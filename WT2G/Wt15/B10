&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Writers have so confounded society with government as to leave little or no distinction between them." So wrote Thomas Paine in "Common Sense" in 1776. He could be writing today about those who look to government to solve all of America's problems.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	 The House GOP freshmen reject this view. We know that government is only a part of society. Society is not a part of government. Government serves as only a portion of the entire society, and is not the entire society.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Think of society as a chair. The legs of the chair represent four different and separate institutions. Government is just one leg; the others are families and the institutions that support them, religious and civic institutions, and business.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A stable chair frees you to sit, relax, eat, whatever you want to do, without worrying about falling on the floor. Similarly, the four institutions of society contribute equally to its stability. A child born into a society where all four institutions are healthy has the greatest opportunity for success in life. Consider the child's relationship to these four institutions: When family institutions are healthy, a child is more likely to learn respect for his parents. When government institutions are healthy, a child is more likely to obey the law. In healthy businesses, a child is more likely to learn the work ethic. In healthy religious institutions, a child is more likely to maintain a clear conscience before his or her God. With healthy and equal institutions, we can provide to every individual the freedom and security to pursue the promised opportunity for life, liberty, and happiness.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	During the past 100 years, America's government has become disproportionately large in relation to the country's other institutions. The result has been a burdensome governmental structure involved in virtually every aspect of our lives. The fundamental principles of the New Deal and Great Society programs -- the solving of social ills with governmental programs -- has resulted in a chair so unstable that a single finger can tip it over. Of all the money spent by government, 70 percent is controlled at the federal level, while 30 percent is controlled at the state and local levels. The 537 elected officials in Washington have substituted their "wisdom" for the wisdom of the thousands of local elected officials in our communities. The growth of the governmental leg has drawn too much away from the other core institutions, reducing their effectiveness and creating instability in America.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Our families have been decimated over the last 30 years by divorce, teen pregnancy, drug abuse, juvenile crime, and failing educational institutions. Religious and civic institutions are not functioning to their full potential. In his article "Bowling Alone" for the <i>Journal of Democracy</i>, Harvard professor Robert Putnam documented the significant decline in "social capital" and in participation in the civic associations of "civil society." In the political arena, declining voter participation and the community's feelings of disempowerment are symptoms of the deterioration of these institutions. In the business realm, our current fascination with "downsizing," layoffs, and superheated stock markets is a result of unstable institutions. The political community is particularly concerned about job insecurity, which has probably exacerbated the decline of business as well as religious and civic institutions.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	These concerns, I believe, prompted Americans to send a Republican-led Congress to Washington in November 1994. Our new Republican majority went about aggressively downsizing government. We acted on the promises of the Contract With America, like blockgranting programs to the 50 states. We set about reforming or eliminating the myriad federal welfare, job-training, and housing programs. We focused on deregulation and tax reform, trying to encourage the marketplace to shed government control. We even considered eliminating the Departments of Education, Commerce, Energy, and Housing and Urban Development.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Unfortunately, House Republicans failed to communicate a vision of America that included its other core institutions. We did not give enough thought to how families would react to the withdrawal of government from their lives. We did not articulate the need to re-create religious and civic institutions, or to develop self-regulation in the business realm. In short, we only looked at the institution we could influence directly: government. Until we can explain to the American people how we can rebuild the institutions of community while reducing government, then maybe we shouldn't be reducing government at all.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Through its disapproval of the government shutdowns in 1995 and 1996, the American people have told us, "We agree with downsizing government, but we're not going to let you do it unless you can show us how America will be a better place for everybody as a result." Thus the task we freshmen have set ourselves is to articulate our vision of the "New America."<p>	<b>The Legislative Program</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Freshman Class Vision articulates two essential elements (see <a href="#box">box</a>). One element is legislative reform, and the other is a higher level of personal responsibility in society. Both must happen simultaneously. The legislative program continues to be our priority in Washington. We must downsize, restructure, and reform government while we begin to rebuild the other core institutions. Four examples will give some idea of how this might happen:<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Social programs.</b> During the 30 or so years of government expansion into welfare, food stamps, and Medicaid, dependency upon government has increased and the ranks of the needy have expanded. Many people believe that the values reflected in social programs and in helping with the care of the needy have a basis in Scripture, not in the Constitution. The Good Samaritan, after all, is found in the Bible. The New America vision calls for the care of the poor to shift from government to religious and civic institutions and the family, where it had historically resided prior to the development of the welfare state.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Churches and faith-based organizations, nonprofit social-service agencies, and charities should have a prime role in providing for those in need. But if we are to begin to rely on nongovernmental institutions, then we must create legislation that encourages this transfer. How can we structure tax policy, for example, to provide a smooth transition from government programs to the religious, civic, and family institutions of this country?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In my opinion, we should encourage religious and civic institutions to take up social programs by giving healthy tax deductions to those contributing money to churches, charities, and other nonprofit groups. Under this policy, institutions caring for the needy expand, while the revenue propping up the government sector shrinks.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Regulation and tax relief.</b> As we reduce taxes and regulation of business, we reduce the overhead of a regulatory government. At the same time, the market will redirect resources currently consumed by taxes and regulatory compliance toward business expansion.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Education.</b> Properly handled, reforms in education would help restore the institution of the family. The educational system, a governmental structure, must be accountable to parents, not the state. This can be achieved in part through voucher programs. My personal preference is to increase local control, and therefore encourage parental participation. The most telling problem with education, at least in local school districts, is that local elected officials have very little discretion over school spending; most is determined by state and federal mandates. If we send more dollars unencumbered to the local level, we will encourage more parents to get involved in their children's education. This will encourage parents -- and their children -- to assume personal responsibility for educational decisions.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Localizing.</b> Localizing government, as with education, means shifting responsibilities back to the state and local levels. When we localize decisionmaking, we reduce the overhead of the federal government, thereby reducing its role.<p><b>Personal Responsibility</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	By downsizing government and reinvigorating other institutions to fulfill their proper roles, we have begun to address our obligations as the freshmen elected in 1994. We have taken a necessary, though not sufficient, first step toward a New America.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Still, something is missing. The nongovernmental institutions are not functioning to their full capacity. By encouraging local control and involvement, we may have begun to address issues like juvenile crime and school accountability. Our problems, however, demand another, essential element: personal responsibility.


<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Congress cannot raise the conscience of the American people, decrease our reliance on governmental institutions, and encourage the development of individual and community-based solutions to community problems. Personal responsibility cannot be legislated in Washington. We can't create good parents by passing a law. We can't make everybody go to church or other religious institutions or be ethical in business. There are some things that even Great Society advocates would agree government simply cannot do. Encouraging and creating personal responsibility is ultimately the task of the nation's religious institutions. It must happen in concert with downsizing government, and won't happen without it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Family institutions.</b> For members of a family, taking personal responsibility means meeting obligations, participating in family activities, and raising children well.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Business institutions.</b> Encouraging personal responsibility in business institutions would accomplish at least two things. One result would be fewer lawsuits; another would be the development of peer review, such as doctors policing doctors, lawyers policing lawyers, and like businesses policing one another. Peer review would achieve a more cost-effective regulatory scheme than government, with better results.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Governmental institutions.</b> We need to spread responsibility among the tens of thousands of state and local elected officials across the country. By raising the conscience of the American people, we can eventually change the distribution of government resources from 70 percent controlled at the federal level to 70 percent controlled at the state and local levels.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The central challenge is to downsize government in a responsible fashion that rebuilds the other core institutions in this country until they all achieve a final equality and balance. It is a huge job. It is one my colleagues and I face every day, and it will require the ongoing support of the American people. But it is a task we must accomplish to restore the stability of the American Dream and to provide freedom and security for all.

<h3>Blueprint To Renew Society</h3><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In order to provide greater freedom and security, the 74 members of the Republican Freshman Class stand for structural reform in America.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We believe that government is too big in relation to other institutions in America.  We believe that reducing government should not, and cannot, occur without renewal of family, religious/ civic, and business institutions in American society.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A balanced budget that privatizes, localizes, and eliminates federal government activities is the blueprint to renew society.  To renew society, however, the conscience of the American people must be raised, increasing personal responsibility and hence the effectiveness of all of our institutions.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Our vision is one in which family, religious/civic, business, and government institutions contribute equally to the foundation of a New America.

<h3>Where Do The Presidential Candidates Stand on Term Limits??
</h3></center>
<p>
<p>
ABIC has pulled together information from many sources, including press clippings, candidate questionnaires and candidate statements to put together a picture of where each presidential candidate stands on this important reform issue.  We've gathered what information we could about some of the key presidential candidates--if you have more information that can be substantiated, please let us know!
<p>
<b>The candidates:</b>
<p>
<center><h3>Bill Clinton (Democrat)</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Position on Term Limits</b>: Opposes
<p>
<i>What is he saying about term limits?
</i><p>
"No.  I share with supporters of congressional term limits their goal to reform our political system and renew our democracy.  I do not, however, believe that term limits are the appropriate means to achieve this desirable end."
<h6><p align="right">--USAToday (10/15/96), Answer to Candidate Questionnaire<br>
(Question: Do you support congressional term limits?)</p>
</h6><p>
"I've had my own reservations about term limits because I didn't necessarily think that -- as a national thing -- because I didn't necessarily think that voters in one state ought to tell voters in another how long they ought to b able to vote for the people of their choice."
<h6><p align="right">--telephone interview with the Denver Post (5/30/95)
</p></h6><p>
"I know they're popular, but I'm against them."
<h6><p align="right">--Presidential Debate in Richmond, Virginia (10/15/92)
</p></h6><p>
<i>What has he done?</i>
<p>
In 1992, the same year he was elected president, the voters of Bill Clinton's home state of Arkansas passed term limits for their own congressional delegation.  When the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of this law reached the U.S. Supreme Court at the end of 1994, President Clinton had his Solicitor General argue against the law before the High Court and against the voters of his own home state.  Ultimately the Court agreed with the President and overturned Arkansas' term limits law.
<p>
Since then, while Congress has attempted to pass a term limits constitutional amendment through both the House and Senate, the President stood by while members of his own party fought against the amendment in both chambers.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<center><h3>Bob Dole (Republican)</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Position on Term Limits:</b> Supports
<p>
<i>What is he saying about term limits?
</i><p>
 "As president, I will push for an amendment to the Constitution that establishes a two-term limit for senators and a six-term limit for House members. I will continue to press for legislation that limits the power of special interest groups and makes representatives more accountable to their constituents. These decisive steps will further enhance the confidence of the electorate in Congress, and the laws it developed, as we enter the 21st century."
<h6><p align="right">--USAToday (10/15/96), Answer to Candidate Questionnaire<br>
(Question: Do you support congressional term limits?)</p>
</h6><p>
<i>What has he done?
</i><p>
In the early days of this Congress, then-Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole promised that the Senate would have a vote on the term limits constitutional amendment.  In April of this year, he kept his promise and brought the amendment to the floor of the Senate for a vote.  Unfortunately, the Democrats filibustered, preventing the Senate from ever having a vote on the actual amendment.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<center><h3>Ross Perot (Reform Party)</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Position on Term Limits:</b> Supports
<p>
<i>What is he saying about term limits?
</i><p>
"Yes. Our elected leaders must realize that serving the American people is a privilege, not a career. Seventy-four percent of the American people support term limits. It is time we passed a constitutional amendment limiting congressional terms."

<blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For nearly 40 years, my grandma taught poor immigrant first-graders in Brooklyn to read. She also taught remedial reading to teenagers who had somehow never mastered the written word. She was a marvelous teacher who combined patience, affection, and phonics, which she always said was the best way to learn. And at her funeral, many of her former pupils showed up to honor her memory.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Your grandmother gave me a gift I will never forget," one of them told me. "When she taught me to read, she changed my life. She opened doors that had slammed shut on me. She made it possible for me to succeed." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I thought of my grandmother when I heard President Clinton's stirring call for a national literacy campaign at the Democratic convention in August. "Let us set a clear national goal," Clinton said. "All children should be able to read on their own by the third grade." Yes, I thought, the president is right on target: Literacy is the key to all other learning. Unless he can read, a child is doomed. And Grandma would have applauded Clinton's infectious, can-do spirit. She always insisted that <i>every</i> child could be taught to read.

</table>
<br><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Grandma also would applaud the precise, measurable standard the president set for his campaign. This is not some slippery, Goals 2000-type call to raise self-esteem or ensure children enter school "ready to learn." This is a real test measuring essential knowledge, the kind of test that good teachers prize. Either a child can read or he can't, in which case some other way to teach him must be found. And it's a badly needed test because, as President Clinton reminded us, 40 percent of eight-year-olds have serious reading difficulties.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The president's literacy proposal is attractive for other reasons. It calls not for a new bureaucratic program but rather a volunteer army of 1 million reading tutors. This is consistent with Clinton's appreciation of civil society and the American tradition of citizens stepping forward to solve the problems of their communities. So far so good. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But wait a minute: Where's the accountability for teachers? Just what are they supposed to be doing, if not teaching our children to read? If 40 percent of eight-year-olds have trouble reading, what's wrong with our public schools? Shouldn't we hire better teachers who can teach reading the way Grandma did? And why aren't problem readers helped by the $30 billion-plus we spend each year on special education?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The literacy proposal is typical of Clinton at his best and at his worst. He has a brilliant knack for focusing the nation's attention like a laser beam on a profound problem. He laces his solutions with culturally conservative notions such as rigorous testing and volunteerism rather than bureaucracy. But he totally ignores the need to reform existing institutions that are already expected to address the problem; in this case, he absolves the schools of their failure to teach. <i>President Clinton uses the language of personal responsibility to promote and perpetuate government irresponsibility.</i> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Clinton has defined himself as a cultural conservative. There are a few issues where he is on the cultural left: abortion, where he defends even a grisly procedure bordering on infanticide, and civil rights, where he defends racial preferences that violate the principle of equality before the law. On gay rights, he sends mixed signals. But on most social issues, Clinton is the most culturally conservative Democratic presidential nominee since Hubert Humphrey, perhaps even since Harry Truman. Consider the Clinton record:

<ul><li>	He has issued guidelines calling for more teaching about religion in public schools; during his presidency, National Public Radio and PBS have finally begun treating religion with respect. <li>	He has promoted the V-chip for TV sets to give parents more control over what their children watch.<li>	Over the objections of the American Civil Liberties Union, he has signed "Megan's Law"-style legislation to keep parents informed of convicted sex offenders living in their neighborhoods.<li>	He has endorsed youth curfews and school uniforms -- seemingly small measures, but a significant rebuke to "children's-rights" activists within the Democratic party who oppose any restrictions on the freedom of minors.<li>	He has said Dan Quayle was right about the irreplaceable benefits of the two-parent family.<li>	He and the First Lady have spoken out frequently about the importance of adoption, and, over the objections of the National Association of Black Social Workers, the president signed GOP legislation overturning barriers to transracial adoption.<li>	He has embraced the principles of the Founding in defining what it means to be an American: "If you believe in the values of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, if you are willing to work hard and play by the rules, you are part of our family."<li>	He has signed legislation protecting states from being forced to recognize homosexual marriages.<li>	He says that the three central principles of the Democratic Party in this election are "opportunity," "responsibility," and "community."<li>	Most prominently, despite the opposition of his party's left wing, the president signed the Republican welfare-reform legislation abolishing Aid to Families with Dependent Children as an entitlement and sending a clear signal that society expects able-bodied welfare recipients to work.</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	These moves to the center cannot be brushed off simply as election-year posturing or Dick Morris's triangulation strategy. Many of the president's cultural proposals reflect the work of William Galston, Elaine Kamarck, and other New Democrats associated with the communitarian movement and the <a href="http://www.dlcppi.org">Progressive Policy Institute</a>. And Clinton targets cultural conservatism not just to swing voters but to the traditional base of the Democratic party. For instance, in 1993 at the Tennessee church where Martin Luther King Jr. gave his final sermon, Clinton imagined what Dr. King might say today:<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"He would say, 'I did not live and die to see the American family destroyed.' 'I fought for freedom,' he would say, 'but not for the freedom of people to kill each other with reckless abandon; not for the freedom of children to have children and the fathers of the children to walk away from them and abandon them as if they don't amount to anything. . . . This is not what I lived and died for.' "<p><b>Co-Conspirator in Evasion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Clinton, in short, is guiding Democrats to a greater appreciation of family and religion and community. But he still promotes government's massive flight from responsibility. For the past 30 years, American mayors and governors have sought to deflect responsibility for failing schools, rising crime rates, and welfare dependency. "Don't blame us," the mayors and governors have said, "blame the federal government, which hasn't given us enough money." President Clinton is a co-conspirator in this strategy of evasion. He may say that "the era of Big Government is over," but he is expanding federal responsibility in a way that diffuses the accountability of public officials.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Consider the president's much-trumpeted funding of "100,000 new police officers" for America's communities. In truth, Clinton's crime initiative has funded 20,000 new cops, a 3 percent addition to existing police forces. But the president has given America's mayors something more important than the few new officers in each city. Now the federal government shares responsibility for police protection. Cities can now cut their own funding of law enforcement with the expectation that the feds will make up the difference. Even better, the mayors can now blame Newt Gingrich and "GOP budget-cutting" for the failures of their own police departments.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Senator Dole has contributed to this irresponsibility, too. He has campaigned as if local law enforcement were the president's job. The real issue should not be whether Bill Clinton or Bob Dole is tougher on crime. The real issue is why city governments, run mostly by liberal Democrats, can't protect their citizens. If Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and police chief William Bratton can cut crime by 35 percent in New York City, why can't Mayors Marion Barry and Ed Rendell do the same in Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia? If California can cut crime by 9 percent in one year with a "three strikes and you're out" law, why can't other states? Americans ought to be asking themselves these questions, but with Dole's help, Clinton has muddied these comparisons by claiming a central role for the federal government.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Perhaps no Clinton initiative promotes government irresponsibility more than his favorite, AmeriCorps. Modeled on the military, AmeriCorps has many culturally conservative attributes. It is dedicated to service, volunteerism, and duty to country. AmeriCorps sends its members to many fine organizations that foster personal responsibility. One such group, <a href="http://www.habitat.org">Habitat for Humanity</a>, promotes home ownership, self-help, and sweat equity as it helps low-income people build their own houses.

<hr width=75><Font FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva" COLOR="blue"><h3>No, Mrs. Clinton, it doesn't take a president to raise a child. If everyone's responsible, no one's responsible.</h3></font>
<hr width=75></td>
</tr></table>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But for all its emphasis on personal responsibility, AmeriCorps aggravates the crisis in government irresponsibility. It is a federal organization parachuting into local communities to solve local problems -- helping a charter school in Oakland, a community-service program in Dallas, a police-cadet program in New York City. Many of these are worthy causes, but AmeriCorps usurps local responsibility. Local governments and private funders have the greatest stake in the success of such programs. They are also in the best position to hold them accountable for how money is spent. But these local institutions are less likely to seek or finance promising solutions if they think AmeriCorps will do it for them.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	AmeriCorps fosters irresponsibility in another way. The federal government now does so many things that it does nothing very well. At a time when government should focus on what it does best and what it alone can do, why is Clinton inflating an already-bloated public sector with volunteer organizations such as Habitat for Humanity that can prosper without government help?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Clinton's diffusion of responsibility is best reflected, of course, in the First Lady's breathtaking statement at the Democratic convention that "it takes a president" to raise a child. No, Mrs. Clinton, moms and dads raise children. Parents can be helped by a village, properly understood: by relatives, teachers, clergy, police, neighbors. But a village defined as a national community can't help them in any meaningful way. Children are in trouble today precisely because moms and dads -- and neighbors and relatives -- are abdicating their responsibility and expecting the president to come to the rescue.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In his convention speech in August, the president defended welfare reform by saying, "Now there's no more 'Who's to blame?' on welfare. Now the only question is 'What to do?,' and we all have a responsibility." Therein lies the essence of Clintonism. Hold everyone responsible, hold no one accountable. When everyone has a responsibility, no one can be blamed when programs fail. And, if we take seriously the history of welfare, fail they will.

<h3>NEW FOREIGN POLICY CREDO: BE PREPARED</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/holmes.htm">Kim Holmes</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
October 24, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The 1996 election campaign has been conspicuously quiet on foreign policy. Both major presidential candidates, catering to a post-Cold War public glad to be rid of the constant nuclear threat from the Soviet Union, have avoided the subject, thinking they were following the prudent political course. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I disagree: Leadership requires more than merely reflecting the momentary concerns of the electorate. It requires not just talking about what people say they are concerned about, but also pointing out what they ought to be concerned about. And they ought to be concerned about foreign policy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 The truth is that the United States is handling foreign policy challenges like Iraq, Bosnia, North Korea and Haiti on an ad hoc basis -- without adequate contingency plans already in place when trouble strikes. What this means is that it is only a matter of time before America is caught unprepared and becomes unnecessarily involved in another war or some other international crisis.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	
In the post-Cold War era, the United States has failed to set clear and meaningful criteria for action, stick to those criteria, and effectively communicate them to friends and enemies alike so other nations can predict how we will respond in a given situation. Without such guidelines, friends are left not knowing whether they can count on us, enemies are encouraged to test the waters to see what they can get away with, and our military is involved in matters best handled by other countries or by international social workers.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The White House should be formulating its plans for dealing with possible foreign policy crises now -- based on a clear understanding of U.S. interests and capabilities to shape events -- not after events start spinning out of control. Here is a "top-10 list," if you will, of worst-case foreign-policy scenarios the White House should be prepared to deal with should they arise, arranged in order from least to most likely: 
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Scenario #10</b> &#160; &#160;Civil war in Russia divides control of Russia's nuclear forces between various political and military factions. Based on false information that the United States is about to intervene militarily, a rogue commander authorizes a nuclear attack on the United States or U.S. forces in Europe. Unlikely, to be sure, but not impossible;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Scenario #9</b>  &#160; &#160;Next year, China decides to turn up the heat on Taiwan by establishing a naval blockade of that island nation or threatening a ballistic missile attack;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Scenario #8</b>  &#160; &#160;Iran tries to close down the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf, bottling up some 20 percent of the world's oil supplies, or helps topple the monarchy in Saudi Arabia;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Scenario #7</b>  &#160; &#160;An Iraqi-backed terrorist group attacks U.S. troops in Kuwait with biological weapons -- anthrax spores, for example -- killing hundreds of American soldiers. However, no one takes credit and no one is sure who did it;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Scenario #6</b>  &#160; &#160;Russia threatens the Baltic states -- Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia -- with military action in response to NATO's decision to include Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary in the alliance;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Scenario #5</b>  &#160; &#160;Boris Yeltsin dies and new Russian elections result in the rise of an unpredictable, anti-Western president like Alexander Lebed.  Or Yeltsin doesn't die, but becomes incapacitated, setting off a dangerous succession struggle in the Kremlin that destabilizes Russia;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Scenario #4</b>  &#160; &#160;Saddam Hussein shoots down a U.S. plane in the newly expanded no-fly zone in Northern Iraq and takes its pilot hostage;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Scenario #3</b>  &#160; &#160;North Korea decides to go down fighting, invades the South, overruns most of the 37,000 U.S. troops along the demilitarized zone, and reduces most of Seoul to rubble;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Scenario #2</b>  &#160; &#160;China decides to crack down on Hong Kong next year after the former British colony reverts to Beijing's rule;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Scenario #1</b> &#160; &#160;U.S. troops stay in Bosnia past the promised December deadline for withdrawal, and dissatisfied groups decide to eject the Americans by force, or radical Moslem terrorists launch attacks on remaining U.S. troops.
</blockquote>	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Does the administration have contingency plans in place should any of the above scenarios arise? To judge from its conduct so far on the world stage, it is highly improbable.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	No administration, Republican or Democrat, should operate in the foreign policy arena without clearly understanding how America's interests would best be served in such crisis scenarios. Unless U.S. policy-makers are prepared to act with determined vision in the post-Cold War world, they place America at risk.

<center><i>Entrepreneurship Matters</i></center>
<P>
Entrepreneurship serves as fuel for the economy.  Entrepreneurs
are the ultimate source of innovation, invention, creativity,
and efficiencies that drive economic growth.
<P>
In turn, vigorous job creation depends upon the health of entrepreneurs
and small businesses.  Indeed, small to mid&#173;size firms (500
employees or less) account for about 70 percent to 80 percent
of new jobs created.
<P>
Given the central role of entrepreneurs and small businesses in
the economy, the impact of public policies on entrepreneurship
looms as a paramount concern.
<P>
Policies that are truly pro&#173;entrepreneur and pro&#173;small&#173;business
enhance incentives for working, investing, and risk taking, and
free up resources from government for private&#173;sector uses.
 These policies are no mystery: lower taxes, elimination of excessive
regulations, and smaller government.
<P>
Quite naturally, presidential leadership on small business issues
is critical.
<P>
<a name="two">
<center><i>The Clinton Plan</i></center>
<P>
President Clinton's economic plan faced an enormous obstacle before
even being formulated, i.e., previous anti&#173;entrepreneur measures
offered by the Clinton Administration.  The President's massive
1993 tax increase hit small businesses hard.  In fact, according
to the congressional Joint Economic Committee, small business
owners were saddled with the brunt of the increase in income tax
rates under the 1993 tax hike.  (See chart on following page.)
<P>
In addition, small businesses would have been devastated by mandates
and higher costs under the President's proposed federal takeover
of the nation's health care system.
<P>
Along with other anti&#173;small&#173;business initiatives (like
the minimum wage increase), the Clinton economic plan faces a
fairly deep hole from which to climb out.
<P>
The following Clinton proposals would directly impact entrepreneurs
and small business:
<ul>
<li>Limited expansion of IRAs for education, retirement and first&#173;time
home buying.  These measures would have a minor favorable impact
on small business by increasing incentives for saving and investment.
 However, the beneficial effects are limited by income caps.<BR>
<P>
<li>Welfare&#173;to&#173;work tax credit for employers hiring
welfare recipients (50 percent tax credit on first $10,000 of
wages and benefits &#173;&#173; available for two years) and an
expansion of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit.  This is a slight
boost for businesses willing and able to hire welfare recipients.
<li>Provide a tax incentive for businesses to undertake hazardous
waste site clean&#173;ups in distressed communities.  Such an
incentive amounts to little when compared with the federal government's
costly, unfair, and litigious policies regarding waste sites under
Superfund.
<li>Expand the number of Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities.
 Empowerment Zones offer rather minor tax breaks for businesses,
while Enterprise Communities merely allow for the distribution
of federal government pork.
<li>A series of tax increases (many rather technical) are proposed
to offset estimated revenue losses from other tax cuts and increased
programs.  These tax hikes include reforming depreciation deductions
to account more accurately for expected future income; restricting
interest deductions for corporations that invest in tax&#173;exempt
bonds; increase in the per&#173;passenger tax for international
flights from $6 to $16; eliminate $3.4 billion in unspecified
corporate &quot;subsidies&quot; (not specific &#173;&#173; good
idea if cutting back on corporate welfare; bad idea if tax increases);
establish a new $225 charge per flight, phased in over 3 years
for commercial and private corporate turbo jets and turbo prop
planes; establish a graduated filing fee structure according to
asset size for firms seeking to merge; eliminate the 70 percent
and 80 percent dividends&#173;received deductions for certain
debt&#173;like stock; impose a fee of $1 per check paid by the
U.S. government to its vendors; and more.
</ul>
The problem with this proposal is that the economy is not receiving
a full net tax cut, but merely replacing one kind of taxation
for another, with no clear benefits for pro&#173;growth economic
incentives.
<P>
<i>Clinton Plan: D&#173;<br></i>
<P>
Comment: The Clinton economic plan offers little hope that  current
tax and regulatory burdens will be eased any time soon.  This
plan fails to relieve any of the misery imposed on small businesses
in the 1993 tax hike.  No regulatory relief is provided.  And
no indications exist that government will be getting any smaller.
 Indeed, the few, minor tax cuts offered are not broad&#173;based
(government once again mistakenly tries to decide how best to
allocate resources) and are offset by other tax increases.  <BR>
<P>
Especially in light of the 1993 tax increase, the near catastrophic
health care plan, and other anti&#173;entrepreneur initiatives
over the past four years, the Clinton economic plan could have
easily warranted a failing grade.  Only minor enhancements in
incentives for savings salvaged a non&#173;failing grade.  Indeed,
considerable grade generosity was used in assigning a D&#173;
to the Clinton plan.<BR>
<P>
In the context of initiatives already advanced by the Clinton
Administration, entrepreneurs and small business generally remain
losers under the Clinton plan.<BR>
<P>
When entrepreneurs and small businesses lose, so does the economy.
 The Clinton Administration's projection of an under&#173;performing
economy &#173;&#173; with a real annual average economic growth
rate of 2.3 percent for the foreseeable future &#173;&#173; is
probably pretty accurate given this economic plan.  Though growth
could certainly wane further.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<a name="three">
<I>The Dole Plan<BR></I>
<P>
A Dole economic plan faced far less anti&#173;entrepreneurial
baggage than the Clinton plan.  Though, Dole's support for both
sizable tax increases (e.g., 1982 and 1990) and tax cuts (e.g.,
1981 and 1986, along with opposition to the 1993 tax hike) created
a more ambiguous environment.<BR>
<P>
The following Dole proposals would directly impact entrepreneurs
and small business:<BR>
<P>
<ul>
<li>A 15 percent across&#173;the&#173;board personal income tax
cut.  An across&#173;the&#173;board cut in personal income taxes
benefits entrepreneurs and business in two primary ways: 1) incentives
for working, investing and risk taking are boosted; and 2) the
bottom line for most enterprises is directly impacted (79 percent
of all business tax returns are filed by non&#173;corporations
&#173;&#173; partnerships and sole proprietorships &#173;&#173;
and this rate jumps to almost almost 89 percent when accounting
for S&#173;Corporations).  <BR>
<dd>The only problems with this measure is that rates are not cut
deep enough (for example, after the Dole tax cut is fully implemented
the top tax rate will rest at 33.7 percent, still above the top
rate of 28 percent under President Reagan), or quickly enough
(phasing in the tax cut over three or four years will only delay
its benefits).<BR>
<li>A 50 percent reduction in the capital gains tax, dropping
the top rate from 28 percent to 14 percent.  No other public policy
step, perhaps barring a complete overhaul of our present tax system,
reaps more rewards for entrepreneurs and the economy than capital
gains tax reduction.  Incentives for investing and risk taking
will rise considerably under a 50 percent cut in the capital gains
tax rate.
<li>A cut in the estate tax by excluding an additional $1 million
of value from an estate for qualified family&#173;owned businesses.
 The estate tax amounts to nothing more than a government hostile
takeover of a business at death.  A cut in the estate tax will
boost incentives for investment and allow many family businesses
to live on and prosper.  The only problem with this proposal is
its somewhat limited scope.
<li>
Expansion of IRAs for retirement and education.  These measures
would have a minor favorable impact on small business by increasing
incentives for saving and investment.
<li>
Repeal the 1993 tax hike on Social Security benefits.  Older
entrepreneurs &#173;&#173; perhaps retired from their original
jobs and trying to launch or expand a business &#173;&#173; will
benefit from a rollback in the 1993 tax increase on Social Security
benefits.
<li>
Regulatory reform including requiring that new regulations
pass muster of cost&#173;benefit analysis, risk assessment, and
independent peer&#173;review; new regulations be re&#173;evaluated
every four years; and a regulatory sunsetting task force review
all federal regulations with an eye toward eliminating the ineffective.
 Regulations have the same impact as do taxes &#173;&#173; raising
the costs of starting up, running, and expanding a business. 
Establishing a regulatory system where regulations must stand
up to more rigorous assessments before being implemented, and
afterwards being subject to regular review and sunsetting, amounts
to a major step in the right direction in regulatory policy.
<li>
Legal system reforms including a limit on punitive damages
in certain cases; abolishing joint and several liability for non&#173;economic
damages in civil cases; and curbing the use of contingency fees.
<BR>
<DD>Our current legal system can inflict considerable and sometimes
irreparable damage on small businesses, entrepreneurs, and our
economy.  Beginning to reform perverse liability schemes and limiting
some damages make for a good start.
<li>
Establish a clear, meaningful home&#173;office tax deduction
for home&#173;based businesses.  Home&#173;based businesses are
rapidly expanding as our economy decentralizes.  These home&#173;based
entrepreneurs need to operate under a clear set of tax rules,
and stop being eyed with suspicion by the IRS.
<li>
Reform independent contractor rules.  The question of who
is or is not classified by the IRS as an independent contractor
has long plagued small businesses and the self&#173;employed.
Clarity and simplicity are surely needed.
<li>
Boost the tax deduction for health insurance costs for the
self&#173;employed to 100 percent.  The self&#173;employed deserve
the same health insurance deduction as is provided for employer&#173;provided
health plans.
<li>
Sets out a long&#173;term goal of overhauling our current
tax code in favor of a fairer, flatter, simpler tax system.  Replacing
our current tax code makes sense.  The current code is riddled
with problems: tax rates are too high; capital taxed too heavily;
it's complicated and unclear; incentives for tax avoidance abound;
it's intrusive and bureaucratic; and it is set up to easily feed
government growth.
</ul>
<P>
The Dole plan deserves credit for noting the need to overhaul
the tax system, but disappoints in that it lacks a clear alternative
with a timetable.<BR>
<P>
<center><i>Dole Plan: B+</i></center>
<P>
Comment: The Dole economic plan amounts to an excellent start
at reducing the governmental burdens imposed on small businesses
and entrepreneurs.  Tax cuts, regulatory reform, and legal reforms
are all desperately needed. <BR>
<P>
While grading on the Clinton plan was generous, a grade of B+
for the Dole plan is a far tougher grade.  The Dole plan fell
short of a grade of A due to what it lacked.  Much more can be
done to spur entrepreneurship, like eliminating capital gains
and estate taxes, instituting deeper cuts in tax rates, and proposing
tougher regulatory standards (e.g., requiring Congress and the
president to sign off on all rules and regulations).  And as already
noted, a complete overhaul of our current tax code  is needed
rather quickly.
<P>
On whole, however, entrepreneurs and small businesses would be
winners under the Dole economic plan.
<P>
Naturally, in turn, the economy should grow at a faster pace.
 Current Administration assumptions place the average annual real
rate of economic growth at 2.3 percent into the foreseeable future.
 Such rates would grossly under&#173;perform the post&#173;Civil
War average rate of 3.5 percent.  The Dole camp projects that
real economic growth rates will average about 2.8 percent over
the next six years.  That is, the Dole changes will be worth about
0.5 percentage points in growth each year versus current projections.
 A new report by Gary and Aldona Robbins for the Institute for
Policy Innovation estimates an average annual percentage point
boost to real growth over the next six years of 0.55.
<P>
Given the economy's long&#173;term growth trend, these certainly
are not wild&#173;eyed projections.  In fact, they are conservative
as they only attempt to quantify and estimate the growth effects
of the tax cuts and do not take into account the impact of regulatory
and legal reforms, for example.
<P>

<center><i>The Ideal: An A+ Economic Plan</i></center>
<P>
The following is offered as a model framework for an economic
plan that will boost investment, entrepreneurship, and economic
growth.<BR>
<P>
<ul>
<li>In the short run, cut income taxes across the board, and eliminate
the anti&#173;entrepreneur capital gains and estate taxes.
<li>In the longer run, replace our current messy, counter&#173;productive
tax system with a low&#173;rate, simple, consumption&#173;based
tax.  A low flat&#173;rate income tax or a low&#173;rate (i.e.,
less than 10 percent) national retail sales tax make sense.  
<li>A massive deregulation effort must be implemented.  This means
not only rolling back current onerous regulations, but establishing
a system that helps to prevent the imposition and continuation
of costly regulations, including congressional approval of all
rules and regulations, sunsetting regulations, and using sound
science&#173;based risk assessment and cost&#173;benefit analysis
when evaluating possible new or renewal of current regulations.
<li>Dramatic reductions in the size of government &#173;&#173;
federal, state, and local &#173;&#173; must occur.  Privatization,
competitive contracting, and cutbacks in and elimination of wasteful
programs must be implemented in order to cut government spending
and free up resources for more productive private&#173;sector
uses.
</ul>
<P>
Also, free trade and sound money are needed as foundations upon
which risk taking and the economy can flourish.  Indeed, this
pro&#173;entrepreneur agenda would more than likely place the
U.S. economy on a track above its post&#173;Civil War real average
growth rate.
<P>
As noted earlier, no mystery needs to be solved.  The policies
that benefit entrepreneurs, small business, and the economy are
clear: low taxes, elimination of excessive regulations, and small
government.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress is considering how to help state and local officials combat violent teenage crime. In the House of Representatives, the most prominent proposal is the Violent Youth Predator Act of 1996 (H.R. 3565), sponsored by Representative Bill McCollum (R-FL), Chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime. The McCollum bill would change the federal criminal justice system by mandating that juveniles who commit two types of federal crime -- serious violent crimes or major drug trafficking offenses -- will be tried as adults in federal courts; it also would impose mandatory minimum sentences on juveniles who use firearms in the commission of a federal crime. In the Senate, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Act of 1996 (S. 1854), sponsored originally by Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and former Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS), would make similar improvements in federal law.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Both the Hatch and McCollum bills would give states financial assistance to help them combat juvenile crime. The McCollum bill would replace the Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) with a new Office of Juvenile Crime Control. In addition to serving as a clearinghouse for information disseminated to state officials, this office would make $500 million available to the states: $250 million in the form of "incentive grants" to help the states adopt needed reforms -- for example, tougher sanctions on juvenile criminals, mandatory restitution, and greater public availability of juvenile delinquency records -- and another $250 million in the form of block grants for the states to use as they think best in combating and preventing juvenile crime.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>State and Local Responsibility.</b> While Congress can assist local officials with block grants, however, taxpayers know that violent juvenile crime, like street crime in general, is primarily a state and local responsibility. And while the capacity of all government officials to cope with the broader cultural and social changes that appear to be driving increased juvenile criminal behavior is limited, state and local officials still can take decisive steps to curb violent juvenile crime.<sup>2</sup>  They can do this by using their police forces more effectively and by integrating innovative community police work with the efforts of community leaders and other agencies in the criminal justice system. This is happening already in such localities as New York City and Charleston, South Carolina. The McCollum bill would help the states by removing the federal mandates that prevent them from adopting many innovative solutions and by providing funds for effective new programs, including the Serious Habitual Offenders Comprehensive Action Program (SHOCAP).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

SHOCAP is one of the most effective ways to attack the juvenile crime explosion. With sophisticated information technology, local officials can develop and share crime analysis and case management files on the most serious violent offenders in the community: serious habitual offenders. This pioneering effort to combine police work with emerging information technology, developed by a team of experts in the Justice Department during the Reagan Administration, combines the modern microelectronic revolution, sophisticated data collection and crime analysis, and community police work. Through computer analysis and effective local policing, it enables state and local law enforcement officials to identify, target, arrest, and incarcerate violent teenage criminals.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In order to institute SHOCAP, state and local officials should:
<p><ul>
<li> Establish an interagency council chaired by the chief of police and comprised of the CEOs of SHOCAP component agencies -- juvenile probation departments, prosecutors, juvenile judges, schools, social services, and public housing.
<p>
<li> Create or enhance crime analysis units within local police departments.
<p>
<li> Enlist the cooperation of state and local agencies in collecting and analyzing data, updating the case files of serious habitual offenders (SHOs), and establishing a strategy for dealing with this class of offenders.
<p>
<li> Identify serious habitual offenders. Approximately 6 percent of all juvenile offenders are responsible for up to 63 percent of violent juvenile crime.<sup>3</sup>  The procedure used to identify and classify these offenders should be rigorous; it should include, for example, an examination of previous offenses, arrest and court records, and social and family histories. Responsible officials then should use the information developed through this process to create sophisticated, computerized case management files.
<p>
<li> Share these case management files with police officials, judges, prosecutors, state probation and parole agencies, and (as needed) schools and social service agencies.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition, states should reform the juvenile justice system by enacting laws to try violent juvenile criminals as adults when necessary, and by passing truth-in-sentencing laws that apply to violent juvenile offenders tried as adults.
<p>

<b>THE NEW FACE OF JUVENILE CRIME</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Violent teenage criminals are increasingly vicious. John DiIulio, Professor of Politics and Public Affairs at Princeton University, says that "[t]he difference between the juvenile criminals of the 1950s and those of the 1970s and early 1980s was the difference between the Sharks and the Jets of <i>West Side Story</i> and the Bloods and the Crips. It is not inconceivable that the demographic surge of the next ten years will bring with it young criminals who make the Bloods and the Crips look tame."<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to the Council on Crime in America, a bipartisan commission chaired by former Attorney General Griffin Bell and former White House Drug Policy Director <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William J. Bennett</a>, crimes committed by males ages 14 to 17 will increase by 23 percent between 1995 and 2005. Because of the deterioration of family life, and also because of their easy access to guns, these juveniles are likely to commit more vicious crimes than their predecessors, targeting strangers as well as known enemies.<sup>5</sup>  Louis Freeh, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, believes that continuation of current trends in juvenile crime "portends future crime and violence at nearly unprecedented levels."<sup>6</sup>  Recent reports of juvenile crime dropping are of little comfort in light of the coming demographic surge of juveniles in their crime-prone years from dysfunctional families.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Growing numbers of young people, often from broken homes or so-called dysfunctional families, are committing murder, rape, robbery, kidnapping, and other violent acts. As John DiIulio and others argue, these emotionally damaged young people, growing up without faith, fathers, or families, often are the products of sexual or physical abuse. They live in an aimless and violent present; have no sense of the past and no hope for the future; and act, often ruthlessly, to gratify whatever urges or desires drive them at the moment. They commit unspeakably brutal crimes against other people, and their lack of remorse is shocking. They are what Professor DiIulio and others call urban "superpredators."  They are the ultimate urban nightmare, and their numbers are growing. The number of juveniles arrested for violent crimes has increased nearly 60 percent over the last ten years:<sup>8</sup>
<p>
<ul>
<li>From 1985 to 1993, the number of murder cases involving 15-year-old juveniles increased 207 percent. Arrests of 18-year-old to 20-year-old males for murder over the same period increased 119 percent.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
<li>From 1988 to 1992, the number of juveniles involved in aggravated assaults increased 80 percent to 77,900; the number involved in robberies went up 52 percent to 32,900; and the number involved in rapes rose 27 percent to 5,400. Overall, juvenile court cases increased 26 percent.<sup>10</sup>  If trends of the past ten years continue, arrests of juveniles for violent crimes will double by the year 2010.<sup>11</sup>
<p>
<li>From 1989 to 1993, transfers of juveniles to adult court because of delinquency increased 41 percent to 11,800 cases; for crimes against persons, the number of transfers increased 115 percent to 5,000 cases.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
<li>Of 1,471,200 juvenile court cases in 1992, personal offenses were up 56 percent to 301,000; property offenses were up 56 percent to 842,000; and public order offenses were up 21 percent to 255,900.<sup>13</sup>
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Young Victims.</b> Young people ages 12 to 17 are the most frequent victims of violent crime. They are raped, robbed, or assaulted at five times the rate of adults 35 years old or older. In 1992, one juvenile in 13 was the victim of violent crime -- up 23 percent from 1987.<sup>14</sup>  Also in 1992, 23 percent of the victims of the 6.6 million violent crimes committed in the United States were juveniles; the juvenile victimization rate was 74.2 cases per 1,000 juveniles, compared to 13.9 cases per 1,000 adults 35 years old or older.<sup>15</sup>  Overall, the sad fact is that
<p>
<blockquote>
	Crime has seriously affected teenagers' lives, especially those who live in neighborhoods seriously hurt by crime, drugs and gangs. The effects are insidious and long-standing. Teenagers protect themselves by carrying weapons, skipping school, changing their routes to and from classes, changing friends or letting their grades slip. For many young Americans, the carefree days of adolescence are a nostalgic fantasy.<sup>16</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Even more shocking than the sheer volume of violent juvenile crime is the brutality of the crime committed for trivial motives: a pair of sneakers, a jacket, a real or imagined insult, a momentary cheap thrill. For example:
<p>
<ul>
<li> A 59-year-old man out on a morning stroll in Lake Tahoe was fatally shot four times by teenagers "looking for someone to scare."  The police say the four teenagers -- just 15 and 16 years old -- were "thrill shooting."
<p>
<li> A 12-year-old and two other youths were charged with kidnapping a 57-year-old man and taking a joy ride in his Toyota. As the man pleaded for his life, the juveniles shot him to death.
<p>
<li> A 14-year-old boy was murdered while trying to reclaim a $2,500 stereo system he had received from his grandfather. Five juveniles, ranging in age from 15 through 17 years, were charged with the crime.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Seasoned big-city homicide detectives have a hard time coming to grips with the horror of these kinds of cases: The crimes are senseless, the motives banal, and the perpetrators all so young. These shocking incidents -- which occur in America's suburbs as well as its inner cities -- are creating a growing consensus among the American people: They have had enough. Lenient sentencing based strictly on age is no longer acceptable for crimes of this magnitude.<sup>17</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Loss of Public Confidence.</b> Polls show that Americans are unhappy with the system as it is: 49 percent believe rehabilitation programs for juveniles are not successful, 52 percent believe the punishments juveniles receive should be the same as those given adults, and 83 percent think juveniles who commit two or more crimes should receive the same sentencing as adults.<sup>18</sup>  A 1995 Gallup poll found that 72 percent of Americans also advocate the death penalty for juveniles who commit murder, as opposed to 24 percent in 1957.<sup>19</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Teenagers themselves take a hard stance on how their peers should be treated if they commit violent crimes. Over 93 percent believe that those accused of murder or rape should be tried as adults. Moreover, they do not believe these offenders should receive special consideration because of their age.<sup>20</sup>  This is consistent with broad public, judicial, and law enforcement sentiment, which generally has favored holding juveniles more accountable for their criminal actions in recent years.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The juvenile justice system that prevails in many states today does juvenile criminals no favors by being lenient. According to a 1985 Rand Corporation study, "[w]aiting for chronic offenders to build a record of many arrests and minor dispositions only compounds the problems that must be dealt with later."<sup>21</sup>
<p>
<b>WHY TODAY'S JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS FAILING</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since 1899, when Illinois adopted the first Juvenile Court Act, America's juvenile courts have been unable to deal effectively with the violent juvenile criminal. Law enforcement officers and a growing number of private citizens realize that this continuing failure undermines the credibility of the whole juvenile justice system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The ultimate price for this failure, of course, is paid by innocent citizens. For example, only hours after returning home from a special school program in Costa Rica, Cindy Del Carmen Villalba, an honor student at Rutgers University, was killed in a botched robbery attempt. Corie Miller, age 17, and two accomplices were charged in her death. Miller had been eluding police for about a week when the slaying occurred. He had fled a Paterson, New Jersey, "get-tough" rehabilitation program that was supposed to be a "last ditch effort to reform him."  In the case of this habitual juvenile offender, it took the murder of a young, intelligent girl with a bright future to force the justice system to take a second look and finally adopt a tougher stance.<sup>22</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Failure to Target Serious Habitual Offenders.</b> In many states, the greatest single weakness of the effort to combat juvenile crime is a simple failure to target the most dangerous young offenders. This weakness arises from a reluctance on the part of juvenile justice officials to admit that there is a point at which a delinquent youth becomes such a threat to the community that he or she must be held accountable and incarcerated. Under the current system, the seriously violent juvenile can become invisible by being mixed in with the general population of non-violent and non-habitual juvenile offenders. Overwhelmingly, most urban young people who get arrested for a crime get arrested only once; seldom are they a serious or long-term threat to the safety of other citizens. Put another way, not all juvenile delinquents are alike, and very few are serious habitual offenders. The official failure to discriminate between minor offenders and hard-core criminal youth undermines the effectiveness of the entire system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The most active juvenile delinquents also are the most dangerous. Often invisible to the officials who preside over the system, they are painfully visible to the victims they assault, rob, and kill. Official failure to develop credible control measures to suppress habitual juvenile offenders also sows the seeds of racial prejudice. With the rise of juvenile crime, an increasingly angry and insecure public tends to look upon all juveniles, particularly black male teenagers, as threats to the community. Most juvenile offenders, however, are not: 58 percent of young black males never have any contact with the police; and of the other 42 percent, an overwhelming majority do not go on to become SHOs.<sup>23</sup>  It is therefore vital that state and local officials, as well as taxpayers, begin to think and act differently toward the occasional juvenile delinquent. The SHO, on the other hand, is a career criminal in the making.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Information Gap.</b> Chronic offenders usually can be identified solely on the basis of their juvenile records. This evidence, however, normally does not accumulate until after the youth's 16th birthday. If additional factors describing the youth's school performance and home situation are included, the age at which youthful chronic offenders can be identified and an intervention mounted may be moved up several years.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In reality, these young criminals are shunted in and out of state and local agencies by bureaucrats who are supposed to be running the system but who often seem to lack a collective awareness of the kind of young people they are processing. Too often, they are oblivious to the repeated and increasingly serious nature of the behavior of these young criminals. This official failure to share information can occur for many reasons: because it is not required by state law, because of bureaucratic inertia or lack of imagination, or even because of simple negligence. It is a key weakness in the current system. Most of the juvenile codes in the United States contain statutory language indicating that the juvenile judge should consider police reports; field interview reports; citations; social history information (such as data on school, family, and work); drug involvement information; motor vehicle operation information; associates' history; offense digests; victim accounts; and other relevant information, including medical and juvenile victimization data. Only rarely, however, is this information used or shared among youth service agencies; it often is not even made available to the presiding judge.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Declining Police Morale.</b> The continuing failure of the juvenile justice system in many states contributes to defeatism and low morale among local police. Police officers frequently do not treat juvenile crime the same as they treat crime committed by adults. Since no one else in the criminal justice system seems to be serious about punishing juvenile criminals, police officers often feel they will be wasting their time if they pursue these cases with the same zeal they display in pursuing adult criminals. They have learned from painful and frustrating personal experience that spending street time trying to suppress juvenile crime by arrests is futile; nothing will be done to the young criminals, who will just be allowed back out on the streets.<sup>24</sup>  As a result, many patrol officers shift juvenile crime problems to the local department's juvenile unit, transferring both the problem and the responsibility to a specialized unit that already is overloaded.
<p>
<b>WHY STATES AND LOCALITIES SHOULD ADOPT SHOCAP</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The SHOCAP system has been employed successfully in over 150 communities in the United States and Canada, including Oxnard, California; Colorado Springs, Colorado; Tallahassee, Florida; Prince William County, Virginia; and Tampa, Florida (Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office). SHOCAP works in these communities because it provides accurate, documented support to police in tactical operations focused on their most active criminals. SHOCAP enables law enforcement officials to give direction to police in the field so that they can use their patrol activities to prevent and suppress the criminal activities of SHOs. Through computers and information sharing, SHOCAP provides field forces with comprehensive information on a SHO's criminal activities beyond beat or shift boundaries. The system works because a computerized case file -- either on-line in a police cruiser or accessible by police dispatchers -- can be punched up by the police within seconds.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Perhaps the most dramatic example of SHOCAP's effectiveness is Oxnard, California. Despite having one of the lowest police-to-population ratios in the country, over a three-year period in the 1980s, Oxnard experienced a 38 percent reduction in violent crime and a 60 percent drop in the murder rate. It did this by targeting and successfully incarcerating a greater number of SHOs than were targeted and incarcerated in jurisdictions not using SHOCAP. Recognizing that most crime is committed by a small minority of felons, Oxnard officials used SHOCAP to remove 30 of these hard-core juvenile offenders from the streets.<sup>25</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But SHOCAP is more than an effective short-term anti-crime program; it also has longer term preventive effects when employed consistently by local police officials and social service agencies. SHOCAP has received several evaluations in both the United States and Canada. Since 1983, for example, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention has evaluated the program three times. The first evaluation process lasted from May 1, 1983, until July 1, 1986, and served as the basis for later implementation of the program. Additional studies began on January 1, 1985. These evaluations indicated that most project cities which remained in the program exceeded their expectations and reduced crime rates in neighborhoods from which SHOs were removed. The Canadian government's 1993-1994 evaluation of the Calgary SHOCAP program led the Solicitor General of Canada to recommend that SHOCAP be considered by other Canadian jurisdictions.<sup>26</sup>
<p>
<b>HOW TO IDENTIFY SERIOUS HABITUAL OFFENDERS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In every community, there is the potential for only 2 percent of the juvenile offender population to be responsible for up to 60 percent of the violent juvenile crime.<sup>27</sup>  These serious repeat offenders, who all too often eventually become adult career criminals, bleed the life from the community, endangering public safety and undermining economic stability.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In general, only 25 to 35 juveniles in every 100,000 members of the population will engage in criminal activity that matches the Serious Habitual Offender pattern. Based on criteria developed by the Reagan team at the Department of Justice, this means that 0.03 percent to 0.04 percent of all juveniles between 14 and 17 years old will be SHOs. At the same time, for each SHO, four other juveniles are at risk of becoming SHOs themselves.<sup>28</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Profile of a SHO.</b> Data collected and analyzed by the Reagan Administration team at the U.S. Department of Justice in the 1980s presents a graphic portrait of the serious habitual offender. The typical SHO is male, 15 years and six months old. He has been arrested 11 to 14 times, exclusive of status offenses, and five times for felonies. He comes from a dysfunctional family; and in 46 percent of cases, at least one of his parents also has an arrest history. He has received long-term and continuing social services from as many as six different community service agencies, including family, youth, mental health, social services, school, juvenile, or police authorities,<sup>29</sup> and continues to drain these resources for years before he is finally incarcerated as a career criminal.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The typical SHO's family history follows a classic pattern of social pathologies: 53 percent of his siblings also have a history of arrest; and in 59 percent of these cases, there is no father figure in the home. The absence of a father is particularly destructive for boys; only 2 percent of SHOs are female. Furthermore, 68 percent of these offenders have committed crimes of violence, 15 percent have a history of committing sex crimes, and 51 percent have a reported missing or runaway record. If a broken family characterized by physical or sexual abuse is an early indicator of criminal behavior, then virtually all of these serious habitual offenders fit this category. Not surprisingly, these findings are consistent with the Heritage Foundation's widely reported analysis of the true root causes of violent crime, particularly the crimogenic conditions associated with broken or dysfunctional families.<sup>30</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In fact, SHOs do not consider the crimes they have committed to be all that bad.<sup>31</sup>  Forty-five percent are gang members, 64 percent associate with other serious habitual offenders, and 75 percent abuse drugs. School, social, and employment experiences are not good experiences for SHOs,<sup>32</sup> who invariably have no moral compass. The SHO seems to feel that, no matter what he does, the system barely notices. The effect inevitably is to reinforce his criminal inclinations; when released from a state prison, for example, one in 30 of these offenders probably will commit murder.<sup>33</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Recent empirical evidence shows that illegal drug use among the young is on the rise.<sup>34</sup>  It is worth noting, therefore, that a significant majority of all SHOs use or sell illegal drugs and often become addicted themselves. Illegal drug use and alcohol abuse tend to be regular features of their criminal conduct. Drugs, in particular, are part of the criminal scene of these juvenile offenders, and the use and sale of drugs contributes significantly to a SHO's other criminal activity. The need to purchase illegal drugs, combined with the warped hedonism of the addict, shapes and drives much of the criminal activity of this class of criminals.
<p>
<b>HOW LOCAL COMMUNITIES CAN DEAL WITH SERIOUS HABITUAL OFFENDERS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Following a step-by-step process, a community can set up an interagency council to coordinate efforts by the police and other local government and social service agencies to collect and analyze the essential data on SHOs, train police and local government staff in the use of information technology, and establish a strategy for dealing with these offenders that includes referrals to social service agencies for use in a judge's decision to incarcerate.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Serious Habitual Offender Comprehensive Action Program, essentially a comprehensive information and case management process, is directed by the police department's crime analysis unit. Information is collected from and shared with prosecutors, schools, probation officials, judges, correctional departments, and social service and welfare agencies. When community leaders initiate this process, however, they must remember their target: The purpose of SHOCAP is not to curb public nuisances, disorderly conduct among teenagers, or general property crime, but to identify, isolate, and control a very small group of serious habitual juvenile offenders -- only about 35 per 100,000 in the general population. Through SHOCAP, the community can concentrate its law enforcement and criminal justice resources on apprehending and incarcerating these juveniles.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

SHOCAP also can lay the groundwork for appropriate intervention by public or private social service or welfare agencies participating in the program. As Professor DiIulio and others argue, the best weapon against violent crime is one that stops juveniles who are at risk of becoming career criminals in the first place. With early, targeted intervention by dedicated local community organizations -- especially religious or faith-based institutions with a social service capacity -- such children can be taught to tell right from wrong, can acquire personal discipline and moral virtues, and can learn to respect both themselves and others.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Certain conditions are essential to the success of any local SHOCAP program:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>CONDITION #1: Establish the local police as the lead agency in tracking serious habitual offenders.</b> The police department is the logical lead agency in a SHOCAP program. Police officers have the first contact with criminals in the community. Police work is a 24-hour, 365-day-a-year job that involves the front-line responsibility and experience needed to handle criminal information. The police therefore have the ability to gather, organize, and analyze a SHO case file; they are familiar with SHOs and their case histories, as well as the kinds of crimes they commit and how they operate. On patrol in the neighborhoods, they will know where SHOs live and who their associates are, as well as their family and criminal histories.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Functional crime analysis by police is essential to SHOCAP, but local officials in each case will have to review the capacity of their own police agency to function as primary collector and analyzer of the basic SHOCAP information. This capacity varies from department to department; only two-thirds of all local police departments use computers, but many have a separate crime analysis unit.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
With regard to the police department's role, a cautionary note is in order: SHOCAP must be a department-wide responsibility. Placing the responsibility, particularly for data collection and analysis, with the juvenile division sends the signal that this unit can take care of the problem, and the rest of the police force need not concern itself with this juvenile project. Such an approach cuts off the agency's most important tactical muscle -- the cop on patrol in the neighborhood.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>CONDITION #2: Require local government agencies to share information on serious habitual offenders.</b> The adoption of a Serious Habitual Offender Comprehensive Action Program is predicated on gathering and analyzing data, and then planning an appropriate response to SHOs. The SHOCAP process improves operational coordination among the police, prosecutors, courts, probation departments, schools, correctional agencies, social and family services, and other public and private community organizations. Computerized case management procedures for tracking serious habitual juvenile offenders allow the police to identify the warning signs of potential SHOs, such as a home characterized by domestic violence or sexual and physical abuse. Then, using the information gleaned from these routine police reports, local officials can assign responsibility for intervention or monitoring to public or private social service agencies.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is why it is essential that welfare agencies and schools be included in the information gathering process. The families of serious habitual offenders often receive various types of public assistance.<sup>35</sup>  At the state and local levels, where many of these welfare programs are administered, social service workers who know the welfare histories and family structures of potential and active SHOs can provide important information on child abuse, neglect, or domestic violence.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Because of the 1996 federal welfare reform, which includes block granting of welfare assistance and responsibilities to the states, cooperation among state welfare or social service agencies should improve significantly. Vital child victim and abuse information collected by social service agents in the course of their routine duties can give particular direction to law enforcement, probation, court, and corrections officers. Public housing authorities or managers also have tremendous potential to assist law enforcement officers in developing a database of serious habitual offenders. A juvenile growing up in public housing is four to five times more likely to become a SHO than is a juvenile growing up in non-public housing.<sup>36</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
School officials, especially administrators, also can play a significant role in monitoring SHOs because SHOs invariably disrupt the classroom and are poor candidates for continuing in public school.<sup>37</sup>  School officials get to know who the serious habitual offenders are because of the pressures of trying to maintain order and discipline in the classroom, and usually have to spend more time monitoring them than they do with other students. Under certain circumstances, specialized schools designed to handle disruptive students should be an integral part of the intervention plan for these juveniles.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the 1980s, juvenile justice files and crime, school, welfare, social service, and probation records rarely were shared between agencies. State and local officials, misconstruing the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA),<sup>38</sup> frequently overreacted by withholding even basic "juvenile information."  Law enforcement and other agencies strained to keep secret common street information regarding a juvenile's conduct or the receipt of social services or welfare benefits. Before SHOCAP was implemented, juvenile judges and prosecutors in current SHOCAP jurisdictions often had access to less than 30 percent of the information needed for filings or court dispositions. In places like Colorado Springs and Oxnard, for example, there was little, if any, sharing of information between agencies. Where SHOCAP has been implemented, however, there has been remarkable progress in breaking down barriers to the gathering of appropriate information on juvenile criminal conduct. A new consensus has been emerging, both on sharing juvenile records and on what information within these records ought to be considered relevant.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A SHOCAP case file should include the following types of information: biographical data; a description of prior and current offenses, including criminal history; a listing of known and suspected associates and confederates; any gang or drug involvement; a description of any "fencing" activity; a concise, comprehensive narrative portrait; field investigation data (FI cards); motor vehicle ownership and violation information; whether the subject has been named as a suspect in other crimes; victimization history; the status offense history of the victim as well as the SHO; any active warrants; school, employment, and family histories; social and medical services history; and prior conduct in detention and correctional facilities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some states, however, may need to enact SHOCAP enabling legislation, which allows the sharing of juvenile records and information before SHOCAP can be established.<sup>39</sup>  Such legislation helps establish working relationships among law enforcement and local government agencies so they can build an effective database and case management system. To date, seven states have adopted or are working on SHOCAP enabling legislation.<sup>40</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Condition #3: Establish local criteria for identifying serious habitual offenders.</b> Each local jurisdiction must tailor its SHO criteria to fit its own crime problems, keeping in mind the capacity of its own law enforcement agencies. The criteria for identifying and tracking juvenile crime should focus on the worst juvenile offenders -- those who repeatedly have displayed serious criminal misconduct. Local officials must resist the temptation to broaden the net to include less serious offenders. Without this discipline, the program's focus will be lost, and the system will be swamped with marginal threats to community safety.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Based on the experience of local SHOCAP sites and an analysis conducted by Justice Department officials during the Reagan Administration, the following criteria conform to the case histories of the 35 most serious juvenile offenders per 100,000:<sup>41</sup>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Five arrests, with three chargeable as felonies, and three arrests within the last 12 months; or
<p>
<li> Ten arrests, with two chargeable as felonies, and three arrests within the last 12 months; or
<p>
<li> One arrest for three or more burglaries, robberies, or sexual assaults within the preceding 12 months; or
<p>
<li> Ten total arrests, with eight or more for misdemeanor crimes of theft, assault, battery, narcotics, or controlled substance abuse, or for possession of weapons, and three arrests within the preceding 12 months.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
By using such criteria, local officials can estimate the caseload for all components of the criminal justice system, including the arrest, detention, and prosecution of serious habitual offenders and the extent of supervision to be provided by corrections officers after a SHO is released from prison. On the basis of this projected caseload, local officials also can inventory the resources available to concentrate on these juveniles (including both public and private social service agencies desiring to participate in the prevention aspects of the SHOCAP program) and allocate those resources accordingly.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Condition #4: Require that information on serious habitual offenders be shared with the courts and their officers.</b> In court proceedings, as well as in probation and parole hearings, the comprehensive case management files developed through SHOCAP can be invaluable. Juvenile judges can be assured that whatever judicial decisions they make are based on the best information available. The same is true for judges in adult criminal courts who have access to such files.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Similarly, prosecutors will have the sort of comprehensive information they need to prosecute serious habitual offenders successfully. In fact, once a jurisdiction's SHOCAP program matures, and depending on caseload, the local prosecutor's office should consider creating a specific case management position, both to manage these cases more efficiently and to support vertical prosecution of SHOs.<sup>42</sup>  In addition, SHOCAP gives prosecutors a ready-made case priority and assignment schedule. A complete SHOCAP file ensures that SHOs are charged with the highest legally provable offense, prevents the inappropriate pretrial release of such offenders, and prevents the sealing or destroying of the records of juveniles designated as SHOs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Juvenile probation officers will find that the case file preparation generated by the SHOCAP process can lessen their casework and fortify their recommendations to the courts on the disposition of juvenile cases. They can develop specialized individual programs and custody levels for such offenders, making a sharp distinction between SHOs and other juvenile delinquents. The most important task is to develop specialized control measures for the SHO on probation or back on the streets after release from prison.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>CUTTING SHORT A CRIMINAL CAREER</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For law-abiding citizens, the career criminal is Public Enemy Number One. By using modern information technology and case management as embodied in Serious Habitual Offender Comprehensive Action Programs, law enforcement officers and local government officials can target and track society's most dangerous criminals. Almost without exception, the adult career criminal was a serious habitual offender as a juvenile. Once again, this is a very small minority of the population: 94 percent of the juveniles arrested for a criminal offense are never arrested again, 4 percent are arrested on a regular basis, and only 2 percent are arrested repeatedly and go on to become serious habitual offenders and career criminals.<sup>43</sup>  Career criminals exhibit common patterns of behavior, as well as a relationship between age and criminal behavior. Unfortunately, however, today's juvenile justice and adult criminal justice systems are not adequately linked.<sup>44</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since both the volume and intensity of juvenile crime have increased and are likely to escalate in the future, it is no longer feasible to wait until these career criminals reach adulthood to protect society from their actions.<sup>45</sup>  There are stages in the life of the typical career criminal.<sup>46</sup>  By channeling resources on the basis of a comprehensive case management system, SHOCAP can play a crucial role in stifling a criminal career at each stage. State and local officials therefore should adopt a SHOCAP program and try some juvenile offenders 18 years old and under as adults.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Stages of Development.</b> In the first stage of criminal development, as amply documented by <a href="/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick Fagan</a>, these serious habitual offenders come from abusive, broken, or neglectful homes.<sup>47</sup>  Looking backward through the SHOCAP telescope, local law enforcement and criminal justice officials can trace the pattern of abuse and neglect that often results in a delinquent and criminal lifestyle. Based on the SHOCAP criteria and amplified by indices of negative social conditions identified by the Heritage Foundation, state and local officials can design an early intervention strategy for juveniles who are at risk of becoming serious habitual offenders and career criminals. Such a strategy can focus community resources, including private-sector charitable, social, and religious institutions, on potential and active SHOs and stop their criminal careers before they gain momentum.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the second stage of the criminal's development, from 13 to 18 years of age, the SHOCAP process helps judges and other state and local criminal justice officials answer a critical question: Is the offender, based on his record, likely to respond to intensive intervention by social service agencies, or is he in fact a youthful career criminal who cannot be rehabilitated and should be locked up?  State corrections officials simply do not know how to rehabilitate some violent young criminals who pose such a clear danger to society that they must be separated from the community and controlled. SHOCAP can help state and local judges and other responsible officials determine who among a larger class of young offenders are the incorrigibles.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

From the vantage point of public safety, the best that state and local officials can do with the incorrigible juvenile SHO when the crime is serious is to try him as an adult, sentence him as an adult, and require him to serve at least 85 percent of his sentence, as specified by the truth-in-sentencing laws called for in recent federal legislation and enacted in 22 states.<sup>48</sup>  This would mean that a 15-year-old serious habitual offender who is given 20 years for second degree murder would serve at least 17 years before being released at age 32. Thus, the serious offender would have spent his highest crime years locked up, unable to prey on more victims.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
During the third stage of a criminal's career, from 18 to 30 years of age, SHOCAP gives state and local criminal justice officials complete criminal histories of career offenders at the time they are arrested. The police, prosecutors, and judges know instantly that they are dealing with a SHO and not a petty or first time offender. Currently, however, an adult criminal's previous juvenile records are not available to the system in most jurisdictions. As a result, 18-year-olds with lengthy records of serious and violent crime frequently are treated as first-time offenders.
<p>
<b>A NEW POLICY TO COMBAT VIOLENT JUVENILE CRIME</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
America's juvenile and criminal justice system still works too slowly to be effective in identifying and incarcerating career criminals. Congress can assist state and local officials with money, technology, and advice -- and by removing federal mandates in the juvenile judicial system -- but controlling and combating serious crime remains the responsibility primarily of state and local government. State and local leaders can take a variety of concrete steps to combat the scourge of violent crime, especially crimes committed by juveniles. Innovative police methods like those implemented in cities like Houston and New York are reducing the rate of violent crime.<sup>49</sup>  Beyond adopting an information management system like SHOCAP, state and local leaders can take three other steps to stop these criminal careers before they run their destructive course:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b> Target and track serious habitual offenders.</b> Enact legislation at the state level that enables local officials to share crucial juvenile case files and establish an effective Serious Habitual Offender Comprehensive Action Program in their local jurisdictions. SHOCAP can make available to police and state law enforcement officers, as well as judicial and corrections officials, the information they need to identify and respond to the most dangerous young criminals in their communities.
<p>
<li><b>  Try as adults all juveniles who commit heinous crimes.</b> Enact state laws to try juvenile offenders as adults for specific violent offenses. Under Title I of Representative McCollum's Violent Youth Predator Act of 1996, a juvenile criminal 14 or more years of age who is convicted of a serious federal violent crime or "a major drug trafficking offense" automatically can be tried as an adult. States should consider similar legislation for state offenses.
<p>
<li><b> Enact truth-in-sentencing laws.</b> Pass legislation requiring all violent offenders, including juveniles tried as adults, to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences.<sup>50</sup>  Thus far, 22 states have adopted such laws. As the bipartisan Council on Crime in America has concluded, probation, parole, and other forms of non-incarceration often take the place of prison, even for violent offenders. More than half of convicted violent felons still are not sentenced to prison.<sup>51</sup>  This must end.
</ul>
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress can encourage state and local officials in their efforts to combat juvenile crime. The Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Act of 1996 sponsored by Senator Orrin Hatch and former Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole would allow states to try the most serious violent juvenile offenders (those charged with federal offenses) as adults. In many respects, this bill complements the Violent Youth Predator Act of 1996 sponsored by Representative McCollum. Both bills also give financial assistance to the states.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Ultimately, however, the war to defeat the growing menace of violent juvenile crime must be fought and won by state and local officials who are smart, tough, and tenacious. The SHOCAP process is a valuable weapon for communities fighting the war on crime. It combines the advances of the modern microelectronic revolution with sophisticated crime and data analysis to target and track America's most crucial crime perpetrator: the violent habitual juvenile offender.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By providing instant access to shared information and a complete case file with relevant information, SHOCAP not only will improve the capability of the local police, but also will enhance the quality and caliber of decisions made by key officials in the criminal justice system. Courts, probation and parole departments, correctional officials, and social service and welfare agencies all will benefit from a strong database on juvenile offenders and from shared access to case management files.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Today's serious habitual offenders are tomorrow's career criminals. Children who look more like victims of abuse and neglect than criminals at age 13 may well be engaged in repeatedly committing the community's most serious and violent offenses from ages 14 to 17. They are a serious and growing threat to public safety. Fortunately, if adopted, SHOCAP and the other reforms advocated in this paper can help America's communities make their streets, schools, and neighborhoods safe again.

<P>
<FONT FACE="">National Press Club:  Thank you, Chairman Devine.
 <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">I want to begin my remarks today with a short
story about something that happened to me recently.  Two nights
ago, I was interviewed on CNBC about my organization's efforts
to reduce wiretapping.  In the middle of the interview, the host
took a call from a clear conservative.  Her remark was simple
and to the point -- and the usual remark all conservatives get
from liberals.  &quot;If you are for reducing wiretapping, then
you must be for terrorism.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">Conservatives get nailed with that broad brush
every day when it comes to the environment.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE=""> We are for reforming the Clean Air Act --
therefore we are for dirty air.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE=""> We are for reforming the Clean Water Act --
therefore we are for dirty water.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE=""> We are for reform of the Endangered Species
Act -- therefore, we hate wildlife.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<U><I><B><FONT FACE="">Of course, nothing could be farther
from the truth.<BR>
</FONT></B></I></U>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">Conservatives see people as a part of nature.
 Liberals see people as the enemy of nature.  Environmental policies
over the past several decades, while the Democrats have been in
charge of Congress, have illustrated just that view.  In that
time, we have seen more regulations, more government control over
federal lands and private property, higher taxes, and lower involvement
of the private sector.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">Today, if you strike oil on your land, the
value of your property goes up.  However, if you find an endangered
species on your land, your property value plummets.  When your
land value goes down, you and your family are at risk.  This creates
a threat to both people and wildlife.  Is the safety of the golden
cheeked warbler more important that your family's well-being?
 Liberals say yes.  Under conservative proposals, the question
need not be asked or answered.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">This platform calls for tax incentives to protect
species, preserve your property, and enhance the environment.
 The value of your property will rise and the antagonistic relationship
between land owners and wildlife will end.  This platform defines
excessive regulation of property as a &quot;taking&quot; under
the 5th Amendment.  Land owners must be compensated when their
land is abused by the federal government.  Today, there is no
financial constraint on federal agencies, such as the Fish and
Wildlife Service, from over regulating your property.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">If there were a dollar amount attached to every
action that the federal government takes in dealing with private
property, less property will be taken and the government would
need more solid evidence before taking property.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">This platform reduces regulation, puts a better
balance on economic factors, demands more scientific accountability,
keeps our environment, wildlife, and natural resources healthy
and protected, and protects property rights.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">I<B>t's a new approach.<BR>

<B><FONT FACE="">NATURAL RESOURCES, ENVIRONMENT AND PROPERTY
RIGHTS<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">All Americans want to have a cleaner, healthier,
safer environment. The question is how to reach those goals. We
believe that outdated programs such as Superfund, the Clean Water,
Clean Air and Endangered Species Acts must be reformed so that
the well being of human beings is considered the ultimate measure,
responsible scientific standards are incorporated, solutions are
developed at a site- and situation-specific level rather than
by bureaucratic mandate, market mechanisms are employed to reach
goals, and private property try rights are protected. Using all
of these tools improves the environment while protecting rights
and allowing for economic progress. To do so effectively, we must
use scientifically rigorous risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis
for all regulatory activities. Superfund is a colossally expensive
example of what not to do. Billions have been spent in some cases
to make soil squeaky clean, while true toxic waste sites have
often remained untouched for years. We commend the Republican
Congress for passing true reform: the Unfunded Mandates Relief
Act, and the majority of Republicans who supported the Risk Assessment
and Cost Benefits Act, the Regulatory Reform and Relief Act, and
the Clean Water Amendments of 1995.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">Most current government policies have been
based on an outdated, bureaucratic, command-and-control model
of forcing compliance. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is a
prime example that has failed in its purpose and done great harm.
Rather than saving endangered species, the real fruits of this
law have been violation of property rights on a massive scale
and the loss of tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars
of economic activity and land values. As a result, even the Democratic
Congress of President Clinton's first two years was unable to
re-authorize the Act (forcing it to operate only under appropriations
bills). Consequently, we support a new vision on how to conserve
species. We support a non-regulatory, incentive-based system that
rewards property owners for good stewardship of wildlife habitat
and which will begin to re-establish trust between land owners,
communities and officials. We commend those members of Congress
who introduced a measure that meets these goals, the Endangered
Species Recovery and Conservation Incentive Act of 1995.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">Over the past three decades, national regulations
of natural resource management and laws promulgated in the name
of the environment have asserted more and more control over how
citizens can use their property. We believe that excessive regulation
of property undermines its integrity and amounts to a &quot;taking&quot;
under the Fifth Amendment, without providing compensation for
the private loss. We recognize the great value of private property
in ensuring a healthy, productive and beautiful environment. Accordingly,
we support regulatory takings compensation for regulations that
effectively end use of property. We commend those members of the
House who voted to provide such protection in The Private Property
Protection Act of 1995 and those members of the Senate who supported
Senator Dole's Omnibus Property Rights Act.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">Renewable resources-trees, plants, soil, air,
water, fish and wildlife and collections thereof such as wetlands,
deserts, forests and prairies-are the resources that produce food,
clothing, medicine, shelter and essential human needs.    Human
life depends upon them. In most cases, such resources are continually
regenerated and have a profound ability<B> </B>to carry, recycle,
recover and cleanse. These characteristics make it possible to
wisely use renewable resources and conserve them for future generations.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">Agriculture and energy are the building blocks
of modern life and remain vital to survival. Human ingenuity can
conserve, develop and improve resources through privatization
and the use of enterprise. We support the private nature of the
American farm system and the entrepreneurship of the American
farmer and rancher. We salute the Freedom to Farm legislation
passed by the Republican 104th Congress and encourage other responsible
movements toward a true market system. We likewise note that our
energy system, primarily private, made the American economic miracle
possible. We support elimination of the Department of Energy to
emphasize the need for greater privatization and deregulation.
We oppose efforts to nationalize under the Department the electric
utility industry and support its continued deregulation and privatization
under state regulatory policies.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="">With large majorities of the land in the West
owned by the government, Democrat Party policies have severely
restricted natural resource production and even recreation activities
without improving the environmental quality of these lands. We
support responsible privatization of such lands, particularly
those under the Bureau of Land Management, while we support preserving
historic rights to water, mining claims, grazing permits, rights
of access, hunting and contracts. We oppose new additions to the
government's already large land stock through additions to national
forests, wildlife refuges and parks well beyond Federal ability
to manage them. We oppose the intrusive and destructive policies
of the Clinton Administration designed to halt timber production
in the most productive forests, force livestock off traditional
ranges, limit mineral and oil exploration and production, establish
an intrusive national biological survey, and restrict hunting.
We also oppose policies which conveyed decision-making over American
resources to international bodies such as the Convention on Climate
Change, the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Montreal Protocol,
and the myriad United Nations UNESCO programs. We reject these
environmentally and economically disastrous policies. We instead
support our new and workable vision for ensuring that all Americans
have a healthier, cleaner and safer environment.</FONT>

<I><DD>With President Clinton's signing of welfare reform legislation, almost everyone now agrees that the 
welfare state has been a failure.  Government welfare programs, rather than providing a temporary safety net for those who have fallen on hard times, have too often become a long-term snare that discourages self-sufficiency. But what will replace the welfare state?
<BR>
<DD>Proponents of the status quo often say that viable private alternatives to government welfare do not exist or cannot be created.  Yet such alternatives flourished in the past, and some still flourish today.  They need to receive greater public attention and, more importantly, they need to be duplicated.
<BR>
<DD>The four books reviewed in this month's </I>Alternatives in Philanthropy<I> explore some of these alternatives and suggest changes that can be made in public policy to help restore private charity to its once indispensable role. Together, they offer a compelling vision of a post-welfare society.</I><BR>

<BR>Visiting Fellow</B></FONT></CENTER>
<P>
<DD>For years, the debate over welfare reform has 
centered around money.  Liberals have contended that the 
problems of the poor can be solved by spending more tax dollars. 
 Most of this money, of course, has ended up in the hands 
of middle-class professionals who deal with the 
poorsociologists, nonprofit executives, and social workers.  
And because the number of poor people has not fallen even 
as government spending on poverty programs has 
increased, liberals have called for even more tax funding of 
nonprofit organizations that ostensibly serve the poor.
<BR>
<DD>The standard conservative response has been to call 
for cuts in welfare.  Cut payments and impose time limits 
on benefits, conservatives have argued, and the poor 
will struggle in low-wage jobs and gradually move up 
the income ladder as earlier generations did.
<BR>
<DD>This view is not without merit.  In the late 1980s, 
the American Enterprise Institute's Michael Novak convened 
a team of policy analysts, both liberal and conservative, 
to see if they could reach a consensus on how to 
reduce poverty.  They concluded that in order to avoid 
long-term poverty, a person must do three things: finish high 
school, get married, and get a job -- any job.  (See 
<I>The New Consensus on Poverty and Welfare</I>, Washington, DC: AEI, 1987.) 
 Even the lowest-paying jobs teach important skills such 
as punctuality and courtesy that are essential in all kinds 
of work.
<BR>
<DD>Against the liberal argument, it can also be said that 
the poor, like everyone else, respond to incentives.  In 
large cities, the homeless often receive many kinds of 
benefits, from shelter to food to medicine to evenin a few 
&quot;progressive&quot; citieselectronic mail addresses.  Of course, 
this does nothing to reduce homelessness.  In fact, many of 
the homeless seem to prefer life on the streets to the 
demands earning a living in mainstream society.
<P>
<B>Changing the Terms of Debate</B>
<BR>
<DD>Marvin Olasky, whose 1992 book <I>The Tragedy of 
American Compassion</I> helped spark a renewed debate on 
how best to help the poor, seeks to change the focus of 
welfare discussions.  He argues that many of the problems the 
poor face are not financial but cultural and spiritual.  He 
contends that many 19th-century charities effectively 
fought poverty by helping the poor on an individual basis 
and through biblical and moral teaching.  <I>Renewing 
American Compassion: How Compassion for the Needy Can 
Turn Ordinary Citizens into Heroes</I> (New York: Free Press, 
201 pages, $21.00) continues Olasky's exploration of why 
private charity is a better way to help the poor than 
government subsidy.
<BR>
<DD>&quot;Private charities had succeeded in helping many 
individuals,&quot; Olasky writes, &quot;because they offered 
compassion that was challenging, personal, and spiritually based.  
Government over time proved itself incapable of doing 
the same; instead, governmental charity emphasized 
entitlement rather than challenge, bureaucracy rather than 
personal help, and a reduction of man to material being only.&quot;
<BR>
<DD>In the first chapter, Olasky examines recent efforts 
in Wisconsin to reform welfare by imposing work 
requirements and time limits on benefits.  While supporting 
some of these reforms, he argues that Wisconsin's reforms 
include &quot;a package of social-worker intensive programs 
that will continue to keep the welfare world safe for 
bureaucracy.&quot;  Moreover, the Wisconsin effort is essentially 
a compromise intended to please liberals, conservatives, 
and feminists.  Liberals under the reform get a continuation 
of the welfare state.  Conservatives get some insistence 
on work, as welfare recipients are required to get a job 
or spend 32 hours per week in classes to prepare them 
for work.  And feminists get an assurance that welfare 
agencies will not elevate the traditional family above other 
living arrangements.  On the walls of a Kenosha, 
Wisconsin welfare office are such slogans as &quot;A family
doesnt need a man to be whole and Stop waiting for Prince Charming, his horse broke down.
<BR>
<DD>While its too early to tell what results these reforms as well as recent federal legislation will produce, Olasky suggests that most reformers are asking the wrong questions.  Perhaps current reforms will prompt some mothers to enter the work force, but will government programs ensure that poor women dont form single-parent households in the first place?  Long-term poverty fighting, he contends, depends on affecting not just the outside of a person, but the inside as well.
<BR>
<DD>In the second chapter, Olasky explores several faith-based private alternatives to Wisconsins reform efforts.  In Milwaukees Parklawn housing project, Deborah Darden heads the Right Alternative Family Services Center, which teaches responsibility to welfare mothers and their children.  He also visits Milwaukees Professional Receptionist Institute, where Lessie Handy teaches poor women how to get jobs as receptionists.  According to Handy, her school has had 206 graduates in its short existence, 186 of whom currently have jobs.
<BR>
<DD>These charities, Olasky contends, do a better job with less money than their state-run counterparts because they teach moral lessons as well as job skills.  No bureaucracy, and no amount of money, can buy the reformation of morals that is desperately needed.
<P>
<B>Lessons from History</B><BR>
<DD>In subsequent chapters, Olasky returns to history to discuss principles that charity workers and organizations used to help the poor.  New York Citys Society for the Relief of Poor Widows with Small Children (founded 1797) provided food, clothing, and medicinebut no cashto those it believed would be propelled toward greater self-sufficiency.  Other 19th-century charities admonished volunteers to follow such principles as: help the deserving poor one at a time, and treat them as friends and neighbors, not clients.  
Most 19th-century social reformers opposed
any massive national effort to address poverty.  An 
1844 edition of <I>McGuffey's Reader</I>, for example, criticized 
a &quot;Mr. Fantom&quot; who had &quot;noble zeal for the 
<I>millions</I>&quot; but &quot;little compassion for the units.&quot;
<BR>
<DD>Around the turn of the century, however, these 
effective charities were superseded by large national 
organizations that thought it more important to fight the presumed 
&quot;social causes&quot; of poverty.  Progressive reformers replaced 
the reform-minded Christianity of their parents and 
grandparents with a weaker, utopian faith which held that a 
New Jerusalem could be built in America through 
government action.  As Frank Lovejoy, president of the National 
Conference of Social Work, said in a 1920 address, 
social workers could become &quot;social engineers&quot; who would 
create &quot;a divine order on earth as it is in heaven.&quot;
<BR>
<DD>Ultimately, the ideas of Progressives led to the 
welfare programs of the Great Society.  But today, Olasky 
contends, the welfare state is like an abandoned church: its 
structure still stands, but the faith that built it is long dead.
<P>
<B>Moving Beyond the Status Quo</B>
<BR>
<DD>Olasky observes, however, that many smaller nonprofits, often with shoestring budgets, have adapted or retained the methods of 19th-century charities.  Reformers such as Bob Cote in Denver, Hannah Hawkins in Washington, D.C., and Freddie Garcia in San Antonio change lives through tough-love approaches.  As welfare agencies stagnate under the dead weight of disproved theories and political inertia, smaller, nimbler nonprofits are succeeding.
<BR>
<DD>Olasky argues that thousands of poverty-fighting groups will do more for the poor than a massive and costly welfare state.
To help them, he proposes greatly expanded tax credits for charitable activities.  He supports the proposals of Sen. Dan Coats (R-IN) that would give a $500 tax credit to taxpayers who contribute to direct-service charities, and an additional $500 credit to taxpayers who take care of homeless people, battered and pregnant women, or those requiring hospice care.
<BR>
<DD>But Olasky believes that more dramatic reforms 
are necessary.  He calls for devolving welfare to the states 
and reducing the average federal tax burden by $3,000 
per person.  To offset the loss of federal revenue, state 
taxes would rise by $2,500 per person.  However, those 
who contributed $3,000 in time or money to 
poverty-fighting organizations would be exempt from the new state tax.
<BR>
<DD>Tax credits, Olasky concludes, can play a part in 
ensuring that more Americans practice true compassion 
toward the needy.  But personal changes in the beliefs of 
millions of Americans will be necessary if poverty is to be reduced. 
 &quot;With supportive laws and rules,&quot; Olasky says, 
&quot;compassionate individuals can make real progress toward 
reducing some of our most serious social pathologies, but the 
crucial change is still the one that goes on in each individual 
soul, not in the federal or state capitals.&quot;

<CENTER><FONT  SIZE=+2><B>David G. Green's<BR>
<I>Community without Politics</I></FONT><BR>
<FONT  SIZE=+1>Reviewed by Daniel T. Oliver<BR>
Editor</B></FONT></CENTER>
<BR>
<DD>Is there a viable private alternative to the welfare state? 
 This is the question posed by David G. Green, director 
of the Health and Welfare Unit of the Institute of 
Economic Affairs, in <I>Community without Politics: A Market 
Approach to Welfare Reform</I> (London: IEA, [2 Lord 
North Street, SW1p 3LB, tel: 0171-799-3745], 1996, 184 
pp., &#163;8.00).  Green, a leading expert on welfare in Great 
Britain, brings a much-needed classical liberal perspective to 
the issue of how to replace the welfare state.  Most of 
his analyses and recommendations are applicable to the 
United States.
<BR>
<DD>Before the welfare state, Green argues, most 
Britons assumed responsibility for fostering a &quot;public but not 
political domain&quot; of duties to care for those unable to 
support themselves.  They prioritized responsibility for this 
task: first, the individual or family; second, the community 
as distinct from the state; and finally, the government.  
This formed the basis for an ethos of &quot;community without 
politics&quot; in which ordinary people helped the less 
fortunate without generally resorting to government.  This 
ethos, argues Green, urgently needs to be revived.
<P>
<B>Liberty and Community: A Restatement</B>
<BR>
<DD>Green argues that the Thatcher and Reagan 
administrations failed to curtail government welfare because 
they could not change public beliefs that doing so would 
be harmful and immoral.  He contends that this attitude 
still predominates because few people can envision 
private alternatives to welfare and because &quot;collectivists 
have successfully established in the public mind . . . that 
to demand more government welfare . . . is proof of 
compassion.&quot;  Moreover, advocates of freedom have been 
preoccupied with economic issues while overlooking the 
importance of voluntary associations in addressing social 
problems.
<BR>
<DD>Green believes that fundamental welfare reform 
depends in part on reviving classical liberal conceptions of 
freedom and community.  These, he suggests, have important 
implications for both givers and receivers of charity.  To 
most 19th-century liberals, freedom was not &quot;laissez-faire&quot; 
or liberation from obstacles to one's desires, but the 
exercise of responsibility for self-improvement and for making 
the world a better place for others.  Historically, advocates 
of liberty &quot;wanted to create and foster institutions that 
would encourage self-improvement.  Civic capitalists always 
understood that life is a perpetual struggle against 
imperfection.  They did not, of course, expect perfection to 
be achieved.&quot;
<BR>
<DD>Drawing on the work of political philosopher 
Michael Oakeshott, Green uses the term &quot;civil association&quot; to 
describe the kind of community classical liberals sought 
to build.  Advocates of civil association held that 
individuals were intelligent agents capable of overcoming 
obstacles and charting their course in life.  Freedom, while 
demanding much of the individual, was experienced as a 
pleasure, not a burden.  A sense of community arose from a 
shared understanding that everyone, through the exercise of 
responsibility and virtue, had both the chance to achieve 
his or her potential and a responsibility to help others 
achieve theirs.
<BR>
<DD>But Green notes that when the 20th-century welfare 
state tried to solve problems that all individuals 
facefrom saving for health care to guarding against poverty in 
old ageit undermined opportunities to address those 
problems individually and through voluntary associations: 
it &quot;weakened human character by diminishing 
opportunities for us to develop our skills and our virtues through 
direct participation in overcoming the hazards of life. . . .  
There can be no virtue without practice and no practice while 
the state monopolizes all important services.&quot;  If the 
welfare state is to be replaced, each of us must be willing to 
shoulder more responsibility for our own welfare and the welfare 
of others.
<P>
<B>Reforming the Nonprofit Sector</B><BR>
<DD>Green succinctly explains why the welfare state 
has encouraged long-term dependency and effectively 
refutes arguments often used to justify expansive welfare 
programs.  But his main contribution may be the many 
proposals he advances to scale back the welfare leviathan 
and allow private initiative to flourish.
<BR>
<DD>Recognizing that private alternatives to welfare will 
not become widespread so long as nonprofit organizations 
rely on government funds, Green suggests that the law 
recognize two types of nonprofits: &quot;registered charities&quot; 
that depend entirely on private funding and &quot;registered 
voluntary associations&quot; that receive partial funding from 
government.  Only the former would enjoy tax-exempt status.  
This change, Green believes, would encourage more 
nonprofits to forego government funding.
<BR>
<DD>Green also proposes that advocates of nonprofit 
reform create a membership organization to represent 
privately supported nonprofits.  Its goal would be to &quot;build a 
movement of those who take pride in ensuring that vital tasks 
are undertaken without resort to government . . . and to 
encourage the new spirit among others.&quot; Green further 
proposes that businesses reorient their giving programs to 
favor privately supported nonprofits and that they refuse to 
fund nonprofits that seek to expand the welfare state.
<P>
<B>Policy Proposals</B>
<BR>
<DD>Green outlines four policy changes that must occur if 
the poor are to become economically self-sufficient:
<UL>
<LI>Promote economic growth and end over-regulation that is responsible for unemployment.
<LI>Acknowledge that self-destructive behavior is a major cause of poverty.  Discretionary assistance is more likely to help the needy than cash payments and one-size-fits-all entitlement programs.
<LI>Cut income taxes to allow wage earners to keep more of their earnings, and end income taxes on savings.
<LI>Revive the tradition of community without politics.
</UL>
<BR>
<DD>Green discusses how voluntary organizations could do 
a better job of providing two types of government 
benefits: insurable contingencies (such as sick pay and 
disability benefits) and unemployment compensation.  To 
privatize insurable contingencies, the government would honor 
existing commitments but at a set date pay no new benefits. 
Reductions in spending would be matched by tax 
cuts, allowing workers to retain more of their earnings to 
buy health insurance or set aside money in case of ill health.
<BR>
<DD>Green proposes four ways to handle individuals 
with costly pre-existing health conditions:
<UL>
<LI>The government could pay insurance companies a one-time lump sum in exchange for accepting such persons
<LI>Risk pools, like those in use in the U.S., could be created;
<LI>Insurers could be required to accept a certain number of uninsurable persons based on market share;
<LI>Traditional provident dispensaries, similar to America's community health clinics, could be reestablished.  
The poor would pay what they could for health 
care while the better-off would pay more.  As Green notes, 
&quot;the British people have traditionally been generous and 
many may well be attracted to support provident associations. 
Today, organizations which have an ethical as well as 
a commercial purpose are already popular, including 
unit trusts [mutual funds] promising `ethical investments.'&quot;
</UL>
<DD>Green argues that Britain's current unemployment 
compensation system encourages an attitude of &quot;claim all 
you can get.&quot;  But private organizations, he contends, are 
better suited to develop tailor-made programs that help 
individuals regain employment: &quot;A face-to-face relationship with 
a voluntary association worker will not have the same 
corrupting effect because all assistance will be 
discretionary and subject to mutual agreement.  In such a 
personal relationship, mutual respect, honour and good faith have 
a chance, but an arms-length relationship with a public 
official encourages dishonesty, bad faith and `working 
the system.'&quot;
<BR>
<DD>Green proposes giving the unemployed the option of choosing either government unemployment benefits or 
assistance from privately funded employment organizations. 
Individuals choosing the former would have to spend 
all their savings and deduct any part-time income before 
receiving benefits.  Those choosing private support, 
however, would not be legally obliged to do either.
<P>
<B>Dealing with Illegitimacy</B><BR>
<DD>Green believes that &quot;to father a child and to refuse to 
take responsibility should be clearly marked out as one of 
the lowest things a man can do.&quot;  To deter men from 
fathering children out of wedlock, he proposes three new 
criminal offenses, possibly carrying jail sentences:
<UL>
<LI>A father's failure to register his child's birth;
<LI>Threatening the mother with violence to conceal the father's identity;
<LI>Failing to pay child support.
</UL>
<DD>Green proposes that fathers who refuse to pay 
child support be legally required to turn over all earnings, 
savings, and non-essential possessions until their obligation 
is fulfilled.  He also proposes that fathers who quit working 
to avoid child support be forced to work at special centers.  
&quot;It may be necessary in a few cases to make this work 
obligation especially burdensome, perhaps by requiring 
performance of hard labour for up to ten hours a day. . . .  
These measures will strike many as severe, and that is 
their intention.  They are likely to bring about a 
substantial behavioural change in men.&quot;
<P>Green also recommends that never-married mothers 
with children over two years of age be required to work as 
a condition of receiving benefits.  He speculates that the 
need for day care would make mandatory workfare more 
costly in the short run.  However, if &quot;the future promises a 
five-day working week plus caring for the child alone in the 
evenings and weekends, fewer [women] will choose it.&quot;
<P>
<B>The Road Ahead</B><BR>
<DD>Green aptly summarizes today's welfare problem 
by quoting J.S. Mill: &quot;A people among whom there is no 
habit of spontaneous action for a collective interestwho 
look habitually to their government to command or prompt 
them in all matters of joint concern who expect to have 
everything done for them, except what can be made an affair 
of mere habit and routinehave their faculties only 
half developed.&quot;
<BR>
<DD>The current welfare crisis, as Green amply makes 
clear, is not primarily financial but moral: welfare has 
undermined the determination of recipients to become 
self-sufficient and discouraged those who can help from doing so.
<BR>
<DD>As the 20th century draws to a close, more people 
are becoming convinced that the all-embracing welfare 
state cannot work.  Yet it is not sufficient to demolish the 
myth of the beneficent welfare state. <I>Community without 
Politics</I> outlines important steps that must be taken to 
make viable private alternatives to welfare a reality.
<BR>

book, <I>Reinventing Civil Society: The Rediscovery of 
Welfare without Politics</I>, see the April 1994 issue of 
<I>Alternatives in Philanthropy</i>.)

<I>To Empower People</I></FONT><BR>
<FONT  SIZE=+1>Reviewed by Daniel T. Oliver, Editor</B></FONT></CENTER><BR>
<P>
<DD>In 1977, the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) 
published a forty-five page pamphlet entitled <I>To 
Empower People</I>.  Its authors, sociologist Peter L. Berger 
(now director of the Institute for the Study of Economic 
Culture at Boston University) and Catholic theologian 
Richard John Neuhaus (president of the Institute on Religion 
and Public Life and editor-in-chief of its monthly journal, 
<I>First Things</I>), argued compellingly that &quot;mediating 
structures&quot;institutions such as neighborhoods, families, churches, 
and voluntary associationsserve as an important bridge 
between individuals' private lives and the larger 
institutions of society.  Mediating structures, they declared, are vital 
to maintaining social cohesion and preventing social 
breakdown.
<BR>
<DD>AEI has republished the original work along with 
eleven new essays by prominent observers of American civic 
life in <I>To Empower People: From State to Civil 
Society</I> (Washington, DC: The AEI Press, 1996, 223 pages, $24.95, 
tel: [202] 862-5800).  The essayists offer insight into how 
the ideas of Berger and Neuhaus have helped to shape 
thinking about public policy over the last 20 years and 
contemplate the future course of public policy.  The introductory 
essay by AEI scholar Michael Novak, winner of the 
1994 Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion and a member 
of Capital Research Center's National Advisory Board, 
offers this prediction: &quot;The political party that makes 
mediating structures the North Star of a new bipartisan agenda 
will dominate practical politics for the next fifty years.&quot;
<UL>
<LI>Douglas J. Besharov, resident scholar at AEI, suggests ways to generate funding for mediating institutions that do not rely on direct federal monies;
<LI>Stuart M. Butler, vice president for domestic and economic policy studies at the Heritage Foundation, describes how public policy can encourage the growth of mediating structures;
<LI>William A. Galston, former deputy assistant to President Clinton for domestic policy, tells how &quot;New Democrats&quot; in the executive branch have sought to reinvigorate mediating structures;
<LI>David G. Green, director of the Health and Welfare Unit at the Institute of Economic Affairs, analyzes how the welfare state has undermined mediating institutions and suggests ways to address this problem;
<LI>Michael J. Horowitz, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and former general counsel of the Office of Management and Budget, proposes legal reforms that can help restore the role of mediating structures;
<LI>Michael S. Joyce and William A. Schambra, president and director of general programs, respectively, of the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, examine how the erosion of the Great Society ideal has laid the foundation for a revival of mediating structures;
<LI>Leslie Lenkowsky, president of the Hudson Institute, explains how federally funded nonprofits present a major obstacle to restoring mediating structures;
<LI>Marvin Olasky, senior fellow at the Progress and Freedom Foundation and author of the new book <I>Renewing American Compassion</I>, examines how the effectiveness of one mediating structurea homeless rehabilitation center was undermined by government funding;
<LI>James K. Pinkerton, former deputy assistant to Presidents Reagan and Bush for policy planning, describes how the concept of mediating structures has been incorporated into presidential campaigns since 1977.
<LI>Robert L. Woodson, president and founder of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, highlights several successful grassroots mediating institutions that can serve as an inspiration to others.
</UL>
<DD>Looking over their 1977 essay, Berger and Neuhaus 
note that today's political climate is more favorable to 
realizing their vision of reinvigorated mediating institutions.  
Indeed, they originally stressed that they were not 
primarily concerned with reducing the cost of government or 
devolving government responsibilities since &quot;that would be 
tantamount to dismantling the welfare state.&quot;  They now 
state that &quot;it seems plausible to us to be less cautious on 
both counts.&quot;
<BR>
<DD>Berger and Neuhaus also note that a major obstacle 
to reviving mediating structures is the &quot;very large and 
powerful vested interests [that] have grown up around 
every policy of the welfare state.  The paradigm shift suggested 
by the concept of mediating structures directly threatens 
some of those interests.  Needless to say, they will fight back. . . . 
The deformation of mediating structures by this process 
of creeping `governmentalism' must be at the center of 
any rethinking of social policy.&quot;

<I>The Home</I><BR></FONT>
<FONT  SIZE=+1>Reviewed by Martin Morse Wooster, Visiting Fellow</B><BR></FONT></CENTER>
<BR>
<DD>One issue often raised in the welfare debate is what to 
do about children who have lost one or both parents or who 
for some reason cannot remain with their biological parents. 
 It's clear that the existing state foster-care system is 
expensive and ineffective.  But would orphanages be a 
practical and humane alternative?
<BR>
<DD>That's the question posed by Richard B. McKenzie in 
his latest book, <I>The Home: A Memoir of Growing Up in 
an Orphanage</I> (New York: Basic Books, 1996, 227 
pages, $22.00).  McKenzie, an economist at the University 
of California at Irvine, is perhaps best known for his 
1993 book <I>What Went Right in the 1980s</I>, an analysis of 
economic policy during the Reagan Administration.  
Unlike McKenzie's usual focus on public policy, 
<I>The Home</I> is a narrative account of McKenzie's boyhood years at a 
North Carolina orphanage.
<BR>
<DD>McKenzie is very candid about his life at The 
Home, telling how his experiences there helped him mature 
and become a responsible adult.  He concludes that on 
balance The Home helped both him and his fellow orphans.  
&quot;Obviously, if any of us had been given a choice between 
growing up with Ozzie and Harriet or in The Home, we would 
surely have taken the former,&quot; he writes.  &quot;But our families 
had failed us, and we didn't want to take the risk that 
another family would do the same.  Virtually all of us today 
shudder at the foster-care option.  Foster families cannot 
offer children a sense of permanence, and the children can 
never be sure whether foster parents are taking them in as 
a personal mission or just for the money.&quot;
<BR>
<DD>McKenzie's account of recent changes at The Home 
is engaging if not saddening.  During the 1950s, 
when McKenzie was there, the institution was affiliated with 
the Presbyterian Church.  It had large farms where the 
orphans worked after school and during the summer.  It also had 
its own school, although in later years McKenzie and 
his fellow orphans went to a nearby high school.
<BR>
<DD>In the late 1960s, The Home underwent massive change. 
 Its board decided to transform the institution into a 
foster-care center, admitting only troubled children.  
Meanwhile, The Home's administrators, while retaining the 
institution's name in order to attract donors, cut off relations 
with alumni and forbade them from visiting students 
during reunion weekends.
<BR>
<DD>McKenzie observes that as a foster-care center, 
The Home has become vastly more expensive.  Tuition is 
now $45,000 a year!almost twice as much as Harvard 
tuition and fifteen times more than when McKenzie was there.  
And despite these huge fees, the school no longer provides 
jobs for students because it cannot afford to pay them.
<BR>
<DD>Surveying other orphans who grew up in The 
Home, McKenzie finds that most have become solid 
citizensministers, managers, doctors, bankers.  Far from 
being damaged by their time in The Home, McKenzie argues 
that they gained a sense of permanence they would never 
have had if they had bounced from one foster home to the next. 
 &quot;Children need, at a minimum, a safe, stable, 
structured, and permanent place that provides opportunities for 
personal growth, a chance to live down and away from 
the problems of their past.  They need the break I was 
lucky enough to get at The Home.&quot;
<BR>
<DD>(Results from McKenzie's survey of orphans appear 
in &quot;Orphanages: Did They Throttle the Children in their 
Care?&quot; <I>The Public Interest</I>, Winter 1996.)<BR>

</center><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration claims that its military intervention in Haiti has been one of the greatest foreign policy successes in American history. During the vice presidential debate on October 9, 1996, Vice President Albert Gore said that Operation Restore Democracy is "one of the most deft uses of diplomacy and military force in combination that you will find anywhere in the annals of the history of this country."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The truth, however, is that two years after Jean-Bertrand Aristide was restored to the Haitian presidency under the protective umbrella of 23,000 American soldiers -- and at a cost of $3 billion to America's taxpayers -- Haiti remains a cauldron of barely contained violence. Despite this ill-advised intervention in domestic Haitian politics, democracy has not come to Haiti.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Instead, a one-party government controlled by Aristide's Lavalas party has shut out most of Haiti's genuine democrats. An Aristide puppet, Rene Preval, now rules Haiti as president. Economic reforms are stalled. There are no property rights. The judicial system does not function. An inexperienced and weak U.S.-trained Haitian police force has been unable to stop political killings, and is outnumbered by more than 6,000 armed members of rival left-wing gangs and right-wing demobilized soldiers who are responsible for growing urban and rural violence. Economic and political pressures to migrate from Haiti to the U.S. remain high. Finally, despite massive amounts of U.S. aid, about 70 percent of the people are illiterate, and 60 percent remain unemployed.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>President Preval: Aristide's Puppet.</b> Aristide would still be president of Haiti today if the Clinton Administration had not pressured him strongly in 1995 to step aside and allow a democratic transition of power to a new elected president. Aristide chose Rene Preval as his successor. On December 17, 1995, Preval, a lifelong friend and close supporter of Aristide, was elected President of Haiti.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

However, turnout was light as 21 Haitian political parties boycotted the elections to protest what some opposition leaders called Aristide's "use of the cloak of democracy to justify the installation of a dictatorship."<sup>1</sup>  More than 70 percent of the country's 3.7 million eligible voters stayed home, many of them intimidated by supporters of Aristide who systematically harassed and murdered his political opponents throughout 1995 in advance of the presidential elections.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some two dozen democratic Haitian leaders opposed to Aristide were murdered during 1995 while Aristide was still in power -- and while American troops were still stationed in large numbers on Haitian soil. Members of Aristide's hand-picked, U.S.-trained palace security unit in Port-au-Prince were implicated directly in many of these killings. Nonetheless, Aristide rejected private entreaties by U.S. Ambassador to Haiti William Swing, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, and other U.S. officials that he fire the suspects and order police investigations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Clinton: Unable to Stop the Killing.</b> On September 24, 1996, White House counsel Jack Quinn notified Representative Benjamin Gilman (R-NY), Chairman of the House Committee on International Relations, that President Clinton had invoked executive privilege to deny a request for key documents that might shed some light on whether the Administration has tried to conceal the fact that U.S. officials have known since early 1995 that "death squads" loyal to Aristide are operating out of the presidential palace.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Representative Gilman says that the Clinton Administration "has been aware since early 1995 that death-squads were operating under the direction of top security aides to President Aristide."<sup>2</sup>  Ambassador Swing reported the first killings in a cable to the State Department dated February 18, 1995; he also admitted in a September 1995 cable to the State Department that the Aristide government had stonewalled an FBI investigation of these political assassinations. In fact, not one of the Clinton Administration officials who testified before or briefed the House Committee on International Relations on ten separate occasions in 1995 ever revealed any information about these specific reports of palace death squads. The first such acknowledgment did not occur until public testimony before the committee on January 4, 1996.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

When Preval became president in 1996, Aristide's palace guards -- trained in Virginia by American security experts at a cost of more than $5.5 million to U.S. taxpayers -- remained at Preval's side. Moreover, killers assigned to the presidential security unit continued to gun down Aristide's opponents. The Clinton Administration, for example, has information implicating members of the palace guard in the August 20, 1996, political assassinations of the Reverend Antoine Leroy and Jacques Fleurival, leaders of the opposition Mobilization for National Development (MDN), in Port-au-Prince. Deputy Secretary of State Talbott, however, did not tell the House committee, in sworn written testimony submitted on September 9, 1996, that Haitians implicated in the 1995 political killings of Aristide's opponents remained in the Haitian palace guard.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

On September 13, 1996, the Clinton Administration rushed 22 armed bodyguards from the State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS) to Port-au-Prince to guard the life of President Preval. This group of American security officials was reinforced by 22 Navy and Air Force civilian guards and contractors, in addition to 70 Canadian soldiers who were deployed in a security perimeter surrounding the presidential palace. The day before the U.S. bodyguards arrived in Port-au-Prince, Preval transferred the head of the palace guard (Joseph Moise) and his deputy (Milien Romage) to other security functions within the Haitian government. As many as a dozen political assassins loyal to Aristide may still hold their jobs in the palace guard, working alongside U.S. government bodyguards assigned to protect Preval.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Haiti's rising violence and political instability reportedly have prodded Pentagon planners to revisit contingency plans for the possible reintroduction of U.S. troops. These troops would be in addition to the 160 U.S. soldiers of the 82nd Airborne Division that were deployed briefly in July 1996 after the Clinton Administration learned of credible assassination threats against Aristide and Preval, and 50 U.S. Marines that were sent to Port-au-Prince on August 20, 1996, following the commando-style executions of opposition leaders Leroy and Fleurival. Although Clinton Administration officials have explained the rotation of American combat troops through Haiti as "training exercises," Ambassador Swing acknowledged to Congress on September 27, 1996, that these small U.S. troop deployments are intended to augment security and keep the lid on Haiti.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Stuck in Haiti.</b> Prominent Members of Congress suspect that the Clinton Administration is misleading both Congress and the American people about Haiti. Congressional efforts to overcome the Administration's stonewalling on Haiti should be intensified. In an October 22, 1996, press release issued by the House International Relations Committee, Representative Gilman said that "Enough evidence exists to justify a further inquiry into the possible existence of a conspiracy to withhold this information from Congress."<sup>3</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The House and Senate should challenge President Clinton's use of executive privilege to hide the failure of Operation Restore Democracy. They can do this by holding hearings on Haiti and by compelling the appearance -- as witnesses under oath -- of top Administration officials involved in Haiti policy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If the Administration balks at disclosing the truth about Haiti, Congress should take steps to block all financial aid to Haiti from the Agency for International Development (AID) and multilateral lenders such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Inter-American Development Bank. Congress also should block further U.S. funding for the Canadian-led U.N. security mission in Haiti and compel the withdrawal of all remaining U.S. troops and other American security officials from Haiti. Finally, the U.S. should make it clear to Haiti's government and people that all Haitian immigrants caught trying to enter America illegally will be repatriated immediately and without appeal.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress needs to get to the bottom of what is going on in Haiti. U.S. personnel in Haiti are in danger of becoming not guarantors of democracy, but a palace guard for a corrupt and bloody regime.

<CENTER>by Malcolm Wallop</CENTER>
<P>
Washington has taken such a beating in recent decades
because the citizens of this great country do not believe that
the Congress or the White House know the value of a tax dollar.
 Oh, they say they do.  It is a great sound bite on the campaign
trail.  The new freshman class in Congress seems to understand.
 They have held the leadership's feet to the fire through the
entire budget debate.  We can only hope that the freshman stay
vigilant, do not get seduced by the trappings of Washington, and
maintain a determination to keep sacred the value of the tax dollar.
<P>
The Clinton Administration could stand to take a
few lessons from the Republican House freshmen.  It is not a stretch
to say that Bill Clinton's &quot;ethic&quot;-that the government
is the nursemaid of all citizens-has been wholeheartedly embraced
by all presidential and political appointees.  It is remarkable
to what a broad extent that ethic has been transformed into government
policy.
<P>
Case in point.  The Clinton Administration's premise:
Cigarette smoke is bad for your health.  The Clinton Administration's
answer?  Destroy the tobacco industry with taxpayer funds and
protect us from ourselves.
<P>
The issue of tobacco and its effects on our health
is a legitimate issue, but the government's vendetta singling
out an industry is quite another.  I am not just talking about
the FDA rule to limit the tobacco industry's First Amendment rights.
 The proposed FDA rule is a dangerous course that Bill Clinton
willingly charts. He and his ilk prefer politics to the Constitution.
 The First Amendment is a simple nuisance, the Constitution is
an impediment to efficient government.
<P>
We Americans have become immune to our lawmakers
chipping away at our Constitutional rights.  We no longer lash
out when they whittle away at more of our freedoms.  When Americans
do lash out at their government, they are dismissed as radicals,
anarchists, militia members, or simply, the &quot;angry block.&quot;
 Nonetheless, when these attacks on our personal freedoms are
done with taxpayers money, all Americans must stand up and take
notice.
<P>
Whether you like smoking or not, your money is being
used to destroy the American tobacco industry.  If you think this
is all right, just think of this. Do you enjoy a nice thick steak
on occasion?  How about a cold beer during a hot summer day or
a nice glass of wine during an elegant meal?  I do and, in fact,
I occasionally enjoy a cigar.
<P>
Is it a stretch to think that this government could
attack other American industries such as the meat industry or
the alcohol industry.  On September 19, 1995, approximately 40
anti-drinking organizations wrote to President Clinton asking
for the FDA rule be applied to cover the sale of alcohol, as well.
 And that is how it begins.
<P>
Once the first spark hits, all gasoline burns.  The
Clinton Administration jumps into its &quot;nanny&quot; role and
begins spending taxpayer dollars to &quot;protect&quot; us all
from &quot;evils&quot; of their choosing.
<P>
Just this year, the National Cancer Institute awarded
a grant of $606,000 to Stanton Glantz, Ph.D. to &quot;study&quot;
tobacco industry political contributions and their effect on legislative
policy in California.  The National Cancer Institute is a scientific
body not a political research firm.  In what scientific realm
does the study of political contributions fall?  Furthermore,
could NCI find anyone more biased than anti-smoking crusader Glantz?
 Speaking to a  conference in April of 1990, Dr. Glantz remarked,
&quot;We are on a roll and the bastards [tobacco industry] are
on the run and I urge you to keep chasing them.  In researching
scientific data, one would assume that credible research comes
from a totally objective approach to a given project.  Giving
Dr. Glantz a grant to study the tobacco industry is akin to the
EEOC giving Mark Furman a grant to study race relations.
<P>
Another example of President Clinton's efforts to
kill the tobacco industry is a $950,000 grant to Northeastern
University to, in the words of professor Richard Daynard, principle
investigator, &quot;develop strategies to thwart the bullying
tactics of the tobacco industry.&quot;  By the way, Professor
Daynard has been an advocate of tobacco control policies since
the mid-70's.  I would say that qualifies him as an &quot;objective&quot;
researcher.  Of course, we are talking about the Clinton Administration
where scientific data is less relevant than the point they're
after.
<P>
These two absurd grants simply scratch the surface.
 If that $606,000 and that $950,000 of taxpayers money can be
used to investigate the tobacco industry, look out, your industry
could very well be next.  There is no constitutional basis or
authority for their assault.  Again, it is the battle between
those who believe in big government and those whose preference
is limited government.  It is the battle between those who believe
that one tax dollar is theirs to spend in any way and those who
would like that tax dollar returned to the taxpayer.
<P>
To smokers or those who detest smoking, funding these
federal projects to promote a political motive is unethical. 
Moreover, funding these projects to single out and destroy a particular
industry is near criminal.
<P>
While the President goes after the tobacco industry
with a vengeance, his administration happily uses other taxpayer
dollars to benefit his political friends.  Between July of 1993
and June of 1994, the Clinton Administration handed the AFL-CIO
over $2 million, the National Education Association $385,000,
the Teamsters over $3.5 million.  What did Democrats get in return
from the happy Unions?  From 1988 to 1993, Unions gave Democrat
House Members $57 million to $4.7 for Republicans.  In that same
time span, Unions gave Democrat Senate candidates $15 million
to $1.5 million for Republicans.  In 1994, the Democratic National
Committee received $835,000 from Unions and the Republican National
Committee received, are you ready?-$0.
<P>
Here it is in a nutshell.  Spend lavishly to kill
an industry in free market America and then turn around to give
taxpayer money to your friends.  Bill Clinton is truly amazing.
 He finds nothing wrong with this scenario.
<P>
Every single tax dollar begins as the fruits of someone's
labor.  Using taxpayer money to destroy an industry or help a
political friend is wrong and Bill Clinton, had he any conviction,
would agree.

<H2>Avoid Political Extinction with A New Shade of Green</H2></FONT>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
The modern environmental movement evolved from the conservation movement of the turn of the century.  We can be grateful for the many notable successes of the early conservationists.  They alerted America to serious problems like "cut and run" timber harvesting, overgrazing government lands, and vanishing game.  However they also gave us a legacy to overcome.  Here's how it evolved.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
After the deprivations of the Great Depression and World War II, Americans had 25 years of material success.  Environmental sensitivity posed few constraints on the economic boom.  In the economic growth, environmental costs went largely unaccounted for.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
But as the Americans prospered, gaining in education and affluence, there was an environmental awakening. Rachel Carson's <CITE>Slient Spring</CITE> and the first Earth Day in 1970 opened niches for politicians.  They responded to the nation's growing concern over environmental quality with command-and-control legislation.  Environmental goals implied federal management, political mandates, and stringent regulations. The costs of legislation like the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act were high but so were the benefits.  The Cuyahoga River is no longer flammable and airborne lead dropped 98 percent.
</P><IMG ALIGN="Right" SRC="/free/Images/Bandwagon.gif" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=270 ALT="Al Gore's Bandwagon">
<P><FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><B>Environmentalism Today</B></FONT><BR>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>Today, environmentalism is in crisis.  Many early environmentalists came out of the radical movements of the late 1960s.  They were largely innocent of basic economic principles, hostile to business and the market process, and highly optimistic regarding the potential of federal command-and-control regulation.  Some, especially the deep ecologists, advocated a halt to economic progress and a return to simpler, more primal living.  This approach, however romantic, has important economic, ecological, social, and ethical flaws.
</P>

<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
As the bureaucratic pathologies of Progressive-Era agencies like the Forest Service and modern agencies like the EPA multiplied, violations of efficiency and liberty became increasingly obvious.  The "wise use" movement succeeded the Sagebrush Rebellion as rural frustration with federal arrogance mounted.  </P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Again, politicians responded.  Helen Chenoweth (R-ID), Don Young (R-AK), and others tried scaling back federal environmental oversight.  But the Republican position on the environment is opportunistic and ultimately self-defeating. Republicans promise to improve the education and prosperity of Americans.  What Republicans consistently neglect, however, is that environmental sensitivity increases with wealth and education.  </P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Don Coursey, dean of the <A HREF="http://www.spc.uchicago.edu/orgs/gspps/">Harris School of Public Policy</A> at the University of Chicago, demonstrates that environmental quality is like BMWs:  as income increases 1 percent, demand for environmental quality increases 2.5 percent.  Simply put:  the affluent and well-educated demand environmental quality
</P>

<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Newt Gingrich acknowledges this reality by saying, "I don't think any party can be a sustainable majority that ignores or rejects its environmental responsibilities."  So he shouldn't be surprised if Republicans lose the majority.  The word "environment" doesn't appear in the Contract with America.  I just recevied a fund-raising letter from the <A HREF="http://www.rnc.org">Republican National Committee</A> which named dozens of issues but didn't even mention the environment. 
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Republicans consistently neglect positive environmental reform and cave in to special interests which promote extractive industries and regional subsidies.  Yet well-off, well-educated voters increasingly say, "But Newt, we love the environment!"  Republicans are taking political heat for giving their environmental portfolio to wise-use sympathizers like Young and Chenoweth.  Many Republicans stay home or even defect to the Democrats who support the traditional environmental agenda.  Their own party gives them no comfortable niche.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
In August, environmentalist and conservationist groups with 20 million members met to voice displeasure with the Republican environmental platform. One participating group, <A HREF="http://www.tu.org/trout/">Trout Unlimited</A>, makes the links between environmentalism, education, and prosperity clear.  The average TU member has an income of $105,000, and 40% of their members have a master's, law, M.D, or Ph.D degree.  Their membership is "conservative on almost every issue apart from the environment," according to TU's communications director Peter Rafle. 
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN="Left" SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Instead of appealing to this important and growing constituency, Republicans offered ethanol subsidies, salvage logging, and lax efforts to preserve endangered species.  But as Americans become wealthier and wiser they abhor such policies.  Republican Party strategists appear dim-witted or cowardly.  Is exploitation their only alternative to command-and-control, Al Gore statism?
</P><IMG ALIGN="Left" SRC="/free/Images/Briefcase.gif" WIDTH=216 HEIGHT=171>
<P><FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><B>A New Shade of Green</B></FONT><BR>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>A different shade of green respects ecology, liberty, and prosperity.  Rather than pit the environment against the economy, it harmonizes complementary values.  This evolving environmental vision recognizes the problems inherent to bureaucracies and stresses the importance of local knowledge, incentives, and entrepreneurial innovation.  It rejects government as an engine of plunder while respecting links between property rights and stewardship.  
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
This new shade of green is evolving.  Environmental groups like <A HREF="http://www.tnc.org">The Nature Conservancy</A>, <A HREF="http://www.tu.org/trout/">Trout Unlimited</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.defenders.org">Defenders of Wildlife </A> have had remarkable successes with their voluntary conservation programs.  Firms like <A HREF="http://www.amoco.com">Amoco</A>, Coors, and Port Blakely Tree Farms are creating new value by protecting the environment and improving the bottom line.  And even some government programs are beginning to use market processes to better coordinate management of public lands.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
If the learning curves of Republicans don't slope upward, that species of elephant may go extinct.  And if Al Gore's statist platform doesn't adapt as well, in the election of 2000, his earth will be way out of balance.  There is a vacant niche for political entrepreneurs who appeal to well-educated, wealthier, greener Americans.  Candidates who can't find it deserve to fail come November.
</P>
<FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><H2>Clinton's "Green Decrees":  Easy Answers Postpone Reform</H2></FONT>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Election politics brought a wave of "green decrees" from Washington.  President Clinton has locked in the support of national environmental groups by resolving environmental controversies by executive order.
</P><P><FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><B>Utah Monument</B></FONT><BR><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
Most recently, Clinton declared 1.7 million acres of southern Utah (seven times larger than Mount Rainier National Park) a national monument, using authority granted under the 1906 Antiquities Act.  With a stroke of a pen, Clinton resolved a bitter, highly polarized debate between environmentalists, who want to see 5.7 million acres declared "wilderness areas" off limits to any development, and locals, who believe the land is so special because they've been stewarding it for 150 years.  There were no Utah officials present at the signing that Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) described as "the mother of all land grabs."  They were not consulted on the matter; the locals and the public were the last to know.  Now Utahns are working fervently to thwart the monument's existence and operation.</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>Snubbing Utahns is a small price for Clinton to pay for the support of the environmental groups; he finished third, behind Ross Perot, in Utah in 1992.  If the monument survives legal challenge, tourism will replace coal jobs.  Locals will guide buses, ATVs, and campers into the monument, rather than drive coal out.</P><IMG ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="/free/Images/Owl.gif" WIDTH=357 HEIGHT=156 ALT="Spotted Owl">
<P><FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><B>Headwaters Forest</B></FONT><BR> 
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>A week earlier, the Administration brokered a halt to the logging in the northern California Headwaters Forest.  Headwaters holds the largest remaining old-growth redwood stand on private property.  As hundreds of protestors and a few celebrities, including pop singer Bonnie Raitt and Don Henley of the Eagles, were arrested, federal officials secretly engineered a tentative agreement with Pacific Lumber to halt the logging in exchange for other government lands and cash payments.  Clinton exploited yet another environmental crisis.  If the tenuous agreement stands, the federal and California governments can expect to spend $350 million to forge a ceasefire in Headwaters.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><B>New World Mine</B></FONT><BR>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>Yellowstone's New World Mine exemplifies Clinton using a green decree to make messy environmental conflicts disappear.  The dispute involved Crown Butte Mines Inc., environmentalists, the Park Service, the Forest Service, locals, and even the United Nations.  
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>In exchange for $65 million in federal lands, Crown Butte forfeits (if the deal goes through) the mineral rights on their land obtained under the Mining Law of 1872.  Voila!  The beast is vanquished.  Clinton can return to Yellowstone, having triumphantly made the dirty mine go away.  
</P>
<P>Until the next gold mine.  Or the next coal mine.  Or the next timber stand.  
</P><IMG ALIGN="Right" SRC="/free/Images/Scape.gif" WIDTH=328 HEIGHT=241 ALT="Landscape">
<P><FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><B>Green Decrees as Quick Fixes</B></FONT><BR>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>Clinton's green decrees are quick fixes, often at the great expense of other natural treasures and local communities.  For example, as the New World Mine controversy so beautifully illustrates, the Mining Law of 1872 is long overdue for reform.  The myopic 1872 law provides for mineral deposits on federal lands to be turned into commodities like gold and copper, while ignoring other values:  undeveloped wilderness, undisturbed watersheds, and unscarred land.  Although this made sense in the Civil War era, relative values have drastically changed with increased education, scientific knowledge, and affluence.  
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
A truly courageous president would call for fundamental reform.  He would advocate systems that provide incentives to conserve, to account for downstream pollution, and to foster responsible use of the land.  </P>
<P><FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><B>An Alternative</B></FONT><BR>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>Here's an idea for some political entrepreneur:  Propose a system that replicates for environmental values what the 1872 Law does for minerals.  It would give individuals opportunities to invest in and protect the land for its amenity and ecological features, like wilderness, biodiversity, and recreation.  Public, nonprofit organizations and trusts could stake a "claim" on federal lands, like BLM districts in Utah, and attempt to produce a "mother lode" of environmental quality.  Like mining claims, these would be contingent on "proving up" the environmental qualities of the land.  This way the claimholders would have to be prepared to meet the public challenges of competing users.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>
This sort of change would dramatically alter the nature of the environmental debate in the West.  In addition to reforming outdated legislation, it would move environmentalists from the Beltway to the back country.  No longer would green decrees come from the White House.  Federal authority would serve in its proper role of monitoring and enforcement, not opportunistic rule-setting on an ad hoc basis.
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="3A3ABD"><B>Politics Brings Gridlock, Conflict</B></FONT><BR>
<IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>Clinton's green decrees are surprisingly effective election politics.  This strategy gets good press because it perpetuates the polarization and gridlocks real reform.  But this short-sightedness is the predictable consequence of political allocation.  Voters may get tired of crisis management of popular areas.  If so, some candidates will advocate genuine reform and be rewarded by voters for honestly analyzing the underlying causes of environmental problems.
</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=Left SRC="/free/Images/0.gif" WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=0>There is another problem with Clinton's tactics.  Using executive fiat to make others pay for something you want generates perverse consequences and intractable conflicts.  The counterproductivity of green decrees is glaring in Utah's Kane County.  The county is now backing out of an agreement to release endangered California condors into the region.  After the green decree, county attorney Colin Winchester warns, "We're going to be a whole lot less cooperative with the federal government."</P></TABLE>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	A powerful grass-roots movement is slowly gathering force that may transform the politics of American education. Its human face is not white but black; its resources few but its determination strong. And its goal is freedom. Although most black political leaders still actively oppose vouchers and charter schools, their constituents are growing increasingly angry at the public schools' disastrous record of teaching black children. As a result, black parents, pastors, local officials, and civil-rights leaders are beginning to embrace school vouchers, charter schools, and other reforms that offer alternatives to dismal public schools. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	These African Americans believe that academic achievement is the key to their economic independence. They want schools that involve them in their children's education while imposing high standards and strict discipline, and they reject the notion that poverty somehow renders parents less interested in their children's academic well-being. As their numbers swell, teachers unions will find it increasingly difficult to hold back reforms that offer black children a better chance.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This new movement is already spreading throughout the country. In Cleveland, African Americans like councilwoman Fannie Lewis, school principals Lydia Harris and Sister Hasina Renee, and school-board member Genevieve Mitchell led the fight for a new state law that provides vouchers this fall for 2,000 low-income children. Lewis, Harris, Renee, and Mitchell vigorously supported Republican governor George Voinovich as he moved his voucher proposal through the state legislature. Lewis recruited 300 citizens in her neighborhood of Hough, the site of race riots in 1968, to travel to Columbus to lobby for the scholarship program. Last fall, when the governor's staff organized a press conference to announce the signing of the bill, jubilant black students and their parents packed the hallways and aisles.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In fact, support for vouchers in Cleveland was so strong that nearly 6,300 students, almost all of them black, applied for only 2,000 slots, which were filled by lottery. By mid-September of this year, 1,410 of the students had enrolled in a religious school. Councilwoman Lewis, a mother and 46-year Cleveland resident, attributes this flight to public schools' dismal educational record and indifference to parents. "The quality of public schools in Hough is poor," she says. "The roofs leak and the schools sometimes lack books, chairs, and other materials. Of the more than $7,000 spent on each child in the Cleveland public schools, only a fraction goes to classroom education." Thanks to vouchers, this fall Lewis was able to open her own community school, the Hough-Brooks Academy for Higher Learning -- a nonsectarian school run by a community board with a curriculum emphasizing the arts and cultural awareness. Lewis hopes this will "force school officials to pay more attention to parents' concerns and to provide safer and better schools." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In Milwaukee, as Dan McGroarty has shown in his new book, <i>Break These Chains</i>, blacks have been the principal supporters of two Wisconsin voucher programs. "The battle for Parental Choice," McGroarty writes, "began in the church basements and meeting halls of Milwaukee's Near North Side," a poor neighborhood where only 48 percent of adults hold a job. "From the start, the Milwaukee proponents' language was appropriated from the civil-rights movement. Their rhetoric was more redolent of Martin Luther King Jr. than the free-market pronouncements favored by conservative voucher proponents."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The engineer of Milwaukee's first voucher plan, which was limited to nonsectarian schools, was Annette "Polly" Williams, a black Democratic state representative from the Near North Side. Having fought the school system a dozen years earlier for busing her daughter to a bad public school, Williams was familiar with the Milwaukee education establishment's indifference to the needs of low-income black families. "The system is the system. It doesn't care. It doesn't feel," Williams told McGroarty. "The way I saw it, [it] is preparing our children for slavery. Look at the situation: Drop out by 10th grade, get into the street life. When you should be walking across the stage getting a diploma, you're standing in front of a judge wearing chains." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Committed to breaking up the system for the sake of the young black children in her community, Williams gradually mobilized her army of mothers and grandmothers, most of whom were on welfare, and all of whom were determined to "do right by their children." Aware of her army's powerful impact on lawmakers, she convinced the chairman of the state assembly's urban-education committee to hold a public hearing on her school-choice plan on the morning of February 23, 1990. The three-hour-long hearing, which attracted 200 low-income minority parents and children, prompted the committee to approve her proposal. Soon thereafter, it passed the assembly and the senate and was signed into law by Republican governor Tommy Thompson. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Throughout the endeavor, only one local newspaper captured Williams's crusade in a concise and accurate way: <i>Community Journal</i>, whose editor, Mikel Holt, is yet another fan of school choice. As for Milwaukee's mainstream dailies, McGroarty notes, "they attacked Williams repeatedly. One went as far as portraying her in a cartoon as a stick-up artist pointing a pistol at a public-school teacher." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Having survived a grueling round of constitutional scrutiny, the program generated so much support that in September 1994, 750 mostly low-income blacks rallied for its expansion. This time, a new generation of African-American educators joined Williams in the battle. They included Zakiya Courtney, then principal of the Urban Day School and now the director of a grass-roots group called Parents for School Choice; Brother Bob Smith, the principal of the outstanding inner-city school Messmer High; and Howard Fuller, then superintendent of Milwaukee public schools. Last year, the school board and the teachers unions mailed 3,000 videotapes attacking Fuller's stance on choice, calling it an attempt to scale back or completely cut educational programs. The unions succeeded in establishing an anti-reform majority on the board of education, which prompted Fuller's resignation.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But according to a February 1995 report by the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, 95 percent of African Americans polled in Milwaukee support school choice, and 70 percent believe that students in private and religious schools get a better education than students in the Milwaukee public schools. Finally ceding to their constituents' demands, the Wisconsin legislature last year expanded the program to include religious schools, increased the number of vouchers from 1,500 to 15,000, and eliminated restrictions on the number of choice students in participating schools. In response, voucher opponents immediately and successfully sought an injunction from the courts and have, so far, blocked the plan's implementation. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The parents, however, are equally determined. In February 1996, for instance, Courtney filled nine buses with 500 mostly black parents and children to attend a rally at the capitol, in Madison. There they voiced their enthusiasm for the newly enacted plan, which was being challenged in the Wisconsin Supreme Court. After a tie vote, the court sent the case back to trial court, where Dane County Circuit Judge Paul Higginbotham refused to lift the injunction blocking religious schools' participation in the program. "The state cannot do indirectly what it can't do directly," he said.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Higginbotham did allow the state to issue up to 15,000 vouchers for private nonreligious schools. But Courtney and Milwaukee's parents eagerly await the day the court will grant them complete authority over the upbringing of their children -- including the freedom to send them to a religious school. Meanwhile, 4,500 low-income Milwaukee students are going to religious schools this year with privately financed vouchers -- thanks to the generosity of the Bradley Foundation and 1,040 private donors who gave more than $4 million to help the students hurt by Higginbotham's decision.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In Florida, T. Willard Fair, the president and chief executive officer of the liberal Urban League of Miami, and the Reverend R.B. Holmes, a black Baptist pastor from Tallahassee, are the principal supporters of a new charter school law enacted in April. The Florida plan allows any creative educator to open a school, free of the red tape that binds most public schools (such as  teacher certification and state-imposed standards). Fair formed a partnership with Jeb Bush, the conservative Republican candidate for governor in 1994, to advance the legislation. Fair described public schools as "too regulated, entrenched in bureaucracy, with overcrowded classrooms, out-of-control children, and teachers who are not held accountable due to too much union interference." And so he created Florida's first charter school, whose student body is almost entirely low-income and African-American.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Similarly, Holmes opened the C.K. Steele-Leroy Collins charter middle school, with a student body that is 75 percent black. His school is modeled after a Christian academy he created five years ago, which he describes as a school that "all people, [whether] black, white, rich, or poor want to send their kids to." To Holmes, charter schools mean "freedom to teach reading, writing, arithmetic, respect, responsibility, and entrepreneurship all in one--without the bureaucratic strings attached." A 1995 survey by the Foundation for Florida's Future found that Florida's black citizens supported school choice and charter schools by 68 percent and 63 percent, respectively.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In California, voucher supporters include Anyam Palmer, the principal of the Afrocentric Marcus Garvey School in South Central Los Angeles, who views "the present school system [as] the vehicle that puts us on welfare, in prison, and leaves us illiterate. . . . School choice is the only way out of this vicious cycle." "Public education is not working for most minority citizens in the inner city," says Bishop George D. McKinney Jr. of San Diego, who has set up a school at St. Stephen's Church of God in Christ. Testifying for vouchers last year before the House Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth, and Families,  McKinney faulted public schools for "low expectations . . . of minority students" and "the systematic tracking of minority students toward nonacademic programs." A recent survey of South Central's residents by the Center for the Study of Popular Culture found that 77 percent of minorities supported vouchers. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Californians may not win the right to vouchers in the near future, but an innovative charter-school law, passed in 1992, offers blacks a close alternative. According to the Hudson Institute, the California plan gives "charter petitioners the right to seek significant autonomy from local board control [and provides] a blanket waiver from most state laws and regulations." Jonathan Williams, the black principal of the Accelerated School, in South Central Los Angeles, says that a charter-school system offers "more freedom, choice, and responsibility." Accelerated's student body comprises 50 percent blacks and 50 percent Hispanics; a majority of students belong to low or low-moderate income groups.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Williams believes charter schools are the solution to the educational crisis. "With charters you can keep the system public and free, while instilling stronger accountability," he contends. Without union pressure and  handouts, "I feel like a professional instead of a wage earner." Williams's school sits in a gang-infested neighborhood. "It is not unusual for us to hear gun fights, and notice the residues of drug abuse around the school grounds," he says. But with a low student-to-teacher ratio, lots of parental involvement, and zero tolerance toward violence and drugs, Williams avoids the problems that incapacitate many public schools every year. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In Michigan, the TEACH Michigan Education Fund reports that black educators have launched one out of every three Michigan charter schools. According to Bryan Taylor, the fund's executive director, "5,000 applicants applied for 330 spots when the first charter school came to Detroit; African-American educators led most of them." In Michigan, where charter schools are called "public-school academies," the law allows any individual or group to develop a charter and to seek sponsorship from a variety of entities such as the board of a state public university. The program's key supporters include black leaders like the Reverend Ned Adams Jr., an official of the Council of Baptist Pastors, which assists member churches in Detroit interested in starting charter schools; and Larry Patrick, the former president of the Detroit Board of Education and an avid advocate "for parents having as many choices as possible for the education of their children."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another black charter-school fan is Freya Rivers. The frustrated former Lansing public-school teacher now serves as district superintendent, full-time language-arts teacher, and part-time janitor and nurse. Her school, the Sanfoka Shule charter school in Lansing, targets at-risk elementary school students. In the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> earlier this year, she said, "I have two students who were [in special education in traditional Lansing public schools]. They couldn't even write their names or recognize any words. . . . I use the same methods to teach them that I use with the other students. Now both of them are writing sentences." In fact, 85 percent of the first- and second-graders Sanfoka received from Lansing public schools were illiterate; now all are able to read.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In Texas, ardent African-American voucher promoters include Democratic state representative Glenn Lewis, the former general counsel for the Tarrant County chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and his liberal legislative colleague Ron Wilson. Fueled by support from a growing number of black churches, including the Reverend Raymond Bryant's Union Center African Methodist Episcopal Church, in Conroe, the leaders foresee a strong chance to enact school choice in their state next year. A 1995 Texas Poll showed black support for vouchers at 59 percent, and a growing number of church groups, ministers, and community groups also believe vouchers are the next step. Says Michael Williams, a black conservative and former assistant education secretary in the Bush administration, "The [African-American] community looks to choice as the vehicle to reclaim control over the learning of the next generation of African-American scholars and leaders." Allan Parker, the president of the Texas Justice Foundation, whose group has convened a citizens' task force to investigate why Texas minority students fare worse than whites on the state's achievement tests, works closely with these leaders in promoting school choice.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	All of these low-income parents and community leaders seek the same opportunities for their children that middle- and upper-income black parents enjoy. "I don't think African-American parents are any different than other parents," says Michigan's Larry Patrick. "All they want is quality education for their children. Wealthy parents, like the president, can make this choice; poor ones cannot. . . . Most African-American leaders [seem to] practice choice in their own lives and support [it] on a personal level." Denis Doyle, a senior fellow with The Heritage Foundation, notes that black teachers are twice as likely as other black parents to send their children to a private school, and 30 percent of Congressional Black Caucus members with children send their children to private schools. Meanwhile, only 4 percent of blacks possess the means to exercise this option. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Perhaps this is why a poll by the left-leaning Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies in April 1996 reveals that African Americans favor school choice more strongly than the general population. Support registers highest among women (51 percent), parents (61 percent), and younger African Americans (64 percent among 18- to 25-year-olds, 61 percent among 26- to 35-year-olds). These numbers are particularly telling when you consider that only 18 percent of blacks support the devolving of power from the federal government to the state and local levels. Says Brian Jones, the president of the Center for New Black Leadership, they reflect "a stalwart trend towards reclaiming the power of parents." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	With respect to charter schools, the Hudson Institute's Educational Excellence Network recently reported similar positive conclusions. The report finds a high level of satisfaction with charter schools among most students, and cites the schools' clear academic expectations, safety, individualized instruction, committed teachers, and familial atmosphere. Hudson found that 63 percent of the students attending charter schools nationwide belong to a racial minority -- including 19 percent who are African-American--and that 55 percent are poor.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What drives African Americans toward choice and charter schools? Standards, discipline, and parental involvement are the three core reasons.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Joyce Watkins, a resident of Chicago's West Side and a mother of seven, wants higher academic standards and eagerly hopes her city will adopt some form of school choice soon. "Where I'm from," she says, "public education offers leftovers. It means getting lost in the cracks." What frustrates Watkins the most is public-school teachers' lack of interest in her children's academic achievement. "They come home without homework sometimes," she laments. "The quality of education is really low. . . . I often wonder if teachers and school counselors even know my children's names, since they are too busy disciplining unruly students." Watkins would prefer sending her children to Providence St. Mel, a Catholic school in her neighborhood, even though she belongs to a different Christian denomination. "If they gave us more choices, more kids would go to school, stay in school, and graduate to college. . . . You would also see the crime rate go down because the kids would be in class, not on the streets. . . . That's where the opportunity lies." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Gloria Grayson, a mother in Milwaukee whose two daughters now attend a private school, abhors the absence of strict disciplinary guidelines in public schools. "They were not learning. Classes were large and pupil-to-teacher ratios were high," she says. "The children were afraid and could not concentrate because they had to deal with their undisciplined peers rather than listen and learn in class. Teachers were not able or did not try to maintain adequate control over their classes. As a result, classes progressed slowly. Teachers and administrators had nothing but excuses for the poor education my children were receiving. The . . . schools are filled with drugs and violence. They graduate drug dealers. At best, children leave those schools not with a diploma, but with battle scars." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Grayson and Watkins join other parents and educators in blaming the education system's lack of interest in their concerns. After all, as Cleveland councilwoman Fannie Lewis notes, "parents have little influence over education policy. The school board often will go into executive session to shut out community attendance at its meetings." Texas legislator Glenn Lewis, whose constituents show their anger by picketing outside school-board meetings, concurs. He considers choice a means to provide parents with more leverage over the school boards and "an opportunity to improve public schools . . . because so long as they are guaranteed our parents' dollars, they have no incentives to listen." According to a poll by the Center for Education Reform, 61 percent of blacks say "the quality of their public school could be improved a great deal," compared with 44 percent of the general population.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	To find those key ingredients of a good education, black parents often gravitate towards religious education. As Fannie Lewis observes, "in most instances [the parents'] decisions have nothing to do with religion. They want their children in a safe environment with strong disciplinary standards where they can get a good education." Sectarian schools constitute 85 percent of all private schools; of that share, more than half are Catholic. Others include religious schools run by Baptists, Lutherans, Seventh-Day Adventists, and Muslims. These schools, especially in urban areas, enroll growing numbers of ethnic minority students, according to the National Catholic Educational Association (NCEA). NCEA also reports that in the last 20 years, the minority percentages have more than doubled in all Catholic schools, from 10.8 percent in 1970-71 to 23.5 percent in 1992-93. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Bob Smith, the veteran superintendent of Milwaukee's Messmer High School, a Catholic school, attests to these facts. "Catholic schools have been known for high-quality education since the black migration from the South. For many years, next to public schools, they were the only safe haven for blacks in the segregation era." He proudly cites the St. Benedict the Moor School, known today as the Urban Day School, as an example. The black all-male boarding school boasts a number of high-profile alumni, including Dizzy Gillespie, the jazz musician; Harold Washington, the first black mayor of Chicago; and Redd Foxx, the comedian and television star. Catholic schools are popular with parents, Smith says, because they are "safe havens against drugs, violence, and uncaring teachers."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A forthcoming study in the <i>Journal of Labor Economics</i> supports the believers in religious schooling by revealing that those most likely to benefit from a Catholic-school education are minorities, many of whom are not Catholic, who attend big-city schools. The paper's author, University of Chicago economist Derek Neal, observes that "in the urban minority sample, Catholic schooling dramatically increases the probability of high school graduation . . . [and increases] college graduation rates." According to Neal, that translates into future wage gains. Among the study's sample of urban blacks and Hispanics, the probability of graduating from high school rises from 62 percent to at least 88 percent when the public-school students are placed in a Catholic secondary school. "For urban whites," he continues, "the effects are . . . always smaller in magnitude. In fact, [their] estimated wage gain from Catholic schooling is not statistically different." Neal concludes that "urban minority students benefit most from access to Catholic schools because their local public-school alternatives are poor."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Perhaps this explains why New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani recently urged educators to use the city's Catholic schools as a "guide" to reforms. He noted in a <i>Wall Street Journal</i> article in 1995 that the city's Catholic and public schools enroll about the same proportion of students with multiple risk factors, but that Catholic schools have a dropout rate of 0.1 percent, compared with 18 percent in the public schools. Giuliani also observed that, despite popular belief, Catholic schools have expulsion rates of only 2 percent. The mayor has recently proposed a measure allowing students performing in the bottom 5 percent to attend religious schools.<p><table width="170" align="right" cellpadding="3">

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Furthermore, a recent report by Jay Greene of the University of Houston and Paul Peterson of Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government fortifies the supporters of choice. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that students participating in the Milwaukee choice experiment, 70 percent of whom are African American, made major academic improvements compared with a control group in public schools. In fact, after three years, the gap between the test scores of whites and minorities narrowed by 33 to 50 percent.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Despite the growing black support for vouchers, the civil-rights establishment and most black leaders in Congress and state legislatures remain steadfastly opposed. Their explanations range from fears of losing their best students to private schools (so-called creaming) and segregation to concerns that private schools will soak up public funds. Jessica Butler, a spokesperson for the Greater Harrisburg branch of the NAACP, exclaims "tuition vouchers are just the latest scheme for abandoning our public schools." Michael Myers, the president and executive director of the New York Civil Rights Coalition, says, "School choice is a gimmick. There is no such thing as school choice for children who don't have a choice," since private schools get to select the types of students they like.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Militant opposition to choice may also stem from the influence of large, monied teachers unions, which see any choice outside the public schools as a threat to their monopoly. Teachers unions adamantly opposed a small school-choice plan tagged to Congress's District of Columbia appropriations bill last fall. After it passed overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives, the plan died in the Senate, despite the support of local leaders like Franklin Smith, the city's schools superintendent, and Mayor Marion Barry. Throughout the proceedings, District of Columbia delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton and the Congressional Black Caucus sided with the unions and refused to endorse school choice for the city's neediest children. Explaining her reasons for opposing the modest school choice proposal, Norton told the <i>Washington Post</i> on November 3, 1995, "It's not about money, it's about the strong feeling in the District that District schools are where most of the children are going to be, so we need to spend money fixing up our schools." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"School choice creams the public schools of their best students, and robs them of their much needed funds for educating the needy kids left behind," explains Daniel E. Katz, legal counsel for the Washington office of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). "Choice also raises the specter of segregation." But as Cleveland's Lydia Harris, principal of one of the nation's best private schools, can attest, this description is inaccurate. In <i>World</i> magazine, she recently said, "There's no cream on my crop until we put it there. It's a myth that we take discipline problems and throw them out of school. It's the other way around. I get the kids the public schools can't handle." And she does all this at a per-pupil cost one-seventh that of Cleveland public schools.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"Choice is just a subterfuge for segregation, like it was in the South," says Felmers Chaney, the head of the Milwaukee NAACP, which joined the lawsuit against the initial Milwaukee school-choice plan as lead plaintiff. "Taken as a whole, expanded [school choice] will deny African Americans equal educational opportunity," asserted Chaney in a recent brief against the expanded Milwaukee school-choice plan. To many of its black critics, the NAACP seems more concerned with integration than with quality education for black children. Even so, opponents of vouchers need only examine the work of the late James Coleman, of the University of Chicago, which shows not only that poor black youngsters fare better in religious schools than in public schools, but also that a child is more likely to attend school with a child of another race in the private sector than in the public sector. As for the Milwaukee plan, the NAACP ought to take a look at the high level of integration in Milwaukee private schools in comparison to its public schools.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Some critics argue that the education establishment opposes school choice for a very basic reason: self-preservation. "Perhaps one of the strongest reasons why the civil-rights establishment opposes choice is economic," says Brian Jones. "They strongly feel that competition and privatization will leave them out in the cold." Public schools employ a large portion of the African-American professional community; some of them may view school choice and charter schools as programs designed to rob them of tenured jobs. To convince public-school employees that market forces will provide jobs for the best teachers and administrators from these public schools is next to impossible. Of course, as Milwaukee's Zakiya Courtney points, the number of kids in the school system won't shrink. "This won't impact the teachers," she says. "It will only affect the pencil pushers."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Will saving jobs justify depriving innocent children of a quality education? To answer this question, these leaders ought to talk to students and their parents, visit the neighborhood private schools these children could go to, and perform a cost-benefit analysis of the savings associated with sending children to these schools. "Once you do this, you can't help but become a believer in school choice," says Messmer's Smith.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 	School choice is the civil-rights movement of the 1990s. Says Milwaukee's Polly Williams, "I am one of those people who is supposed to be very stupid because I am black, I live in the inner city, I am poor, and I raised my children in a single parent home. Well, those are lies. The only thing different about us is that we have been deprived of resources and access. When you empower parents like me, there is a major difference. We become responsible for our own lives. . . . We want to be empowered, and that is what the choice program has done."<p>

<h3>Five items today:</h3>
<ol>
<li>On Monday and Tuesday nights the CBS and NBC evening <a href="#newscasts">newscasts did not run any stories</a>
from their correspondents traveling with Clinton and Dole. ABC didn't on Tuesday either, but Monday night ABC's Brit Hume
actually employed the term "harsh" to Clinton.
<li>The <a href="#fundraising">questionable fundraising sources</a> for the Democrats is getting some network attention. Tuesday night's World News Tonight included a story a  Florida drug dealer invited to a White House dinner.
<li>A CBS reporter says a second Clinton term will bring more <a href="#moderate">"moderate appointments" to the Supreme Court,</a> but he's immediately contradicted in the next soundbite.
<li>PBS's Frontline asks <a href="#press">"Why America Hates the Press."</a> But in one hour a reason left unmentioned: liberal bias.
<li>CNN's <a href="#rook">Susan Rook</a> cites Bob Dole's divorce as proof his word is not his bond.
</ol>
<a name="newscasts">
<hr>
1) Monday night CBS and NBC covered the day's campaigning with 
their anchors giving brief reports. NBC Nightly News ran a lengthy piece 
from Andrea Mitchell on the Indonesian money trail.
<P>
On the October 21 World News Tonight, Brit Hume reported President 
Clinton's reaction to the fundraising scandals. Hume offered a unique use 
of the term "harsh," applying it to Clinton instead of Dole:
<P>
<DD>"President Clinton though stayed as far above the fracas as possible. 
He personally said not a word about it as he campaigned in Ohio and Michigan
today. But his campaign thought enough of the matter to send out a spokesman 
to denounce Bob Dole on it in the harshest terms."
<BR>
<DD>Joe Lockhart, Clinton-Gore Press Secretary: "You know Bob Dole talking 
about campaign finance reform is like Dr. Jack Kevorkian talking about the 
sanctity of life. It doesn't work. He has no credibility."
<P>
<a name="fundraising">
<hr>
2) On Tuesday's World News Tonight (October 22) Brian Ross explored a 
convicted drug dealer who got a White House dinner for his $20,000.
<P>
<DD>Brian Ross: "At the very time twice convicted Jorge Cabrera was setting 
up his latest cocaine smuggling deal last December in the Florida Keys, 
Democratic fundraisers were arranging for him to attend a White House dinner 
with President Clinton. All it took was a $20,000 campaign contribution to 
the Democratic Party...."
<BR>
<DD>"A few weeks after the White House dinner federal agents raided Cabrera's 
hideout and seized more than 5,000 pounds of cocaine, leading to Cabrera's 
conviction in July. Still, the Democrats didn't return his money until last 
week when after a  reporter for Newsweek asked about it and the party finally 
checked into Cabrera's background. According to Cabrera's lawyer there are 
pictures of the drug smuggler at the White House and at another dinner here 
in Florida with Vice President Gore. But federal prosecutors demanded all 
copies and negatives of those photos and the Justice Department is refusing 
to make them public."
<P>
<a name="moderate">
<hr>
3) MRC analyst Steve Kaminski caught this humorous sequence during a 
story on Monday's This Morning on who Dole and Clinton might appoint to the 
Supreme Court. 
<P>
<DD>CBS reporter Troy Roberts: "Court observers believe a Bob Dole presidency 
would move the court to the right and President Clinton would stick with 
moderate appointments should he win a second term."
<P>
<DD>Clint Bolick, Institute for Justice: "Bill Clinton has tended to appoint 
very well qualified people but people who are quite liberal. I expect that he'll 
continue doing that if he gets a second term and the Republican Senate will have 
no option but to confirm those people." 
<P>
<a name="press">
<hr>
4) In most markets Tuesday night PBS aired an edition of Frontline 
titled "Why America Hates the Press." The show approached the subject from the 
left, using the James Fallows critique as its guide. There was plenty on the 
evils of the McLaughlin Group, celebrity journalism, reporters taking speaking 
fees and how awful it was for the Washington Post to put on the front page a 
story about Bob Woodward's new book.
<P>
One theme that was absent: Any consideration of how liberal bias might be 
turning people off. Just take a look at this list of those featured in the PBS 
show, as listed in the Washington Post's TV Week on Sunday:
<P>
"Michael Kelly, editor of the New Republic; the New York Times's R.W. 'Johnny' 
Apple; James Fallows of U.S. News & World report; Tom Brokaw and Andrea Mitchell 
of NBC News; Tim Russert, host of NBC's Meet the Press; McLaughlin Group panelists 
Jack Germond of the Balitimore Sun, Clarence Page of the Chicago Tribune; 
Howard Kurtz, Bob Woodward and David Broder of The Washington Post; Paul Taylor, 
a former Post reporter; and National Public Radio's Elizabeth Arnold and 
Cokie Roberts."
<P>
Not a conservative in the list. Fred Barnes snuck on a couple of times, but not
to discuss anything about bias. 
<P>
<a name="rook">
<hr>
5) CNN's Susan Rook took a nice little pot shot at Bob Dole last week. 
In his Media Notes column on October 21, The Washington Post's Howard Kurtz relayed 
an exchange from CNN's TalkBack Live (3-4pm ET), though he didn't provide a show date. 
<P>
After the RNC's Ed Gillespie asserted that for Bob Dole "his word is his bond," 
Rook shot back: "Which word are we talking about? The word to his first wife when 
he said, 'Until death do us part?'" Kurtz noted that after an audience member called 
it a cheap shot, Rook agreed: "Mea culpa. My apologies to Bob and Elizabeth Dole."

<title>Lebed Dismissed But Not Tamed - Heritage</title>

Executive Memorandum 465<br>
October 23, 1996<br><hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


	On October 17, President Boris Yeltsin fired National Security Aide and Security Council Secretary Alexander Lebed, denouncing him for "acting without proper authority" and committing "errors intolerable to Russia." Yeltsin's allies went even further: Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin charged the controversial general with "Bonapartism," while Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov accused him of plotting a coup.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Lebed's dismissal was the culmination of a long and complicated series of maneuvers initiated by Chernomyrdin and Presidential Chief of Staff Anatoly Chubais. With Yeltsin clearly ill and in his last term, all of the politicians around him, including Lebed, have been engaged in a power struggle that is likely to continue.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Lebed, an outspoken retired paratroop lieutenant general, emerged as a serious contender for the presidency by finishing third in the first round of presidential elections held on June 16, 1996. The 11 million votes cast in his favor earned him much acclaim -- and numerous enemies in the Kremlin. In the second round of elections, held on July 3, Lebed grudgingly endorsed Yeltsin (and thereby insured his victory) in exchange for being nominated as National Security Aide to the President and Security Council Secretary.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	An extremely ambitious man, Lebed refused to have his authority confined to a merely advisory role on the Security Council. Even before taking office, he succeeded in engineering the dismissal of his rival and former boss, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. Lebed then proceeded to meddle in economic affairs, an area normally regarded as the Prime Minister's territory. He also began advocating a new anti-corruption campaign which, had it been implemented, would have been ruinous for the many highly placed Russian officials who often are accused of corruption in the media.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Lebed succeeded in pushing for a swift settlement in Chechnya, which made him the most popular Russian politician. At the same time, however, he challenged the vested interests of extremely influential forces in Russia. Interior Minister Kulikov became his archrival after Lebed demanded his dismissal as the main culprit in the Chechnya fiasco. Virtually the entire upper echelon of power quickly united against Lebed.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition to senior government officials, the anti-Lebed coalition came to include communists and nationalists. Lebed contributed to the growing sentiment against him by coming out with a series of wild accusations against his own protg, the popular Defense Minister General Igor Rodionov. He also made the mistake of allying himself with the extremely unpopular General Alexander Korzhakov, Yeltsin's former chief bodyguard. This move infuriated both President Yeltsin and the Russian media.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	When Lebed finally was ousted, the main charge against him was that he was preparing a coup. This accusation appears to be false. Unlike Chernomyrdin and Chubais, Lebed has neither a nationwide organization nor a strong bureaucratic structure standing behind him. His actions may have been aimed at improving his standing by creating a powerful support structure of his own. He openly proposed creating regional branches for the Security Council, for example, as well as a paramilitary "Russian Legion" to combat organized crime and ethnic violence. According to Kulikov, documents distributed by Lebed indicated that this Legion was supposed to "detain and liquidate leaders of political groups and movements" which threatened national security or the integrity of the Russian state. However, such an apparatus would have taken months to establish.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Had Lebed really planned a mutiny with the aid of his Legion, it is highly unlikely that he would have shared his plans in advance with the Defense and Interior Ministers or sought their consent. However, his proposal was a useful blunder in the hands of his rivals. Kulikov was the one to articulate the charges--with Chernomyrdin's or possibly Yeltsin's approval. Getting Lebed out of the way apparently was a matter of personal survival for Kulikov, since Lebed's people reportedly have accumulated evidence of his involvement in massive fraud and embezzlement in Chechnya.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Lebed still has high hopes for the future. Despite his dismissal, his popularity continues to be high. He is credited with stopping the war in Chechnya, which claimed 100,000 lives. If hostilities resume because of pressure from Kulikov and his allies, Lebed's rating will skyrocket.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Russian public has always favored the political underdog. This helped Boris Yeltsin in the late 1980s, and it is helping Lebed now. Should Yeltsin retire or pass away in the near future, new presidential elections will be called. If this scenario develops, Lebed will have a good chance of succeeding Yeltsin if he can muster enough financial and media support.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Lebed's chief opponent for the presidency would be Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. Unlike Lebed, Chernomyrdin lacks charisma; but he does command huge organizational and financial resources as well as the loyalty of local political elites. Chernomyrdin could establish a broad anti-Lebed coalition. The Prime Minister also would be in a position to encourage media efforts to discredit Lebed. But it is too early to tell whether these measures would be sufficient to prevent Lebed from ascending to power.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	If Yeltsin remains in power for at least two more years, Lebed's chances of winning the presidency will diminish. Much would depend upon his ability to establish a nationwide political movement and secure the support of local elites and business interests.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Despite the turmoil surrounding Lebed's dismissal, Russia does not appear to be heading for civil war. The army is politically passive, and its support for Lebed is neither total nor unconditional. Lebed tried to boost his popularity in the armed forces by supporting the disappointed paratroopers against a Defense Ministry decision to cut airborne forces. However, the top brass moved quickly to instill discipline. General Kazantsev, Deputy Commander of the Airborne Troops, was fired for publicly opposing the force reduction and siding with Lebed. Lebed appears to realize that any appeal to the army to rise in mutiny would only provoke bloodshed and ruin his chances of achieving his ambitious political goals peacefully.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Nevertheless, Lebed's dismissal could have a dramatic impact on Russia's domestic and foreign policies. Most important, the peace he worked to secure in Chechnya could be disavowed, causing disaster for Russians and Chechens alike. Lebed's more reasonable approach to NATO expansion and NATO-Russia cooperation also could be renounced. In the economic arena, Chernomyrdin's government will feel more comfortable and confident without Lebed, whose constant support of a larger military budget and subsidies for the military-industrial complex was a thorn in the Prime Minister's side.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	A populist politician, Lebed could initiate a campaign focused on saving the peace in Chechnya and denouncing government corruption. Such an onslaught would mobilize many of his supporters. It is therefore possible that the government might move preemptively against him -- for example, by stepping up the orchestrated media campaign against him, or even by bringing criminal charges.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	During his short time in office, Lebed made many controversial statements on domestic and foreign policy. He has shown himself to be both unpredictable and anything but a team player. His departure leaves the Yeltsin administration more united and consolidated, and thus more predictable for the U.S. -- at least in the short run. To this extent, Lebed's firing could be good news for American policy. However, not everything Lebed stood for was inimical to U.S. interests and values. In dealing with the Kremlin, the Clinton Administration and the West should insist that the best features of Lebed's legacy -- cooperation with NATO, the fight against crime and corruption, and the end of hostilities in Chechnya -- be continued even after his dismissal.

<H3>Four items today:</H3>
<p><br>
<ol>
<li><a href="#vargas">On Good Morning America, Elizabeth Vargas</a> asked Jack Kemp
about Bob Dole's hypocrisy in opposing Whitewater pardons after
having supported the pardoning of Casper Weinberger. But Vargas
and others in the media have ignored some key differences.
<li><a href="#shaw">To CNN's Bernard Shaw, raising ethics isn't a valid concern</a>
worthy of discussion. It's either an "attack" or an "insult."
<li><a href="#cbs">The co-host of CBS This Morning, however, offered</a> a
contrarian view Thursday. He suggested that the media are wrong
to consider negative campaigning off limits. 
<li><a href="#nq">The text of the October 21 edition of <I>Notable Quotables</I></a>,
jammed with the most biased quotes of the past two weeks,
including many examples of reporters calling Dole mean and
nasty.
</ol><br>
<a name=vargas>
<FONT  SIZE=+1>1)</FONT> MRC analyst Gene Eliasen caught a couple of interesting questions posed during Thursday's Good Morning America. Interviewing Jack Kemp and Leon Panetta, Elizabeth Vargas asked Kemp: 
<blockquote>"Senator Dole had pledged to keep this campaign on a
positive note. You, in your debate said yourself that negative
attacks are, quote, 'beneath Bob Dole.' Why then the decision to
launch specific, some would say negative, attacks last night?"
<br>
    Her next question: "Mr. Kemp, you do know that Senator Dole
also fought to get a pardon for Casper Weinberger several years
ago. It would seem that many, in the eyes of some, it's a bit
hypocritical to criticize the President for, for possibly
considering pardons this year."
</blockquote>
Like other reporters over the past couple of days who have
highlighted the Dole pardon hypocrisy theme, Vargas failed to
note some key differences between Weinberger and Whitewater.
Former independent counsel Lawrence Walsh raised the issue
Tuesday. But the October 16 <I>USA Today</I> noted that Walsh claimed
that Dole had "urged pardons for crimes of constitutional
dimension." Whitewater crimes hardly raise constitutional
balance of power issues. There is a difference between a
President pardoning business associates who committed crimes to
make money for themselves and a cabinet member indicted for
carrying out policies while in office.
<p>
<a name="shaw">
<FONT  SIZE=+1>2)</FONT> After Wednesday night's debate, MRC analyst Clay Waters
noticed, CNN's Bernard Shaw concluded the post-debate analysis 
by posing this question to the audience: "I only leave you with 
this question: Is a question about character and ethics a quote 
'insult,' or an 'attack'?"
<p>
<a name="cbs">
<FONT  SIZE=+1>3)</FONT> On the bright side, the media's attitude that anything
negative or critical said of Clinton is "nasty" or "harsh," was
noted by the co-host of CBS This Morning. Thursday morning
(October 17) Jose Diaz-Balart asked CBS analyst Kevin Phillips: 
<blockquote>
"It seems like everywhere else in the world, where there is
a democracy, people are allowed to talk about the other
candidate's failures as a politician. Here, it seems, that many
in the media call that name calling and personal attacks. Are we
in the media making too much of pointing out what seemed to be
just inconsistencies in a candidate?"</blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote>
"Good morning, everyone. The last debate of the national
political campaign is on tap for tonight in San Diego. Bob Dole
is not waiting for that debate to attack Bill Clinton's ethics.
With more on a campaign that is now getting meaner, NBC's Kelly
O'Donnell is standing by live in San Diego." -- Matt Lauer
leading off his October 16 Today newscast.
<p>
"Rita, true or untrue that they're preparing for a kind of
carpet bombing on character?" -- Dan Rather to Rita Braver on
what the White House faced from Bob Dole in that night's debate,
Oct. 16 Evening News.
<p>
"Was he borrowing the words of an over-enthusiastic supporter,
or did Bob Dole lower the level of civility a notch in his
contest with Bill Clinton?" -- Bernard Shaw on the "Bozo"
comment, October 8 Inside Politics.
<p>
"I know that was a major goal of the Dole campaign [in the
debate], to make sure people saw this compassionate side of Bob
Dole. Do you think that he is in some ways paying the price for
a Republican Congress that enacted, or tried to enact measures,
in the views of many were simply too harsh or too draconian?" --
Katie Couric to Elizabeth Dole, October 8 Today.
<p>
"Let me just turn to the presidential campaign very quickly. As
you've heard, Tim, it turned decidedly nastier in the Dole camp
yesterday. He was talking about a moral crisis. He refused to
answer a question if President Clinton was morally and ethically
capable of being President. You heard that Bozo exchange.
Effective strategy or is this going to come back to haunt him?"
-- Katie Couric to Tim Russert, Oct. 9 Today.
<p>
"In his harshest, most personal attack yet on the President, Bob
Dole today charged that the Clinton Administration is unethical,
that Bill Clinton himself is slipping and sliding away from
questions about possible illegal campaign contributions." -- NBC
reporter David Bloom, October 14 Nightly News.
<p>
"Senator Dole said he wasn't going to mention Whitewater, then
Whitewater did rear its ugly head last night." -- CBS This
Morning co-host Mark McEwen to Fred Barnes the morning after
the first debate, Oct. 7.
</blockquote>
<CENTER><FONT  SIZE=+1><b>Phil Jones: CBS Hatchet Man</b></FONT></CENTER>
<blockquote>
"He's got to explain how his campaign centerpiece, the 15
percent tax cut, can be paid for without draconian cuts in
social programs. He wants to talk about the character issue, but
he can't get personal or look mean-spirited doing it." -- Phil
Jones on what Dole needed to do in the upcoming debate, October
4 CBS Evening News.
<p>
"I think that if I had to say probably where he was the weakest
and where he really needed to score was, he needed to explain to
the American people how this country can afford that 15 percent
tax cut, the centerpiece of his campaign, without these
draconian cuts. I don't think he has done that yet." -- Reporter
Phil Jones on CBS after the October 6 debate.
<p>
"It's a tough speech for him to make because he runs the risk of
looking desperate and mean-spirited." -- Phil Jones on Dole
raising Clinton's "public ethics," October 15 CBS Evening News.
<p>
"Attacking the President could be risky for Mr. Dole because of
the debate format. The candidates will be facing voters who are
asking the questions, not a reporter. Mr. Dole has never been
able to shed that image of a hatchet man that he got back in his
1976 vice presidential debate and the last thing he needs
tonight is a boo, a hiss, or a gasp from one of the questioners
who thinks he's being too mean." -- Phil Jones, October 16 CBS
Evening News.
</blockquote>
<CENTER><FONT  SIZE=+1><b>Characterwise, It's Clinton Over Reagan</b></FONT></CENTER>
<blockquote>
"In the first two years this is a man [Clinton] who tried his
best to balance the budget, to reform health care, to fight for
gay rights, to support personal freedoms. Couldn't those be
considered doing the right things, evidence of true character?"
-- Bryant Gumbel to David Maraniss, MSNBC's InterNight, October
10.
<p>
"Lou, I know you feel as if Reagan had few, if any, character
flaws. But let me ask you this. When one sidesteps, or refuses
to acknowledge the consequences of their policies or actions,
why shouldn't that be viewed as a character flaw? Or when one
lies. For example, let me roll a clip and then we'll come back.
This one deals with Iran-Contra." -- Gumbel to Washington Post
reporter Lou Cannon, same show.
<p>
"While he appeared to be empathetic, his policies caused
enormous suffering for those who were least able to afford it?"
-- Gumbel to Cannon in discussion about Ronald Reagan, same
show.
<p>

<h3>LIUNA, ORGANIZED CRIME, AND THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION</h3>
<b>A Government Reform Project Study</b>
<p>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/weinstein.html">Kenneth R. Weinstein</a><br> 
Director, Government Reform Project<br>
and August Stofferahn, Research Assistant<p>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder Update No. 281<br>
October 20, 1996<br>
<p></center>
<font size="-1">(Updating <a href="/heritage/library/categories/govern/gip10.html"><i>Government Integrity Project Report</i> No. 10</a>, "Organized Crime, Organized Labor, and Corruption of the Federal Grants Process," July 31, 1996.)</font>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In a February 1995 consent decree, the Laborers' International Union of North America (LIUNA) admitted that several of its locals and affiliates operated under the influence of organized crime. Over the past two decades, at least 80 officials of LIUNA and its affiliates have been convicted of various organized crime-related activities, including bribery, embezzlement, interstate transportation of stolen merchandise, and attempted murder. Notwithstanding this record, the Justice Department under the Clinton Administration has allowed LIUNA's leadership to remain largely in place.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In hearings this summer, Congress raised questions about whether the Justice Department's treatment of LIUNA was influenced by the union's political ties to the Clinton Administration.<sup>1</sup>  After the Justice Department investigation was disclosed publicly, LIUNA significantly increased its political activity. Despite its relatively modest size, it became the largest union contributor of "soft money" to the Democratic Party, as well as the fourth-largest political action committee (PAC) contributor among all of the nation's labor unions.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
During the first two full fiscal years under the Clinton Administration, LIUNA received nearly $30 million in federal grants. Many of these grants were awarded to LIUNA's education and training programs, a special focus of criminal investigations of the union. Congress should direct the General Accounting Office to investigate whether taxpayer funds were abused and whether government grantmakers were ignorant of, or simply chose to ignore, evidence of LIUNA's abuse of education and training funds.
<p>
<b>LIUNA's Record of Partisan Politics</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Around the time the Justice Department investigation of LIUNA became public knowledge in October 1993, the union dramatically increased its involvement in partisan politics. During the first ten months of 1993, it gave $50,600 in "soft money" donations to the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Between January and September 1996, it gave $460,000 to the DNC, making it the top soft money donor among labor unions. Although LIUNA has only one-third the membership of the National Education Association, its soft-money donations exceed the NEA's by 50 percent.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
LIUNA's political action committee, the Laborers' Political League (LPL), has grown in influence over the same time period. The 16th-largest labor PAC in 1993-1994, the LPL has become the 4th-biggest in the 1995-1996 election cycle. Since 1993, it has donated over $2.1 million to Democratic Party congressional candidates.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
LIUNA General President Arthur Coia also has become a leading fund-raiser for the Democratic Party. He served as co-host for a 1994 fund-raiser that brought more than $3.5 million into DNC coffers and as Vice Chairman of a May 1996 event that raised more than $12 million for the DNC. These efforts and others earned Coia the privilege of frequent access to the White House. He also has traveled with the President on numerous occasions, even accompanying him to greet the Pope in Denver.
<p>
<b>Cash-Back Bonus: Nearly $30 Million in Federal Grants in FY 1994 and 1995</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
During 1994 and 1995, the first two full fiscal years of the Clinton Administration, LIUNA's largesse to the Democratic Party was reciprocated more than tenfold in the form of nearly $30 million in grants from the federal government. Such federal subsidies are especially significant to the financially strapped union, which last year ran an operating deficit of $11.8 million.3
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As detailed in <a href="/heritage/library/categories/govern/gip10.html"><i>GIP Report</i> No. 10</a>, four federal agencies -- the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and Department of Labor (DOL) -- awarded 38 grants totaling $11,376,000 to LIUNA and its affiliates in FY 1994 alone. Moreover, in April 1995, just two months after it signed the consent decree publicly acknowledging the influence of organized crime in its ranks, the union received a $3.5 million training and education grant from HUD.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Now The Heritage Foundation has obtained copies of numerous FY 1995 grants to LIUNA and its affiliates. During FY 1995, in addition to the $3.5 million HUD grant, LIUNA and its affiliates benefited from 12 grants totaling $14,832,000 from six federal agencies: DOL, EPA, HUD, HHS, the Department of Education, and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (see <a href="#app">Appendix</a>). The majority of these grants were awarded after the February 1995 LIUNA-Department of Justice consent decree had been signed.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Most significant among the FY 1995 grants was $9.3 million from the National Institutes of Health's Superfund Worker Training Program, awarded on September 15, 1995. This grant, nearly six times the program's average grant of $1.59 million, amounted to more than one-third of the Superfund Worker Training Program's entire $30.3 million 1995 grant budget.
<p>
<b>LIUNA's Record of Training Fund Abuses</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bulk of these 1994 and 1995 federal grants to LIUNA funded education and training programs, where much of the criminal activity in the union took place. The November 1994 complaint against LIUNA, drafted by the Department of Justice but never filed in court, alleged that "in or about 1986 to on or about July 31, 1994," LIUNA officials -- including Coia -- sought to "defraud training and education funds of various upstate locals" in New York, employing "actual and threatened force" to "induce the locals to surrender control of these funds."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition, the Department of Labor's Inspector General recently hailed the conviction of one LIUNA official for conspiracy to steal union training funds.4  But despite this conviction and other government allegations, federal grants continue to flow to a group that admittedly has been infiltrated by organized crime.
<p>
<b>GAO Should Investigate LIUNA's Federal Grants</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress should call upon its investigative arm, the General Accounting Office, to examine the process by which federal officials awarded such major grants to LIUNA. The GAO investigation should attempt to determine whether any of the training and education grants awarded to LIUNA and its affiliates were connected in any way to the allegations, prosecutions, or convictions against LIUNA officials.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
LIUNA officials have been both charged with and convicted of abusing training and education funds. The federal government provided tens of millions of dollars in training and education grants to the union. Even minimal concern about taxpayer funds would more than justify an inquiry as to whether known abuses involved the use of federal grants.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The GAO also should try to ascertain whether federal grantmakers adequately monitored the receipt and use of taxpayer funds by union officials. Relevant grantmakers at agencies that have supported LIUNA should be asked about their knowledge of allegations of criminal infiltration of LIUNA and their agencies' efforts to prevent such wrongdoing in the future. Moreover, the GAO should begin an immediate review of FY 1996 and FY 1997 grants to LIUNA.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The House Judiciary Committee has yet to conclude its investigation of whether LIUNA's political ties allowed it to escape harsh legal sanction from the Justice Department. It seems clear, however, that LIUNA General President Arthur Coia used his ties to the White House to seek federal grant dollars. According to an article in the May 1996 <i>Washington Monthly</i>, Coia personally lobbied the President for grant money at a fall 1994 Oval Office meeting, and the President informed Coia that White House Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes would handle such matters.<sup>5</sup>  (Before joining the Clinton Administration, Ickes practiced labor law; LIUNA was one of his clients.<sup>6</sup>) Normally, federal grants are issued directly by agencies without White House intervention. Although White House intervention in the grants process may not be illegal, it is unusual enough to merit further GAO examination.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition to examining the specifics of the LIUNA case, the GAO should recommend guidelines to help federal agencies determine how to respond properly to grant requests from organizations operating under substantial allegations of criminal wrongdoing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i> we are focusing on a topic which
once was taboo but now is a regular part of many television
sitcoms.  It's a hot point of controversy between people who
believe there are reliable standards of right and wrong and
those who believe anything goes.

<p>

The topic is homosexuality, but the story tellers 
will not be policy experts or politicians.  You'll hear from 
former homosexuals about their life experiences.

<p>

With the AIDS quilt celebration just last week, 
many people were talking about coming out as a homosexual.
But have you ever heard of National Coming OUT OF 
Homosexuality Day?  Begun by Michael Johnston, the day is 
part of a vision of many people who have suffered because 
they believed the message, once gay, always gay.  Michael's 
perspective is especially poignant because he is slowly
dying of AIDS.

<p>

This is an important show, because it not only 
provides a viewpoint of homosexuality that other networks 
have virtually ignored; it contains vital information for 
parents struggling to understand their gay children and 
striving to find a way to talk about these tough issues.

<p>

But first, let's hear from Gary Bauer, president 
of the Family Research Council.  Election day is quickly 
approaching, and the candidates continue to square off on 
issue after issue. Tonight the last Presidential debate of 
this cycle will occur, and Gary discusses possible outcomes. 
Let's hear what he has to say about the race to November 5 
as we take you Behind the Headlines.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.

<p>

MR. BAUER: My pleasure.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There has been a lot of talk about 
how these issues need to be run in the campaign.  We've seen 
a lot of economic issues.  But it seems that the social 
issues that created great coalitions are missing in action.
What's your perspective?

<p>

MR. BAUER: I think economics are important, and, 
you know, incomes have been stagnating.  We haven't had the 
job growth we should have, and those things should be 
discussed.

<p>

But I have to admit, I am furious that some of the 
most profound things facing the country -- issues about 
life, about the family, about values -- that these things 
seem to be ignored by both of the major candidates and the 
campaigns this year, and I think the American people are 
losing out.  I think we deserve a more electrifying, 
enlightening debate on some of the things that define who we 
are as Americans.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It has been interesting if you look 
at the polling data, Gary, that people are saying they are 
not going to vote.  There is a tremendous lack of voter 
interest.  In fact, we are looking at possible record lows 
in participation. What do you think will capture voter 
interest?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, I sure see a link between the 
lack of voter interest and the fact that there has not been 
any passion in this campaign.  And you're right; there's a 
really clear trend line here.  People didn't watch the 
conventions at the same level that they've watched 
conventions in the past.

<p>

Apparently, the first debate, the viewer audience 
was off at least 20 percent. I don't have any reason to 
believe that the debate tonight or the one later in the week 
is going to have any bigger audience.

<p>

So the American people seem to be tuning out, and 
that's strange.  I don't think they would be tuning out if 
they thought there were really profound questions on the 
table being settled.  So it's something that I think both 
parties ought to be worried about.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What do you think would capture the 
attention of the American voter?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, I think excitement captures 
their attention.  I think they want to see, even though the 
voters seem to say that they don't like negative 
campaigning, nonetheless, I think they do want passion.  
They want one candidate to say, Look, your vision for 
America is wrong.  You've done this, this, this, and this.  
Here's what I want to do.  Here's what I believe about the 
American family.  Here's how I can make our streets safer, 
our schools work, protect the handicapped, our unborn 
children, and so forth.

<p>

I think if you could get a discussion on those 
things, the American people would tune out from some of the 
other stations they're watching, the sports events and so 
forth, and tune in to a very important debate about the kind 
of country we are.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: In terms of campaign themes, Bob 
Dole seems to have two:  I'm going to cut your taxes and 
Bill Clinton is a liberal.  But "liberal" seems a little 
undefined.  How can we clarify what that means?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, both those themes are good 
themes from Bob Dole's standpoint.  Here's his problem.  On 
the tax cut theme, he is urging a tax cut after two 
betrayals that the American people have experienced.  First 
they watched George Bush say, "Read my lips," and they 
watched that promise go down the drain.  And then fresh in 
their minds is the fact that Bill Clinton promised a middle-class 
tax cut four years ago, and once again, we got a tax increase.

<p>

So you can't be angry at Americans for listening 
to Bob Dole and saying to themselves, "Oh, yeah, here's 
another guy who says he's going to cut our taxes; I don't 
believe it."  So there's a credibility problem there.

<p>

Quite frankly, if I were Bob Dole, I would say, 
"Look, elect me President, give me a Republican Congress, 
and if I don't lower your taxes in one year, I'll resign."
That would deal with the credibility issue, and that would 
get the attention of the American people.

<p>

On the other issue of accusing Clinton of being a 
liberal, he is a liberal.  Unfortunately, Bob Dole is 
leaving out half the issues that define his liberalism.  He 
is not reminding them of the five executive orders that 
Clinton signed on abortion the first day he was in office.
I mean, here's a President that says he's basically a 
moderate in this issue; he's an extremist on that issue.

<p>

It was really the cultural and social issues that 
Republicans used in the past to label Democratic candidates 
as being liberal or extreme, and at least as of now, the 
Republican campaign has not done that this year, and I think 
as a result, they are not getting the so-called Reagan 
Democrats to vote for them.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One thing that was very interesting, 
Gary, during the debate was when Bob Dole turns to Bill 
Clinton and says that he had promised not to bring up 
Whitewater. It seems a strange thing to make a promise 
about. Did you find that odd?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Yeah, gee, when did that happen?  I 
mean, when did they have that private meeting where Bob Dole 
agreed to take off of the table one of the biggest 
vulnerabilities that Bill Clinton has?  I was astonished.  I 
was shocked by it.  I was also surprised that the media 
didn't pick up on it.  It seems to me that in that one 
little exchange, Bob Dole told us about something that no 
one knew about before, that there had been some sort of a 
conversation between him and the President where he agreed 
to let the President off the hook.

<p>

Now, I am interested in what the President did in 
exchange for that. It couldn't be not to label Dole as an 
extremist. The Clinton campaign does that all the time.  It 
couldn't be to no longer make older people fearful because 
Bob Dole is going to take away their Medicare.  Bill Clinton 
does that all the time.  So what did Bob Dole get for this 
promise not to bring up the greatest vulnerability that Bill 
Clinton has?  I'm afraid he didn't get anything, and as a 
result, we are all losing as a result of that for not 
hearing that issue being debated.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Another issue which came up during 
the debates was the issue of whether or not Bill Clinton 
will do a Presidential pardon for friends, former business 
partners, and possibly people who joined with him, 
allegedly, in criminal activity.  This is all being 
determined. The President has absolute power to pardon 
anyone he wants and seems to be dangling this over the heads 
of former friends.

<p>

The pardon issue has a lot of power, potentially.
What do you make of that?

<p>

MR. BAUER: I don't know what to make of it.  It 
was clear when the question was raised that Bill Clinton 
refused to eliminate the possibility of pardons.  We may 
have a Presidential first here, because some of the pardons 
we're talking about could extend to family members of the 
President.

<p>

So again, this is an important issue.  If I were 
Bob Dole, I would be hitting the President every day on 
this:  Will you promise the American people to not use your 
Presidential powers to thwart justice, to thwart the logical 
outcome of the cases that are pending in the Whitewater 
investigation?  I think it is a mistake to not press the 
President on that issue.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Last question for you, Gary.  Where 
do the campaigns go from here?  It's clear that, so far for 
voters, it has been a very lackluster exchange.  What can 
they do to change that?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, you know, there are only a 
couple of times in a campaign where a candidate gets the 
chance to let the American people see him or her without the 
filter of the media.  One is your acceptance speech at the 
convention. The other is these debates.  There is only one 
more Presidential debate left.  This one is going to be a 
town hall forum, where Bill Clinton tends to shine.

<p>

I would hope that Bob Dole, in that last 
opportunity before the American people, will without 
hesitation define Bill Clinton as a liberal across the board 
on economic issues, on the size of government, on how 
high taxes should be, and on the important social issues.
If he does that, we are going to have a much closer election 
than anybody thinks.  If he doesn't do it, then I am afraid 
Bill Clinton is going to have four more years.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll 
introduce you to a man who is dying of AIDS; yet he brings a 
story of hope to those struggling in a homosexual lifestyle. 
You will not want to miss his story and the amazing stories 
of others who have come out of homosexuality.  Please stay 
tuned.

[Segment from National Coming OUT OF Homosexuality Day, held October 
11, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. JOHNSTON: Today and today's observance is 
critical for this country.  It is critical for the youth of 
our country, and it is critical for the moral foundations of 
our society.

<p>

For 10 years we have been experiencing an 
onslaught of deception and lies coming from organizations 
like National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, the Human Rights 
Campaign, PFLAG, which is Parents and Friends of Lesbians 
and Gays -- which they're not, by the way -- and other 
organizations that have no hesitancy to absolutely lie about 
the information they put out and are drenching in hypocrisy.

<p>

One of the most intolerant groups in this country 
are homosexual activists.  They tolerate only those who want 
to accept and approve and promote homosexuality.

<p>

We have a little bit different message today.
It's not really political; it is a message of hope and a 
message of warning -- a message of warning to the American 
public and to our young people that involvement in 
homosexuality can kill you.  It can kill you emotionally, it 
can kill you physically, and it can certainly kill you 
spiritually.

<p>

The consequences of homosexuality, I think, are 
best shown by the event going on behind us today:  the AIDS 
quilt.  We are here today, and as an individual with AIDS, I 
grieve for those looking at the AIDS quilt today, 
homosexuals and heterosexuals alike, family members, wives, 
brothers and sisters.  But what I really grieve as well is 
that there is an effort in this country to promote a 
behavior that is responsible for a huge percentage of those 
panels on that quilt today.

<p>

How is a country that has any morality left, how 
can it possibly promote to our young people a behavior that 
causes so much tragedy, so much pain, and so much death?

<p>

[Conclusion of segment.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Michael, you have been involved for 
many years reaching out to homosexuals and working with 
former homosexuals.  What gave you the courage and the 
interest to reach out to them?

<p>

MR. JOHNSTON: Well, the passion really came from 
my own experience and struggle with homosexuality.  I was 
introduced to homosexuality by a peer friend of mine, 
actually about a year older, (who) asked me if I wanted to 
go to a disco one night.  Like most young people, I was 
looking for a place to fit in, a sense of acceptance from 
others.  I had been fairly shy all my life, and so this 
opportunity to fit in with the "in" crowd was something that 
I was excited about.  So without even thinking about it, I 
said, "Sure, I'll go."

<p>

That night, however, he placed his hand on my leg 
and he said, "It's a gay bar.  Do you mind?"  Well, I didn't 
think twice about it.  I wish I had.  It was one of the 
worst decisions I made in my life, and I ended up going into 
a homosexual disco that night, and from a human experience, 
it was probably one of the most exciting experiences I had 
had up to that point in my life.  The lights were blaring, 
the music was playing, there was a lot of camaraderie and 
closeness going on, and I liked that.  And that night he 
first introduced me to my first homosexual experience, and I 
remained in the homosexual community for just under 13 years 
and even remained in it for two years after I tested 
positive for HIV back in 1986.

<p>

My relationship and my experience coming out of 
homosexuality has less to do with homosexuality than it does 
about my personal faith in Jesus Christ and my relationship 
with Him.  And so my passion is, as I sit here dying slowly 
from AIDS, I don't want to see the young people in this 
country go through what I have gone through.

<p>

When I came out of homosexuality, I thought I was 
the only person this had ever happened to.  I want young 
people to know that there are others who have struggled with 
it. There are others out there that are willing to help 
them, and not just young people but men and women, some of 
them who have been in the homosexual subculture for many, 
many years, that there is hope for them, that their lives 
don't have to be full of despair.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One of the things, though, that 
people talk about with homosexuality is that once gay, 
always gay.  Did you receive that message while you were in 
the community?

<p>

MR. JOHNSTON: Sure. Now, of course, as I was 
growing up in this country, there was still a sense of shame 
associated with homosexual behavior.  To a large extent, 
that shame has dropped in this culture.  We have done away 
with a lot of our sodomy laws, and today it is fashionable, 
particularly if you look at the young people graduating from 
high school, they are coming out of high school believing 
that homosexuality is just something cool, just something 
you can experiment with.  It's a life-changing decision, and 
it very often can lead to an individual's death.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: From your own experience, did you 
feel once gay, always gay, was accurate?  Did you feel 
trapped in your lifestyle?

<p>

MR. JOHNSTON: I went back and forth. I did do 
some reading as I was struggling with this.  I, of course, 
as a Christian, knew deep in my soul that something was 
wrong.  I didn't know why God didn't seem to be changing me. 
I didn't know what to do about it.

<p>

As I grew up as young Christian, in my family, we 
didn't use the Word of God as a basis for truth.  We must 
have some objective truth in our lives, as a country and as 
individuals.  Otherwise, we end up with moral anarchy.
Well, that was what was happening in my heart, was personal 
moral anarchy.  I had no basis on which to make my life 
decisions.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Michael, you are the national 
chairman of National Coming OUT OF Homosexuality Day, which 
you designed to coincide with the AIDS quilt and with 
National Coming Out Day, which is very popular with 
homosexual activists, and they encourage people to come out 
and say to the world, "Yes, I am gay."

<p>

Do you think that is a good idea to affiliate 
yourself with that message?  Is coming out as a homosexual 
something people should do?

<p>

MR. JOHNSTON: You mean as an individual, for them to come out?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes.

<p>

MR. JOHNSTON: You know, really, when you think 
about it -- let me just be blunt here -- when an individual 
"comes out" and proclaims their homosexuality, really, what 
they are doing is standing up and saying, "I'm a sexual 
deviant, and I'm proud of it."  That's what we're really 
talking about.  Homosexuality, up until the last decade, I 
would say, was still considered to be deviant human 
behavior, certainly because of religious reasons but also 
because of the consequences of the behavior itself.  It's a 
terribly tragic medical consequence of those who involve 
themselves in it.

<p>

The tragedy, though, I think is most keen when we 
look at our children.  It is not uncommon for a young person 
who is going through adolescence to struggle with a sense of 
who they are, to struggle with their sexuality.  I think we 
can all remember doing that.  And certainly as homosexuality 
is held out more and more as an option, I think more and 
more children will deal with it.

<p>

But for organizations like PFLAG and the National 
Gay and Lesbian Task Force, Human Rights Campaign, all pro-
homosexual activist groups, to tell a child that if they 
have even ever had a thought in that direction, that they 
ought to come out of the closet, as they say, and proclaim 
their homosexuality, will destroy many of those young 
people's lives.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Segment from National Coming OUT OF Homosexuality Day, held October 11, 
1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. CHRIS JOHNSON: I come to you this morning 
with some very important news -- how detrimental the 
homosexual lifestyle can be.  I come to expose myths that we 
were born this way, that once a homosexual, always a 
homosexual. I come to you as a witness, one who lived in 
this lifestyle for over 10 years of my life.  Actually, it 
became a death style. Slowly I was dying spiritually, 
mentally, and also physically.  I was involved in alcohol 
and drugs so deeply, this was ingrained within me, because 
that was the lifestyle, to constantly stay high, not be 
aware or conscious of actually how hurt one really was in 
this lifestyle.

<p>

There was no fulfillment internally, spiritually. 
It was a constant trying to find satisfaction in another 
male in physical terms.  But that could never satisfy the 
deep need that was on the inside.  It was so much hurt and 
bitterness that I had seen within this lifestyle.  But I 
knew that only God, that only God could actually change me, 
that I could not change myself, for the Word of God says, 
what is impossible with man is possible with God.

<p>

And, yes, it was impossible for me, of my own 
power, to walk out of this lifestyle, and one cannot do it 
within his own power.  But with the power of God, one can 
walk out of this lifestyle.

<p>

Recently, I guess about five years ago, I was 
tested as being HIV positive, also.  At this particular 
time, I thought that my life was over.  But God had still 
given me promises in my life and said that one day I would 
have a wife and have a family.  So I stand now married, 
having two children.  My children are HIV negative as well 
as my wife is HIV negative.

<p>

So I come to give you hope and to bring you truth, 
that just because you may be in the homosexual lifestyle 
today, you do not have to stay in this lifestyle.  God has 
given you a choice that if you believe His Word, you can 
walk out of this lifestyle and you can have a more 
fulfilling life.  Jesus says that He comes that you may have 
life and have it more abundantly.

<p>

I am a witness that it is much more of an abundant 
life that I live today than I could even imagine when I was 
living in the homosexual lifestyle.

<p>

[Conclusion of segment.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What has been the impact so far of 
National Coming OUT OF Homosexuality Day?

<p>

MR. JOHNSTON: I think the first impact, and 
probably the most important in my view, is that it will and 
has already begun to provide a sense of support and 
encouragement to the many men and women who are actively 
struggling to walk away from homosexuality.

<p>

I think, as I mentioned earlier, when it happened 
to me, I thought I was the only one out there.  It really is 
the best-kept secret around, that there's thousands of us 
across the country who have successfully walked away.

<p>

I think, also, it will and already has begun to 
educate the American public that this is not just a 
personality issue; this is a specific behavior with specific 
consequences, and very often detrimental not only to the 
individual involved but to society as a whole.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As an outsider looking in, Michael, 
it seems that there's a lot of hostility directed toward you 
from homosexual activists and even from the media.  Has that 
been your experience?

<p>

MR. JOHNSTON: Yes, and you know why?  I think 
they are afraid of the truth, because if there is something 
spiritually sinful about homosexuality, then many of these 
same individuals must also have some kind of sin in their 
lives, and they don't want to confront that.  No human being 
does.

<p>

We know there is a God. At least we know there is 
a God. The Bible says that He has made Himself known by the 
things that are.  But if we acknowledge too much about God, 
then we have to acknowledge our sinfulness before Him, and 
then we've got to deal with it, and that means going to the 
cross, the cross where Jesus Christ hung, spilled His blood, 
and paid for our sins, all of us, and some folks just don't 
want to deal with that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As a man who is dying from AIDS 
today, what hope, Michael, do you have for the people who 
are listening to us?

<p>

MR. JOHNSTON: The hope is a Person.  His name is 
Jesus Christ.  He is not just a religious figure.  He is the 
Son of God.  He is God Incarnate.  And that is the hope of 
mankind, whether we are talking about homosexuality or all 
of the other evils and wickedness that plague humanity.  He 
is the hope.

<p>

An increased economy is not a hope.  Quite 
frankly, we've got a lot of moral reprobates in the 
Republican and Democratic Party.  I am not looking there for 
hope.  They don't have the answers.  Bill Clinton doesn't 
have the answers.  Quite frankly, I am not sure Bob Dole has 
the answers.

<p>

But God does.  He knows what the problems are.  He 
knows the longing in our heart to be loved.  And the 
wonderful thing about God is He knows me better than I even 
know myself.  He knows the ugly that I haven't even seen 
yet, and I will be frank with you, I have seen a lot of ugly 
in my heart, a lot of darkness.  But He loves me, anyway.  
That is something that homosexual relationships can never 
provide.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: This year was the second annual 
National Coming OUT OF Homosexuality Day, and I know you 
worked long and hard on it, Michael.  How can people get 
involved for the third annual Coming OUT OF Homosexuality 
Day?

<p>

MR. JOHNSTON: They can call us at Kerusso 
Ministries.  Do you have the number?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes.

<p>

MR. JOHNSTON: All right. It is area code 757 
872-8878, and we're modern, so we have an e-mail address.
If they have e-mail, they can contact us at 
KERUSSOMIN@AOL.COM, and we will be glad to get the
information to them.

[Segment from National Coming OUT OF Homosexuality 
Day, held October 11, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MS. BOYER: I am a former lesbian, and I am a 
representative and a board member with Exodus, which is a 
worldwide coalition reaching out to those who desire freedom 
from the gay life.  This is a global movement where 
thousands are walking out of the gay life.

<p>

[End of segment.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Jane, how long have you been 
involved in ex-gay ministries?

<p>

MS. BOYER: I have been involved for about eight 
or nine years.  It all began when I attended my first Exodus 
conference in 1989 looking for an answer because I was 
dealing with homosexuality.

<p>

I had heard for a number of years that I was born 
gay and that there was no hope for change, and then I found 
out about Exodus, and so my car was packed and I was heading 
down to my first conference with Exodus in Pennsylvania.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So you went to your first conference 
while you were still in the lifestyle just to see what you 
would see.

<p>

MS. BOYER: Yes. My life was in crisis at that 
time.  I had lived a double life.  I have been a Christian 
now since I was age 5, but about halfway through my 
marriage, I fell into lesbian relationships, and I lived the 
gay life, lived a double life, for about five years.

<p>

Towards the end of that, though, my husband found 
out and I was faced with making some of the most difficult 
decisions that I have ever had to make, and that is, I was 
faced with should I leave my husband, who is a fine 
Christian man but whom I had no desire for at that time, and 
leave my lesbian lover, whom I felt I could not live 
without.  I also had to decide between the gay community, 
which gave me much support and acceptance, and the church, 
which I felt was very cold and detached.

<p>

And so at that time, I hit bottom.  I was very 
depressed and I felt hopeless.  I was in despair, and I even 
contemplated suicide because there just seemed to be no hope 
for change and no hope for my marriage.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: A lot of people watching have a 
difficult time understanding how you would get involved with 
a homosexual lifestyle.  How did that transpire for you?

<p>

MS. BOYER: Well, if you were to talk about what 
causes homosexuality, homosexuality is not inborn; 
homosexuality is caused by emotional wounding as a child, 
and the research is very clear about that.  My background 
was very dysfunctional.  I had been abused sexually and 
physically, and I had grown to develop quite a hatred for 
men.  Just line them up against the wall, and I will shoot 
them all and let God sort them out, thank you.

<p>

But God has really changed my heart.  I mean, I 
really love men today.  I love being around them, and I have 
close, healthy relationships with other men, and my husband 
is my best friend.  I mean, God has really healed our 
marriage.  We have been married 18 years now.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Wow! So you were struggling with 
kind of a hatred for men, which is very typical of a lesbian 
experience.

<p>

MS. BOYER: Yes, it is.  In fact, the work that I 
do now, I run a support group.  I am founder and director of 
Amazing Grace in Portland, Maine, which is an affiliate of 
Exodus.  Our purpose is to reach out to those who desire 
freedom from homosexuality and other forms of sexual 
brokenness such as cross-dressing, transsexuality, 
pedophilia, and sex addiction.

<p>

The men and women that are coming to Amazing 
Grace, they are all born-again believers, they are all 
Christians.  We haven't even tapped into the gay community 
at this point in time.  But my point being is that even 
though we are born-again Christians, it doesn't mean that at 
the moment of salvation that all of our hurts just magically 
go away.  So it is a process.  It is a process of healing.

<p>

The women that I work with, I have never known a 
lesbian who has not been hurt and wounded by a man some 
period in her life, whether it be sexual abuse, physical 
abuse, which causes her to shut down in fear towards any 
relationship with a man.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There has been a lot of media 
attention on the sitcom Ellen and whether that character 
will come out as a lesbian.  One has to wonder whether a 
sitcom is really going to portray the homosexual lifestyle 
accurately, whether we are going to see a very upbeat 
picture.  What is the reality of the homosexual and lesbian 
lifestyle?

<p>

MS. BOYER: You know, I have been accused of being 
homophobic and what have you, but in areas that are most 
accepting of homosexuality, such as Hollywood and San 
Francisco and New York, there is the highest percentage of 
suicide, death from chemical dependency, drug addiction, 
alcoholism, and HIV amongst the gay community, and I am 
concerned about that, because I love the homosexual.
Obviously, in those areas that they are receiving the 
greatest acceptance, there is the highest percentage of 
death and despair amongst the gay community.

<p>

So in regard to your question, the show, I am 
sure, will not portray the reality of the gay life. It is 
portrayed as being wonderful and pleasurable and whatever, 
but it is not that way in real life.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Jane, how difficult was it for you 
to leave the lesbian lifestyle?

<p>

MS. BOYER: It was one of the most difficult 
decisions that I have ever had to made.  My decision to 
leave the gay community was not based on what I wanted; it 
was based on what God wanted.  God was very clear to me in 
telling me that I was called to a radical obedience, radical 
to His Word, radical to His will in my life, radical to His 
calling, regardless of how I felt.

<p>

I did not want to leave this woman that I was 
involved with.  I did not want to leave the gay life.  These 
were my gay friends.  These were my whole life.  The gay 
life was my whole life.  The gay community was my social 
life.  That was my identity, and God was telling me to give 
it up.

<p>

I remember wrestling with God and saying, "God, 
but don't you know that this is the best thing I have ever 
known, and don't you know that the environment that I was 
raised, there was not a whole lot of love, not a whole lot 
of acceptance, and this is the best love that I have ever 
known?"  But God was calling me to a radical obedience.

<p>

What happened at that time is that I made the 
decision to leave the gay community but not knowing for sure 
if He could fill the hurts, that emptiness, that longing to 
be loved that I had carried around my whole life, and Jesus 
touched my heart in a way that I had never known, and His 
love began to flow into my heart in those places that were 
empty, and I began to realize that lesbian love is a 
counterfeit, it's a lie, and we are far too easily pleased 
with a counterfeit.  And that is what the gay community -- 
that is the deception, is that when they turn to homosexual 
behavior, when they turn to these gay relationships, it 
doesn't fill.  It gives the illusion of being satisfying.  
But it really doesn't.  It really doesn't.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Do you think it is possible for 
someone struggling with their feelings of homosexuality to 
leave that lifestyle without a faith experience?

<p>

MS. BOYER: Absolutely. It entails, though -- it 
is much like coming out of the disease of alcoholism.  I 
also work in the field of chemical dependency, and it 
entails a twofold process.  It involves putting down the 
booze and then working through those issues, the root 
issues, the hurts, the brokenness, the broken relationships, 
the self-hatred, the bitterness.  All of those things need 
to be dealt with in order to deal with the whole concept of 
alcoholism.

<p>

The same thing with homosexuality.  In order to 
come out of homosexuality, you make the commitment, you make 
the decision that you are going to leave this way of life, 
that you are not going to turn to homosexual behavior.  It 
is sin.  And then we allow Jesus to encounter the hurts with 
His love, His grace, and His mercy.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You are a counselor now, Jane.  When 
someone comes to you and they are struggling with 
homosexuality, what are their greatest fears?

<p>

MS. BOYER: Their greatest fears are that their 
feelings will never go away.  The other is that, what if God 
never changes me?  What if I never know intimacy with Jesus 
Christ because it has not worked before?  And so part of the 
process there is identifying the blocks that keep Jesus out.

<p>

What happens is that in a dysfunctional 
environment where there may be chemical dependency, there is 
abuse or whatever, a little child will look to the father, 
and the father is like God to this little child.  Dad is 
all-powerful, Dad is all-knowing, Dad is the authoritative 
word.  And so, based on our relationships with our fathers, 
we perceive God.  So if Dad was not the giver of good 
things, then we perceive that God is not the giver of good 
things.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: For someone who is watching this 
show and may be struggling with homosexual feelings or even 
be in the lifestyle, what is the first step toward getting 
free?

<p>

MS. BOYER: To realize that there is hope for 
change. It is a painful process.  It is not an easy 
process. This is not a quick fix.  And it entails 
commitment to Jesus Christ, it entails commitment to His 
Word, and it also entails allowing Him to encounter the 
hurts with His love and His grace.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There is a lot of attention paid in 
ex-gay ministry to men and to males leaving homosexuality, 
and in fact a lot of the leaders in ex-gay ministry are men. 
Some of the research would indicate that it is actually 
tougher for women to leave the lifestyle, which is why there 
aren't as many women up front.  Would you agree that it is 
harder for women to leave the lesbian lifestyle?

<p>

MS. BOYER: It is difficult in the sense that male 
homosexuality often entails sexual addictive-compulsive 
behaviors, where there are one-night encounters, that kind 
of thing.  But with women, it is a whole different thing.  
It is much more an emotional enmeshment that is very, very 
difficult to break, because when two women come together in 
this kind of relationship, you are both broken people in a 
lot of pain, in need to be loved and accepted, a lack of 
identity, a lack of self-worth, and then you come together 
enmeshed, and you see the other person as survival.  You see 
this person as vital to your survival.

<p>

What I do is, when I am talking to two women who 
are involved, I would not initially tell them that they have 
to break off the relationship.  I help them first identify 
the hurts that they are dealing with.  Eventually, as time 
goes on, they begin to let go of the relationship.

<p>

But it is much like grieving the loss of a loved 
one.  There is a process where you grieve, you allow the 
feelings to come up, you get to a point where you accept the 
fact that the person is no longer coming back, or maybe 
through divorce or whatever.  This is much the same way.

<p>

When someone breaks off in a relationship, it is a 
very, very painful process.  And unless you are willing to 
go through this process with them, we need to leave them 
alone and refer them to someone who is willing to go through 
that process with them.

<p>

So it is more than just saying to two women, no 
more contact and you need to cut it off.  It is a process.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's the nature of the bond.

<p>

MS. BOYER: Exactly.  It is a very difficult bond 
to break, and it does take time.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There are international ministries 
that reach out to homosexuals and are a support system for 
homosexuals.

<p>

MS. BOYER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Could you tell us about them?

<p>

MS. BOYER: Well, Exodus is a worldwide coalition 
of Christian organizations reaching out to those who desire 
freedom from homosexuality.  Once a year they hold a 
national conference whereas 500, 600 people attend.  These 
people come from all over the country, around the world, 
proclaiming freedom from homosexuality.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We now bring you Robert 
Knight, FRC's Director of Cultural Studies.  Over the years, 
Bob has presented the often unpopular facts about 
homosexuality and the destruction it brings to individuals, 
families, and society.

<p>

Bob has been accused of hatemongering and called 
many names.  But the truth about Bob's perspective could be 
seen at a press conference opening the second annual 
National Coming OUT OF Homosexuality Day.  Let's take a 
look.

<p>

[Segment from National Coming OUT OF Homosexuality 
Day Press Conference, held October 10, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: First, I would like to thank Michael 
Johnston for organizing this event.  Michael, as you have 
seen, is a man of great courage and integrity.  He is a 
great personal friend, and I grieve with him and his parents 
as we watch him struggle with this deadly disease that has 
invaded his body.

<p>

But I thank God that he has the courage to say the 
things he does in order that others may not fall into that 
path and suffer the same consequences.  A lot of people 
aren't willing to do that, and you can see the tragedy 
unfold.  You can just wander down to the Mall and look at 
that AIDS quilt.

<p>

For Family Research Council, our concern is the 
same as Michael's, that the facts aren't getting out about 
this vital issue affecting all Americans.  You only hear one 
side normally, and that is the mantra of tolerance, of 
acceptance.

<p>

But you have to wonder what we are being asked to 
accept.  If being asked to accept more of the kind of 
behavior that has made that AIDS quilt possible is what we 
are being asked to accept, that is unacceptable.

<p>

When the facts are known, most people turn from 
homosexuality and reject it in terms of support.  It is not 
easy for those struggling with these desires.  But I think 
one of the bigger lies that is told about the lifestyle is 
that somehow homosexuals are different from the rest of us, 
that they have an exemption from the responsibility to live 
by the rules of nature and nature's God that the rest of us 
have.

<p>

Well, the good news is that homosexuals really are 
no different from anybody else, and they have the same 
chance for salvation as anybody.  Everybody struggles with 
lusts and temptations.  The idea of a sexual orientation 
without sexual behavior is a patent absurdity, because we 
are concerned about the behavior.  We are concerned about 
the consequences of that behavior, and not just physical but 
the emotional consequences, the effect on people's families.

<p>

This whole idea that what you do sexually is only 
your own business is another great myth, because it does 
affect other people.  Everybody with children knows that if 
the kids go out and you don't know where they are until 2 in 
the morning, you can bet that affects you deeply.  It isn't 
just them.

<p>

The idea that once you're gay, you're always gay, 
is the mantra of the gay rights movement.  You're born that 
way.  Genetic studies allege to show that there is a genetic 
component to homosexuality.

<p>

All too often we have seen the media -- and I am 
not criticizing anybody in particular here -- rush to accept 
these studies without critical analysis.  But even a cursory 
glance at these studies for a genetic basis for 
homosexuality reveals that you can drive a truck through 
them.  They have terrific holes.  Reputable scientists in 
major scientific journals have discredited them and said 
that whatever they show, it isn't a genetic cause for 
homosexuality.

<p>

I would like to see that reported, because a lot 
of people struggling with homosexuality, particularly young 
people in their teens, raging with hormones, wondering who 
they are, shouldn't be told that they are inescapably gay 
just because they have had some thoughts in that direction.

<p>

We have seen a major movement into America's 
schools with the message that homosexuality has to be 
affirmed because we have to conquer homophobia.  Gay 
students have to be singled out and affirmed in their 
sexuality lest they get suicidal.  This is recruitment, 
plain and simple.  It is a way of shepherding people into a 
death style.  It has got to stop, and I think Americans will 
stop it if they get the facts about it.

<p>

I think most Americans are not aware of how heavy 
the propaganda is in America's schools.  We are now seeing 
it on America's television programs.  In Los Angeles 
magazine two months ago, a gay writer bragged that virtually 
all situation comedies on television are written, produced, 
and directed by homosexuals, who do have an agenda, and it 
goes beyond just leave us alone, just tolerate what we do.  
It is to force acceptance of this lifestyle, this death 
style, on the rest of America.

<p>

What is the gay attitude that they are projecting 
through these television shows?  According to the gay 
writer, it is an ironic detachment from anything else going 
on in the programs; in other words, the outsider's point of 
view.  It is also a heavy dose of sexuality and sexual 
innuendo.

<p>

I don't think I am the only person in America who 
has noticed that American situation comedies are just 
drenched with sexuality and of a type that smacks of the gay 
lifestyle.  It all has to do with casual sex, hit-and-run 
sex, lusting after bodies instead of hearts.  It is anything 
but a healthy lifestyle that we are being sold on America's 
TV screens.

<p>

One thing Family Research Council does is try to 
present facts that you won't find in major media.  I come 
out of a media background myself.  I was an editor for the 
<i>Los Angeles Times</i> for seven years and worked for newspapers 
for 15 years on both coasts.  And I can tell you, I have 
never seen an issue treated with less objectivity than the 
homosexual rights issue. You are only getting one side out 
there, and we are here to present the other side with 
courageous people like Michael Johnston.

<p>

What we are here to do today is to bring hope.  We 
are not here to talk about policy decisions or governmental 
rules or regulations.  We are here to talk about human 
beings and human hearts that can change when they are 
presented the truth.  The truth is Jesus Christ can bring 
anybody to salvation, can heal any wound, can bring a 
wholesome, full spiritual being to anyone.  And if 
homosexuals are being told they are somehow not qualified 
for that, well, that's a lie.  They are loved by God like 
everyone else, and they deserve the same chance.  If you are 
out there struggling with homosexuality, don't believe the 
lie that you can't change.

<p>

[Conclusion of segment.]

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, you will 
hear how you can receive more information about the topics 
affecting you, your family, and our nation. Don't go away.

Research Council or anything we discussed, call us at 1-800-225-4008.

<p>

Next week we are going to bring you a perspective 
on election issues from the unique viewpoint of women.
Since the suffrage movement, women have fought to make their 
mark in political discussions that shape our nation.  Is the 
women's movement what it was in the sixties as women battle 
for equal rights?  Do single mothers have a voice in our 
nation?

<p>

You will hear the answers to those questions and 
more when we bring you more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. Thanks for watching.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When the <a href="http://www.npr.gov">National Performance Review</a> (NPR) was unveiled with great fanfare in September 1993, President Clinton promised to "reinvent" the federal government because "it's not just broke, it's broken."  Now, as it celebrates the NPR's third anniversary, the White House claims its reinventing efforts have saved taxpayers $118 billion and "reduced the size of the federal workforce by nearly 240,000 workers -- its smallest level in 30 years."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The reality, however, is quite different: Most government agencies remain both broke and broken. While it is true that there are fewer civilian federal workers than at any point since 1965, the NPR's purported savings (even if taken at face value) amount to shaving only one penny from every federal dollar spent. Sadly, there is little evidence to show that even these meager amounts actually accrued as real savings for American taxpayers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Over the past four years, both the tax burden on families and the level of federal spending have gone up, not down. If the Administration truly had downsized the government, taxpayers would have reaped a tax windfall and Uncle Sam would have spent proportionately less. But instead of realizing a smaller budget from these savings, Washington will spend nearly $190 billion more this year than it did in 1992, George Bush's last year in office -- a 14 percent increase.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Moreover, the elimination of some 240,000 positions in the federal workforce has been achieved without terminating one major agency. The reason is simple: 75 percent of these reductions were in national defense-related civilian positions. Today, Washington is simply spending more taxpayer money with fewer workers. Spending per government worker has jumped 30 percent since 1993. This is hardly the kind of efficiency taxpayers might expect from a government the President says should work better and cost less.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The NPR's reinvention efforts have done little to cure the widespread cancer of waste and mismanagement throughout the government. Dozens of reports issued recently by such official "watchdogs" as the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) and various agency Inspectors General (IGs) confirm that the Clinton Administration has failed to address the most serious problems in government agencies: severe financial mismanagement, lack of management accountability, widespread program duplication and fragmentation, poor stewardship of government assets, and the ability of programs to survive long after they have become obsolete.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Financial Weaknesses.</b> GAO and Inspector General audits have "identified hundreds of billions of dollars of accounting errors -- mistakes and omissions that can render information provided to managers and the Congress virtually useless."<sup>2</sup>  Even at the Internal Revenue Service, some $1.4 trillion in total revenue and $122 billion in tax refunds cannot be verified or reconciled; nor can the IRS substantiate the amounts reported for taxes collected (including Social Security, income, and excise taxes).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Management Weaknesses.</b> The Department of Housing and Urban Development's own Inspector General found that HUD never completed its 1993 reorganization plan and that, because of HUD's continuing resource management weaknesses, there is little assurance that its $1 billion annual salaries and expenses budget is used either efficiently or effectively to further the agency's mission and minimize program risks.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Federal Dinosaurs Saved from Extinction.</b> The Rural Electrification Administration was created in 1935 to help local utility companies bring electricity to rural areas. In 1949, REA's mission was expanded, with the assistance of Congress, to provide loans to rural telephone companies. REA continues today as part of the new Rural Utilities Service created by the Clinton Administration and the 103rd Congress. The new agency will give grants and loans to improve rural water and sewer service as well.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Rampant Duplication.</b> The Department of Commerce shares its mission with at least 71 other federal departments, agencies, and offices; for example, export promotion programs are fragmented among 19 agencies. "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, not Commerce, receives about 74 percent of total funding for these programs, although it accounts for only about 10 percent of U.S. exports."<sup>3</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Poor Stewardship of Federal Assets.</b> According to many sources, the known environmental cleanup costs at government-owned facilities could reach $400 billion over the next few decades; as much as $350 billion of this liability is forecast for Department of Energy facilities alone. In addition, hundreds of other government-owned physical assets, such as the National Highway System, the National Park System, dams, waterways, computer systems, and buildings, are coming dangerously close to collapse.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These examples of rampant government waste and inefficiency have been well documented by Washington's own watchdogs. Yet while this waste and mismanagement persists, the White House has pushed an agenda of pseudo-reform designed to get media attention rather than to get to the root of government's most pressing problems. The truth is that the Administration's reinventing government program has had little material impact on the day-to-day lives of ordinary Americans. Taxpayers want real solutions for the deep problems facing the federal government. They do not want obsolete and inefficient government programs simply to waste their money more efficiently.
<p>
<b>REINVENTING GOVERNMENT BY SAVING PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The White House claim that the National Performance Review has produced the smallest government in 30 years derives from a fundamental error: The Administration wrongly equates the size of government with the size of the civilian workforce. While the number of federal workers has declined, the NPR's efforts have neither stemmed the tide of government spending nor halted the persistent waste and mismanagement that plague most federal agencies. Quite simply, Washington is just as wasteful and costly today as it was when the Administration began reinventing government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

When the White House released the first report of the National Performance Review (known as NPR Phase I) on September 7, 1993, Americans were told that this was a blueprint for "reinventing" government. The six-month-long effort produced over 1,200 specific recommendations intended to "make government work better and cost less."  The Administration promised that the NPR's recommendations would save $108 billion between FY 1995 and FY 1999.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

NPR Phase I savings were expected to come from five major reform initiatives. The White House claimed that the bulk of the savings ($40 billion) would come from "Streamlining the Bureaucracy Through Reengineering" by cutting the civil service by a total of 252,000 full-time equivalent positions (FTEs). About 20 percent of the expected savings was to come from "Reinventing Federal Procurement," while lesser savings would be achieved by "Reengineering Through Information Technology" and "Reducing Intergovernmental Administrative Costs."  Finally, over $36.4 billion was expected to be saved from "Changes in Individual Agencies" even though at least $8 billion of this amount was from new revenues, not spending cuts.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1995, the Administration released NPR Phase II as a response to the serious downsizing proposals being debated within the new Republican-controlled Congress. These new initiatives were predicted to save an additional $69 billion through FY 1999, bringing the total expected savings from "reinventing government" to $177 billion.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

From day one, however, it was clear that even the first phase would have a minimal impact on the size and scope of the federal budget. First, the much-touted $108 billion in savings actually represented a small fraction of projected federal spending. At the time the NPR report was released, the Congressional Budget Office projected federal spending would total $8.73 trillion for fiscal years 1995-1999. Thus, the $108 billion the White House claimed it would save from reinventing government amounted to just 1.2 cents for every dollar the government was projected to spend over the five-year period.<sup>4</sup>  Adding the NPR's Phase II proposals to this formula brings the total savings on every dollar of federal spending to just two cents. Second, the White House boosted its promised savings by basing its estimates on a "baseline" projection of federal spending. A baseline assumes that federal programs will grow because of such factors as economic inflation, population expansion, and other statutory formulas; it therefore follows that small programmatic changes can alter a baseline projection considerably -- and that any "savings" calculated from such a baseline also will be overstated considerably.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Because of these problems, the GAO reported that it could neither confirm nor track the NPR's promised savings. When Members of Congress specifically asked the GAO to look at the Administration's Phase II estimates, the GAO said "it would be difficult or impossible to verify most of the NPR II savings estimates."<sup>5</sup>  With respect to the elusive nature of such estimates, the GAO observed that:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	All savings estimates, including those for the NPR II recommendations, are point-in-time estimates. That is, they are measurements of future anticipated savings based on the policies and economic conditions prevailing at the time the estimate is made. Once an estimate is prepared and time passes, it becomes difficult or impossible to retrace the original steps and reconstruct events in order to determine the validity of the original estimate.... [E]ven if the NPR II savings estimates could be shown to have been correct at the time, we could not effectively track for most of the proposals whether the savings estimated are being achieved.<sup>6</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Superficial Savings from Reinventing Government</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Given the difficulty encountered by the GAO in trying to measure the accuracy of the White House's savings estimates, taxpayers and the media should be cautious in accepting at face value the latest figures claimed in the NPR's third annual report, <i>The Best Kept Secrets in Government</i>, released on September 20, 1996. The Administration claims in this report that its measures will have achieved about $118 billion in eventual savings between fiscal years 1995 and 2000.<sup>7</sup>  This total represents roughly two-thirds of the promised savings from NPR Phase I combined with roughly one-third of the expected savings from NPR Phase II.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These savings are trivial when compared to Washington's appetite for spending. Current CBO estimates put total federal spending (actual and projected) for fiscal years 1995-2000 at over $10 trillion. Thus, the Administration's "banked" savings of $118 billion will amount to just 1.2 cents for every federal dollar spent during this period. Unfortunately, even these modest savings will not accrue as actual savings for taxpayers, having disappeared instead into more government spending.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The most misleading Administration claim is the so-called savings achieved by reducing the federal civilian workforce, which the NPR proposed to cut by 252,000 full-time equivalents (FTEs).<sup>8</sup>  In March 1994, Congress passed, and President Clinton signed, the Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994, which enacted the Administration's goal of reducing the civilian workforce but raised the number of positions to be cut to 272,000. While federal agencies are well underway in their efforts to meet this goal, these efforts have not yet led to a smaller government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
First, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994 would save taxpayers $32.8 billion over five years. It is interesting to note that this estimate is 20 percent less than the amount the White House calculated would be saved by cutting 20,000 fewer FTEs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Second, the so-called savings achieved by these reductions were not dedicated to deficit reduction. Instead, Congress and the President used them to finance the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, commonly known as the 1994 crime bill. To be sure, many taxpayers would rather spend money on so-called crime prevention programs than on federal bureaucrats. However, the White House has grossly misled taxpayers by implying that this reduction in the federal workforce has saved taxpayers' money.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ironically, though Clinton's FY 1997 budget projects the number of civilian federal workers to be the smallest since 1965, the cost of the civilian workforce continues to escalate. As Chart 1 shows, since 1993 the number of civilian FTEs has declined by 11 percent, but the total cost of the civilian workforce has increased by 4.5 percent, from $111 billion to $115 billion. The reduced costs associated with the 17 percent decline in civilian defense employment since 1993 masks an 8 percent, or $5.7 billion, increase in the costs of employing non-defense government workers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

And third, the Administration rarely mentions that 75 percent of the total federal workforce reductions have come at the expense of civilian workers at the Department of Defense (DOD). According to recent testimony by an official of the General Accounting Office:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Although the workforce reductions occurred governmentwide, they were not evenly distributed among agencies. Indeed, most of the downsizing took place at DOD. [As is shown in Table 3,] DOD absorbed nearly three quarters of the FTE reductions in fiscal year 1994 and over half of the governmentwide reductions in fiscal year 1995. In fiscal year 1997, <i>DOD is expected to absorb all of the FTE reductions made that year while the non-DOD workforce is expected to increase by a net total of 0.2 percent</i>, according to the President's fiscal year 1997 budget [emphasis added].<sup>9</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While the civilian workforce is the smallest it has been since 1965, the Administration should not imply -- as it often does -- that all parts of the government are smaller. While DOD's civilian workforce today is 22 percent smaller than it was in 1965, the non-DOD civilian workforce is 40 percent larger today than 30 years ago. This follows the overall shift in federal resources away from national defense toward domestic spending.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

When the young Bill Clinton had his picture taken with President John F. Kennedy in the White House Rose Garden, defense spending consumed 50 percent of all federal spending and about 10 percent of the nation's economy. Under Clinton's policies, defense spending has fallen to less than 17 percent of overall federal spending and roughly 3.6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Both levels are lower than at any point since before World War II.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The bottom line is that overall federal spending has continued to grow despite three years of reinventing government. Since 1992, total federal spending is up by $189 billion, almost 14 percent; and it would be much higher had defense spending not declined by $36 billion during this same period, a process that began under George Bush. Indeed, non-defense domestic spending has increased $195 billion, or 23 percent, since 1992. This spending would have been considerably higher if the 104th Congress had not forced Clinton into accepting spending bills that cut discretionary spending for the first time in 25 years and terminated some 270 programs and projects.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In a perverse way, the NPR has achieved its goal of making the federal workforce more efficient. When Clinton kicked off the NPR in 1993, overall federal spending amounted to roughly $653,600 per federal worker. Under the President's proposed FY 1997 budget, however, the government would spend $856,000 per federal worker, an increase of some $202,000, or 30 percent.<sup>10</sup>  This means that the typical government worker wastes 30 percent more taxpayers' dollars today than before the onset of the Administration's reform efforts.
<p>
<b>FEW NPR ACTION ITEMS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One of the chief reasons the NPR -- especially in Phase I -- has recorded so few savings in its three-year effort to reinvent government is that few of its recommendations have been undertaken by federal agencies. While it is too early to assess the progress of NPR Phase II, the GAO's recent analysis of the Phase I successes claimed by the White House found that only 294 (24 percent) of the 1,203 original "action items necessary to implement the NPR's recommendations to make the government work better and cost less" were completed by January 1996.<sup>11</sup>  Moreover, the NPR recorded a total of 380 recommendations as completed, but the GAO found that nearly one-fourth of these had yet to be completed.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In some cases, the GAO noted that the agencies either modified or watered down the original recommendations to make them more achievable. In one case, for example, "The description in NPR's records for action item PROC15.03 was changed from 'train procurement officials on source selection techniques' to 'develop a course to train procurement officials.'"<sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As amusing as such findings may be, the fact remains that neither of these recommendations has any substantive bearing on the size or scope of government or on the actual service delivered to taxpayers. Indeed, both of these action items are process-oriented pseudo-reforms designed by bureaucrats to benefit bureaucrats.
<p>
<b>Pseudo-Reforms, Pseudo-Results</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Many of the NPR Phase I action items marked completed fall into such a category of "pseudo-reforms."  They often sound impressive, and a few may even make the bureaucracy work better for bureaucrats. But they have little substantive impact, either on the functioning of the program or on its cost to taxpayers. Indeed, the bureaucracy often invents these pseudo-reforms to divert attention from the real question of whether or not the program should exist at all. Management expert Peter Drucker has criticized the NPR on this point:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In any institution other than the federal government, the changes being trumpeted as reinventions would not even be announced, except perhaps on the bulletin board in the hallway. They are the kinds of things that a hospital expects floor nurses to do on their own; that a bank manager expects branch managers to do on their own; that even a poorly-run manufacturer expects supervisors to do on their own -- without getting much praise, let alone any extra rewards.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Indeed, by focusing attention on <I>reinventing</i> government rather than <i>downsizing</i> government, the NPR unwittingly validated the process by which government workers block real reforms with pseudo-reforms and the way in which programs continually recast themselves to justify their existence. The continuous process of reinvention is how programs designed 40 or 50 years ago to address a specific problem can continue decades after the reason for their creation has passed. The fact that the NPR put so much trust in bureaucrats to reform their agencies and programs from within has contributed to this and, in some cases, has led to a reduction rather than an increase in accountability. In the end, the government may work better for bureaucrats, but not for all Americans.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The accompanying sample of completed NPR action items -- for which the White House now proudly congratulates itself -- illustrates the kind of pseudo-reforms that would not merit notice on Drucker's bulletin board.<sup>14</sup>

<p>
<b>A GOVERNMENT IN SHAMBLES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The problems facing the federal government are not trivial, and they merit serious action by the White House. Washington institutions have become monuments to the needs and priorities of the 19th century, the Great Depression, World War II, and the Great Society. No amount of "reinventing" can turn institutions that were created to address problems the nation faced 30, 50, or even 100 years ago into agencies capable of meeting the needs of Americans in the 21st century.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite the Administration's effort to streamline and improve the functioning of federal agencies, severe waste and mismanagement persist throughout the government. The government's own "watchdogs," such as the General Accounting Office and various agency Inspectors General, confirm that the problems plaguing agencies include severe financial mismanagement, lack of management accountability, widespread program duplication and fragmentation, poor stewardship of government assets, and the ability of programs to survive long after they have become obsolete.
<p>
<b>Financial Weaknesses</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As Bill Clinton entered the White House in 1993, the GAO warned that "widespread financial management weaknesses are crippling the ability of our leaders to effectively run the federal government.... Not only does the government do an abysmal job of rudimentary bookkeeping, but it is also far from having the modern financial systems one would expect of a superpower."<sup>15</sup>  Unfortunately, the situation has changed little since the GAO issued its report.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Indeed, the GAO and most agency Inspectors General continue to uncover vast amounts of financial mismanagement in federal agencies of all sizes, from the $570 million Corporation for National Service to the $55 billion U.S. Department of Agriculture. The problems identified range from "shortcomings in accounting and financial systems" to "material weaknesses in the internal controls for financial management that result in a lack of accurate and reliable financial information."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While taxpayers are right to be shocked by reports of widespread financial mismanagement in government, Members of Congress -- who are responsible for approving funding for federal programs -- should be no less so. Unless those responsible for administering a program can provide a full accounting of how taxpayers' money was spent in the past, Members should be hesitant to spend more taxpayers' money on that program. As the GAO reported recently:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Financial audits have also shown that agencies often do not follow rudimentary bookkeeping practices, such as reconciling their accounting records with Treasury accounts or their own subsidiary ledgers. <i>These audits have identified hundreds of billions of dollars of accounting errors -- mistakes and omissions that can render information provided to managers and the Congress virtually useless</i> [emphasis added].<sup>16</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As U.S. Comptroller General Charles Bowsher has testified to Congress, the federal government is the nation's largest single source of credit, yet lending programs cannot provide accurate and reliable data. According to Bowsher, the FY 1994 financial audit reports from the Farmers Home Administration, Federal Housing Administration, Federal Family Education Loan Program, and Small Business Administration "revealed that agencies' estimates of the subsidy costs of their credit programs reflected in the budget are not accurate. Based on these audits, budget decisionmakers know that they have reason to question the amount of future budget requests for these agencies."<sup>17</sup>  Even worse is the acknowledgment that lending agencies are not able to collect on the loans they have made or guaranteed. As of the end of FY 1994, "the government reported (1) $241 billion in nontax receivables, of which $49 billion, or 20 percent, was reported to be delinquent and (2) $694 billion in guarantees of outstanding loans for which it was contingently liable."<sup>18</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In light of these serious financial management problems, the Administration incredibly proposed to reorient the mission of agency Inspectors General away from oversight and toward a more management-oriented role.<sup>19</sup>  According to Ronald C. Moe, a scholar at the Congressional Research Service and Johns Hopkins University:
<blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The report criticizes the IGs for being overzealous in their pursuit of "waste, fraud and abuse...."  The report repeats that it is interested in results, not processes. Therefore it views IGs as a problem since they are designed to punish those who violate processes.... The answer to the problem of overzealous IGs is to reculturate them to think and act less like IGs and more like managers.20
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Implementing such a recommendation would effectively neutralize the abilities of the principal fiscal watchdogs within each agency and thereby further erode the financial accountability of government workers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To varying degrees, nearly every major federal agency suffers from some form of financial management problem. Examples of problems in the following agencies vary from a lack of qualified accounting staff to an inability to maintain accurate records.
<p>
<b>Department of Agriculture</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In financial terms, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is one of the federal government's most troubled agencies. In FY 1994, the USDA spent over $60 billion, yet the agency's Inspector General was unable to express an opinion on its financial statements for the year because of system-wide weaknesses in the department's financial accounting system. Among the problems cited by the IG:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	We were unable to substantiate certain cash balances because of unsupported write-offs and adjustments. Reconciliations were not always performed appropriately and balances reported for certain Treasury symbols contained unexplained negative balances.<sup>21</sup>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	We also could not determine whether approximately $500 million in accounts receivable and $445 million in accounts payable balances were materially stated.<sup>22</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Sufficient, competent evidential matter was also unavailable to support the reasonableness of about $32.8 billion in "Credit Program Receivables and Related Foreclosed Property" and $485 million in "Estimated Losses on Loan Guarantees."<sup>23</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	We noted inadequate documentation, pervasive instances of error and material control weaknesses when accounting for approximately $7 billion of Property, Plant and Equipment.<sup>24</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Department does not maintain an integrated, automated system for maintaining applicable records, existing records were not consistently updated, supporting documentation was inadequate, and capitalization rates were not consistently applied.<sup>25</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Food and Consumer Service (FCS) could not provide "sufficient, competent, evidential matter to fully support" about $13.5 billion in "primary grant operating/program expenses for the Child Nutrition Programs, Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), Food Stamp Program Administration, and Food Donation Program."  Nor could it document "nonoperating changes stated at about $3.2 billion."<sup>26</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The General Accounting Office has also noted severe financial weaknesses in other USDA-administered programs. For example:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	At the request of Representatives John Kasich (R-OH) and Don Young (R-AK), the GAO asked the U.S. Forest Service to provide revenue and cost data for each of the national forests it manages for fiscal years 1992-1995. In FY 1995 alone, "over $1.3 billion was appropriated to manage the National Forest System, and revenue generated from the use of the forests totaled about $1.0 billion."  However, the USFS was unable to comply with the GAO's request "because of shortcomings in its accounting and financial information systems" which "does not enable the Service to associate the costs incurred in generating revenues from various forest uses."  USFS officials admitted that there were "various material weaknesses in the internal controls for financial management that result in a lack of accurate and reliable financial information...."<sup>27</sup>

</blockquote><p>

<b>Department of Commerce</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Despite years of stern warnings, the Commerce Department's Inspector General continues to find department-wide material weaknesses in financial management systems.<sup>28</sup>  Among the more severe problems identified by the IG:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	During our survey of BXA [the Bureau of Export Administration], we identified significant deficiencies in the internal control structure that would inhibit the agency's ability to produce accurate, reliable financial information.<sup>29</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	We have repeatedly reported on the inadequacies in Census' financial management practices and systems, identifying several obstacles to change: lack of senior financial managers and leadership, lack of designation of financial management as a bureau priority, and lack of qualified financial management staff.<sup>30</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The IG gave qualified (disclaimer) financial audits of the Economic Development Administration (EDA), International Trade Administration (ITA), and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), "all of which have multiple material weaknesses and have shown only limited improvement."<sup>31</sup>
<p>
<b>Department of Defense</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Though the Department of Defense spends over $250 billion annually and manages over $1 trillion in assets, according to the GAO, its financial management problems are so widespread that "no single military service or major component has been able to withstand the scrutiny of a financial statement audit."<sup>32</sup>  Though DOD is developing a new accounting system, the GAO reports that this system will not be completed until the end of FY 1998. This means the year 2000 is the earliest DOD's IG could render an audit opinion on the agency's financial statement.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Among the problems identified at DOD are overpayments and errors in record keeping:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	As of August 1995, DOD problem disbursements -- those for which the Department can not match a disbursement with a related obligation -- were reported to be $28 billion -- and DOD continues to make hundreds of millions of dollars in overpayments to its contractors. As a result, DOD can not ensure that it does not spend more than it is authorized -- a basic fund control responsibility;
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	DOD does not have adequate records or controls over the multibillion dollar investment in government furnished property and equipment;
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	[T]o an even greater extent than other military services, the Navy is plagued by troublesome financial management deficiencies involving tens of billions of dollars.<sup>33</sup>

</blockquote>
<p>
<b>U.S. Department of Energy</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This year, the Department of Energy's Inspector General could not express an opinion on DOE's Consolidated Statement of Financial Position for FY 1995 because "the audit disclosed reportable conditions in the Department's internal control structure that adversely affected its ability to manage and account for its assets and liabilities."<sup>34</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Specifically, "these weaknesses related to estimating the Department's unfunded environmental liability of $196 billion, accountability and valuation of over $23 billion in property, plant, and equipment, and the inability of the Department's financial management system to produce adjusted consolidated financial statements."<sup>35</sup>
<p>

<b>Department of the Interior</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Trust Funds Management oversees Indian trust fund accounts totaling about "$2.6 billion, including approximately $2.1 billion for about 1,500 tribal accounts and about $453 million for nearly 390,000 Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts."<sup>36</sup>  Remarkably, though some of these accounts were 50 to 100 years old, they had never been reconciled until BIA undertook this effort in 1991. According to the GAO:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	[D]espite over 5 years of effort and about $21 million in contracting fees, due to missing records, a total of $2.4 billion... could not be traced to supporting documentation and only about 10 percent of the leases selected for reconciliation could be verified.<sup>37</sup>
</blockquote><p>

<b>Department of Justice</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Department of Justice claims that one of the reasons its major bureaus, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement Administration, Immigration and Naturalization Service, U.S. Attorneys Office, and U.S. Marshals Service, have not been audited is the "lack of experienced staff to prepare financial statements."<sup>38</sup>  DOJ also claims it lacks the funds necessary to contract for the audits.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) is supposed to collect fees for serving legal processes. However, DOJ's Inspector General found that "none of the districts calculated fees and commission correctly" and that "over 80 percent of the districts did not collect all fees due."  Moreover, the IG "could not estimate whether the USMS was over- or under-collecting fees because 67 percent of districts did not track all information needed to perform this calculation."<sup>39</sup>
<p>
<b>Department of the Treasury</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Of all the Cabinet departments, the Department of the Treasury is the one most Americans would agree should be beyond financial reproach. Unfortunately, however, Treasury manages two of the government's more financially troubled agencies -- the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Customs Service.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Internal Revenue Service.</b> As the principal agency charged with collecting revenue for the U.S. Treasury, the Internal Revenue Service has perhaps the worst financial management system in all of government. This year, as in past years, the GAO could not audit the IRS's books because of widespread financial deficiencies. Among the problems identified by the GAO:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The amounts of total revenue ($1.4 trillion) and tax refunds ($122 billion) cannot be verified or reconciled to accounting records maintained for individual taxpayers in the aggregate.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The amounts reported for taxes collected (social security, income, and excise taxes, for example) cannot be substantiated.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The reliability of reported estimates of $113 billion for valid accounts receivable and $46 billion for collectible accounts receivable cannot be determined.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	A significant portion of the agency's reported $3 billion in nonpayroll operating expenses cannot be verified.<sup>40</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Customs Service.</b> Only the Internal Revenue Service collects more revenue for the federal Treasury than the U.S. Customs Service. Audits have uncovered financial management problems so severe that, according to the GAO, they "impaired Customs' ability to effectively ensure that carriers, importers, and their agents complied with laws intended to ensure fair trade practices and protect the American people from unsafe and illegal [<i>sic</i>] imported goods."<sup>41</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The GAO reported the following problems, which Customs claims it is committed to correcting. The GAO found that Customs did not:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	adequately ensure that all goods imported into the United States were properly identified and that the related duties, taxes, and fees on imports, reported to be over $21 billion for fiscal year 1993, were properly assessed and collected;
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	have adequate controls to detect and prevent excessive or duplicate refund payments;
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	have adequate accountability over tons of illegal drugs and millions of dollars of cash and property seized or used in its enforcement efforts....<sup>42</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Department of Veterans Affairs</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Department of Veterans Affairs' Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal years 1994 and 1995 could not be certified by the Inspector General because DVA's "unreliable" accounting records, procedures, and internal controls did not support the $11.4 billion reported for real property, plant, and equipment, as well as the $3.3 billion in net receivables.<sup>43</sup>
<p>
<b>Independent Agencies</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Financial management problems are not limited to the major Cabinet-level agencies. Smaller, independent agencies also show a lack of financial accountability. For example:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Corporation for National and Community Service.</b> Created in 1993, the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNS) is one of the youngest agencies in the federal government. Spending some $570 million annually, it administers such programs as AmeriCorps, VISTA, and the National Civilian Community Corps.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Despite being such a young agency, independent auditors "found that CNS' general ledger system is outmoded and poorly designed."  The auditors informed the program's Inspector General "that due to weaknesses in CNS' financial systems, accounting records and management controls, the financial statements were unauditable."<sup>44</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Environmental Protection Agency.</b> The EPA's Inspector General could not determine whether the FY 1995 Superfund Trust Fund Financial Statements were accurate because of "weaknesses in the areas of accounting for property, accounting for the components of net position, recording reimbursable Superfund oversight costs as assets," and numerous other technical problems.<sup>45</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The IG could not verify the accuracy of the financial statements for the Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Trust Fund, the Oil Spill Trust Fund, and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Fund.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The IG also found material weaknesses in the Agency's property management system. "We found leases that had not been capitalized, inventories had not been completed at some locations, and some contractors did not provide reports on the value of EPA property in their possession."<sup>46</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Social Security Administration.</b> The Social Security Administration's Inspector General found that the systems which generate the Agency's accounts receivable data continue to suffer material weaknesses. According to the IG, "<I>the SSA's overpayment systems cannot identify how much is owed or collected</I> [emphasis added]."<sup>47</sup>

<p>
<b>Management Weaknesses</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The National Performance Review argues persuasively that the industrial-age management structures employed by government agencies are no longer suited to "today's world of rapid change, lightning-quick information technologies, tough global competition, and demanding customers.... "<sup>48</sup> After all, suggests the report, "Saturn isn't run the way General Motors was. Intel isn't run the way IBM was."<sup>49</sup>  The NPR's solution to this problem is to reinvent federal agencies into "entrepreneurial organizations" with authority devolved to the lowest possible level.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As persuasive as this line of argument might be, some analysts suggest that devolving authority in government -- a politically rooted institution -- can lead to the unintended consequence of undermining presidential authority. Ronald Moe is highly critical of the NPR's entrepreneurial agenda. Moe writes that under the NPR's management theory of devolution:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	[T]he President's management responsibilities and authorities will be diminished as will be the institutional capacity of the central management agencies....  The President, in turn, is seen more as a catalytic agent than as the legal agent of a sovereign power.<sup>50</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Instead of increasing bureaucratic accountability, Moe argues, the NPR's agenda will reduce accountability:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The net result of the Gore Report when its recommendations are implemented to the maximum degree possible in the political realm will be a government much less accountable to the citizens for its performance. The institutional presidency and the central management agencies are being intentionally weakened in their management roles.
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Indeed, most federal agencies suffer management weaknesses that result in fraud, waste, cost overruns, and no accountability for program performance.
<p>
<b>Department of Agriculture</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Roughly half of the Department of Agriculture's $55 billion per year budget is spent on one program -- the Food Stamp Program (FSP). Waste, fraud, and abuse in the Food Stamp Program has been estimated by the USDA Inspector General at $3 billion per year. Yet, according to the IG, the Food and Consumer Service (FCS), which runs the Food Stamp Program, "does not require preauthorization visits to applicant stores. After authorization, periodic visits are not made unless trafficking is suspected."  During a recent nationwide sweep of more than 5,000 stores, the IG found that one-sixth (roughly 830) clearly were not eligible for the program. Among the ineligible vendors cited were a pizza restaurant in California, a vacant store in St. Louis, and the owner of 12 ice cream trucks in South Carolina.<sup>51</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Error rates in the Food Stamp Program have escalated since 1989. According to the Department of Agriculture's Inspector General, the combined value of FSP overpayments and underpayments jumped from $1.1 billion in FY 1989 to approximately $2.3 billion in FY 1994.<sup>52</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

All states were to have implemented the Disqualified Recipient System (DRS) by April 1994. This Food Stamp monitoring system is intended to "track individuals who have been disqualified from FSP because of intentional program violations."<sup>53</sup>  However, in 1996 the IG found that 26 states had not fully implemented the tracking system. As a result, thousands of individuals who have been disqualified in one state could apply for benefits in another state or county without being caught.
<p>
<b>Department of Commerce</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although it has the smallest budget of all the major Cabinet agencies, the Department of Commerce is a management nightmare. Even its own Inspector General admits Commerce has evolved into "a loose collection of more than 100 programs delivering services to about 1,000 customer bases."  The GAO reports that Commerce "faces the most complex web of divided authorities" by sharing its "missions with at least some 71 federal departments, agencies, and offices."<sup>54</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Examples of the department's more significant management problems include:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).</b> In 1992, NOAA began a $1.9 billion, 15-year plan to modernize its in-house fleet of research vessels. Since then, the Commerce Department's IG repeatedly has urged NOAA to explore more cost-effective options such as privatization. NOAA has ignored these suggestions even though the IG found that "(1) NOAA's fleet is clearly more expensive than available alternatives, (2) its decisions regarding the fleet have been based on faulty assumptions and inaccurate cost data, and (3) its actions have impeded attempts to form external partnerships with public and private sector organizations."<sup>55</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>National Weather Service (NWS).</b> For over ten years, NOAA's IG has warned repeatedly of management problems in the NWS's $4.5 billion modernization program. In a recent report, the IG focused on cost overruns and delays in just one part of the modernization program -- the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS). According to the IG, "In 1985 NOAA estimated that the [AWIPS] program would cost $350 million and be completed in 1995. As of 1995, the NOAA estimate had risen to $525 million, with a 1999 completion date. We believe that AWIPS will probably cost over $625 million and take nearly twice as long as originally planned."<sup>56</sup>  Further, the IG is "convinced that AWIPS is still dangerously schedule-driven: NOAA is attempting to develop and deploy the system much too quickly because the agency is under intense pressure to show progress."<sup>57</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Bureau of the Census.</b> The Commerce Department's IG recently questioned the readiness of the Bureau of the Census to implement the 2000 census. The IG found that "the bureau had selected a new design with questionable components" and "lacked an effective organization for planning and implementing the decennial."  The IG concluded that "the bureau's fragmented organizational and decision-making structure is not conducive to completing, substantiating, and implementing any design."<sup>58</sup>
<p>
<b>Department of Energy</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In response to plans by members of the 104th Congress to terminate the Department of Energy, the department embarked on its own Strategic Plan in April 1995. DOE management estimates this initiative will save about $1.7 billion over five years, a mere 2.5 percent of the $67.5 billion projected to be spent on DOE programs during the same period. DOE's management problems, especially its lax oversight of contractors, have been criticized repeatedly by the GAO and by the department's own Inspector General. GAO officials have testified that "DOE suffers from significant management problems, ranging from poor environmental management to major internal inefficiencies rooted in poor oversight...."<sup>59</sup>  Specific Inspector General findings include the following:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since 1989, DOE has 
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	received about $10 billion for environmental restoration projects at its 130 facilities across the country. These projects are aimed at cleaning up more than 10,500 individual waste sites.... To date, much of the $10 billion has gone to study waste sites and develop an approach to their remediation, as required by environmental laws, rather than to actually clean them up.<sup>60</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Attempts to establish direct accountability among program offices at headquarters, administrative units, field offices, and the national laboratories have been especially difficult. Reporting relationships changed often and sometimes have been confusing.<sup>61</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
An IG audit found that the department "spent about $29 million to design, modify and produce 87 accident resistant containers for the Air Force. However, the Air Force did not want them and expressed no desire to use these containers."  According to a GAO interview with DOE management, "this particular case was an exception in that the Department was responding to a 'sincerely felt' requirement."<sup>62</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The IG discovered that "the Department allowed arms and military-type equipment to be loaned for extended periods of time even though it had established specific policies prohibiting the practice."<sup>63</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In May 1995, DOE attempted to justify its existence in the face of congressional attacks by publishing <i>Success Stories: The Energy Mission in the Market Place. Success Stories</i> highlights over 60 technologies developed or supported by DOE's applied research and development programs. This report, however, only fueled congressional criticism following a GAO analysis of 15 randomly selected "success stories."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The GAO "found problems with the analysis DOE used to support the benefits cited in 11 out of the 15 cases" it reviewed. "These problems include basic math errors, problems in the supporting economic analysis, and unsupported links between the benefits cited and DOE's role or the technology. These problems make DOE's estimates of the benefits for these cases questionable."<sup>64</sup>
<p>
<b>Department of Housing and Urban Development</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Department of Housing and Urban Development has had a long and colorful history of scandal, from gross mismanagement to outright corruption. In December 1994, the Clinton Administration released HUD's "Reinvention Blueprint," intended to "improve HUD's overall program delivery structure."<sup>65</sup>  According to HUD's Inspector General, however, this blueprint and the 1993 reorganization plan that preceded it have largely failed to improve HUD's operations. The IG found that:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	HUD's 1993 reorganization was never fully completed, given that HUD's considerable headquarters resources were never reorganized, and the field office restructuring and staff reassignments were never fully carried out.... 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	HUD does not maintain a bottom-up budget formulation process to identify resource needs based on detailed analysis of its program roles, functions, processes and anticipated workloads.... 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In the OIG's [Office of Inspector General's] view, resource management decisions related to HUD's reinvention proposals have been made without sufficient analysis and detailed planning to assure the feasibility and benefits of the decisions.... 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	As a result of HUD's continuing resource management weaknesses, there is little assurance that HUD's $1 billion annual salaries and expenses budget is efficiently and effectively used to further HUD's mission and minimize program risks.<sup>66</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	HUD has only been able to accumulate rudimentary performance measure data for many of its programs.... 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	 The need for improved HUD enforcement culture is still frequently evidenced in the lack of management action on the results of OIG audit findings of waste, abuse and funding misuse in HUD programs.<sup>67</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Department of Justice</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Justice Department's Inspector General found that the Drug Enforcement Administration's "official property records were materially misstated."  With a property inventory of 111,000 items valued at some $290 million, DEA does "not have a comprehensive, reliable property management program."<sup>68</sup>
<p>
<b>Department of Transportation</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The recent resignation of DOT Inspector General Mary Schiavo because of unaddressed problems at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has drawn attention to the systemic management problems throughout the entire $39 billion agency. For instance, although the FAA employs about 5,000 people performing safety-related inspections and oversight, the IG discovered severe management weaknesses throughout the system:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	FAA's inventory acceptance procedures for aircraft parts purchased for FAA aircraft failed to detect that about 39 percent of the parts were of unknown origin and could not be traced to FAA-approved manufacturers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	FAA-established parts manufacturer approval process had been compromised, and manufacturers produced and sold replacement aircraft parts without an FAA-approved quality assurance manufacturing system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	FAA databases contained incomplete, inconsistent, and inaccurate data that does not reliably support safety-related decisions and will not effectively support FAA's inspection and certification mission.<sup>69</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In another safety-related program, the IG found that the Federal Highway Administration's "motor carrier assistance program safety inspections had limited effectiveness."<sup>70</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

DOT also has a poor track record in grant and asset management oversight. The Federal Transit Administration, for example, which gives out about $4.5 billion in grants annually, was placed on the GAO's "High-Risk" list of troubled programs because "FTA's past oversight and enforcement practices failed to protect the government from waste and mismanagement."<sup>71</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
DOT's Inspector General also has cited the FAA and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) for poor management over acquisitions and assets. According to the IG, although the FAA and USCG planned to spend $2.3 billion in FY 1996 on capital investments, both agencies 
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	have a history of inadequate mission analysis, frequently changing requirements, insufficient operational testing, inadequate contractor oversight, and poor contractor performance. Acquisition staffs have not been well-trained or highly supervised.... Problems such as inadequate specifications and testing have resulted in purchases of expensive equipment that did not satisfactorily perform its intended function.... FAA's AAS Program experienced substantial cost overruns and schedule delays. Initially estimated to cost $2.5 billion to complete, today's estimate is over $6 billion.<sup>72</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Federal Dinosaurs Saved from Extinction</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Most taxpayers would be stunned to learn how old many federal programs and agencies really are. Large segments of the federal bureaucracy were created decades ago for purposes long since forgotten. One of the ways obsolete programs like the pre-World War II-era Rural Electrification Administration, the National Helium Reserves, and the Agricultural Extension Service become cemented in the federal budget is by continually reinventing themselves to "address" the needs of the day.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Among the numerous examples of programs evolving and adapting to ensure their survival are the following:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Rural Electrification Administration</b> was created in 1935 to help local utility companies bring electricity to rural areas. In 1949, REA's mission was expanded, with the assistance of Congress, to provide loans to rural telephone companies. REA continues today as part of the new Rural Utilities Service created by the Clinton Administration and the 103rd Congress. The new agency will give grants and loans to improve rural water and sewer service as well.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Export-Import Bank</b> was created in 1934 to finance exports to Russia. Today, the bank backs some $18 billion per year in cheap credit to major corporations such as Boeing, McDonnell-Douglas, and General Electric. In the 60 years since its creation, the Export-Import Bank has lost $8 billion on its operations -- practically all of it in the last 15 years.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The National Fertilizer Development Center</b>, built as a munitions factory during World War I, was converted into a fertilizer plant and given to the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in the early 1930s. Fearing Congress would close it down, this obsolete program then reinvented itself and changed its name to the TVA Environmental Research Center as a way to chase federal research dollars. The 104th Congress, however, finally began taking steps to close this unnecessary program.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
By focusing its efforts on <i>reinventing</i> government rather than <i>downsizing</i> government, the Clinton Administration has validated and institutionalized the evolutionary survival process of obsolete government programs. Outmoded agencies do not need to worry about being terminated as long as they create a new mission for themselves.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One such outmoded agency is the Bureau of Reclamation, established in 1902 to bring water to arid Western states through public works projects such as the Hoover and Grand Coulee dams. The power generated by Reclamation's 56 hydropower plants makes it the second-largest power producer in the nation. Now that the West has been tamed, there is a strong argument to be made for ending the Bureau of Reclamation and privatizing its facilities in the way countries from China to Chile have sold government-owned utilities to the private sector.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While the Administration has modestly endorsed privatizing some of the government's power distribution enterprises, it also recommends "creating a new mission for the Bureau of Reclamation."  According to the NPR, Reclamation "needs to redefine its mission toward new environmental priorities and clarify its role in water management."<sup>73</sup>  The Administration thus is sending a clear signal to other outmoded agencies: They need never fear being closed as long as they can find new missions for themselves.
<p>
<b>Rampant Duplication</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Because outmoded, obsolete, or inefficient programs rarely die, bureaus, agencies, and programs duplicate each other's functions throughout government. Government auditors, as well as analysts at the National Performance Review, have identified a staggering degree of duplication throughout the federal bureaucracy. For example, the NPR found that "much of Washington's domestic agenda, $226 billion, to be precise," is allocated to state and local governments "through an array of more than 600 different grant programs," many of which target the same populations for assistance.<sup>74</sup>  Moreover, each of these programs has strings attached that bind the hands of local officials.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The GAO has identified duplication and fragmentation of government functions both across and within agencies. This creates considerable confusion for potential program recipients, who often are at a loss as to which program suits their particular needs, and for policymakers who must make funding decisions based on unreliable information. For example:
<p><ul>
<li> Some 15 separate government departments and agencies spend $20 billion a year on over 160 employment and training programs.<sup>75</sup>  The GAO found, however, that "almost 40 percent of the programs could not accurately tell us how many people were served each year... and less than 50 percent of the programs collected data on whether or not participants obtained jobs after they received services."<sup>76</sup>
<p>
<li> According to the NPR, Washington spends "about $60 billion a year on the well-being of children. But we have created at least 340 separate programs for families and children administered by 11 different federal agencies and departments."<sup>77</sup>
<p>
<li> The GAO has identified 72 federal programs and initiatives managed by eight different agencies that either directly or indirectly support water quality protection and enhancement. According to agency estimates, about "$4.6 billion and 10,680 full-time equivalent staff were dedicated to efforts related to water quality in fiscal year 1995, and about $5.1 billion was requested, appropriated, or otherwise provided for these programs for fiscal year 1996."<sup>78</sup>
<p>
<li>The GAO has identified 131 programs, administered by 16 different departments and agencies, targeted to assisting "at-risk" or delinquent youth. The Department of Health and Human Services managed the majority -- 58 separate programs. The cost of these 131 programs tops $4 billion per year. According to the GAO, "our analysis showed that, in many cases, it was possible for two or more programs to provide similar services to the same target group."<sup>79</sup>
<p>
<li> "The Department of Commerce shares its mission with at least 71 federal departments, agencies, and offices."<sup>80</sup>  Commerce has "14 subordinate organizations addressing missions as varied as natural resources; advancement of commerce; area and regional development; and research and general education aids."<sup>81</sup>
<p>
<li> Federal law enforcement activities are spread among five major departments and four independent agencies.<sup>82</sup>
<p>
<li>Export promotion programs are fragmented among 19 agencies. "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, not Commerce, receives about 74 percent of total funding for these programs, although it accounts for only about 10 percent of U.S. exports."<sup>83</sup>  According to the GAO, "it is unclear that [USDA's] export credit guarantee programs have resulted in increased agricultural exports."<sup>84</sup>
<p>
<li> In the Department of Agriculture, as many as 12 different agencies spend over $1 billion per year to administer 35 different laws pertaining to food safety. As a result, the current food safety system suffers from overlapping and duplicative inspections, poor conditions, inefficient allocation of resources, and outdated inspection procedures.<sup>85</sup>
<p>
<li> The USDA administers 14 food assistance programs serving 39 million people annually. 
<p>
<li> The cost of these programs has skyrocketed from $664 million in FY 1967 to about $37 billion in FY 1994. According to the GAO, their complex structure has caused overlapping of benefits and functions, inconsistent administrative procedures, and confusion for applicants who attempt to access the system.<sup>86</sup>
<p>
<li> At a cost of $1 billion to $3 billion per year, some two dozen federal agencies engage in mapmaking and geographic data collection activities.
<p>
<li> There are at least 14 major federal housing programs for low-income persons. Many state governments also operate independent public housing programs. Total housing aid for these beneficiaries equaled $23.5 billion in FY 1993.
<p>
<li> The Department of Education alone manages over 240 programs, yet federal spending comprises about 6 percent of all education spending.
<p>
<li> There are at least 62 federal economic development programs under the jurisdiction of 18 different departments and agencies.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Clinton Administration has a mixed record in consolidating duplicative programs and functions in government agencies. The Administration has recommended consolidating programs within the Departments of Education, Health and Human Services, and Housing and Urban Development, to name a few. However, had these consolidation proposals been enacted, the savings to taxpayers would have been minimal at best.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For the most part, the Administration has displayed a zealous belief that better management and "coordination" can overcome the problems of duplication and fragmentation. NPR documents are replete with recommendations to create new programs, interagency coordinating councils, and oversight boards to overcome duplicative programs and functions. For example, the Administration created the nationwide One Stop Shopping program to help people seeking job training navigate through the maze of over 160 education training programs. A simple solution would be to eliminate these programs and use the $20 billion now spent on them each year to finance vouchers or tax credits for those seeking employment training. The Administration, however, even fought House and Senate attempts to consolidate between 75 and 100 of these job training programs into simple block grants to the states.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Many of the NPR's so-called successes include the expansion of what can be called the informal level of government, comprised of interagency councils and coordinating committees. For example:
<p><ul>
<li> The Administration created a National Spatial Data Infrastructure project to coordinate the two dozen agencies involved in mapmaking and data collection.
<p>
<li> The NPR recommended the creation of "regional ecosystem management teams for each of the cross-agency ecosystem management projects."<sup>87</sup>
<p>
<li> To "strengthen the financial management roles of OMB and Treasury," the NPR recommended the creation of "a governmentwide budget and financial information steering group."<sup>88</sup>
<p>
<li> To solve the problems caused by 19 different export programs, the NPR recommended that the "President should issue an executive order to grant the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC) broader authority to control federal export promotion efforts."<sup>89</sup>
<p>
<li> To "improve the delivery of federal domestic grant programs," the NPR recommended the creation of "a Cabinet-level Enterprise Board to oversee new initiatives in community empowerment."<sup>90</sup>  Apparently, the NPR did not think this recommendation duplicated its proposal to reinvent the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR) and charge it with improving intergovernmental service delivery.
<p>
<li> To coordinate science policy, the NPR recommended that the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology be modified and reconstituted by presidential directive "as the National Science and Technology Council."<sup>91</sup>
<p>
<li> To solve procurement problems, the NPR recommended the creation of "an interagency team to develop a plan for improving federal information technology acquisitions."<sup>92</sup> The problem of overregulation was to be solved by the creation of "an interagency Regulatory Coordinating Group to share information and coordinate approaches to regulatory issues."<sup>93</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to Ronald Moe, expanding this informal layer of government will further reduce the authority and management function of the President: "What does this devolution of management functions to the employee and broadening span of control mean to the President?  For one thing, it will mean that presidents will have to manage more through negotiations than through authoritative relationships."<sup>94</sup>  Moe believes the permanent bureaucracy, not the President, will then have ultimate control over federal policy.
<p>
<b>Poor Stewardship of Federal Assets</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Washington's poor record of managing the nation's assets has created an almost unaffordable liability for future taxpayers. According to many sources, the known environmental cleanup costs at government-owned facilities could reach $400 billion over the next few decades, with as much as $350 billion of this liability incurred at Department of Energy facilities alone. Hundreds of other government-owned physical assets, such as the National Highway System, the Park System, dams, waterways, computer systems, and buildings, are coming dangerously close to collapse. With a greater share of the federal budget dedicated to entitlement programs, it is unlikely the resources will be there when the bill comes due for these liabilities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The political and bureaucratic processes do not encourage protection of the long-term health of government assets. Since these assets are "owned" by everyone for the use of all citizens, it is in no one's interest (be he citizen, politician, or bureaucrat) to ensure that they are sufficiently maintained for the next generation.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

There are three principal reasons why public resources tend to fall into disrepair faster than private assets and why they fail to get the funds necessary to insure proper upkeep and maintenance. First, public assets typically are underpriced (often free), so consumers of public resources have an incentive to use as much of a resource as they can before the next consumer does. Second, the political process rewards short-term spending priorities, such as pork-barrel projects, and discourages long-term spending on maintaining assets. Third, agency managers are not punished for failing to maintain an asset as they would be in the private sector.<sup>95</sup>  In a perverse way, the political budgetary process can reward an agency with a new program to "modernize" a neglected asset.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Among the many examples of "government failure" that has allowed public assets to deteriorate are the following:
<p><ul>
<li> According to GAO Comptroller General Charles Bowsher, "The poor condition of agency financial systems is a symptom of a much broader issue -- the federal government's overall inability to effectively manage investments in information technology (IT). Many projects have been poorly managed, cost much more than anticipated, and have not provided intended benefits."<sup>96</sup>  Moreover, "In March 1995, OMB reported that 39 percent of agency systems were originally implemented over 10 years ago; 53 percent need to be replaced or upgraded within the next 5 years."<sup>97</sup>
<p>
<li> Many of the 337 dams built by the Bureau of Reclamation are over a half-century old and in desperate need of repair.<sup>98</sup>
<p>
<li> The Forest Service needs $644 million to maintain and reconstruct trails and recreation sites.<sup>99</sup>
<p>
<li> The National Park Service has a $4 billion backlog of infrastructure maintenance, nearly double the backlog the Service reported in 1993. As a result, the infrastructure at many of the nation's most famous sites, such as the Grand Canyon, the Washington Monument, and Independence Hall, is "at risk."<sup>100</sup>
<p>
<li> By the turn of the century, many of the water resources projects in the Army Corps of Engineers' $125 billion inventory will have reached the end of their design life. "The major structures have an average age of 33 years, and 12 percent of the projects are over 50 years old."<sup>101</sup>
<p>
<li> As of FY 1995, the Federal Highway Administration reported that 18 percent of the bridges in the National Highway System and 14 percent of the bridges in other federal-aid highways, were functionally obsolete. The FHWA estimates the "average annual cost to maintain bridge conditions and performance... at $5.2 billion over the next 15 years."<sup>102</sup>

<li> The Federal Highway Administration assists in the maintenance and construction of over 58,000 miles of roads within the Forest Service and the National Park Service, as well as on Indian Reservations. The vast majority of these roads are reported to be in fair or poor condition. The FHWA estimates that the total backlog of improvements needed on these roads is $8.5 billion.<sup>103</sup>
<p>
<li> "Years of neglect at Department of Defense and Department of Energy installations have left a legacy of contamination that these agencies now estimate may cost close to $200 billion to correct. These estimates do not take into account the full federal cleanup liability."<sup>104</sup>
<p>
<li> About 270 million barrels of oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserves cannot be safely removed at this time because of water leakage, natural gas seepage, and heat buildup. The cost of maintaining this 20-year-old facility grows each year.<sup>105</sup>
<p>
<li> Ongoing Federal Aviation Administration modernization projects are years behind schedule, with the Air Traffic Control System dependent on obsolete equipment. "Of the more than 200 projects in FAA's modernization effort, only 36 are completed, accounting for just 3 percent of the $32 billion" FAA will have to spend to upgrade the Air Traffic Control System between 1982 and 2000.<sup>106</sup>
<p>
<li> The National Weather Service modernization program "has exceeded its expected cost and is far behind schedule. The initial cost estimate of nearly $2 billion has risen to $4.6 billion," and the projected completion date has slipped from 1994 to 1998.<sup>107</sup>

"Reinvention" cannot save programs as broken as these from eventual collapse. The only way to raise the capital necessary to rescue them is through privatization. The Clinton Administration, however, has made only token gestures toward privatization and has not seriously advanced such proposals in Congress. As a result, the nation's assets continue to deteriorate, placing and enormous liability on the next generation of taxpayers.

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
After three years of "reinventing government," federal spending continues to soar and Washington continues to waste taxpayers' money on programs that should be dramatically overhauled, terminated, privatized, or transferred to state or local governments. The civilian federal workforce has fallen to its lowest level since 1965, but Washington simply spends 30 percent more for every government worker. This is not the kind of efficiency taxpayers thought they were getting from a government that the Administration itself says must "work better and cost less."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Moreover, reports conducted by official "watchdog" agencies like the U.S. General Accounting Office and agency Inspectors General document a government in shambles, unable to perform even rudimentary functions in an efficient manner. Meanwhile, the Administration's pseudo-reforms may entertain the media, but they fail either to address or to remedy the government's most serious problems. Reinvention has failed to cure such problems as widespread financial mismanagement, lack of management accountability, widespread program duplication and fragmentation, deteriorating assets, and programs that survive long after they have become obsolete.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

President Clinton was right when he said that the federal government is "not just broke, it's broken."  But his solution, and the solutions put forward by the National Performance Review, amount to little more than putting new paint on an old termite-infested house with a crumbling foundation. Given the weakened state of too many government programs, it may be time to move out the remodelers and bring in the wrecking ball.

<center><h2>SPEECH NEVER PROHIBITED -- UNTIL NOW,<br>
VICTORY IN <i>SCHENCK</i> CASE &quot;CRUCIAL&quot;</h2>

<p>

<h4>Family Research Council filed brief/attended arguments today.</h4>
</center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Never in the history of our country
has a federal court prohibited peaceful, non-threatening speech
on a public sidewalk where access to businesses is not impeded,&quot;
noted Family Research Council Legal Director Cathy Cleaver on
Wednesday.

<p>

She made her comments following oral arguments before the Supreme
Court today in <I>Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network of Western New
York.</I>  The Court examined an injunction prohibiting sidewalk
counselors from speaking within 15 feet of anyone going to or
coming from an abortion clinic -- even on public streets and sidewalks.
<b>Family Research Council filed a brief with the Court and held
a Moot Court to assist the lawyers with oral argument preparation.</b>

<p>

Miss Cleaver, who is an attorney, observed: &quot;Several justices
today seemed to agree with the argument of Jay Sekulow of the
American Center for Law and Justice who made a First Amendment
case. Sekulow said sidewalk counselors must remain free to appeal
to young mothers for the lives of their unborn children. 'There
is no medical exception to the First Amendment,' he argued. Justices
Ginsberg and Breyer seemed to be saying that the possibility of
jostling outside a clinic is significant enough to consider silencing
free speech protections in the Constitution.

<p>

&quot;Mr. Sekulow agreed that those acts can rightly be stopped,
but that stopping all speech was overkill.  Justice Scalia, in
a colorful moment, suggested that Mr. Sekulow was, in essence,
saying: 'Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never
hurt me.'&quot;

<p>

<b>Cleaver said, &quot;A victory in the <I>Schenck</I> case is
crucial to show that the First Amendment is not a promise only
for the politically correct, and that the rights of, as Justice
Scalia calls it,  a 'currently disfavored class' of pro-life Americans
are not trashed.&quot;</b>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

For the past nine months, over 35,000<sup>1</sup> members of America's armed forces have been deployed as part of the NATO implementation force in Bosnia (IFOR). These soldiers were sent to the Balkans to enforce the military provisions of the <a href="http://www.state.gov/www/current/bosnia/bosagree.html">Dayton Peace Accord</a> of November 1995. President Bill Clinton, in an address to the nation on November 27, 1995, told the American people that the mission "should and will take about one year."<sup>2</sup>  The House and Senate subsequently adopted resolutions expressing reluctant support for the Bosnia mission and authorizing the deployment of U.S. troops specifically for this one-year period.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

However, recent press reports revealed that the Clinton Administration plans to deploy at least 5,000 new GIs to Bosnia in a "covering force" mission that would last at least until March 1997.<sup>3</sup>  Administration officials defending the surprise move stressed the unstable and dangerous situation in Bosnia as the cause for deployment. In the meantime, NATO has called for a continued military presence in Bosnia (what has been called a "stabilization force").
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Administration officials have refused to define what role the U.S. might play in Bosnia beyond next spring. On October 3, 1996, Secretary of Defense William Perry assured the Senate Armed Services Committee that no firm commitment to a new NATO force has been made; during NATO meetings in Norway the previous week, however, the Secretary of Defense refused to specify any conditions or guidelines that might frame the circumstances in which the U.S. might participate in a new implementation force for Bosnia. This ambiguity has left the door wide open for an open-ended and undefined U.S. military commitment to Bosnia that could last throughout 1997 and beyond.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Such a commitment is both unwise and disproportional to U.S. national security interests in Bosnia. The U.S. needs a plan to extricate its forces from Bosnia in stages and to turn the responsibility for consolidating the peace to other European organizations. To ensure that it does not become bogged down in an open-ended military commitment in Bosnia, the U.S. should:
<p><ul>
<li> Keep only a limited number of U.S. support troops in place in Bosnia in 1997. There should be no American combat ground troops in a new IFOR.
<p>
<li> Organize a follow-on implementation force in Bosnia under NATO's new Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) concept with a European commander.
<p>
<li> Remove all U.S. troops from the Balkans by 1998.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This staged removal of the U.S. and NATO from Bosnia is necessary if the U.S. and its flagship alliance, NATO, are to avoid a likely decades-long military commitment to Bosnia. For 32 years, the United Nations has been chained to an open-ended peacekeeping commitment in Cyprus. It would be highly injurious to NATO to be involved in Bosnia for the next 30 years. To avoid making Bosnia a ward of the U.S., and NATO an emasculated collective security or peacekeeping alliance, the U.S. must now put forth those conditions to European allies.
<p>

<b>THE POLITICAL FAILURE OF PEACEKEEPING IN BOSNIA</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The NATO peacekeeping operation in Bosnia has been a military success but a political failure. This contradiction is rooted in the fact that the military provisions of the Dayton Accord are working at cross purposes with its political provisions. The military mission is to separate the existing Serb, Croat, and Muslim forces, while the political goal is to unify Bosnia. These goals are irreconcilable. Since the beginning of the mission, the military component has endured steady criticism about its refusal to launch manhunts for indicted war criminals and strictly enforce the right of refugees to return to their pre-war homes. If NATO undertook these tasks, however, it could re-ignite the war it is supposed to be preventing, not to mention embarking on the sort of "mission creep" that doomed the United Nations' intervention in Somalia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As a result, the efforts of 53,000 military troops from some 30 countries have done little to advance the political provisions of the Dayton agreement. The principal mission of the military forces while manning the zone of separation in Bosnia was self-preservation. This was especially true of U.S. troops, whose missions were organized mainly to avoid casualties in an election year. While the U.S. has suffered only one death from hostile incidents since December 1995, the IFOR operation has cost $3.5 billion -- more than twice the Administration's 1995 estimate.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

That investment was intended to finance a one-year military effort aimed at implementing the political provisions of the Dayton Peace Accord. That hope is looking bleak, however; the September 14 elections in Bosnia merely confirmed the illusionary nature of the Dayton agreements, evident to many in 1995.<sup>5</sup>  The Dayton Accord's goal of a united and multiethnic Bosnia is wholly unrealizable. In the recent elections, over 80 percent of Bosnians voted in solid ethnic blocs, and few refugees crossed ethnic lines to vote in their pre-war districts. Thus, the factions of Bosnia have claimed with ballots what they had fought for with bullets. As Senator Russell Feingold (D-WI) noted on the eve of the elections, this "bring[s] us back to where we started: a region full of hostile, ethnically divided factions facing off at tenuous borders, under unstable military, economic, and social conditions."<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Dayton Accord's vision of a multiethnic Bosnia is doomed, and partition appears to be inevitable. All that remains is to establish the political goals of a follow-on peacekeeping force and devise the military missions needed to achieve those goals. More important for U.S. military planners will be whether the goals of the military forces are clearly defined, decisive, attainable, and sustainable, and whether they truly contribute to achieving the political goals.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

NATO planners are creating four options for IFOR II. The working assumption is that the U.S. will play a leading role in all of them.
<blockquote>
<b>OPTION #1: Complete withdrawal.</b> This is the least likely option and will get little attention and consideration. America's European allies, who have always been more realistic about the many years that will be needed to patch up Bosnia, regard the one-year time limit as no more than a U.S. election-year ploy. This option presents a stark alternative that probably will be rejected by NATO. No one in NATO wants to walk away from Bosnia entirely.
<p>
<b>OPTION #2: War prevention.</b> This option foresees a smaller NATO force with significant combat capabilities. This force, charged mainly with keeping the factions from resuming the war, would deter (and perhaps defeat) any large-scale organized violence that might break out after the departure of IFOR. Given the European reliance on U.S. combat capabilities, this option would require a significant U.S. military presence. The assumption is that the Bosnians would carry on with political reconciliation under a NATO security umbrella designed to prevent the renewal of factional fighting.
<p>
<b>OPTION #3: A "sustainment" force.</b> This force, about half the size of IFOR, would require about 20,000 troops in Bosnia. It would have the unclear mission of maintaining a general atmosphere of peace and security. It also would be more involved in the political reconciliation of Bosnia than a "war prevention" force but probably would continue to avoid such tasks as hunting down war criminals and enforcing the return of refugees to their pre-war homes. NATO is most likely to choose this option because its mission is the least clear and therefore less likely to polarize either the NATO allies or political factions inside Bosnia. All sides can see in this option exactly what they wish to see. The Europeans could envision an extended presence, while the U.S. would be happy with a reduced presence.
<p>
<b>OPTION #4: Full-scale continuation of IFOR and its current mission.</b> Adoption of this option is not likely because it would require a continued American commitment of some 35,000 U.S. troops to the region -- a politically insupportable position in the U.S. In addition, while America has every intention of reducing its commitment, the European allies have made it clear that they will not increase their own troop commitment to keep a follow-on force up to IFOR's current strength.
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Options 2, 3, and 4 all involve a significant U.S. ground presence in the Balkans for the foreseeable future: 10,000 to 12,000 U.S. ground troops in Bosnia, Croatia, and Hungary. The U.S. has laid down no criteria for U.S. participation in a follow-on force; nor has the Pentagon recommended one of these NATO options to the President. This public refusal to specify the conditions under which U.S. troops will participate has left NATO planners with the impression that the level of American participation in IFOR II will remain the same as it was in the original mission. Conversely, the European allies have set forth their criteria by stating repeatedly that they have no intention of staying in Bosnia if the U.S. pulls out.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While the U.S. has hinted at reducing its presence in Bosnia, the Europeans have made no efforts to step into the leadership vacuum if the U.S. leaves. German officials say they are prepared to provide up to 3,000 soldiers for an IFOR II of 20,000 to 25,000 troops.<sup>7</sup>  The French and British commitments to a follow-on force will be consistent with their commitments to the original IFOR; neither government has indicated a willingness to change its level of commitment to a Bosnian peace force. In any event, the European assumption is that America is still expected to provide the lion's share of any new peacekeeping force. There is no evidence whatever that America's European allies are prepared to step up to the plate and assume a greater share of the military burden in Bosnia.
<p>
<b>THE BIG PICTURE: BOSNIA AND NATO'S DIVISION OF LABOR</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Politicians from all sides of the American political spectrum maintain that while the U.S. is a world leader, it cannot be responsible for policing the world. Distinguishing between the two roles of global power and global cop requires the ability to choose where and when to use America's military forces, as well as to understand how they can be used most effectively. It also requires an alliance system in which the U.S. acts like a great power and does not try to put out every brushfire in the world. America must demand that prosperous and powerful allies take the lead in addressing local crises that are peripheral to American security interests. If the U.S. does not enforce this implicit bargain, the allies will continue to let it do the heavy lifting in missions like Bosnia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This unfair and unwise sharing of the security burden in Europe is neither politically nor militarily sustainable. In addition to perpetuating an outdated division of labor, it flies in the face of at least three long-range political and security trends in the alliance.
<p><blockquote>
<b>TREND #1: Strategic Strain.</b><br>
Because of post-Cold War cuts in the U.S. defense budget, America's armed forces have shrunk by some 35 percent since 1991. However, while "supply" has been reduced, "demand" has not diminished. America's overseas military requirements have not decreased since the end of the Cold War. In fact, they have increased in many circumstances. As a result, the U.S. does not have a force large enough to carry out the national security strategy designed by the President. It is well-known that the Clinton Administration's Bottom-Up Review (BUR) Force will not be large enough to fulfill the task of winning the number of major regional conflicts required by the present national strategy. It also is widely known that the current force is not adequately funded.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
What is less well-known is the effect of this double mismatch on the men and women of America's armed forces. Attempts to bridge this gap between the ends and means of American strategy have left America's armed forces severely strained, demoralized, and unprepared for the future. The results: U.S. forces deploy at three to four times the rate of the Cold War; major combat training exercises have been canceled; "gaps" appear regularly in the coverage provided by the shrinking Navy to key regions of the globe; problems with divorce, quality of life, and re-enlistment are on the rise; and money spent to recapitalize the armed forces for the future is down by some 70 percent since the Reagan years.<sup>9</sup>  Robert Gaskin, a former Pentagon planner, states that the armed forces' men and materiel are "approaching burnout."<sup>10</sup>
<p>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) believes that strategic strain is "stretching our military [to] the verge of the breaking point."  He warns that "at some point somebody needs to stand up and say there is a minimum size to being the world's only superpower, and we have gotten smaller than that in terms of our regular units, and we have an obligation to insist on a military in which people can serve without being burned out by the sheer constancy of their being used."<sup>11</sup>
<p>
<b>TREND #2: Diverging Military Competencies.</b><br>
The core competencies of the armed forces of the United States and its European allies are diverging, making the European allies more dependent on the U.S. for military operations. For the most part, the U.S. armed forces are focused on deterrence and warfighting against aggressive states. While the U.S. is prepared to go to war in a number of regions to protect American interests and American allies; the NATO allies are slashing defense spending and refocusing their military establishments on peacekeeping and operations other than war.
<p>
As in the United States, monetary concerns are one of the principal driving forces behind the changing military capabilities of the NATO allies. While Korea and Japan have increased their defense spending since the end of the Cold War, America's European allies have cut defense spending as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) by an average of one-third.<sup>12</sup>  Most of these funding reductions have been precipitated by the need to meet the stringent fiscal requirements of European Union monetary integration.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
More important, America's allies are not investing in military systems needed to project power and conduct sustained warfighting campaigns; rather, they are preparing for regional peacekeeping and other low-intensity conflicts. With only a few exceptions, they are not investing in strategic airlift and sealift; strategic logistics systems; space-based command, control, communications, and intelligence (C3I) networks; and modern weapon systems based on revolutionary advances in information technology.<sup>14</sup>  In Bosnia, while the allies provide over 50 percent of the implementation force, the U.S. supplies 46 of the 48 satellites used by IFOR for command, control, communications, and intelligence.
<p>
<b>TREND #3: Diverging Security Interests.</b><br>
During the Cold War, the overwhelming threat from the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact caused allied interests to converge and provided a centripetal force that held NATO together. However, most post-Cold War security challenges will be well below the threshold of a major power threat. Problems like the ethnic battles in the former Yugoslavia threaten local and regional security interests more directly than they do the more global security interests of the United States. Common sense would dictate that local powers and regional security arrangements should be the "primary care networks" for small regional security crises. States with the most immediate interests should be the principal candidates for providing most of the resources necessary to solve the problem.
<p>
The recent series of confrontations with Iraq and the multinational operation in Somalia highlight the diverging security interests of the U.S. and its allies. In both cases, the coalitions were faced with relatively minor threats but could not agree on common approaches to solving the crises. In Iraq, the French criticized the U.S. action and refused to help the British and American air forces patrolling the extended no-fly zone. In Somalia, the U.S. virtually accused the Italian contingent of being in league with warlord Mohammed Farah Aideed and even publicly asked the U.N. to fire the Italian commander. These examples highlight the fact that when allies face lesser threats, their interests can differ greatly. It therefore behooves an alliance managing a crisis like Bosnia to match the differing interests and capabilities of various allies to different roles and responsibilities. In other words, the U.S. should not be expected to have the same degree of interest in a local European security affair as the European allies themselves have.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>The Imperative of American Leadership: A New Security Bargain </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These trends suggest that the U.S. needs to strike a new security bargain with its European allies. The U.S. should keep the military alliances that served it well during the Cold War and are still useful in protecting vital interests, but it must adapt them to the changing nature of the post-Cold War world. America's role in these alliances should be focused on the military tasks that directly protect America's vital interests. This means, primarily, deterring major power threats to the United States and such key regions as Europe, East Asia, and the Persian Gulf, and ensuring unimpeded U.S. access to such key global systems as trade, finance, energy, and natural resources. America's alliances exist to serve these missions and to make American power more effective by harnessing and using the resources and energies of allies who share these goals.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In return for this commitment to the major tasks of global security, America's allies increasingly must take the lead in smaller regional and local security crises that exist well below the threshold of vital U.S. national interests. In these crises, the U.S. must play only a supporting role, helping allies with unique and decisive U.S. military capabilities. In general, America must reserve its limited resources for the singular and critical tasks of global security that it alone can accomplish.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Good leaders measure the differing talents and resources of their team, and match missions and tasks to those team members most suited for the job. In this way, the overall effect of the alliance is more than the sum of its members. As management guru Peter Drucker has noted, "effective leaders delegate a good many things; they have to or they drown in trivia. But they do not delegate the one thing that only they can do with excellence, the one thing that will make a difference, the one thing that will set standards, the one thing they want to be remembered for. They do it."<sup>15</sup>  The U.S. cannot and should not delegate its superpower role in global security, but it can and must delegate regional peacekeeping to those local powers well-equipped to do it.
<p>

<b>WHAT KIND OF NEW PEACEKEEPING FORCE IN BOSNIA?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A follow-on Bosnian peacekeeping force, or IFOR II, should be smaller; should have fewer tanks, artillery, and other "heavy" forces; and should be more European. The U.S. and its European allies generally agree on those conditions, but they have very different ideas about the extent to which the U.S. should be involved. Since the Dayton Accord was signed, European officials have been much more realistic and forthcoming about the need for a long-term military commitment to Bosnia. Moreover, French and British officials repeatedly have insisted that they would not keep forces in Bosnia if U.S. forces were withdrawn. Thus, the negotiations over an IFOR II are likely to come down to a battle of political will, with the European allies attempting to obtain the largest U.S. commitment they can while the U.S. tries to provide the smallest force possible. To avoid this trap, the U.S. should take the initiative in the NATO planning cycle. To prepare for this, the U.S. should insist on the following specific conditions:
<p><ul>
<li><b> NATO should use the new Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) concept to organize a follow-on peacekeeping force in Bosnia.</b> A U.S. initiative, the CJTF was conceived in 1993 and, after several years of painstaking negotiations, agreed upon by NATO ministers in June 1996. The Combined Joint Task Force is a flexible military structure in which Europeans can lead while still borrowing some NATO resources for the task at hand. The CJTF makes it possible for European allies to assume the chief responsibility for regional problems (like Bosnia) while the U.S. commitment to NATO remains focused on the collective defense of Europe against outside aggression.16  It also is a practical mechanism that can stiffen the political resolve among European allies about their abilities to organize and undertake small crisis management, humanitarian relief, and peacekeeping missions. 
<p>
A CJTF for a follow-on force in Bosnia can come in several forms and can be led either by NATO or by a European security organization like the West European Union (WEU). The units involved in a CJTF are "separable but not separate" and could be "leased" from NATO. A CJTF is temporary and mission specific: Its units return to the NATO fold after mission completion or in the event of more important NATO contingencies.
<p>
Any force following IFOR should have less combat power and more civilian resources. The military mission of separating Bosnian forces can be accomplished by European combat troops. The important work left to be done in the political, economic, and social reconstruction of Bosnia is the province of civilian aid workers and administrators, not combat troops.
<p>
<li><b> The new force should be less American and more European.</b> The U.S. is involved in NATO to help protect Europe from major power threats, not to police out-of-area ethnic disputes. Moreover, the U.S. cannot credibly undertake the former task while involved in the latter.<sup>17</sup>
<p>
As a general proposition, the U.S. should limit its contribution to support units that are truly unique and decisive for the European-led effort: air and sea support, command and control resources, communications units, and limited logistics support from Hungary and Croatia. U.S. units in Bosnia itself should be restricted to combat service support units such as intelligence, command and control, communications, medical, military police, and civil affairs. In addition, for contingency planning purposes, the U.S. can provide a quick-reaction combat force from either the airborne infantry regiment in Vicenza, Italy, or an armored task force stationed temporarily in Hungary. This force could reinforce European peacekeepers in the event of an emergency they are unable to handle.
<p><li>
<b>American armed forces should not be involved in Bosnia in any capacity after 1997.</b> A continued NATO presence in Bosnia, led by Europeans and supported by the United States, will buy the Bosnians even more "breathing space."  After 1997, however, any continuation of the military mission should come from Europe alone. The U.S. and NATO can leave Bosnia with their accomplishments intact if it is done in stages and while preparing other European organizations, such as the Western European Union or the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), to take over after NATO's departure.<sup>18</sup> 
<p>
<li><b>Control and management of the Bosnian peacekeeping force should devolve eventually from NATO to other European initiatives like the WEU and OSCE.</b> NATO must reassume its principal role as the alliance providing for the collective defense of Europe. If NATO sees its <i>raison d'etre</i> in collective security actions like Balkan peacekeeping, it will become as emasculated as the OSCE.<sup>19</sup>  NATO is built around a clear mission and focused purpose; it should not become the dumping ground for every security crisis in Europe.
<p>
<li><b>The new force should resemble a traditional peacekeeping operation.</b> NATO should abandon the unrealizable goal of an integrated Bosnia as envisaged under the Dayton Accord. There is no achievable military mission for a follow-on force in Bosnia that would support the goals of Dayton. On the other hand, reduced political expectations about Bosnian integration can be supported by a peacekeeping presence throughout 1997. If the political solution is realistic and recognizes that Bosnia will evolve based on some form of partition, peacekeepers can support that goal. European-led peacekeepers therefore should limit their military ambitions to manning the zones of separation to ensure that no large-scale combat operations are conducted within Bosnia.
</ul><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


There is no way to predict with assurance what will happen to Bosnia in 1997 and beyond. Most experts agree that the prospects for a multiethnic state as envisaged by the Dayton Accord are dim. Because this political forecast is so gloomy and the political goals are so contentious and unachievable, it is highly doubtful that a clear and authoritative military mission can be defined for IFOR II. This combination of factors points to a protracted international presence that will have to "muddle-through" in Bosnia for years to come.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A new peacekeeping force should not be led by the United States. In the long run, such a presence should be the responsibility of an organization like the WEU or OSCE. America's main purpose in NATO should not be to police out-of-area ethnic conflicts in Europe.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The U.S. participation in IFOR is coming to a close, and Congress should hold the President to his promise of a mission that would take "about one year."  A follow-on force in Bosnia can include a small U.S. support presence, but the entire enterprise must be underpinned by the clear indication of a European willingness to take charge of a difficult situation now that "breathing room" has been attained with the help of the U.S.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To support its European allies, the U.S. should accept the temporary attachment of American troops to a new Bosnian peacekeeping force. However, this force should be composed largely of European ground troops, and U.S. forces should remain under U.S. command. In this way, America can do what it does best -- focus on larger military contingencies -- while the Europeans take on a larger share of the peacekeeping burden.

<li>    All numbers are from the Department of Defense, but are approximate to reflect the variance in staffing levels and several different methods of calculating force numbers. Calculating air and sea support is problematic because the U.S. ordinarily has a Carrier Battle Group and Marine Forces stationed in the Mediterranean (Sixth Fleet) and air wings at bases in Italy. However, up to 12,000 U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps personnel have been supporting IFOR full-time. These numbers should drop to 4,000-6,000 in IFOR II.<p>

<h2>&quot;HARM REDUCTION&quot;<br>
AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE DRUG<br>
WAR?</h2>

<p>

&quot;Harm reduction&quot; is a new approach to the drug abuse
crisis which is winning disciples worldwide.  Its goal is to legalize
drugs, stop illicit substance interdiction efforts and step up
abuse treatment.

<p>

The &quot;harm reduction&quot; approach maintains that drug abuse
is inevitable and that society must learn to accept the &quot;responsible
use&quot; of psychoactive substances.  It ignores the physiological
and psychological effects of illicit drugs, preferring concepts
that include outright legalization of all drugs or non-enforcement
of existing drug laws.  There is evidence that the United States
is embracing &quot;harm reduction.&quot;

<p><ul>

<li>In 1996 Californians are being asked to decide whether to
legalize the medical use of marijuana even though pot's healing
qualities have never been proven and there are thousands of scientific
reports showing harmful effects.  Similar initiatives are gaining
momentum in other states.

<p>

<li>Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) has introduced legislation which
provides &quot;for the therapeutic use of marijuana in situations
involving life-threatening or sense-threatening illnesses and
to provide adequate supplies of marijuana for such use.&quot;[1]
This legislation has both Republican and Democrat co-sponsors.

<p>

<li>There are at least 75 needle giveaway programs in 55 American
cities.[2] These programs give needles to addicts to ostensibly
slow the spread of the AIDS virus, but there is evidence that
high risk drug abusers are at least as likely to contract the
disease through sexual contact. Moreover, giving needles encourages
drug abuse. Some of these programs are paid for with tax dollars.

<p>

<li>Conservative columnist William F. Buckley Jr. has joined the
harm reduction camp.  The February 1996 edition of  <I>National
Review</I> featured Buckley and six &quot;harm reduction&quot;
proponents agreeing that the drug war has failed and calling for
decriminalization of illicit drugs.

<p>

<li>Billionaire philanthropist George Soros has given $15 million
to fund organizations that actively promote harm reduction programs.
Soros is also the major financial backer for California's medical
marijuana ballot initiative and has financed many needle giveaway
programs.[3]

<p>

<li>Major television networks have featured news magazines that
sympathetically portray harm reduction as an answer to the &quot;failed&quot;
drug war. On April 6, 1995, ABC's Catherine Crier began her news
magazine, &quot;America's War on Drugs -- Searching for Solutions&quot;
with the statement, &quot;If America cannot win the war on drugs,
it should try instead to reduce the harm associated with drug
abuse.&quot;

<p>

<li>The Clinton administration has overseen a &quot;controlled
shift&quot; in drug policy from an aggressive interdiction policy
to one of harm reduction.  The federal government's ability to
disrupt drug shipments has been reduced by 64 percent.[4] Foreign
anti-drug programs have been cut by 55 percent and domestic marijuana
eradication by 59 percent. Meanwhile, between 1992 and 1996 funds
for treatment rose 19 percent.[5]

</ul><p>

<center><h3>THE ORIGINS OF &QUOT;HARM REDUCTION&QUOT;</h3></center>

<p>

Harm reduction was appropriated from the safety and insurance
industries. These industries try to minimize the consequences
and probabilities of accidents and costly illnesses by providing
incentives for behaviors like wearing safety belts, not smoking,
exercising regularly and avoiding high-risk sports such as skydiving
and auto racing.  This business philosophy has been transferred
into drug-related public policy.

<p>

The Netherlands was the first country to adopt a &quot;harm reduction&quot;
public policy.  In the 1970s, the Dutch responded to an outbreak
of hepatitis among injection drug users by passing out clean needles.
The concept gained momentum with the AIDS epidemic and quickly
spread across Europe. Harm reducers have expanded the concept
to include heroin maintenance programs, legalization of marijuana
and reduced interdiction and enforcement efforts.

<p>

America's Harm Reduction Coalition published an article that outlines
defining practices.[6]

<p><ul>

<li>&quot;Every time a needle exchange program participant ditches
a used syringe to avoid arrest rather than bring it back to the
exchange, he is practicing harm reduction.&quot;

<p>

<li>&quot;And every time a dope-injecting [person] or pot smoker
spends all day traveling around the city in search of good drugs,
as inconvenient as this may be, she is practicing a form of harm
reduction.&quot;

<p>

<li>&quot;Every time a methadone patient 'beats' his urine to
stay in the program, he is practicing harm reduction.&quot;

<p>

<li>&quot;A user might be able to do the networking needed to
find good drugs in the half an hour he spends at a street-based
needle exchange site -- networking that might otherwise have taken
half a day.&quot;

<p>

<li>&quot;While not legally available to users unless they are
a patient of an authorized clinic, there is an underground system
for obtaining methadone that most commonly revolves around the
sale of weekend pick-ups.  Lovers, spouses, family members, and
friends often share a single methadone prescription.&quot;

</ul><p>

The American Civil Liberties Union's AIDS project is a leading
promoter of &quot;harm reduction&quot; in America. &quot;Harm
reduction attempts to instrumentalize the notion of meeting individuals
'where they're at,'&quot; says the ACLU, &quot;by providing each
user with as many techniques and tools as possible to reduce that
user's particular drug-related problems.&quot;[7] It labels &quot;harm
reduction&quot; the &quot;safe sex&quot; approach to preventing
drug abuse.

<p>

The whole harm reduction approach is a complete reversal of the
&quot;zero tolerance&quot; nature of this nation's recent drug
policy.  According to the ACLU, harm reduction &quot;assumes that
drug users' civil rights and individual autonomy should be respected,
treats drug users as important participants in the process of
gaining or maintaining control over their drug use, and makes
no moral judgment based solely upon an individual's use of drugs.&quot;[8]

<p>

Wayne Roques, a retired Drug Enforcement Administration agent,
disagrees. &quot;Harm reduction entails enabling the users to
continue their self-destructive behavior,&quot; says Roques.[9]
&quot;It is more logical to reduce the demand for drugs by improving
and expanding law enforcement, education, prevention, research,
rehabilitation and recovery programs.&quot;[10]

<p>

<center><h3>HARM REDUCTION'S POPULARITY</h3></center>

<p>

The successful anti-drug efforts of the 1980s cut abuse in half
and slowed the flow of illicit drugs to American shores.  That
victory was based on a balanced interdiction (supply reduction)
and simple &quot;just say no&quot; demand reduction policy, but
recently those trends have changed dramatically.

<p>

Demand has increased especially among adolescents. On August
20, 1996, the federal government released the National Household
Survey on Drug Abuse indicating that an estimated 12.8 million
Americans are currently abusing illicit drugs.  Adolescent abuse
is especially high.  Since 1992 drug abuse by teenagers has risen
105 percent.[11]

<p>

As abuse has risen, efforts to reduce supply have declined. Consider
recent evidence.

<p><ul>

<li>A June 1996 General Accounting Office report, &quot;Counternarcotics
Efforts in Mexico,&quot; states, &quot;Mexico is the primary [70
percent] transit country for cocaine entering the United States
from South America.&quot;  The report says that interdiction funding
for the transit zone has declined from &quot;about $1 billion
in fiscal year 1992 to about $570 million in fiscal year 1995.&quot;
This decline happened in spite of the State Department's March
1996 assertion that &quot;no country in the world poses a more
immediate narcotics threat to the United States than Mexico.&quot;[12]

<p>

<li>An April 1996 General Accounting Office report, entitled &quot;U.S.
Interdiction Efforts in the Caribbean Decline,&quot; states that
&quot;30 percent of the cocaine entering the United States comes
through the Caribbean section of the transit zone.&quot;  In November
1993, the executive branch issued a counternarcotics policy which
called for a &quot;controlled shift in emphasis from the transit
zone to the source countries.&quot;  The same GAO report states:
&quot;While a reduction in the interdiction effort was envisioned
in the new cocaine strategy, the strategy also anticipated an
increase in source country funding that never materialized.&quot;[13]

<p>

<li>Domestic efforts to eradicate marijuana have been cut 59 percent
since 1992.[14]

<p>

<li>Since 1993 anti-drug defense funding has been cut 32 percent,
and government-wide interdiction funding has dropped 55 percent.[15]

</ul><p>

No policy shift was announced during the 1992 campaign.  Presidential
candidate Bill Clinton told the Democratic National Convention
in July 1992, &quot;[President Bush] hasn't fought a real war
on crime and drugs. I will.&quot;[16] He promised to combine tough
law enforcement with expanded treatment and prevention programs.

<p>

The President's 1993 &quot;controlled shift&quot; and his 1995
National Drug Strategy left little doubt that interdiction was
taking a backseat to harm reduction with a focus on treatment.
In his strategy Clinton states: &quot;The National Drug Control
Strategy...confirms...my priorities for addressing this nation's
continuing drug problem....This strategy gives those who have
fallen prey to drugs the opportunity to change their behavior.&quot;[17]

<p>

A Pentagon-commissioned report suggests that Clinton's &quot;controlled
shift&quot; has failed.  The 1996 study, by the Institute for
Defense Analyses, a Pentagon-funded think tank, criticizes the
shift away from interdiction to treatment.  It concludes that
interdiction is the most successful and cost-effective way of
dealing with the nation's drug epidemic.  Rep. John L. Mica (R-Fla.)
said of the Clinton administration and the IDA report, &quot;I
think they knowingly and willingly suppressed this document....If
they are trying to cook the report or modify it from its original
conclusions, I'd be even more concerned.&quot;[18]

<p>

<center><h3>HARM REDUCTION OVERSEAS</h3></center>

<p>

Harm reduction advocates are quick to tout the successes of foreign
drug policy experiments.  They suggest that America should declare
defeat and mimic foreign drug policy.  On close examination, the
foreign &quot;experiments&quot; may well represent yet another
form of defeat.

<p>

The European Cities on Drug Policy (ECDP) is the primary torch-bearer
for Europe's  harm reduction philosophy.  In 1990, the city of
Frankfurt/Main, Germany hosted ECDP's first international conference
which included officials from 22 cities and regions.  That conference
adopted the so-called Frankfurt Resolution which called for heroin
distribution to drug addicts, decriminalization of cannabis and
the introduction of shooting galleries (safe havens for abusers
to inject illicit drugs).[19] Today, it encourages other cities and
nations to embrace the tenets of harm reduction.  One of its first
disciples was Scotland.

<p>

&quot;Harm reduction really sounds good,&quot; says Kerry Condron,
18, a heroin addict from Glasgow, Scotland, &quot;but it doesn't
work.&quot;[20] Condron says that harm reduction has become another
way of perpetuating addiction.

<p>

Glasgow's harm reduction goal was to prevent the spread of AIDS
and to reduce crime.  Drug addicts were given clean needles and
methadone, a heroin substitute.[21]

<p>

Maxie Richards runs a home for Glasgow addicts.  She says that
harm reduction has become a vested interest of the social service
industry, and with only one purpose: keeping social peace at the
cost of dispensing drugs.  She argues that social workers have
too much power.  According to Richards, the harm reduction approach
says, &quot;If you have to take drugs we can live with it.&quot;[22]
In fact, harm reduction policies are often harmful.

<p>

Richards' views on harm reduction needle-exchanges have scientific
support. The August 3, 1996 edition of <I>The Lancet</I>, a respected
British medical journal, profiled a Montreal, Canada study which
found that injection drug users were two times more likely to
become infected with HIV than those who did not.  Researcher Julie
Bruneau said that the increased HIV risks were &quot;substantial
and consistent...despite extensive adjustments for confounders.&quot;[23]

<p>

The Dutch say they want to &quot;normalize&quot; addicts through
their harm reduction policy.  They do this by providing social
services such as medical care, housing, free methadone and needles.
About half of Amsterdam's [the largest Dutch city] 400 general
medical practitioners prescribe methadone for their patients.[24]

<p>

&quot;Normalizing&quot; includes providing clean needles to addicts.
Ton Quadt, the Rotterdam coordinator of all drug treatment programs
says, &quot;If you put in enough clean syringes and needles, people
don't have to use dirty needles, so the risk of getting HIV is
lessened, and I think the Dutch number will prove it.&quot;[25]

<p>

Studies of the Dutch policy provide some revealing numbers indeed.
In 1993, Dr. Karl Gunning, a Dutch physician and a harm reduction
opponent, wrote, &quot;The harm reduction Dutch policy of containing
heroin addiction through distribution of free needles and syringes
and through methadone distribution has not prevented the spread
of heroin addiction, curtailed drug-related crime, nor has it
proven to decrease the level of HIV infection.&quot;[26]

<p>

The Dutch harm reduction policy has, however, contributed to more
abuse.  Dr. Frans Koopsman, public relations director for the
Dutch government-funded treatment center &quot;De Hoop,&quot;
said, &quot;There's no taboo anymore on drug use.  For a great
part drug use is normalized in the sense that youngsters appear
to make no big fuss about using drugs.&quot;  He reports that
adolescent cannabis abuse has doubled since 1990 with perhaps
nine percent using pot on a regular basis.  He also reports that
80 percent of Dutch criminal activity is linked to drug abuse.[28]

<p>

Paul Oldenburger, a Delfzijl businessman, declares, &quot;The
war on drugs -- we lost it a long time ago.&quot;  He offered,
&quot;These coffee shops, they don't just sell the soft drugs.
Hard drugs are available too, and it's an easy step from one
to the other.&quot;[29]

<p>

Ernst Gunst manages a cannabis-selling club in the Dutch town
of Delfzijl.  Gunst's Paradox Cafe operates out of rented, municipally-owned
space and next door to the town library.  His business has the
support of the mayor and police chief.  Gunst explains that his
cafe is an experiment in cannabis regulation.  The town fathers
hope it will drive criminal elements out of business and keep
them out.[30]

<p>

Gunst espouses a harm reduction philosophy, explaining, &quot;The
message is:  Don't do drugs.  But if you want to use drugs, do
it in a healthy, conscious way.&quot;  He warns, &quot;If you
forbid it, people still want to use it, like the U.S. during prohibition.&quot;
Gunst says his cannabis supply is regularly checked for impurities
and the content levels of THC, the psychoactive ingredient in
cannabis.  He emphasizes health, explaining, &quot;That's why
we sell no soft drinks.  Coca-Cola is just water and sugar. It's
not healthy.&quot;[31]

<p>

The Dutch harm reducers have a worldwide reach via the Internet.
The Dutch drug-dealing firm Neuroroom sells &quot;weedcigars&quot;
and ready-made joints and slices of weed-hash cake via computer.
Payments for the drugs are handled by the Dutch PostBank.  According
to the Internet site, Neuroroom has &quot;successfully delivered
soft drugs to:  Japan, Israel, Sarajevo, USA, Sweden, Norway...and
of course, the Netherlands. Until now, we did a 95 percent delivery.&quot;[32]

<p>

Switzerland is seen as a model harm reduction state and has long
been a social Petri dish.  Friedrich Engels, Karl Marx's closest
collaborator, said, &quot;Small countries like Belgium and Switzerland
are modern political laboratories, the experimental fields in
which the kind of experience is collected that shall be applied
later on in large countries.&quot;

<p>

In 1986, the Swiss began experimenting with needle programs. 
After legalizing over-the-counter syringe sales, the Swiss soon
embraced free needle distribution.  In 1988, Zurich's Platzpitz
Park was opened for free needle distribution, and soon the city
was flooded with foreign addicts.  As many as 15,000 needles were
given away each day before the park was closed in 1992.[33]

<p>

Dr. Franziska Haller, a Swiss psychologist, pharmacist and anti-drug
activist, said that Zurich's permissive drug policy was designed
to put pressure on the federal government to start a nationwide
heroin distribution program.  She says this is a big step toward
drug legalization -- the ultimate goal of harm reducers.[34]

<p>

The Swiss government began a heroin giveaway program in 1993.
There is an ongoing experiment in nine cities where heroin, morphine
and methadone are given away.  The project, scheduled to end in
December, 1996, includes 700 addicts.  Nearly half of these addicts
are HIV-positive.  They are given free drugs up to nine times
a day.  At night they are given heroin cigarettes for use at home.
The cost is covered by health insurance or the government.[35]

<p>

The experiment's goal, according to Dr. Haller, is to improve
addict health, decrease criminal activity, cut addicts off from
drug dealers and stop abuse.  Unfortunately, the number of addicts
is rising, and the experiment has cut neither illegal drug abuse
nor crime.  It is also reported that police officials in Bern
and Zurich have been ordered not to arrest drug consumers and
dealers.[36]

<p>

<center><h3>AMERICA'S HARM REDUCTION DISCIPLES</h3></center>

<p>

America's cadre of harm reduction disciples is growing in influence.
They have moved into elitist ranks, and many are financed by
pro-drug billionaire financier George Soros.

<p>

Soros, a Hungarian immigrant worth perhaps $1 billion, reportedly
gave away more than $350-million last year, the bulk to Eastern
European projects.[37] He has invested in American social problems,
such as schools, abortion rights, electoral politics, drugs and
death.  In 1995, he gave $5 million to the American &quot;Project
on Death in America&quot; and over the last few years, he has
given as estimated $15 million to drug legalization organizations.[38]

<p>

Soros is a very influential man.  He deals with social issues,
saying that he indulges his &quot;messianic fantasies in giving
away money.&quot;[39] According to Kevin Quigley, a scholar at the
Woodrow Wilson International Center for scholars in Washington,
Soros is &quot;viewed as having more clout than Secretary of State
Warren Christopher&quot; in Eastern Europe.[40]

<p>

He created the New York-based Open Society Institute to oversee
his programs. OSI has grown from just 64 employees in 1994 to
more than 160 today.  &quot;I want to create an organization,&quot;
says Soros, &quot;that can function without me.&quot;[41] That promises
a long life for his radical drug policy views.

<p>

Soros declares the drug war lost. In his book, <I>Soros on Soros</I>,
he says, &quot;I think that the whole idea of eradicating the
drug problem is a false idea....A drug-free America is simply
not possible....Once you accept this point, you may be able to
develop a more rational approach to the problem.&quot;[42]

<p>

Ethan Nadelmann runs Soros' The Lindesmith Center in New York
and is Soros's mouthpiece on drug legalization.  Nadelmann told
the pro-drug magazine <I>High Times</I>, &quot;If by legalization
you mean it's time to make marijuana available in a regulated
way, then I am for legalization.  If you mean that we should prescribe
heroin for addicts, then, yeah, I am for legalization.  If it
means that we should legalize the personal use of drugs by adult
Americans, well, yeah, I'm for that kind of legalization.&quot;[43]

<p>

&quot;Until a couple of years ago,&quot; Nadelmann told the <I>New
York Times</I>, &quot;there was only one person in the country
giving over $100,000 to the [drug legalization] movement.&quot;
He referred to a Chicago donor named Richard Dennis.  Now, according
to Nadelmann, &quot;there are four, five, six people willing to
give $100,000 or more, of which no one is in Soros's league.&quot;
On March 8, 1996, Soros gave $200,000 to salvage California's
Proposition 215 (the medical marijuana ballot initiative).[44]

<p>

Mr. Soros has also given $6 million to the Washington, D.C.-based
Drug Policy Foundation.  Soros supports the DPF, saying, &quot;I
do think we need a more open debate [on drugs] and more humane
policies in this country....I think the DPF will play a key role
in bringing about these changes.&quot;[45]

<p>

In 1995, the DPF used the money Soros provided to make grants
to groups like the Cannabis Action Network in Berkeley, California
($25,000), New York Harm-Reduction Educators ($25,000), NORML
(two grants totaling $23,000), and the Los Angeles-based Clean
Needles Now ($25,000).[46]

<p>

The DPF frequently hosts Capitol Hill seminars to brief staffers
about drug policy.  Arnold Trebach, DPF's president and an American
University professor, showed his harm reduction colors at a Capitol
Hill seminar, explaining, &quot;[The] dominant morality is that
drug abuse is a greater threat than AIDS.&quot;[47] Trebach said
the federal government needle-exchange policy is &quot;obscene&quot;
because Congress has made the use of taxpayer money for needle
giveaways conditional on proof that syringe exchanges reduce the
spread of AIDS without encouraging drug abuse.

<p>

Clearly, wealthy men like Soros have considerable sway with some
politicians.  Soros spokesman Nadelmann told <I>Reason</I> magazine,
&quot;The replacement of the Bush administration with the Clinton
administration was generally a good thing.  It brought in a lot
of new blood, new thinking.&quot;[48] Even Clinton deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott has described Soros as &quot;a national
resource -- indeed, a national treasure.&quot;  Whether the mutual
admiration extends to drug policy remains to be seen.[49]

<p>

<center><h3>CLINTON'S HARM REDUCTION CADRE</h3></center>

<p>

This summer the White House grudgingly acknowledged past drug
use by 21 employees.  Secret Service agent Jeff Undercoffer told
a House subcommittee, &quot;I have seen cocaine usage. I have
seen hallucinogenic usages, crack usages.&quot;[50] This is in addition
to the president's and vice president's admission to past drug
use.[51] When faced with his 1992 MTV declaration, &quot;I tried
before [to inhale a marijuana cigarette],&quot; Clinton now says
he regrets the comment.

<p>

Patsy Thomasson, Director of White House administration, once
served at the right hand of Dan Lasater, who pleaded guilty to
federal drug charges.  Her past association with a convicted drug
felon impelled the Senate to vote 98-0 in June 1994 to require
the president to certify that Thomasson has no history of drug
abuse.[52]

<p>

A number of Clinton's non-White House advisors are harm reducers.
His Yale Law School mentor, Steven Duke, advocates legalizing
most illicit drugs in his 1993 book, <I>America's Longest War:
Rethinking Our Tragic Crusade Against Drugs</I>.[53] Even the president's
pastor, the Reverend Walter Shropshire of the Foundry United Methodist
Church, has said he believes the government would create &quot;a
safer environment for all of us&quot; if now-illicit drugs were
legalized.[54]

<p>

Clinton's 1992 campaign received drug policy advice from Mathea
Falco. Falco is now the president of Drug Strategies, a non-profit
organization funded by Soros, who gave Falco's organization a
reported $2 million in 1994.

<p>

Falco worked closely with Dr. Peter Bourne, President Carter's
drug policy chief, who fell from power after he allegedly snorted
cocaine at a National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana
Laws (NORML) party.  Dr. Bourne volunteered that &quot;about half
the White House staff&quot; had attended the NORML party &quot;looking
as though they belonged.&quot;[55]

<p>

Falco, once appointed to NORML's board of advisors, believes drug
interdiction does not work and supports medical use of marijuana
and needle exchanges.  In 1977, she told a congressional committee
that she favored marijuana decriminalization.  Falco was seriously
considered a candidate for the Clinton administration's drug czar.[56]

<p>

Mark Kleiman was hired by the administration to review the performance
of the Drug Enforcement Administration.  Kleiman is a UCLA professor
and author of <I>Against Excess,</I> which includes an endorsement
of marijuana legalization.[57] In a 1986 <I>Wall Street Journal</I>
article, he advocated marijuana legalization.  In April 1993,
Kleiman spoke at a conference sponsored by NORML, stating, &quot;The
hardest...problem...facing American drug policy is how to make
the psychedelics available...[f]or their beneficial uses to people.&quot;[58]

<p>

Kleiman continues to have inside influence.  In October 1994,
John Carnevale, director of Office of Planning and Budget, Executive
Office of the President, Office of National Drug Control Policy,
defended the drug czar's decision to employ Kleiman's services.
Carnevale said that Kleiman's organization, BOTEC, Inc., &quot;has
conducted a number of important studies over the past few years
for ONDCP, especially in the area of monitoring the emerging heroin
situation.&quot;[59] Kleiman was listed by then-drug czar Lee Brown
as one of the many &quot;expert individuals&quot; helping the
drug czar formulate the 1995 National Drug Control Strategy.

<p>

Clinton hired Joycelyn Elders as surgeon general.  She stated,
&quot;If the doctor feels that this [marijuana] is an appropriate
medication for his patients to use, I would very much support
the medication being available.&quot;[60] Marijuana has never been
scientifically shown to be either safe or effective for the treatment
of any condition.

<p>

Elders responded to a question from a member of the pro-drug Drug
Policy Foundation at a National Press Club luncheon by stating,
&quot;I do feel that we would markedly reduce our crime rate if
drugs were legalized.&quot;[61] At that time her son's 10-year cocaine
problem was not public.  Over the next year, Kevin Elders was
to be arrested and convicted for selling cocaine to an undercover
agent.  Elders and Clinton's first AIDS czar, Kristine Gebbie,
pushed needle giveaways for drug addicts.[62]

<p>

In January 1994, Philip Lee, Clinton's assistant secretary of
Health and Human Services, announced a review of the federal ban
against the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes.[63] Lee's friend,
Dennis Peron, is a leader with California's 1996 marijuana legalization
ballot initiative.[64] Peron's headquarters were inside the Cannabis
Buyers' Club of San Francisco, which illegally sold marijuana
and was raided August 4 by law enforcement agencies.[65] Before Lee
took office in 1993, Peron told an LSD conference that Lee &quot;is going 
to reinstate the medical marijuana program when he is appointed.&quot;[66]

<p>

On January 23, 1996, Clinton radically reversed his drug philosophy.
He hired Army General Barry McCaffrey to mount an all-out attack
against well-entrenched drug traffickers.  This election year
turnaround came on the heels of a call by Senator Richard Shelby
(R-Ala.) for abolishing the drug czar's office.

<p>

Shelby blamed the administration for sending &quot;a mixed message
to America's youth -- a message that doing drugs is not a crime.&quot;
&quot;I object to the administration's handling of this issue,&quot;
said Shelby, &quot;[and] its lack of commitment to enforcement.&quot;[67]

<p>

Since taking office, McCaffrey has been in damage control mode.
He has patched up relations with Congress and local anti-drug
organizations.  He has re-established a tough approach to the
drug war. Not everyone believes this paradigm shift will last,
however. The <I>Wall Street Journal</I> has editorialized that
a second Clinton term will find McCaffrey job hunting.[68]

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

Harm reduction is a failed philosophy, much as the &quot;safe
sex&quot; approach has failed to slow the spread of sexually transmitted
diseases among young Americans.  A balanced effort to reduce both
the supply of and demand for drugs worked in the past and will
work again.

<p>

Drug policy has seen at least two historic flip-flops over the
past few decades, each with tragic results.  Under President Richard
Nixon strong interdiction and the creation of the DEA, coupled
with solid demand-reduction efforts, crippled the illicit drug
trade and abuse plummeted.  By contrast, President Jimmy Carter
embraced a harm-reduction philosophy which led to historic levels
of abuse.  Carter's legacy was reversed by Nancy Reagan's &quot;just
say no&quot; campaign.

<p>

The start-up of a serious drug war began during the Reagan-Bush
years, characterized by stiff interdiction balanced with locally
run demand reduction.  The Clinton administration's harm reduction
approach has once again turned policy on its head.  Hopefully,
Mr. Clinton has seen the error of his first three years and General
McCaffrey's tough, anti-harm-reduction approach is indicative
of a renewed seriousness about fighting drugs.

<CENTER><B>Tax Pledge to Small Business A Decisive Factor in '96<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<hr>
<P>
<B>Washington, D.C.</B> -- Taxes will remain the number one issue for small businesses in the 1996 elections, and individuals seeking public office who pledge not to raise taxes while advocating fundamental tax reform will fare better with this large and growing constituency according to a national small business advocacy organization.
<P>
"With high taxes and a burdensome tax system impeding the growth and survival of small businesses at ever stage of their development, you can bet that this issue will be a priority for each and every small business person who votes on November 5," said Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) President Karen Kerrigan.
<P>
Kerrigan made her remarks on Capitol Hill today at a press conference with a coalition of groups supporting the Taxpayer Protection Pledge -- an effort sponsored by Americans for Tax Reform.  When signed by a Member of Congress or candidate for public office, the Pledge commits the signer to oppose and vote against any effort to raise the federal income tax on individuals or corporations.
<P>
"In 1992 Bill Clinton promised a middle-class tax cut, instead middle-class small business owners got hit with the biggest tax increase in history.  President Clinton made a campaign promise to cut taxes, instead he raised them.  Taking the Pledge separates the true friend of the taxpayer from the big tax and spenders," said Kerrigan.
<P>
According to SBSC, small business owners are drawn towards elected officials and candidates who support tax system reform -- changes that would encourage risk-taking, investment and job creation rather than the attributes of the current system which punish entrepreneurial activities.
<P>
"Taxes are still a hot issue despite what the political pundits say.  Pledge signers, and those who make tax reform a key issue of their campaign have a tremendous advantage over their political challengers," added Kerrigan.
<P>
SBSC is a nationwide, nonpartisan small business advocacy organization.  For additional information please call <B>Renee Stikes</B> at<B> (202)-785-0238</B>.

<center><h2>TIME FOR A GROWN UP RESPONSE TO DRUGS,<br>
SAYS BAUER</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;The adolescent attitude towards
drug use which ignores the life-threatening nature of the problem
must stop,&quot; Family Research Council President Gary Bauer
said Friday, as news of the HUD drug scandal began to unfold.

<p>

The <I>Washington Post</I> reported Friday that members of Congress
were questioning a Housing and Urban Development project that
did not eject people who used drugs on federal property. And,
that at least one organization, the Salvation Army, that applied
for grant money was rejected because it would not accept the provision
concerning on-site drug use.

<p>

&quot;This week we're being told by former Surgeon General Joyceln
Elders that the Clinton administration has plans outlined for
needle exchange programs in Clinton's second term. Now we learn
that drug use in a taxpayer-funded housing project was being purposefully
ignored.

<p>

&quot;It's time for a grown up response to the drug problem. It's
time we send a clear signal to our most valuable resource -- our
children -- about the danger of drugs,&quot; Bauer said.

<p>

<title> How Government Wastes Your Money: Report No. 3 - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>How Government Wastes Your Money:
Report No. 3</h3>

Compiled by Ronald D. Utt, Senior Fellow <br>
Daniel J. Hickey, Special Assistant to the Vice President for Domestic Policy Studies<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 123<br>
October 15, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%>

</center>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Earlier this century, H. L. Mencken, the Baltimore journalist and wit, is said to have described government as "a broker in pillage, and every election is a sort of advance auction sale of stolen goods." While that may have characterized government spending in a simpler time when human motives seemed more straightforward than today, one can only wonder whether even Mencken's immense wit and cynicism would have been up to the task of trying to make sense of the bizarre collection of federal financial abuses described below. As politicians of both parties approach this election with various proposals to cut taxes, and pundits wonder how Americans can pay for them, this month's report offers more instances of waste and excess that could be used as a down payment on promised tax relief.
<p>
<b>Don't Leave Home Without It</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Smart Cards will lead to Smarter Government," a Clinton official said when promoting Vice President Albert Gore's <a href="http://www.npr.gov/index.html">National Performance Review</a> recommendation that government agencies make greater use of credit cards to pay for employee business travel. The Vice President apparently pushed this idea without realizing that the government's bookkeeping capability has not advanced much beyond techniques available to Bob Cratchit and Bartleby the Scrivener. But government employees knew exactly how little oversight there would be, and misuse and fraud have accompanied the program.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One hotbed of misuse is the Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). NOAA was targeted for termination by Congress, but President Clinton successfully resisted--to the relief of the agency's traveling bureaucrats. Commerce's Inspector General reported (Audit Report No. EAD-7129-5-0001/September 1995) that NOAA exceeded its travel budget by 84 percent in 1994 and that numerous employees misused the government travel card with "excessive unpaid charges, use of the card for personal purchases, and questionable automatic teller advances." According to the IG's report, such misuse included payments for meals at Washington-area restaurants and the purchase of liquor, jewelry, flowers, books, music, computer on-line service fees, and automobile insurance. Between 5,000 and 6,000 NOAA employees have such cards. According to the Inspector General, "A primary reason for the abuse is a lack of management and oversight by the agencies."

<b>Who's in Charge:</b> D. James Baker, Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmospheres, U.S. Department of Commerce, (202) 482-3436.
<p>
<b>Public Housing Sings the Blues - Again</b>
<p>

	The Department of <a href="http://www.hud.gov/">Housing and Urban Development's</a> 1.3 million public housing units represent some of the worst housing in America, and the worst of the worst may well be the 13,000 units operated by the Housing Authority of New Orleans (HANO), the seventh-largest housing authority in the nation. Officially designated "troubled" in 1979, HANO has defied all efforts to correct its manifest deficiencies, even after the investment of a staggering $244 million in federal subsidies over the last three years. As recently as 1994, HUD's Inspector General reported that a random sample of 150 of HANO's housing units found that all 150 failed to meet HUD's housing quality standards. Typical problems included missing ceilings, holes in walls, loose and peeling paint, and roach infestation. A follow-up random survey in 1995, however, did find some improvement--only 93 percent of the sampled units failed.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Why the persistent failure to improve this project? The chief reasons may well be the local housing authority's gross mismanagement and misplaced priorities. Despite a maintenance backlog estimated at 36,000 individual work orders, and despite the availability of only one pickup truck for work crews who serviced nine of HANO's ten projects, HANO's management purchased 16 new Ford LTD Crown Victoria passenger vehicles for the central office staff in 1993. Also in that year, HANO's board awarded a $164,000 contract to a joint venture between HANO's former board chairman and a former management contractor who earlier had failed to make good on a $75,000 debt to the authority. Such failings make it easier to understand why the nation's public housing authorities fight so vigorously against federal proposals to replace them with housing vouchers.

It was revealed recently that Sam Donaldson, one of the most highly paid correspondents on ABC News, received U.S. <a href="http://www.usda.gov/">Department of Agriculture</a> subsidies of $97,000 over the past two years to help with the mohair sheep he raised on his New Mexico ranch. Now he's back in line for a new government benefit, this time asking the federal government's Animal Damage Control program to help him eradicate the pesky coyotes that keep eating his subsidized sheep on land he leases from the state government for less than a dollar an acre. The <i>Dallas Morning News</i> quotes Mr. Donaldson as saying recently: "The government helps ranchers and farmers and businesses of all kinds. If it's in existence and I'm eligible to use it, I'll use it."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	This attitude apparently is shared by Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam, which went Sam one better with its 1,600-acre farm in Georgia, described by <i>The Washington Post</i> as having "no barn, no fence, only a cinder-block shed and a double-wide trailer home that was knocked off its moorings by a tornado this spring. The land was dotted with rusted farm implements, dented fuel barrels, mangled trailers, [and] a fragile pickup truck." The farm nevertheless received a payment of $36,977 last year from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for <i>not</i> growing crops on 821 acres of its land. The Heritage Foundation estimates that last year, approximately 259 million other Americans joined Mr. Farrakhan in not growing crops, and might therefore be eligible for the same no-grow government bonus. Prospective beneficiaries may call Mr. Grant B. Buntrock at (202) 720-3467 to determine their eligibility for the payment and to receive information on how to become eligible for the no-grow bonus in the future. Buntrock is the Administrator of the Farm Service Agency, the USDA division that operates the bonus program.

Even with a federal subsidy of $750 million per year, equaling $47 per passenger, <a href="http://www.amtrak.com/">Amtrak</a> still loses millions. On August 10, 1996, Amtrak announced that an expected $250 million deficit forced it to eliminate three train routes and service to 42 towns and cities. But while Amtrak was shutting down its service to Boise and Dallas, it was trying to start up a costly new service between Boston, Massachusetts, and Portland, Maine. Although that route is already served by a taxpaying private bus company that offers a two hour ride for $15 per trip, Amtrak proposes to spend $40 million of taxpayer money to offer competing service. According to railroad experts in Massachusetts, the new Amtrak service will take two and one-half hours to make the trip -- 30 minutes longer than the private bus that now serves the route.

<b>U.S. Taxpayers Fund Egyptian Obituaries</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Each year, the United States provides Egypt with more than $815 million in foreign aid. Despite this vast financial assistance, however, Egypt remains a poor country, largely because of its commitment to failed socialist principles and the U.S. government's apparent indifference to this commitment. Egypt also maintains a huge bureaucracy whose employees are estimated to work approximately 27 minutes per day -- which may explain why they have become so dependent on U.S. welfare, why Egypt is the 48th-poorest country in the world, and why half its population is unable to read.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Internal Agency for International Development (AID) reports reveal that substantial amounts of American aid to Egypt -- up to one-third of the total spent on some projects -- are lost through gross misuse of the money. Take for example the $3.4 million provided to, and spent by, the National Bank for Development in Cairo. According to AID's auditor, more than $1 million of what the bank spent was used for questionable purposes, with $693,000 of this amount deemed ineligible and $329,900 described as unsupported. AID heavily censored most of the dollar figures in the report provided to Heritage, but there was enough information to deduce that much of the wasted money appeared to benefit personally many of the Egyptian Bank officials directly involved in the project.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Chief among the ineligible expenditures were bonuses paid to the Bank's chairman, project director, and senior officers. Although the amounts taken by members of this group were censored by AID, the auditor did note that they "appear excessive considering the loan fund has just recently reached operational break even." Bonuses also were paid to more junior bank employees and project employees. According to AID's October 1, 1995, Report No. 6-263-96-001-N, taken together these ineligible bonuses cost the U.S. taxpayer $629,000. Other ineligible expenses incurred by bank employees and officials included costs of parties, gifts, obituaries in newspapers, flowers, tips, radios, meals, entertainment, conference prizes, and new clothes for Bank employees to wear to a population development conference.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
East of Cairo, in the Gaza Strip bordering Israel, is the headquarters of the AID-funded Society for the Care of the Handicapped in the Gaza Strip. According to the audit, $1.5 million of the Society's $9 million budget was spent on ineligible or unsupported purposes, including an apartment in Arlington, Virginia, for the Society's Palestinian chairman. According to AID audit Report No. 6-294-96-006-N, the chairman billed AID for the apartment's rent, security, "significant" telephone charges, and maid service; the cost of an automobile (including traffic fines and parking tickets); medical costs for his family; and cable TV. He also illegally billed the U.S. for travel expenses to his Virginia getaway (including airfare for his wife), other living expenses beyond those described above, and a gun for his Palestinian bodyguard. In response to the audit findings, the chairman claimed that "Cable TV was needed because only CNN produced quick and detailed accounts of what was happening in the occupied territories."

<b>Food Stamps for Caviar</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This year, the government will spend over $26.3 billion on the <a href="http://www.usda.gov/fcs/fs.htm">Food Stamp Program</a>. More than 10 percent -- approximately $3 billion -- of this amount will be lost to fraud and abuse, according to testimony by Roger A. Viadero, Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. One reason is that "food stores" accepting food stamps can be in the program without any required preauthorization visits. Once a store is authorized to accept stamps, visits by inspectors are rare and fraud is frequent.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In one instance, a South Carolina retailer redeemed over $300,000 worth of food stamps over a two-year period despite the fact that the only "store" he owned was a fleet of 12 ice cream trucks. Across the country, in Los Angeles, California, a liquor store was removed from the program after an inspection revealed that its food inventory consisted of a few containers of milk and a limited supply of canned goods with expiration dates long passed. Further north, in Alameda County, a pizza parlor was authorized to accept food stamps even though it did not sell foods for home preparation. An employee told government investigators that the store was not authorized to accept the stamps but still averaged $3,500 a month in food stamp sales.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The behavior of some of the nation's 25 million food stamp recipients accounts for the rest of the abuse, as demonstrated by a <i>New York Post</i> report that a New York couple bought over $120 worth of caviar at a grocery store using food stamps, then sold the product at a flea market for a profit. Skeptical cashiers checked the regulations on allowable purchases and found that food stamps can indeed be used to purchase caviar. It turns out that the actions of the couple were not illegal. Elsewhere, a transient was able to collect $21,000 in food stamps from 16 states over a three-and-a-half-year period by traveling from city to city by bus for a few weeks each month and applying for the stamps under an assumed name. The man would wait the required waiting period for application approval and then make a return trip to collect the stamps. While travel was inconvenient, he told investigators that "getting the stamps was easy." In Tennessee, a woman with assets valued at over $350,000 was charged in August of this year with illegally receiving $27,000 in food stamps and welfare benefits over a three-and-a-half-year period. Her husband is president of a security company.

<b>Who's in Charge:</b> Yvette S. Jackson, Deputy Administrator, Food Stamp Program, U.S. Department of Agriculture, (703)305-2026.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

An activist labor movement may be the most significant new force in American politics, but the agenda of labor's new leaders is radically different from that of the traditional labor movement. Curiously, much of this new agenda is unconnected with workplace issues, not generally supported among rank-and-file union members, and clearly outside the mainstream of American politics. In recent decades, organized labor has been transformed from a relatively centrist political force into a powerful lobby for liberal special interests and big government. Organized labor has decided to use its billions of dollars in dues revenue to defeat conservative Members of Congress, while also encouraging the Boy Scouts to admit homosexuals and atheists, offering financial contributions to political groups that promote abortion, and opposing welfare reform and a balanced budget.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While political parties have moved to the center and right, union activism has shifted decisively to the left. This transformation has occurred in tandem with a historic change in union membership from private-sector, largely industrial workers toward government and service employees. Unions began organizing the public sector in the 1960s and 1970s to offset a continuing decline in membership, particularly in manufacturing. New AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, the first federation leader from a government employee-dominated union, came to power when his coalition of service and public-sector unions toppled former president Lane Kirkland and his industry-based allies.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The desires of government employees, however, have proven to be in conflict with the interests of blue-collar workers, who now get billed twice for big government: Thanks to their unions' lobbying efforts, private-sector workers pay high taxes to support bloated bureaucracies in Washington and state capitals around the country. Meanwhile, union dues are used to support political causes that are irrelevant to the bread-and-butter interests of the average worker. There is no evidence that the new union leadership's radical political campaign will do anything but accelerate the exit of union members, especially in the private sector. Workers who once formed the backbone of the American labor movement now find themselves paying higher and higher fees to unions that are paying less and less attention to the real interests of their members.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In fairness, it should be easier than it now is for union members to opt out of radical politicking by obtaining a refund of the significant portion of their dues that is used to support such efforts. In view of organized labor's growing politicization, policymakers should re-examine the unique privileges that have been granted to unions.

<p>
<b>THE POLITICAL TRADITION OF AMERICAN LABOR</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Writing over a decade ago in <i>Policy Review</i>, labor analyst Max Green decried the full-scale embrace of Walter Mondale's presidential candidacy by Lane Kirkland, the AFL-CIO's president from 1979-1995.<sup>2</sup>  Green argued that Kirkland's actions, taken at the behest of public employee unions, represented the ultimate rejection of the ideas of American Federation of Labor founder Samuel Gompers. Gompers made sure that labor kept "its distance both from socialism and from partisan politics," focusing instead on organizing and winning concessions from business through collective bargaining. In the first half of this century, the AFL even refused to support minimum-wage legislation. In those days, labor was committed to the market economy and "opted for what Gompers and his associates called `trade unionism pure and simple,' the collective-bargaining strategy on which workers of every political stripe could agree."<sup>3</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If labor unions did take a political stand, it was generally centrist, especially on social issues. In 1968, when the United Auto Workers threatened to leave the AFL-CIO because of AFL-CIO founder George Meany's opposition to an alliance with activist left intellectuals and students, Meany bid the UAW good riddance. In 1972, labor unions joined with the Coalition for a Democratic Majority, a group established to move the Democratic Party to the center, but abandoned the effort in 1974 in order to concentrate once again on economic issues. The colorful Alan Barkan, AFL-CIO political director in 1972, denounced the McGovernites for turning the Democratic Party into the "party of acid, amnesty, and abortion."<sup>4</sup>

<p>
<b>DECLINING MEMBERSHIP AND THE TURN TO GOVERNMENT</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For all the media focus on upheaval in the AFL-CIO, the federation's political aggressiveness and renewed emphasis on organizing have neither stemmed declines in union membership nor markedly improved working conditions; "wage growth is at historically sluggish levels, and labor's share of the growing national income is currently at its lowest level in two decades."<sup>5</sup>  In spite of these trends, workers apparently do not see joining unions as a remedy. In the mid-1950s, 35 percent of America's workers were unionized; today, fewer than 15 percent belong to unions. Leo Troy, a labor economist at Rutgers University, notes that unions have lost 7.5 million members since 1970, largely in the shrinking industrial sector.<sup>6</sup>  In response to these declining numbers, unions have attempted to bring more public employees into the fold. Of the 16.4 million union members in America, 6.9 million work directly for federal, state, and local governments.<sup>7</sup>  Despite the aggressive efforts of numerous AFL-CIO affiliates to recruit government workers, however, Sweeney has been forced to admit failure: "We are still losing members as an absolute number, and as a percentage of the workforce."<sup>8</sup>  In fact, the number of union members fell from 16.7 million in 1994 to 16.4 million last year.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The AFL-CIO altered its moderate political stance as it moved beyond the shrinking manufacturing sector. As the union movement has grown more dependent on the public sector, it has moved squarely into the liberal camp, forging the very alliances that Gompers and Meany had shunned.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In October 1995, public employee unions such as the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and Service Employees' International Union (SEIU) spearheaded a successful rebellion to depose Lane Kirkland as president of the AFL-CIO. John Sweeney, head of the SEIU, became the first AFL-CIO president from a largely public-sector union, completing the federation's transformation from a voice for workers in negotiating with management into one of the nation's principal defenders of big government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The labor movement's efforts to organize public employees may do more for big government than for private-sector union members, who would benefit from balanced budgets, lower taxes, and less intrusive government. Although bloated bureaucracies might be in the interest of a federal employee in Washington, D.C., or a municipal employee in Cleveland, Ohio, the man or woman on the automobile assembly line in Hamtramck, Michigan, benefits directly from lower taxes. Deficit spending comes out of their paychecks. By siding disproportionately with the interests of government employees, the AFL-CIO is neglecting the millions in its ranks who work in the private sector.
<p>
<b>LURCHING LEFTWARD</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

More significant than its defense of big government is organized labor's continuing leftward lurch on a broad array of issues. Liberal activists have captured the union movement and are using its influence to move the Democratic Party to the left by "controlling the debate," as AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer Richard Trumka puts it.10  Trumka and other AFL-CIO officials, for example, regularly denounce the so-called New Democrats who have sought to move the party away from its traditional big-government agenda. Trumka has decried the agenda of the Democratic Leadership Council, the leading organization of centrist Democrats, as "immoral ... anti-worker [and] a blueprint for political disaster."<sup>11</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The AFL-CIO's "Union Summer" project, originally designed to train 1,000 young people to become union organizers, also is being used for "voter education and registration" as well as to fight the California Civil Rights Initiative.<sup>12</sup>  This shift epitomizes the transformation from recruitment to politicking. It is not surprising, however, considering that Union Summer's director, Andrew Levin, boasts of having made a career of "apartheid, anti-nuclear, environment, civil rights, community organizing, union organizing, and student protest" activism.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The AFL-CIO has become a leading funder of liberal causes, lending its rhetoric, foot soldiers, and coffers to a variety of movements. Under Sweeney, this shift to the left has accelerated, leaving organized labor outside the political mainstream on issues ranging from racial preferences to sexual preferences, tax policy, and protecting American national interests abroad:
<p><ul>
<li> The AFL-CIO has strongly opposed the $500-per-child tax credit.
<p>
<li> The National Education Association, United Auto Workers, and AFL-CIO have lobbied against legislation to make English America's official language.
<p>
<li> Several AFL-CIO unions have donated thousands of dollars to Emily's List and other pro-abortion political action committees.
</ul> <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

During the 1996 election cycle, as part of their drive to control the debate, the activists who have captured the AFL-CIO have not hesitated to use workers' hard-earned dues money to fund their aggressive political campaign. The AFL-CIO has pledged to spend $35 million -- seven times the amount it normally spends in an election year -- in an effort to unseat 75 conservative Members of Congress.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The AFL-CIO's new leaders are pushing a cultural and economic agenda that does not represent the views of the federation's members. In some cases, labor leaders have taken positions directly counter to the interests of working families. Often, they have chosen to highlight issues with no relevance to collective bargaining, taking advantage of their roles and organizational resources to advance their own agenda.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

For instance, the leadership of the Detroit chapter of AFSCME passed an emergency resolution last year condemning the death sentence meted out to a man convicted of murdering a police officer in Pennsylvania.<sup>14</sup>  As leader of the AFL-CIO, John Sweeney has continued this trend. In a March 1995 address to Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition, for instance, Sweeney declared "that as long as I am president of our federation, the AFL-CIO will `be there' for you."<sup>15</sup>  Yet Jackson remains one of the most controversial figures in American politics; a December 1995 <i>Wall Street Journal</i>/NBC News poll showed that of 2,007 Americans polled, 46 percent viewed Jackson either somewhat negatively or very negatively, compared to just 26 percent who viewed him either very positively or somewhat positively.<sup>16</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Consider some of organized labor's recent stances on issues wholly unrelated to collective bargaining:
<blockquote><p>
<b>Homosexuality:</b> Joe Velasquez, Director of Community Services for the AFL-CIO, led a 1995 campaign to force the Boy Scouts of America to include homosexuals and atheists. Velasquez even lectured the Boy Scouts about the need to reexamine their views and "decide if they are living up to their mission of teaching America's children the values that made this country great."<sup>17</sup>  AFL-CIO affiliates in Colorado and Maine took leading roles in campaigns to oppose efforts in those states to outlaw ordinances that would have given homosexuals special constitutional privileges. Other unions have taken an active role in promoting homosexual rights through donations to political action committees. Since 1993, AFSCME has donated over $5,000 to the Human Rights Campaign Fund, which promotes homosexual "marriage."  The Service Employees International Union has pushed actively for spousal rights for homosexual partners.<sup>18</sup>  All of this despite the fact that over 80 percent of Americans support a law banning same-sex marriages.<sup>19</sup>
<p>
<b>Abortion:</b> William Hamilton, Jr., who ran the Planned Parenthood Federation of America's Washington office for 13 years, now directs the legislative and political program of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.<sup>20</sup>  Hamilton was one of 12 members of the AFL-CIO Political Action Transition Workgroup, which decided to launch the effort to defeat 75 conservative members of the U.S. House of Representatives in 1996.<sup>21</sup>  Through its various political action committees, the union movement has funded several pro-abortion groups. Earlier this year, AFSCME donated $5,000 to Americans for Freedom of Choice. Over the past three years, Emily's List has received contributions of $2,500 from the AFL-CIO, $5,000 from the NEA, $10,000 from AFSCME, $5,000 from the Communications Workers of America, $7,500 from the SEIU, and $7,000 from the UAW. Voters for Choice has accepted $7,000 from AFSCME and $4,000 from the NEA. The NEA also donated $2,500 to the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. The Women's Campaign Fund has taken money from numerous unions, including AFSCME ($5,000), the AFL-CIO ($4,000), the CWA ($7,500), the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers ($15,000), the Letter Carriers ($6,000), the UAW ($15,000), and the UMW ($5,500).<sup>22</sup>  AFSCME was sued earlier this year by Edward P. Kelly, a devout Roman Catholic who objected to the use of union funds to lobby for abortion rights.<sup>23</sup>  A federal judge ruled that AFSCME had violated Mr. Kelly's religious liberties under the 1964 Civil Rights Act and allowed him to donate part of his agency fees to a charitable organization instead.
<p>
<b>Racial and Gender Preferences:</b> Polls indicate that over 80 percent of Americans -- black and white -- oppose racial preferences,<sup>24</sup> but the AFL-CIO staunchly supports these measures, using union members' dues to support programs that will discriminate against members and their families.<sup>25</sup>  The UAW lobbied against H.R. 2128, a bill to eliminate federal affirmative action programs,<sup>26</sup> and several unions are organizing to oppose the California Civil Rights Initiative, which would end racial preferences in public education, government hiring, and government contracts. The California Teachers Association, the United Farm Workers, the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, and local affiliates of the American Federation of Teachers, the SEIU, and the AFL-CIO all plan to publish pamphlets and man phone banks to get out the vote against the CCRI.
<p>
<b>English as Official Language:</b> Despite the fact that eight out of ten Americans support making English the official language, several national and international unions, including the UAW, the NEA, and the AFL-CIO, have opposed legislation to implement the idea.<sup>27</sup>  The AFL-CIO Executive Council declared that it was "deeply disturbed" by the U. S. House of Representatives' passage of the English as the Official Language of Government Act, claiming that the law "would weaken the federal government's ability to deal effectively with the challenges of living in a global age."<sup>28</sup>
<p>
<b>Welfare:</b> In a recent poll of 1,000 union members, 87 percent voiced support for welfare reform that both requires recipients to work and limits the amount of time someone may receive welfare checks.<sup>29</sup>  Nevertheless, labor unions have tapped into the dues of their members to assure that the indolent not have to seek employment. In its year-end report for 1995, AFSCME has bragged about its work with the American Civil Liberties Union in suing various state and local agencies concerning welfare issues.<sup>30</sup>  AFSCME has been particularly aggressive in opposing time limits on cash payments and in fighting workfare, the concept that welfare recipients should work for benefits.<sup>31</sup>  John Sweeney described the recently passed welfare reform bill as "anti-poor, anti-immigrants, anti-women and anti-children," and said that it was a "sad day" when President Clinton signed it.<sup>32</sup>  The AFL-CIO also has decried attempts to prohibit alcohol and drug addicts from receiving welfare through Supplemental Security Income (SSI).<sup>33</sup>
<p>
<b>The Federal Budget:</b> Some 82 percent of union members surveyed support amending the Constitution to require Congress to balance the budget.<sup>34</sup>  Yet the AFL-CIO leadership opposes a balanced budget amendment.<sup>35</sup>  The average working family pays thousands of dollars a year in taxes simply to pay the interest on the national debt, but the AFL-CIO and its allies have chosen to side with the status quo and leave working families to pay the bill. According to a February 1995 AFSCME Legislative Alert, "President McEntee and Secretary-Treasurer Lucy have announced that defeat of the Balanced Budget Amendment is our number one national legislative priority. It is urgent that you call your Senators and urge them to vote `NO' on <i>any</i> version of the balanced budget amendment."<sup>36</sup>  Moreover, says the AFL-CIO, "We strongly oppose the [$500-per-child tax credit and other] tax provisions of the `Contract with America.'"<sup>37</sup>  Given the fact that 78 percent of union members support the tax credit, one wonders just who the AFL-CIO means by "we."<sup>38</sup>
<p>
<b>Christian Conservatives and New Age Religion:</b> As part of its efforts to "build solidarity among many kinds of movements,"<sup>39</sup> organized labor gave its blessing to an April 1996 "Summit on Ethics and Meaning" organized by Michael Lerner, a 1960s radical who has emerged more recently as a sort of New Age "politics of meaning" guru to Hillary Clinton.<sup>40</sup>  AFL-CIO President Sweeney was the featured dinner speaker at the conference, which was convened by, among others, People for the American Way, the <i>Utne Reader</i>, the Institute for Policy Studies, and Planned Parenthood of America's Clergy Advisory Board. In his speech, Sweeney declared that participants in the conference were the "core of a progressive coalition that will expand the frontiers of social justice."  One of key goals of the conference was to educate the public about "the deprivation of meaning in daily life and how our hunger for meaning is used and manipulated by racist, xenophobic, nationalist, fascist and fundamentalist religious groups in ways that set people against each other."<sup>41</sup>  The AFL-CIO's bias was made even clearer by an attack in the <i>AFL-CIO News</i> on the Christian Coalition, the American Family Association, Focus on the Family, the Family Research Council, and the National Association of Christian Educators. The <i>AFL-CIO News</i> alleged that these "religious extremists pose a significant threat to those candidates who would best represent America's working families."<sup>42</sup>  At the same time, the AFL-CIO and the Letter Carriers union have given political action committee donations to the quasi-religious Natural Law Party.<sup>43</sup>  This party, founded by adherents of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, claims that a few government-run centers for Transcendental Meditation would reduce crime, illness, terrorism, and war by reducing the global stress level.<sup>44</sup>  Professionals skilled in this meditative technique allegedly can become smarter, halt the aging process, and levitate.
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Many union members do not agree with such extreme positions. AFL-CIO Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson admitted earlier this year that "labor was all over the place [in 1994]: taking positions on gun control, on abortion. Those issues affect us, but our membership told us in surveys that they felt we were not concentrating enough on bread-and-butter issues: pay increases, job security, a better tomorrow for them and their families."<sup>45</sup>  When union members are evenly split on a controversial issue that has little to do with their standard of living, their leaders should avoid taking either a conservative or a liberal position. At the very least, members should not be forced to finance causes they oppose.

<p>
<b>SWEENEY'S FIRST YEAR: LABOR SOCIALISM IN ACTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The union movement is gradually adopting the tactics of European-style labor socialism. In a December 1995 speech, Sweeney offered the following insight into his thought: "I was in Europe last week, traveling with President Clinton, and I couldn't help but be impressed with what is going on in France. In this country, when we're faced with cuts in vital services that benefit workers and the poor, we shut down a few parts of the government. In France, the workers shut down the country -- even though only 8 percent of the work force is organized!"<sup>46</sup>  Sweeney's admiration for the efforts of the French Communist-backed General Confederation of Labor and its stranglehold on many of France's key public-sector agencies is an ominous indication of the AFL-CIO's political agenda.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The New Voice platform on which Sweeney ran for the AFL-CIO presidency promised to "challenge the right-wing domination of the media in politics."<sup>47</sup>  This unusual claim shows just how far out of the political mainstream Sweeney and his colleagues are. In a recent Roper Center survey of Washington print correspondents and bureau chiefs, only 2 percent described themselves as conservative, compared to 91 percent who saw themselves as liberal to moderate.<sup>48</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This vision of American politics is not surprising given Sweeney's political history. <i>Democratic Left</i>, a publication of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), boasts that Sweeney is a card-carrying DSA member.<sup>49</sup>  The DSA, founded by avowed socialist Michael Harrington, seeks to establish "an openly socialist presence in American communities and politics."  While running for AFL-CIO President, Sweeney worked closely with the DSA by picketing the Columbus office of House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich (R-OH).<sup>50</sup>  The DSA, moreover, is urging youth involvement in Sweeney's Union Summer project: "single-issue progressive young activists have all found a home in unions. And through the labor movement, those activists have learned the connectedness of various forms of oppression and exploitation."<sup>51</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under the leadership of George Meany and even Lane Kirkland, the AFL-CIO supported the Cold War and military intervention, if necessary, to protect American national interests. The DSA, a bastion of the very type of "blame America first" thinking that Meany, in particular, condemned, opposed U.S. foreign policy in Latin America, Eastern Europe, and the Persian Gulf. Although Sweeney has issued few statements on foreign policy, it is worth noting that in January 1991, when he was head of the SEIU, he and Steve Rosenthal, now the AFL-CIO's political director, spearheaded a coalition of labor leaders opposed to the Gulf War.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sweeney and the rest of the new AFL-CIO leadership have even been praised by the Communist Party, U.S.A., a virulent critic of the federation under George Meany's leadership. "Headed by President John Sweeney," writes CPUSA National Chairman Gus Hall, "the new leadership is also involved in a process of radicalization and militancy that is already evident in the activities and commitment of resources in the election campaign, organizing the unorganized and the campaign to win a higher minimum wage."<sup>52</sup>  Reflecting on various speeches at the AFL-CIO convention (including Sweeney's), Hall wrote that "The radical shift in both leadership and policy is a very positive, even historic change. We do not want to take any credit for the shift, but our Party has advocated class struggle policies throughout its 75 years."<sup>53</sup>

<p>
<b>POLITICAL EXPLOITATION OF UNION MEMBERS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The shift from collective bargaining to aggressive political activism has not been limited to issuing cultural manifestos and press releases. Several unions have become heavily involved in partisan politics as well. Despite the fact that union members split their vote roughly 60-40 between the two major parties in 1994, the AFL-CIO has launched an overwhelmingly partisan $35 million "voter education project," funded mainly by mandatory union dues, to defeat conservative members of the 104th Congress. In the words of AFL-CIO political director Steve Rosenthal, the 40 percent who supported Republicans simply voted "wrong."<sup>54</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Unions played a key role at the 1996 Democratic National Convention. NEA President Keith Geiger spoke at the convention and was preaching largely to the choir: 405 NEA members were among the approximately 5,000 delegates.<sup>55</sup>  In addition to that huge total, 889 other delegates came from 44 different international unions, according to the AFL-CIO.<sup>56</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The AFL-CIO leadership's efforts to re-elect President Clinton undoubtedly will continue through the fall. Executive Vice-President Linda Chavez-Thompson proclaimed at a union rally that "we will not have a day of rest until Bill Clinton and Al Gore are back in the White House."<sup>57</sup>  Other unions, including the SEIU, plan to close their headquarters in late October and use their staff for a get-out-the-vote effort. This blatant partisanship would be illegal if undertaken by any other type of organization. Even more important, however, it does nothing to advance the economic interests of working-class families.
<p>
<b>LABOR'S LEFT WING</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The nation's largest union, the National Education Association, epitomizes labor's leftward political tilt. At its 1995 annual convention, delegates passed a resolution stating that "the NEA believes that the following programs and practices are detrimental to public education and must be eliminated: privatization, performance contracting, tax credits for tuition to private and parochial schools, voucher plans... and evaluations by private, profit making groups."<sup>58</sup>  The NEA also has been outspoken in supporting multiculturalism, bilingual education, condom distribution, and abortion. With public school education in a downward spiral, the NEA should be concentrating on stopping this decline; instead, it is pursuing a partisan political agenda. The NEA employs nearly 1,500 people to organize teachers to participate in political activity.<sup>59</sup>  Clearly, though, it is the close financial ties between the NEA and the Democratic Party that should be of the greatest concern to dues-paying members. "In 1994, [the NEA] gave 99 percent of its PAC money -- about $2.27 million -- to Democrats" despite the fact that 30 percent of NEA members are Republicans.<sup>60</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Several unions are trying to push the AFL-CIO even farther to the left. The United Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers, the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, and the Oil, Chemical, and Atomic Workers used union dues to finance last month's founding convention of the Labor Party, a new organization which plans to compete with the Democratic Party on the left.<sup>61</sup>

<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The National Labor Relations Act, the basic federal legislation governing labor unions, empowers unions to provide on-the-job representation for workers in terms of wages, benefits, and working conditions. The AFL-CIO's new leaders have shunned this role, preferring to serve as spokesmen for and financial supporters of an activist political agenda. Politicking and other non-collective bargaining activities cost the average union member hundreds of dollars per year in dues.62  The labor movement needs to return to basics and concentrate on representing union workers in collective bargaining with management. If organized labor is unwilling to return to its chartered role as collective bargaining agent, then union privileges should be re-examined.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although unions have a right to participate in politics, they should not finance their political activities through compulsory membership dues. Simple fairness demands that union leaders not be permitted to exact dues from members and then divert union resources to political causes many of those members do not support. The U. S. Constitution itself protects workers against such abuses.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In a 1988 decision, <i>Communications Workers of America v. Beck</i>, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that union members are entitled to a refund of the portion of their dues used for purposes other than collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment.<sup>63</sup>  But these traditional union functions may represent only a small fraction of today's union spending; in a case involving the NEA and two of its affiliates, for example, the union was able to justify only 10 percent of its general treasury funds as chargeable to bargaining activities.<sup>64</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Labor unions are supposed to defend the rights of working men and women, not trample them: The law says that workers should have this money returned to them if they wish. The Luntz survey cited above showed that 78 percent of union workers were unaware that they had the right to a refund of the portion of their mandatory dues that goes to political activity. The same survey revealed that 56 percent of those union members would be likely to request a refund rather than let labor leaders use the money to advance their own political agenda.<sup>65</sup>  The number of members who would ask for refunds probably would increase substantially if members knew that labor leaders were spending their dues money to fight tax cuts for working families, welfare reform that requires recipients to work, and a balanced budget--all of which rank-and-file members support overwhelmingly.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The tide may be starting to turn. John Joyce, head of the International Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen, recently refused to join in the AFL-CIO's endorsement of President Clinton for re-election. Spurred by the President's veto of a bill that would have banned partial-birth abortions, Joyce said that while labor leaders should be taking positions on economic issues, "union members do not necessarily want or expect union leaders to take a position on issues, like abortion or gun control, where there's no obvious connection to their lives as a union member."<sup>66</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While labor unions have a right to get involved in politics, they should not use compulsory membership dues to finance a specific political agenda. Labor leaders are free to associate with such groups as the Democratic Socialists of America, the Natural Law Party, or Planned Parenthood; but as the Supreme Court declared in <i>Beck</i>, they have no business trying to compel millions of union members to support this extreme political agenda with mandatory union dues.

for his humor. But, not from everyone. NBC's Lisa Myers

<FONT  SIZE=+2>1)</FONT> In an amazing break out of balance, Monday night
both ABC's World News Tonight and the CBS Evening News ran
post-debate "fact check" stories that took on assertions
made in Sunday night's debate by both Dole and Clinton.
<p>
In post-debate banter, Bob Dole largely avoided condemnations
for being too negative or too harsh, but there were some exceptions:
<p>
-- On Monday's Today (October 7) NBC's Lisa Myers raised
the "harsh" theme. Here's the quote caught by MRC analyst
Geoffrey Dickens: 
<blockquote>"I think he was strongest when he talked about his
proposals, tax cuts, opportunity scholarships for poor
children. He showed the wit and humor that those of us who
have covered Bob Dole know. The problem, I think, is that he
may have been a little bit harsh at times and that I don't
think that he really did enough to bring home a lot of
undecided voters."</blockquote>
-- During a special midnight (ET) Inside Politics after
the debate CNN brought on Jack Kemp and Al Gore. CNN's
Bernard Shaw did not ask Kemp negative questions about Bill
Clinton's performance, but Judy Woodruff did pose two such
questions to Al Gore about Bob Dole. As transcribed by MRC 
analyst Clay Waters, here are two of her inquiries:<blockquote>
<EM>Woodruff:</EM> "Bob Dole, as I mentioned a moment ago, among
other things, repeatedly again referred to the President as
being liberal. I mean, just, it seemed to come up throughout
the debate. Do you think the President was able to adequately
respond to what has apparently become a negative label?"<br>
<EM>Al Gore responded:</EM> "I think the American people want to
hear about ideas and don't want to hear candidates insulting
each other and hurling accusations and personal charges."<br>
<EM>To which Woodruff asked:</EM>"Well, do you think Bob Dole
was too negative tonight?"</blockquote>
-- Minutes after the debated ended, reporter Phil Jones
made it clear he was not satisfied with Dole's performance.
MRC analyst Steve Kaminski took down his reaction:
<blockquote>
    "I think that if I had to say probably where he was the
weakest and where he really needed to score was, he needed
to explain to the American people how this country can
afford that 15 percent tax cut, the centerpiece of his
campaign, without these draconian cuts. I don't think he has
done that yet."</blockquote>

<a name=hunt>
<FONT  SIZE=+2>2)</FONT> In Sunday's CyberAlert I reported how on Saturday's
CNN Capital Gang Al Hunt, Executive Washington Editor of the
Wall Street Journal, had disparaged three conservatives. He
said Jesse Helms represented "hate," Pat Robertson was a
"hatemonger" and Woody Jenkins was an "extremist."
<p>
MRC analyst Clay Waters reminded me of what Hunt uttered
the week before, on the September 28 Capital Gang:
<blockquote>
"Whatever you thought of Jimmy Carter as President, he
has been a great ex-President, helping to avoid bloodshed
from North Korea to Haiti, bringing health care to children
in Africa and Latin America. Even Bob Novak has lauded some
of these efforts. The outrage? The Nobel Peace prize for
years has given President Carter the back of its hand. It
can make amends next week and give him what he deserves: the
1996 Nobel Peace Prize."</blockquote>
<a name=times>
<FONT  SIZE=+2>3)</FONT> Sunday's CyberAlert also reported how <EM>The
Washington Times</EM> and <EM>Washington Post</EM> led page one with the
news that an aide to Craig Livingstone contradicted his
story on the FBI files. On Sunday, <EM>The New York Times</EM>
finally got around to reporting the revelation, but on the
bottom of page A30 under this vague headline: "New Testimony
Given on Republicans' Files."<p>
But at least <EM>The New York Times</EM> reported the news. I'm
still waiting to see the first broadcast network story.

<h3>
AS YELTSIN'S HEALTH FADES, THE SUCCESSION STRUGGLE INTENSIFIES IN RUSSIA</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/cohen.htm">Ariel Cohen</a>, Ph.D.</a><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 122<br>
October 7, 1996<br>
</center><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Russian President Boris Yeltsin's declining health has generated great speculation around the world about whether he can continue to lead Russia effectively. As the world awaits Yeltsin's scheduled open heart surgery, concerns for the future of Russia's fledgling democracy mount. Should he die, it is unclear who would succeed him to lead Russia into the next millennium. In addition, any further deterioration of Russia's economic stability and military position would present serious foreign policy challenges to the United States and the rest of the world.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A fascinating power struggle already is underway in Moscow involving Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin; Yeltsin's security aide and National Security Council Secretary, retired General Alexander Lebed; Chief of Staff Anatoly Chubais; and other key political figures. As this power struggle unfolds, three possible scenarios have emerged.
<blockquote> <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Scenario #1: President Yeltsin dies in office.</b> Prime Minister Chernomyrdin becomes Acting President, and presidential elections, with Chernomyrdin and Lebed as the foremost contenders, take place within three months. Under Chernomyrdin, the Russian government most likely would follow the policies put in place under Yeltsin. If Lebed were elected President, Russia might assume a more anti-Western, isolationist posture.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Scenario #2: President Yeltsin rebounds and fully assumes power.</b> Chernomyrdin and Chubais remain important players, and Lebed is put under even tighter control -- perhaps even fired -- for behavior seen as disloyal to Yeltsin. In this case, Russian foreign policy would remain the same. Friction with the West on NATO expansion eventually might be resolved, but arms control and nuclear proliferation concerns would continue to mar bilateral U.S.-Russia relations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Scenario #3: President Yeltsin remains in power but is incapacitated.</b> Chernomyrdin and Chubais assume crucial roles in governing the country. Political turmoil in Moscow would force Russia's leaders to concentrate on the power struggle, and foreign policy would be neglected. Foreign Minister Evgenii Primakov might assume a dominant role in managing Russia's international affairs.
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

U.S. foreign policy makers have a great deal at stake in any scenario for Russia's post-Yeltsin transition. Potential turmoil in Russia raises serious questions such as control of the Russian nuclear arsenal, civil unrest, and upheaval in the defeated, demoralized, and underpaid Russian military. No matter which scenario unfolds, any future Russian government could be less experienced and less predictable than the current one, and might pursue an adventurous policy of aggression in Russia's "near abroad" to solidify support at home. Like the czars and commissars who ruled before them, whoever gains ultimate control of the Kremlin -- whether it is Yeltsin, Lebed, or Chernomyrdin -- will have a tremendous ability to shape the very nature of Russian society and the Russian state.

<p>
<b>JOCKEYING FOR POWER: POLITICAL PLAYERS IN THE SUCCESSION STRUGGLE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Two main contenders for the presidential mantle have emerged over the past three months. The most obvious is Victor Chernomyrdin, Yeltsin's Prime Minister since December 1992. Chernomyrdin's primary opponent is General (Ret.) Alexander Lebed, Yeltsin's national security aide.<sup>1</sup>
<p>
<b>The Predictable Chernomyrdin </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

According to the Russian constitution,<sup>2</sup> should Yeltsin die in office or become unable to perform his duties, the Prime Minister becomes Acting President for no longer than three months until new elections take place. Chernomyrdin represents the class of Soviet-era managers who weathered the country's turbulent transition to the rough-and-tumble market of the post-Soviet era. He also represents the powerful and rich oil and gas industry of Russia, which controls hydrocarbon reserves comparable to those of Saudi Arabia. A gas industry manager during the Soviet era, Chernomyrdin served as gas industry minister in Mikhail Gorbachev's cabinet. Today he leads the centrist, pro-establishment Our Home Is Russia political movement, which won 10 percent of the popular vote in the Duma elections of December 1995.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Chernomyrdin is a convert to the gospel of market economics and a frequent dinner partner of International Monetary Fund Chairman Michel Camdessus, U.S. Vice President Albert Gore, and other Western political and business leaders. Although lacking charisma, Chernomyrdin is a tested political leader who preaches the virtues of hard work and a businesslike approach to solving problems. He has proven himself loyal to Yeltsin and expects to be rewarded with the status of heir apparent.
<p>

<b>The Unpredictable Lebed</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Chernomyrdin's main challenger is a retired two-star paratrooper, General Alexander Lebed. A dark horse candidate in the presidential elections of 1996, Lebed is a charismatic and controversial politician. Before the 1996 elections, the Yeltsin camp gave Lebed generous financing, access to state-controlled television, and a team of savvy and sophisticated image makers and campaign managers. Lebed received 15 percent of the popular vote in the first round of the elections, which served Yeltsin well by siphoning nationalist votes away from the Communist candidate, Gennady Zyuganov. Lebed was rewarded with the highly visible post of Secretary of the Security Council and national security aide to the President.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Since assuming his duties as part of the administration, General Lebed has become known as a peacemaker in Chechnya. He achieved a truce and accord in Chechnya in the aftermath of the humiliating defeat of the Russian military in Grozny during August 1996. The mantle of peacemaker has made Lebed even more popular with the Russian voters, who oppose the war by a margin of four to one. Lebed has scored two political victories since coming to office as Yeltsin's national security chief. In June 1996, he managed to remove the unpopular Defense Minister Pavel Grachev from the "Russian Pentagon" and to purge Grachev's cronies in the Ministry of Defense. He also succeeded in obtaining the nomination of widely respected three-star general Igor Rodionov for the post of Minister of Defense.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

However, Lebed's popular support could disappear quickly. His promises to fight crime and corruption have remained largely unfulfilled. Russia's thorniest problems still await the general's customary no-nonsense, tough approach. Failure to make clear progress in fighting crime could jeopardize Lebed's chances to mount a credible challenge to Chernomyrdin and gain the support of the Russian public, media, and bureaucracy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Lebed's relationships with many powerful Moscow politicians, including Chernomyrdin, Anatoly Chubais, and many nationalists, have soured significantly. Lebed repeatedly offended Yeltsin by openly questioning his ability to govern and by casting doubt on the state of his health.<sup>3</sup>  He also called unsuccessfully for the sacking of the powerful Minister of the Interior, Anatoly Kulikov, thereby making another enemy. Some military officers saw Lebed as too eager to conclude an agreement that came close to granting independence to the Chechen separatists. President Yeltsin, weary of this ambitious, outspoken, and unpredictable general, took action to keep him in check by creating a competing body, the Defense Council, which is chaired by Yeltsin and includes Chernomyrdin (as his deputy) and Chubais. In light of these conflicts, some believe General Lebed's political star "may fade without ever reaching its full luster."<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

On October 3, Yeltsin announced in a dramatic broadcast to the nation that he had stripped Lebed of a key position as chairman of the committee in charge of top military nominations. Infuriated, Lebed tendered his resignation, which Yeltsin refused to accept. Yeltsin is trying to deprive Lebed of real authority while at the same time keeping him in the government. The drama around Lebed is continuing. Firing the popular general could strengthen his underdog image and further increase his popularity, thereby also increasing his chances to succeed Yeltsin.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Lebed's post-Soviet conversion to free-market enterprise remains incomplete. While flirting with classic liberal ideology before the election, he now works in tandem with Sergei Glazyev, a moderate nationalist politician. As an economist, Glazyev advocates Keynesian-style industrial policy and highly protectionist tariffs to help local producers. Lebed appointed Glazyev as Director of the Economic Security Department at the Security Council, which he heads. Both Lebed and Glazyev predictably have become spokesmen for the ailing Russian military industrial complex, advocating the massive government infusions of cash that the state-run behemoth badly needs in order to survive. This position, which calls for heavier taxation of Russian energy exports, most likely will cause the oil and gas industry to rally behind Chernomyrdin. Should Lebed assume presidential powers, his policies could make foreign investment in the Russian energy sector less profitable. If Glazyev remains his chief economic adviser, Russia will become more protectionist and more isolated from international markets.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Sources inside the Kremlin have indicated that a broad coalition is forming to check Lebed's efforts in Moscow.<sup>5</sup>  One tactical maneuver -- removing Lebed as manager of the Chechen crisis and putting him in charge of the explosive issue of Russian relations with Ukraine and Belarus -- took place in September. Lebed already has sent tremors through corporate boardrooms in the West by advocating that the dilapidated Russian Black Sea Fleet play a role in securing shipments of oil and gas from the rich Caspian Sea fields. Russian and Western oil interests may be quite wary of the prospect of a President Lebed.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Despite his detractors and a few setbacks in political dogfights, General Lebed is learning the rules of the political game in Moscow. With Glazyev, he has consolidated control over a nationalist movement called the Congress of Russian Communities (KRO). Lebed also is building another support group of hard-line veterans and military retirees called Motherland and Honor. Another political organization supporting Lebed is called Truth and Order. Lebed is interested in forcing presidential elections before Yeltsin's term in office expires in 2000. Yeltsin's failing health may provide him with that opportunity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Despite his rows with the major Moscow politicians, Lebed remains popular with Russian voters.<sup>6</sup>  In fact, he is the most trusted politician in Russia. A recent poll indicates that 34 percent of Russians trust Lebed, compared with Zyuganov (15 percent), Yeltsin (12 percent), and Chernomyrdin (9 percent).<sup>7</sup>  If the presidential elections were held today, Lebed would have a good chance of winning.
<p>

<b>The Dark Horse: Mayor Luzhkov </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Another possible presidential contender if Yeltsin dies is Moscow Mayor Yurii Luzhkov. Moscow is undergoing a true renaissance under Luzhkov's leadership. The city leads the rest of Russia in market transformation and is in the midst of an unprecedented construction and real estate boom. Moscow's banks now control 80 percent of Russia's finances. Luzhkov has even repaired the notoriously bad Russian roads and has initiated such high-visibility multimillion-dollar projects as the reconstruction of the Church of Christ the Savior, which was blown up by Communists in the 1930s. The mayor, reelected in 1996 with an unprecedented endorsement of 89 percent of Muscovites, enjoys country-wide popularity. His reputation as a tough, no-nonsense manager and <I>khoziain</I> (boss) make him a serious contender for the presidential mantle.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1993, Luzhkov initiated a campaign to arrest and deport dark-skinned "persons of Caucasian nationality" from Moscow; tens of thousands of Southerners, many of them Russian citizens, were deported without due process of law. This undertaking, while popular in Moscow, was criticized vigorously by the human rights community. The prospect of Luzhkov's becoming President should raise eyebrows among Russia's 20 million Moslems. Moreover, a campaign by international human rights organizations would taint his image throughout the world.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Luzhkov is trying to build a nationwide image as a "can-do" politician, actively reaching out to governors and regional politicians; an ally, Vladimir Yakovlev, is now mayor of St. Petersburg. Support from such political leaders may be crucial. Luzhkov remains outspoken on a variety of issues, usually taking a nationalist stance. For example, he supports Russian control of the Black Sea port of Sevastopol and adamantly opposes returning the four Kuril Islands, captured by Russia in World War II, to Japan. Luzhkov celebrated his 60th birthday with unprecedented pomp, possibly to send a signal that he is healthy and ready to compete for national office.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Like Chernomyrdin, Luzhkov is capable of generating the large amounts of cash needed for a presidential campaign. His close ties to Vladimir Gusinsky's banking and media empire, for example, give him an obvious advantage. Nevertheless, his chances of winning the Russian presidency could be reduced significantly if the corruption that is rampant in his administration were to become a major issue in the campaign. Moreover, the envy and animosity of people in the provinces toward "rich" Muscovites could hinder Luzhkov's chances to win national office. The Russian provincial electorate in the end may refuse to vote for a capital city mayor.

<p>

<b>The Capable Anatoly Chubais</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Chief of Staff Anatoly Chubais, Russia's most capable political manager, has not declared his presidential ambitions. He is often blamed for the many shortcomings in Russia's economic reforms and privatization program because he was one of the chief architects of market reforms and has played a key role in privatization efforts. Ironically, the hardship caused by these reforms is the main reason Chubais is not running at this time.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Chubais is engaged in a low-key rivalry with Chernomyrdin, a conflict over Chubais's placement of supporters in key jobs with access to Boris Yeltsin. Recently, Chubais reinforced his links to Russia's Democratic Choice, the center-right party led by Yegor Gaidar, and created a political power base for an election. Chubais could align himself with Chernomyrdin against Lebed, and such a coalition doubtless would prove formidable. Chubais is not only an outstanding campaign manager, but also an impressive fund raiser, having built an alliance with the rich Russian banking sector. He also is popular in Washington and other Western capitals, a fact that could make him a key liaison to the Western political and business communities for the Chernomyrdin ticket.

<p>
<b>Other Possible Candidates </b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Should Yeltsin die, the resulting round of presidential elections undoubtedly would include some familiar faces from the 1996 presidential elections. The Communists certainly will field a candidate, either Gennady Zyuganov<sup>8</sup> or his ambitious second in command, Valentin Kuptsov. Though Communist support peaked last summer, Zyuganov is unlikely to get more than 20 percent of the vote. Reformer Grigory Yavlinsky and populist nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky also may choose to run, although it is doubtful that either would gain more than single digits at the polls. In addition, there probably will be several third-tier candidates from the fringe parties and small political groups that make the Russian political landscape so colorful.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
<b>THE SUCCESSION STRUGGLE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

President Yeltsin already has signed a decree transferring most of his power to Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. As Yeltsin's operation draws closer, the possible scenarios vary according to whether Yeltsin is able to recover and reassume power.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Scenario #1: Yeltsin dies.</b> Should Boris Yeltsin die in office, the Russian constitution clearly states that new elections must be held within three months. During this intervening period, the President's duties are to be performed by the Chairman of the Government (Prime Minister), who will not have the right to dissolve the State Duma.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Lebed would be the principal beneficiary under this scenario. Chernomyrdin might want to delay the elections, fearing Lebed's popularity, but this would violate the constitution and might be politically difficult to achieve. A decree or law delaying the elections would amount to amending the constitution. Such legislation would have to be approved by the Duma with a two-thirds majority, by the Council of the Federation (the upper house) by a three-quarters majority, and by two-thirds of the regional legislatures. If Chernomyrdin were to try to pass such a law, Gennady Seleznev (the Communist Chairman of the Duma) and Yegor Stroyev (Chairman of the Council of the Federation) would find it extremely difficult to accommodate him.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In case of new elections, Chubais's role as Chief of Staff and conduit for Yeltsin's views might lessen, but his importance as a campaign manager and fund raiser would benefit him tremendously. Chubais's successful track record in managing Yeltsin's reelection as President could put him in the key position in a Chernomyrdin campaign.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If the elections were to take place now, Lebed would have a realistic chance of winning. However, he also suffers from two key limitations: insufficient financing and little access to the electronic media. If Lebed maintains his alliance with Boris Berezovsky, a prominent businessman and chairman of the board of Russia's ORT-TV, he might raise enough money to buy the air time required to win. If elections are delayed, however, Chernomyrdin and Chubais could put together a coalition capable of stopping him.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If Chernomyrdin were to win, Russia probably would continue the present government's reforms. Some friction with the West would continue, but so would "business as usual."  Investment in oil and gas would receive a higher government priority, and links developed with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank under Chernomyrdin's tutelage would continue.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If Lebed were to win, the future would be less predictable. Lebed has not been exposed to the West and while not vehemently opposed to NATO expansion, treats all foreigners with suspicion. His power base is the military-industrial complex, veterans of the security services and the army, and the law-and-order constituency. His staff is drawn primarily from the ranks of military veterans who were subjected to intensive anti-Western propaganda while in the service.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Lebed's economic knowledge is somewhat lacking, and he relies on Sergei Glazyev's advice. This could cause a delay in the process of economic reform. Russia would likely increase its military spending and subsidize the military-industrial complex, in addition to erecting tariff barriers and creating additional hurdles to foreign investment. However, Lebed is a pragmatist above all else. If he discovered that such policies were highly unpopular, he would be perfectly willing to reverse them.	
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Scenario #2: Yeltsin recovers fully.</b> If Yeltsin survives the operation, Prime Minister Chernomyrdin will be de facto President for the duration of a recuperation period of from three to six months. This would enable the Prime Minister to consolidate his power base and patronage in preparation for the inevitable power struggle. Anatoly Chubais also would play an important role as the one who prepares the presidential decrees and controls access to Yeltsin. During Yeltsin's illness, Lebed has called repeatedly for his resignation and questioned his ability to govern. Once Yeltsin becomes strong enough, Lebed could be fired for these assertions, which many see as demonstrating a lack of loyalty.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

During Yeltsin's recuperation, U.S.-Russian relations might be put on hold. Russian politicians would be preoccupied with the power struggle in the Kremlin and with domestic problems, and bureaucratic inertia and anti-Western sentiments could continue to influence Russian policy. There would be little place for bold moves to end the stalemate on such key issues as NATO expansion, ratification of START II by the Duma, or the sale of nuclear reactors to Iran.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Even if President Yeltsin recovers fully, however, his overall health, the heavy workload, and his personal lifestyle might not allow him to complete his term in office. Within a year or two, the U.S. could face a new crisis in the Kremlin and new presidential elections in Russia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>Scenario #3: Yeltsin is disabled.</b> This is the most difficult scenario to forecast. If Yeltsin survives but his health severely limits his capacity to function as head of state, calls for his resignation are likely to grow, with Lebed leading the choir and the Communists following closely behind. Lebed, Zyuganov, and Seleznev already have called for Yeltsin's resignation.<sup>11</sup>  This scenario would benefit Chernomyrdin and Chubais, who would be positioned to run the state as did Mrs. Woodrow Wilson when President Wilson was incapacitated in the early part of this century.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Russia's constitution does not provide for official certification of the President's health. Nor is there a tradition of making the results of presidential medical examinations public. It is not clear who, if anyone, has the right to nominate a council of medical doctors to attest to the President's fitness. While the constitution does not specify such a body, it is conceivable that the Communist-controlled Duma could show legislative initiative in this. However, the Constitutional Court would probably do its best to avoid such a difficult and highly politicized issue.<sup>12</sup>  In the past, the Court has avoided politically controversial questions, such as the constitutionality of the war in Chechnya. An incapacitated Yeltsin would continue to be the focus of political controversy. A disabled Yeltsin might trigger an even more bitter power struggle which would spill over into the Russian media. In the long term, Yeltsin probably would be forced to resign so that new elections could be held.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION: POWER STRUGGLES CLOUD RUSSIA'S FUTURE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Much is riding on Boris Yeltsin's health: the course of Russia's development as a state, Russia's security and economic relations with the world community, and the future of U.S.-Russian relations. The current crisis may take as much as six months to a year to resolve. If Yeltsin were to die, a Chernomyrdin successor government could provide for continuity in relations with the U.S. and the West, while a Lebed or Luzhkov government would take more a confrontational stance toward America. The worst-case scenario -- a victory for the Communists -- seems unlikely at this time.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Yeltsin's illness is symbolic of Russia's position as a weak and ailing power. The fact that Yeltsin personally is so important is a clear indication that Russian democracy has a long road to travel. A prolonged power struggle will increase internal instability and interfere with Russia's attempts to put its house in order. Nevertheless, the fact that the transition of power may occur in an orderly manner indicates the progress of Russia's body politic. Russian democracy, as imperfect as it is, still has a good chance to survive its founder and current leader.

href="/townhall/columnists/weyrich.html"><!Biography> <p> <h3> Tuesday, January 21, 1997
</h3> <h2>Getting on With the Business of Governing</h2> <P> <blockquote> <p> <DD> Now that
the shallow rhetoric of the inauguration is history, and now that the latest Gingrich matter
has been disposed of at least for the moment, may we please get down to the business of
running this nation?<p>

There is much pious talk about everyone getting along. There are all of these platitudes
about bipartisanship. There are visions of leaders meeting at a summit to come up with grand
agreements.<p>

Now let's get real.  The fact is while everything has been at a standstill since the
elections, the national debt has continued to expand.  Not a word has been heard by any of
our leadership about tackling that one. Oh, the deficit is down. But the deficit isn't the
problem.  It is the debt that is the problem and almost no one from either party is
discussing this little item which threatens to sink us all.<p>

Then there is the matter of Social Security. Some members of the latest Commission have
actually recommended that Social Security be privatized.  The defenders of the status quo
have, of course, said no.  At least this issue is at last, after years of total silence,
being debated.  The advocates of privatization need champions in the Congress.  They have
none in this Administration. Right now there are too many voices accusing and defending
Speaker Gingrich to find out if anyone is aware that we do have a Social Security problem on
our hands which urgently needs fixing.<p>

And then there is Medicare.  The President wants a fix which will last just long enough for
him to get out of office without the "gone bankrupt" sign being nailed to the door on the
oval office.  Some Republicans are talking about block grants to the states.  Others are
talking about privatization of Medicare through Medical Savings Accounts.  There are lots of
proposals.  No real solutions at hand. And the beat goes on.<p>

The food stamp problem gets worse every year.  The Congress did not have the political will
to do something about it in the 104th.  Does anyone think that the 105th Congress has more
political will than the last gathering?  If, however, this problem isn't tackled, the
welfare reform bill which passed in the last Congress and which Bill Clinton now wants to
repeal will end up effecting very little of the welfare mess this nation has amassed.  That
bill, after all, effected just six percent of the welfare and entitlement programs which are
federally funded.<p>

I am just touching on a few things here.  I haven't tackled regulation, national defense,
the evils of multinationalism, trade and a whole host of other problems staring us in the
face.  And we have time to utter meaningless slogans such as "nothing big has ever come from
being small?"  These problems come close to overwhelming us and yet we can spend days
pondering where the money should come from to pay Speaker Gingrich's fine?<p>

The way we are governed reminds me of how certain of my kids became experts at diverting
their parent's attention from the real issues we wanted them to face.  They did this by
creating a series of side shows.  The side shows were amusing for a time.  They even
succeeded in distracting us for a while.  Sooner or later, however, we and they had to face
the music.<p>

That time has come for America.  We've had our little vacation from reality.  The
celebrations are over.  Now, will someone, anyone, please propose some solutions which will
have lasting impact on the genuine problems facing the country?  Or as my kids used to ask:
"Are we there yet?"

<title>Linda Chavez: Feminist kiss patrol is on the march -- October 2, 1996</title>

<h2>Feminist kiss patrol is on the march</h2>     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>     
<p>
BETHESDA, Md. - Now that everyone's had a good laugh at the North Carolina school that
punished 6-year-old Johnathan Prevette for kissing a classmate, maybe it's time to take a serious
look at just how far the federal government and the courts have gone to make this incident possible. 
<p>
In fact, elementary schools are becoming the new frontier in the fight against "sexual harassment,"
thanks to feminist groups and their allies in the Department of Education and on the federal bench. 
<p>
Since 1992, when the Supreme Court said that schools could be held legally responsible in sexual
harassment cases, some two dozen suits have been filed in federal court alleging sexual harassment
of students by other students. Although the original Supreme Court ruling involved sexual harassment
of a student by a teacher, the legal principle now has been extended by lower courts to apply to
student-on-student harassment. 
<p>
And in California, state law allows for students as young as fourth grade to be suspended or
expelled for sexual harassment. 
<p>
This year alone, at least four federal courts have ruled in favor of plaintiffs who alleged that their
fellow students sexually harassed them and that the schools were legally liable, including one case
involving fifth-grade students in Louisiana and another involving sixth-graders in New York. This
whole area of law is relatively new and adapted from employment law, which defines sexual
harassment as a form of discrimination prohibited by civil rights statutes. 
<p>
The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled this year that "(a) student should have the same
protection in school that an employee has in the workplace." Most of these cases rest on the alleged
failure of schools to prevent a so-called hostile environment, which can mean almost anything from
teasing and taunting to actual physical assault. The only practical way for schools to defend
themselves is to have in place rules that punish students for unwanted verbal or physical harassment -
the kind Johnathan's school has been ridiculed for enforcing. 
<p>
But the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) at the Department of Education considers these matters
deadly serious and now routinely investigates charges of sexual harassment in schools around the
country. In the first year after the Supreme Court ruling, the OCR investigated more than 70 schools.
That same year, Congress appropriated several million dollars under the Women's Educational
Equity Act to provide various "gender-equity training" programs to make boys treat girls more
sensitively and ensure an "environment free from sexual harassment and abuse." 
<p>
OCR has been spurred on by advocacy groups, such as the American Association of University
Women, to zealously root out sexual harassment. In 1993, the AAUW published a study claiming
sexual harassment was rampant in U.S. schools, with 85% of girls and 76% of boys having suffered
such treatment in the previous year alone. 
<p>
Of course, the AAUW produced these shocking statistics by including everything from "sexual
looks" to actual "sexual assault" in the same nebulous category of sexual harassment. 
<p>
Johnathan Prevette may be off the hook temporarily, but not for long. If the feds and their feminist
allies have their way, every little boy and girl in the nation will be taught that flirting is a crime, and
even an admiring look, much less a kiss, can land you in court. As one lawyer for the National
Organization for Women told the Los Angeles Times recently, "The way we establish the rules and
lines of behavior is by litigation." 
<p>
Most Americans may consider this nonsense, but the courts are taking a decidedly different view.
And we can expect worse to come from activist judges in the years ahead (three of the four who
voted against school districts in sexual harassment cases this year were recent Clinton appointees).
School bussing - this time the kissing kind - may once again become the courts' top civil rights issue.

Twenty Four Years of Service to Conservative Principles</h2>
</center>

The "mainstream" of politics was a cliche -- much abused -- when in 1973 a handful of true believers in real values of America met in the Nation's capital. Their sole purpose was to affirm their support of the Conservative ideal. What they started -- with the first CPAC conference -- has become over the ensuing twenty-four years the <i>stellar</i> Conservative gathering of the year and one of the most important political events of both parties.<p>

CPAC is designed to advance important everyday issues such as taxes, crime, culture and foreign policy and to provide basic conservative viewpoints and solutions. CPAC '97 will be a three day event from Thursday, March 6, 1997 through Saturday, March 8, 1997 hosted at the Omni Shoreham Hotel in Washington, D.C.. The conference is composed of speeches, forums and panel discussions from recognized leaders in this country and is sponsored by the American Conservative Union in conjunction with <i>Human Events</i> and over sixty other co-sponsors.<p>

Its mushrooming growth attests not that the "right" has moved "center" but that Conservatism is the true nucleus of American thought. We may attribute its "sudden popularity" to the excesses of liberalism over many a year and we wouldn't be wrong ... although it runs deeper than that. America, itself, was founded on the principle of Conservatism and has yearned to return to that basic philosophy.<p>

The spectacular growth of CPAC anbd now the celebration of it's twenty-forth anniversary isn't all that surprising. Twenty-four years ago it was warranted and timely and today it remains the same. It was anything but a temporary swing of the pendulum, rather, a steady course set -- strengthened and renewed with each year's growing power of CPAC.<p>

In 1997 -- our 24th Annual Conference opens within two months of what we expect will be a <i>new</i> amininistration. We hope for an administration that is founded on Conservative ideals not dominated by liberalism as in the past four years. However, what will really make this country prosper and stand for freedom is an enthusiastic commitment to a Conservative philosophy by the men and women who make service to the freedom of this country their life's goal. You can be a part of that commitment. Join us at CPAC '97!!<p>

<B><Font face=Times New Roman>To:  Fellow Conservatives
<P>
<B>From:  David A. Keene, Chairman
<BR>
<B>American Conservative Union</FONT></B>
<P>
<I><B>Welcome to the Twenty-fourth Annual Conservative
Political Action Conference.</B></I> CPAC,
<B>The Voice of American Conservatism</B>, will be the first major
gathering of conservative thinkers after the 1996 election.  This
conference will be of utmost importance to everyone.  The election
itself confirmed that the people want to be represented by the
conservative ideology.  The President even presented himself as
conservative to insure his reelection.  This is the first time
in sixty years that a liberal president has been given a second
term of office.  It is very important that we stand strong and
fight hard to maintain our cherished conservative values.<BR>

<P>
CPAC '97 takes place at the Omni Shoreham Hotel in
Washington, D.C. March 6-8, 1997.  (There will be a congressional
Reception on Capitol Hill Wednesday, March 5, 1997 for those purchasing
the Presidential Banquet Package.)  The Awards Banquet will be
Thursday, March 6 and the Presidential Banquet Friday, March 7.
 We will conclude the conference Saturday, March 8 with plenty
of weekend left for you, your friends and family to enjoy the
sights of this magnificent city.<BR>

<P>
The three-day conference is sponsored by the American
Conservative Union Foundation, in conjunction with the journal
<I>Human Events</I>.  In addition, the conference is co-sponsored
by more than seventy nationally recognized conservative organizations
and covered by major media outlets including C-SPAN, G. Gordon
Liddy, Oliver North, and other political talk shows.<BR>

<P>
For the past twenty-three years, CPAC has provided
conservatives worldwide with a unique opportunity to meet and
hear recognized leaders speak and participate in forums and panel
discussions on both domestic and foreign policy issues.  Past
speakers include President Ronald Reagan, President George Bush,
Senators Bob Dole,Trent Lott, Jesse Helms, Dirk Kempthorne, and
Phil Gramm.  Additionally, Bill Bennett, Newt Gingrich, Jeane
Kirkpatrick, Pat Robertson, Jack Kemp, Dick Cheney, Phyllis Schlafly,
and Dan Quayle,  have addressed these gatherings.<BR>

<P>
To insure that you are part of this exciting event,
register early for CPAC '97.  We will certainly be hosting another
sell out crowd.  If you send in the completed registration form
by <B>January 3, 1997</B>, you will save significantly over those
who register later.  The last day to register by mail or phone
is Friday, <B>February 14, 1997 </B> (There will be <U><B>no</B></U>
 refunds after February 14.)  Registration costs will be higher
and banquet package spaces cannot be guaranteed after that time.
 Early on-site registration begins Wednesday, March 5, 1997 at
5:00 p.m.<BR>

<P>
A CPAC '97 agenda and registration form are enclosed
for your planning purposes.  The Omni offers a reduced room rate
until February 14 for CPAC '97.  The rate is $129 for a single

DC  20008-9980.<BR>

In 1973, a handful of Americans met in Washington D.C. to affirm their support for Conservative ideals.  That first small gathering has blossomed into the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), the largest annual gathering of conservative activists in America.
<P>
CPAC is designed to advance important everyday issues such as taxes, crime, culture and foreign policy and to provide basic conservative viewpoints and solutions.
<P>
Past speakers include President Ronald Reagan, President George Bush, Lamar Alexander, Dick Armey, Pat Buchanan, Bill Bennett, Dick Cheney, Bob Dole, Newt  Gingrich, Phil Gramm, Jesse Helms, Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick, G. Gorden Liddy, Trent Lott, Oliver North, P.J. O'Rourke, Dan Quayle, Pat Robertson, and Phyllis Schlafly, to name a few.
<P>
CPAC, a three day event, February 22nd, 23rd and 24th, 1996, will take place at the Omni Shoreham Hotel in Washington, D.C.  The conference is composed of speeches, forums and panel discussions from recognized leaders.   It is sponsored by the American Conservative Union, in cooperation with the journals Human Events and <I> National Review </I>and co-sponsored by over 60 nationally known organizations.

<P>
From Newt Gingrich to Bob Dole to Phil Gramm to Patrick Buchanan and everyone in between, they all came to CPAC '95.
<P>
Some of the highlights included the first major speech given by former Vice President Dan Quayle following his decision not to run for President in 1996; a debate between Robert Novak and Sam Donaldson on the relevancy of the media; an analysis by House Majority Leader Newt Gingrich on the  Contract With America; a speech by Senator Phil Gramm on the balanced budget; a preview of the 2nd and 3rd 100 Days by Patrick Buchanan; as well as speeches by Jeane Kirkpatrick, Lamar Alexander, Congressman Istook, Governor John Engler, Bill Bennett, Jack Kemp and many more.
<P>
The Presidential Banquet topped off the Conference with Ashbrook Award recipient, Malcolm Wallop, special guest Dick Armey and a keynote address by Bob Dole.
<P>
The Awards Banquet hosted Dave Thomas of Wendy's, Football Hall of Fame star Frank Gifford, and a special address by G. Gordon Liddy.
<P>
The activity did not end in the conference hall, the Exhibit Hall provided CPAC registrants the opportunity to discuss the latest social and economic issues with our 60-plus Co-Sponsors; to obtain the most current conservative books, brochures and newsletters; and to purchase the latest and greatest political memorabilia.

<a href="/thcc/content/chapman/chap020697.html"><img src="/thcc/images/chapman.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="STEPHEN CHAPMAN">
<b>ALBRIGHT BRINGS A GOOD STORY, BUT NOT GOOD IDEAS</b></a><br>Madeleine Albright is an impressive woman with a fascinating story. Born in Czechoslovakia, she was a refugee
     first from Nazism and then from communism.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/feder/fede020697.html"><img src="/thcc/images/feder.gif" border="0" align="right" alt="Don Feder">
<b>PRAY FOR COLOR-BLIND JUSTICE</b></a><br>You can talk about different standards of proof in criminal and civil cases.
     You can point to evidence that was barred in the first O.J. Simpson trial but admitted in the second. But
     ultimately, the verdicts were influenced by race. 
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/fields/fiel020697.html"><img src="/thcc/images/fields.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="Suzanne Fields">
<b>DENNIS THE MENACE MEETS OEDIPUS</b></a><br>Dennis Rodman, the falling star of the Chicago Bulls, is easy to dislike
     as a man who plays to his basest nature. 
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/novak/nova020697.html"><img src="/thcc/images/novak.gif" border="0" align="right" alt="ROBERT D. NOVAK">
<b>SENATE DEMOCRATIC HARDBALL</b></a><br>The signal last week to the Capitol Hill cognoscenti that
     Democrats were playing hardball against Sen. Fred Thompson's investigation of President Clinton's campaign
     abuses came in the return of fabled Senate wizard Michael Davidson as a back-room strategist.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/snow/snow020697.html"><img src="/thcc/images/snow.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="TONY SNOW">
<b>VIRTUE IS ITS OWN REWARD</b></a><br>As a token of the New Bipartisanship, Democrats and
     Republicans have begun touting volunteerism. They both say they want to celebrate good deeds by bestowing
     grants and tax credits upon "volunteers." Evidently, salvation through compassion is out.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/thomas/thom020697.html"><img src="/thcc/images/thomas.gif" border="0" align="right" alt="Cal Thomas">
<b> WHAT DO BILL CLINTON, O.J. SIMPSON AND J.C. WATTS HAVE IN COMMON?</b></a><br>On Tuesday, we learned that Bill Clinton is a liberal, O.J. Simpson is a criminal and Rep. J.C. Watts, a
     black Republican from Oklahoma, is the ideological heir to Ronald Reagan. What a night! 
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/toledano/tole020697.html"><img src="/thcc/images/toledano.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="RALPH de TOLEDANO">
<b>R.I.P.  --  THE FBI AS THE WORLD'S GREATEST INVESTIGATIVE AGENCY</b></a><br>Time was when even liberals credited the Federal Bureau of Investigation with being the world's greatest
     investigative agency -- but how many remember? 
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/williams/will020697.html"><img src="/thcc/images/williams.gif" border="0" align="right" alt="Armstrong Williams">
<b>WHY BLACK HISTORY MONTH DIVIDES US</b></a><br>Many people assume by looking at me that I am a black American. However, I view myself not as black,
     or any color at all, but as a human being. As such I am subject to all the feelings, wants, needs and emotions that
     we all feel irrespective of our skin color.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/feder/fede020597.html"><img src="/thcc/images/feder.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="DON FEDER">
<b>IS BALANCING THE BUDGET IRRESPONSIBLE?</b></a><br>Memo to the president: C'mon Bill, say it. You've said every other dumb thing imaginable to defeat the
     balanced-budget amendment. So, go ahead, tell us how donning this fiscal life vest before the deck of the Titanic
     hits the water line would be ... irresponsible.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/greenberg/gree020597.html"><img src="/thcc/images/greenberg.gif" border="0" align="right" alt="Paul Greenberg">
<b>A BUDGET BALANCER THAT DOESN'T BALANCE</b></a><br>How does the song go? Call me irresponsible, call me unreliable ... .
     Call me ideologically unreliable, but the constitutional amendment to balance
     the federal budget, a proposal that grows more and more popular every year in Congress, leaves me cold.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/saunders/saun020597.html"><img src="/thcc/images/saunders.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="DEBRA J. SAUNDERS">
<b>NASTY, NASTY PARTY POOPERS</b></a><br>Apparently, Democratic and Republican party leaders do not believe there is
     enough public outrage at judges who gut voter-approved initiatives that have no constitutional problems
     discernible to the naked eye. 
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/bowles/bowl020497.html"><img src="/thcc/images/bowles.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="LINDA BOWLES">
<b>CIGARS</b></a><br>The subject of this week's column boiled down to a choice between two hot issues: the president's State of the
     Union address and cigars. I chose cigars. 
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/fields/fiel020497.html"><img src="/thcc/images/fields.gif" border="0" align="right" alt="Suzanne Fields">
<b>THE CREATOR IS NOT A POLITICIAN. (THANK GOD)</b></a><br>Is God a Republican or a Democrat, or what? He's hardly given us His Word on that. 

         But no matter how high the secularists built the wall between church and state, God influences public and
     private policy and behavior.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/huffington/huff020497.html"><img src="/thcc/images/huffington.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="ARIANNA HUFFINGTON">
<b>DRIVING MR. GINGRICH</b></a><br>It was a tragic day in Newt Gingrich's life when in 1993 Jim Tilton, his best friend for 30 years, died of
     pancreatic cancer.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/murchison/murc020497.html"><img src="/thcc/images/murchison.gif" border="0" align="right" alt="WILLIAM MURCHISON">
<b>WEST IS BEST</b></a><br>China proceeds with its crackdown on the liberties of Hong Kong, and I hate saying this because it's so
     politically incorrect ... Aw, I don't really, because it's true: Democracy -- the rule of the people -- does best in
     the West.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/thomas/thom020497.html"><img src="/thcc/images/thomas.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="Cal Thomas">
<b> COMPASSIONATE CAPITALISM: ONE MORE REASON TO LOVE NEW YORK </b></a><br>A group of successful, wealthy New York City businessmen and women are in a van driving to
     Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn, an area often used as a backdrop for politicians who make empty promises to
     redeem the poor. 
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/feder/fede020397.html"><img src="/thcc/images/feder.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="DON FEDER">
<b>THE RIPPLE EFFECTS OF GAY MARRIAGE</b></a><br>A letter to Ann Landers defending sexual relations among blood relatives is yet more evidence of liberalism's
     unintended -- and most unfortunate -- consequences. Signed "A Friend of Humanity," it rips Landers for
     disapproving of a 60-year-old man and his widowed sister who get together twice weekly for activities decidedly
     contrary to Leviticus.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/novak/nova020397.html"><img src="/thcc/images/novak.gif" border="0" align="right" alt="ROBERT D. NOVAK">
<b>DEMOCRATIC FALL GUY?</b></a><br>A letter to Ann Landers defending sexual relations among blood relatives is yet more evidence of liberalism's
     unintended -- and most unfortunate -- consequences. Signed "A Friend of Humanity," it rips Landers for
     disapproving of a 60-year-old man and his widowed sister who get together twice weekly for activities decidedly
     contrary to Leviticus.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/quayle/quay020397.html"><img src="/thcc/images/quayle.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="DAN QUAYLE">
<b>THE STATE OF THE UNION</b></a><br>As the time approaches for another State of the Union message by President Bill Clinton, a debate is surely
     raging in the White House over whether the speech will be broadly thematic or program-specific. In the end, like
     most State of the Union speeches, it will probably be both.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/saunders/saun020397.html"><img src="/thcc/images/saunders.gif" border="0" align="right" alt="DEBRA J. SAUNDERS">
<b>REAL WELFARE REFORM</b></a><br>"As I've been saying for months, we've reformed welfare for those who don't have money or powerful
     Washington lobbyists," Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio) said Tuesday. "Now it is time we did the same for those
     corporate welfare programs that aid the rich and powerful at the expense of tax paying families."
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/snow/snow020397.html"><img src="/thcc/images/snow.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="TONY SNOW">
<b>CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM</b></a><br>Here's all you need to know about campaign-finance reform: Last Tuesday evening, several
     hours after he urged both parties to "accept responsibility for (election-spending scandals) and take responsibility
     to repair it," President Clinton did neither.
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/bozell/boze013197.html"><img src="/thcc/images/bozell.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="L. Brent Bozell">
<b>MUCKRAKING OR MUCKFAKING?</b></a><br>What do you call it when an undercover reporter working for a national television network, investigating the
     sanitation of a grocery store with a hidden camera, films a dirty meat slicer and then mutters obscenities when an
     employee ruins the fun and cleans it up? 
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/greenberg/gree013197.html"><img src="/thcc/images/greenberg.gif" border="0" align="right" alt="Paul Greenberg">
<b>FULBRIGHT FANS: THE LATEST LIST </b></a><br>The impressive $750,000 memorial, a tower of brass arising out of pool of water, will honor the former
     chairman of the once powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/huffington/huff013197.html"><img src="/thcc/images/huffington.gif" border="0" align="left" alt="ARIANNA HUFFINGTON">
<b>THE LATEST HIT ON CORPORATE WELFARE</b></a><br>What could possibly bring together the ultra-liberal Ralph Nader and the ultra-conservative Grover Norquist,
     Friends of the Earth, and Citizens for a Sound Economy? A Redskins game? A "Politically Incorrect" panel?
<p><br>

<a href="/thcc/content/williams/will013197.html"><img src="/thcc/images/williams.gif" border="0" align="right" alt="Armstrong Williams">
<b>PROMOTE THE GOOD WORK ON EBONICS, NEPHEW</b></a><br>Dear Dukelux, 

         In your last letter you informed me of a very interesting development: that the blacks are encouraging
     ignorance among their children.

<title>CLINTON'S LAND OF NEW PROMISE' MUST INCLUDE THE
UNBORN</title>
</head>

<body>

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
JANUARY 21, 1997<br>
Contact: Jeff Hollingsworth<br>
(703) 836-8602<p>

<h2>CLINTON'S LAND OF NEW PROMISE' MUST INCLUDE THE
UNBORN;<br> MAKE ABORTION ON DEMAND A THING OF THE PAST,
ACU SAYS</h2>
</center>

<p>
ALEXANDRIA, VA.--- "In his Inaugural address, President Clinton spoke optimistically of
America as a  land of new promise' as we approach the 21st Century. But if America is to
remain true to its heritage as the land where life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness
are among the blessings of citizenship, it cannot remain the land of broken promises when it
comes to the right to life," said American Conservative Union (ACU) Chairman David A. Keene.
<P>
     "The President claimed during his campaign that he is committed to making abortions
more rare in this country. He went so far as to buy political ad time on Christian radio
stations trying to make his case," Keene said. 
<P>
     "If the President would have us take him at face value, he must start translating words
into deeds, " Keene continued. "That means he should support rather than veto legislation
banning partial-birth abortions - - a practice so macabre that even many pro-abortion
supporters don't endorse it. If his Administration won't propose them, he should at least
support initiatives from Congress providing encouragement and additional incentives for
adoption. He should support private-sector projects and programs providing education and
counseling in support of the right to life and move away from those which push abortion as
the option of first resort.
<P>
<center>MORE. . .</center>
<P>
ACU, Page 2
<P>
     "In his Inaugural address on Monday, the President made unusually frequent references to
children and to future generations who will benefit from this  land of new promise,'" Keene
continued. "The striking irony is that his campaigns enjoyed the active support of the
abortion industry and its allies, and his Administration is the most avowedly pro-abortion
in history. He can't have it both ways. As long as abortion on demand is sanctioned by his
Administration, his lofty rhetoric about brighter days ahead for children and future
generations will ring hollow."
<P>
     On the eve of the twenty-fourth anniversary of the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade
decision legalizing abortion, Keene called on Congress and the President to relegate
unrestricted abortion to the history books. 
<P>
     "If the President really wants us to believe he is pro-life, he could publicly reject the
flawed reasoning and faulty science upon which Roe vs. Wade rests and work with the Congress
to craft a human life amendment to the Constitution, " Keene concluded.         
<P>
     ACU, founded in 1964, is the country's oldest grassroots-oriented conservative lobbying
organization. On behalf of its nearly one million members and supporters, it lobbies on a
wide range of issues before the Congress.

A Letter from Congressman Christopher Cox
 -- ACU</title>
</head>
<body>
From: Congressman Christopher Cox<p>


<p>
Dear Taxpayer:
<P>
Think back to last April 15, when you finally finished with another year's labor at the command of the IRS. Think about the scores of receipts, the paperwork nightmare, the headaches.
<P>
If you're like most Americans, you've probably fantasized more than once about life without the IRS.
<P>
But did the thought ever occur to you that you might live to see the end of the IRS? Could this actually happen?
<P>
Since last year, things have changed drastically in Washington. Ideas that weren't even on the table for the 40 years of Democrat control of Congress are suddenly achievable goals in our bold new agenda.
<P>
The most dramatic proposal of all is to abolish the IRS.
<P>
This is not an idle dream. It is a serious and sound reform, and I'm inviting you to join me in making it happen.
<P>
The liberal media are not reporting it, but already most of the Republican Congressional leadership favors either abolishing the IRS entirely or radically reforming it and reducing its power, its reach, its control over individual Americans.
<P>
These Republican leaders include Speaker Newt Gingrich, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, Senate Majority Whip Trent Lott, Senator Dick Lugar, Senator Phil Gramm, and many others.
<P>
We have to be realistic about such a bold vision. It will be extremely difficult for Congress to muster the courage to actually vote to abolish the IRS until the members receive a clear signal from the American people.
<P>
That is why I need you to take a few minutes and do two things to help change our tax laws and reduce the size and intrusiveness of government:
<P><UL>
<LI>First, sign the enclosed petition to Congress.
<P>
<LI>Second, send a contribution of at least $10 or $15 to us immediately, and consider sending $25, $50 or $100 to help the American Conservative Union (ACU) fund this campaign to abolish the IRS.
</ul><P>
<p>
Our campaign cannot get off the ground without your support.
<P>
The House Ways and Means Committee recently held hearings that revealed some astonishing facts. We learned that the costs of complying with current income tax laws has ballooned to over $200 billion each and every year. We also learned that it takes over 14,700 pages of regulations and another 200,000 pages of interpretations of these regulatlons to explain our tax code.
<P>
It's no wonder that over half of America's taxpayers are now forced to hire accountants and lawyers to prepare their tax returns!
<P>
Think how much time, income and worry you would personally save if you didn't have to spend hundreds of hours or more during the coming year to be a bookkeeper for the government. Think of how much personal freedom and independence you would gain if the govermnent no longer forced you to record every detail of your flnancial life. Think of all the late evenings and weekends you could spend with your family, your friends, your work, and your community if they were no longer devoted to figuring out how much of your hard-earned money you have to send to the IRS!
<P>
Have you ever wondered how freedom-loving Americans surrendered so much liberty to the bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.? In fact, it happened so gradually; we didn't object loudly enough, or in time. But the truth is, American life has changed dramatically--and for the worse--since the income tax started to take control of personal budgets and fueled the growth of the welfare state.
<P>
When I was growing up, in the 1950s, government did not consume the 40% of our gross domestic product (GDP) that it does today. In 1954, government consumed 20% of GDP. As a result, the average fanlily, making the average national income, paid income tax at the rate of two percent. Social Security taxes were juct one and one-half percent of wages.
<P>
I know, because my father earned just about the national "average" back then. Our family, like most others, could afford a 3 bedroom house, even though only one spouse worked. Mortgage rates averaged just 4 percent. Despite spending much more on national defense in the 1950s to defend against communism, the federal budget was balanced. In this low tax environment, people enjoyed steady gains in their standard of living.
<P>
That kind of freedom and opportunity can once again become a part of American life. But it will happen only if we are willing to reduce the size of government--and only if we recognize that the income tax in America has proven to be a miserable failure.
<P>
Do we have the vision to seize this opportunity?
<P>
As I said earlier, there is strong aupport in the new Congress to abolish the IRS. But Congress rarely acts before voters push them. Pollticians need to hear the persistent and insistent voice of the American people.
<P>
The American people, in turn, want a clear vision of a better life, in which individual opportunity and responsibility replace the failed welfare state. They want a government responsive to their concerns instead of those of bureaucrats. Abolishing the IRS is the central act that embodies that vision.
<P>
I can assure you personally that, for the first time in many years, Congress is really listening to the American people. I wouldn't have been able to write this letter a year ago, because I knew then that Congress wouldn't even think about abolishing the IRS and simplifying our tax system. For forty years, Congress had a vested interest in getting more of your money to fund pet projects of questionable value. But the world has changed.
<P>
The 1994 elections came as a wake up call even to my Democratic colleagues. As a result, congress is listening as never before, because people have joined together and are speaking out in a strong, united voice for many issues: reduced government regulation of individuals and businesses, 
 protection of private property, lower taxes and smaller government.
<P>
There are many groups organized at the local, state and national levels to fight for these issues. But there isn't the necessary organization to lead millions of taxpayers at both the local and national levels in the massive campaign needed to abolish the IRS and end the most noxious and offensive government excess of all.
<P>
That is why I've agreed to help the American Conservative Union give voice to the growing public demand for a simple, fairer tax system without the IRS.
<P>
There are already several proposals before the Congress that will move us toward our goal, including Majority Leader Dick Armey's proposal to replace the current income tax with a flat tax. With your help one of these significant income tax reform plans will pass. And every one of these reforms will help reduce the intrusion of the IRS into our daily lives.
<P>
Whatever path we choose, the ultimate objective must be to accomplish our vision of abolishing the IRS. For that to become a reality, we must begin working immediately. The day after last November's election, my good friend Bill Archer, the new Chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, shocked the Washington establishment by declaring that his number one goal is the total abolition of the income tax.
<P>
Chairman Archer is convinced that, to make this possible, we must get two-thirds of the congress to vote for a Constitutional Amendment to repeal the 16th Amendment, which established our current system of
income taxes. And then we must work to get three-fourths of the state legislatures to agree.
<P>
Once that happens, the income tax will no longer be a part of the U. S. Constitutlon, and the IRS wlll lose its reason for existence.
<P>
When we accomplish our goal of eliminating the IRS, we will have done more to accomplish the objectives of limited government than we ever imagined was possible.
<P>
I believe this historic effort cannot succeed without the leadership of the ACU.
<P>
For over 30 years the ACU has been America's largest and most effective grass roots organization working to lower taxes and greatly reduce the scope of government.
<P>
ACU was in the front ranks in l993 and 1994 with TV advertisements, direct mail, town hall meetings, press conferences, and other methods to organize and lead coalitions to stop the Clintons' socialized health plan.
<P>
But, I can assure you, that battle was nothing like the war it will take to abolish the IRS.
<P>
ACU Chairman David Keene tells me that a successful campaign will take about two years and a budget of at least $25,000,000 to repeal the 16th Amendment, abolish the IRS, and replace today's income tax with a tax that is smaller, simpler, and fairer.
<P>
Those of us in the Congressional leadership are working to build support for income tax repeal right now, but I have to tell you that our best chance will probably come after the next presidential and Congressional elections... If ACU starts our national crusade immediately!
<P>
Speaker Newt Gingrich is fond of saying that organizing a large number of people to solve a problem is a four-step process:
<P>
First, Establish the Vision. Our vision is an America of opportunity, liberty and personal responsibility, without the 
IRS and without the counterproductive income tax.
<p>
Second, Identify Your Goal. Our goal is the repeal of the 16th Amendment by 1997, and the ratification of repeal by the states by the end of l999.
<p>
Third, Define Your Strategy. our strategy is to raise $25,000,000 and use it to reach 100,000,000 taxpayers with our message. That message will encourage them, in turn, to urge their Congress and state legislators to support repeal of the 16th Amendment.
<P>
Fourth, Develop Appropriate Tactics. Our tactics are as follows:
<P>
<ul>
<LI> Establish ABOLISH THE IRS COMMITTEES around the country to coordinate grass roots activity.
<P>
<LI> Circulate petitions and obtain 20,000,000 signatures to abolish the IRS. 
<P>
<LI> Generate 45,000,000 letters and phone calls to members of Congress with our message.
<P>
<LI> Supply talk show hosts and other media outlets with information about the abuses regularly committed by the IRS.
<P>
<LI> Publish a special monthly newsletter for our activists and supporters.
<P>
<LI> Work toward getting both the Republican and Democratic parties to adopt a plank calling for repeal of the 16th Amendment as part of their 1996 electoral platforms.
<P>
<LI> Give every candidate running for President, Congress and state office in 1996 information on the need to abolish the IRS and repeal the 16th amendment.
<P>
</ul>
But ACU can't move forward with this program until you assure me of your support.
<P>
If you and others I am writing today do their part and send what they can afford, whether $15, $25, $50, $100 or more, ACU will be able to start this massive grass roots effort immediately.
<P>
It is also vital that YOU sign the enclosed petition.
<P>
After receiving your signed petition, ACU will advise your elected representatives in the U. S. Congress of your support for our mission.
<P>
We all understand how expensive this type of campaign is in today 's world. ACU will simply not be able to start this campaign and distribute our petitions unless we receive your financial support.
<P>
Our income tax system wastes hundreds of billions of your dollars each year that the government doesn't even receive in taxes. Government agents force us to work hundreds of hours a year keeping records, filling out complicated and unreadable forms, and answering harassing questions. We spend too much time and too such money in learning how to prevent the lRS from claiming money we've earned that isn't legally theirs.
<P>
Then, even after we have done all of this, we are forced to live in fear that the IRS will penalize us, or demand that we gather up years of our financial records for their inspection. If the IRS can find some mlnor error, they penalize us even further.
<P>
Is this any way for America to treat its citizens?
<P>
There is a better way for people to llve together in a free society. We have the vislon to take us toward this better path. He can live without the IRS and without the 16th Amendment.
<P>
So, please take a few minutes right now and return your signed petition and a generous contribution to help launch a massive, grass-roots lobbying campaign to abolish the IRS and replace it with a smaller, simpler, and fairer tax system.
<P>
Sincerely,
<P>

Christopher Cox
<P>
Chairman<br>
House Republican Policy Committee<br>
<P>

P. S. Your signed petition will help 
convince Members of Congress to repeal the 16th Amendment, to abolish the IRS and its more than 14,000 pages of complicated and outrageous rules and regulations, and to dismiss the 115,000 IRS employees that cause Americans to live in fear of their own government.
<P>
In order for this to happen, ACU needs you to send a contribution today of at least $15. If at all possible, please send as much as you feel it would be <u>worth to you</u> to abolish the IRS. Send $25, $50, or $100 If you can only afford $10 or $15, that will be extremely helpful and allow ACU to spring into action with their battle plan to repeal the 16th Amendment by 1997.

Last week, ABIC pointed the finger at the 67 House members who voted against the Metcalf Amendment -- an amendment offered by Rep. Jack Metcalf (R - WA) to stop the automatic pay increase scheduled for members of Congress.  The House adopted the amendment and under its provisions, Congress would receive no payraise this year.  (Note:  Congressional salaries in 1996 are $133,644 per year.)
<P>
<STRONG>Mysteriously,</STRONG> when the bill came up a few days later for consideration by the Senate Subcommittee on July 19th, the Metcalf Amendment was <STRONG>gone!!!!</STRONG>  <BR><STRONG><EM>Section 637 was <STRONG>missing</STRONG> from the bill!!!!!!!!</EM></STRONG>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>M</FONT>ore than 10 years after the United States government illegally grabbed the property of an elderly Maine couple in the name of "wetlands," it has finally apologized. In a July letter, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers acknowledged that agency officials "were clearly guilty of inappropriate behavior in your case" and said the agency had taken steps to prevent it from happening again.
<P>
Given what Gaston and Monique Roberge went through, they would have to be pretty big steps. As noted in this space earlier, the couple had bought a small piece of property on the coastline back in the 1960s, an investment they hoped would one day serve as a nest egg for their retirement. In the mid-'70s, a contractor putting in a town sewer line asked to put some of the excavated dirt on their property. Armed with a town permit for the dirt, the Roberges agreed.
<P>
Suffering from a variety of health problems over the next decade, the ailing couple decided to cash in their nest egg and retire. They struck a deal with a developer in 1986, but the Corps effectively killed the deal by declaring the property a wetland. Never mind that there were houses on both sides of the property, a road in front and railroad tracks in back. Never mind that the Corps itself had previously determined that the property was not a wetland. The Corps insisted that the dirt be removed at costs of tens of thousands of dollars.
<P>
For approximately the next six years, the ailing and bewildered couple struggled futilely with what one federal judge the "regulatory hydra" embodied by the Corps. But it was only with expert assistance from the Cambridge, Md.-based Fairness to Landowners Committee, Washington attorney and former Environmental Protection Agency official Stanley Legro and former Corps regulator Bernie Goode that the couple were able to get their land back. Among other things, the experts quickly discovered that the Corps had misapplied its own rules and regulations; there was no reason to remove the dirt from the Roberges' property. The deal should have gone through.
<P>
Worse was to come. When the Roberges filed suit against the Corps to compensate them for the loss of their land, Mr. Legro discovered chilling memos in Corps files on the Roberge case. Read one: "Roberge would be a good one to squash and set an example." It was signed "Jay Clement, formerly the Maytag repairman." Mr. Clement, the regulator who oversaw the Roberge case, said later he couldn't remember what he had meant when he wrote that. But the obvious implication is that he was no longer bored, since he was squashing old folks. No doubt the discovery of those memos encouraged the Corps to settle the case for $338,000, roughly a third of which went to cover the Roberges' attorney fees and taxes.
<P>
So what steps is the Corps taking to prevent similar squashings in the future? According to the letter from Maj. Gen. Stanley Genega, the Corps' director of civil works, the agency has adopted a "Commitment to Public Service," which promises that its officials will be fair, honest, timely, knowledgeable about the rules they enforce and everything else they were not in dealing with the Roberges. They are going to offer customer surveys. And they are giving agency regulators "training in sensitivity and customer relations." There is no suggestion in the letter that anyone has been fired or otherwise disciplined in connection with the Roberge case.
<P>
Now when ordinary citizens violate wetlands rules they can face jail time and, as in the case of the Roberges, fines. They can also lose the deals on which their retirement nest egg is based. (No subsequent offer for the Roberge property approaches what they were originally offered.) Meanwhile, when Corps officials violate the rules, they get sensitivity training. Lawmakers ought to consider the obvious disproportionality here.
<P>
One apology is still missing -- from former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, whose smarmy tactics only made the couple's problems worse. In private he told them he would look into their case. Publicly he downplayed such cases as "either wildly exaggerated, partially or wholly untrue." For the sake of those involved in Irish peace talks, which Mr. Mitchell is helping to negotiate, one can only hope they don't get the Roberge treatment.<P>

<b>Chapter 3</b>
<P>
The Metcalf Amendment Reappears...<br>
....as the Thompson Amendment!!
</center><p>
In Chapters 1 and 2, we learned that ABIC has been following the disappearance of the so-called Metcalf Amendment. In July, we pointed the finger at the 67 House members who voted against the Amendment offered by Rep. Jack Metcalf (R - WA) to stop the automatic pay increase scheduled for members of Congress.  The House adopted the amendment and under its provisions, Congress would receive no payraise this year.  (Note:  Congressional salaries in 1996 are $133,644 per year.)
<P>
We also learned that when the bill came out of the Senate committee, the Metcalf amendment had <b><i>vanished without a trace</i></b>.  No one knew how it disappeared or whodunnit! In <a href="/abic/ptf/7-29-96.html.cgi">Chapter 1</a>, ABIC pointed the finger at the prime suspects.
<P>
While no amount of detective work will reveal how the Metcalf Amendment disappeared in the Committee, <b>the day was ultimately saved by none other than...<P>

<P>
So, this week ABIC points the finger at a group of <i><b>good</i></b> guys: the six co-sponsors of the Thompson Amendment.

<h3>Testimony of Cleta Deatherage Mitchell</h3>
<h4>Director and General Counsel<br> 
Term Limits Legal Institute, a project of Americans Back In Charge Foundation
<p>
Subcommittee on the Constitution, Federalism and Property Rights<br>
U.S. Senate
<p>
January 25, 1995</h4>
</center>
<p>
 	My name is Cleta Mitchell.  I am the Director and General Counsel of the Term Limits Legal Institute in Washington, D.C.  The Term Limits Legal Institute was established in 1991 as a project of Americans Back in Charge, the first national term limits organization devoted to helping grassroots citizens committees in the various states follow the example of Colorado in 1990, limiting the terms of members of Congress by state action.  The Term Limits Legal Institute was created to defend the right of citizens to vote on term limits proposals and then to defend those enactments in the courts once passed by the voters.  We all are aware of the litigious nature of our society.  This is true as well in the political arena.  Since 1990, the term limits movement has been confronted with over 30 different lawsuits challenging the right of voters even to have the opportunity to consider the issue of term limits and then seeking a "second opinion" from the courts after the voters' verdict in favor of term limits was delivered in state after state or city after city.
<p>
	I am pleased to be in this forum today, because I believe that it is in the political arena--not in the courts--where the decision about term limits for members of Congress should be decided.
<p>
	There has been much discussion today about the public policy reasons for limiting congressional terms, and I won't reiterate those here.
<p>
	I want to focus briefly, however, on three primary points.
<p>
	First, I believe that when we begin amending the Constitution it is necessary to be thoughtful, careful and deeply respectful of the principles on which the entire framework of our government was founded.  I do not take lightly the notion of amending the Constitution, and I would not be here advocating amending it if I didn't believe that the principle at stake here was one that the Founding Fathers believed in but didn't bother to write down.  There has been ample testimony today about the history of the principle of rotation and the way in which term limits fit into the Constitutional framework.  It is my opinion that had Thomas Jefferson not been in France during the Constitutional Convention, we would not be here arguing this point today because he would have insisted on a mandatory rotation being written into the Constitution.  His concerns about the abandonment of the mandatory rotation were met with the response that the principle of rotation was imbedded in the national psyche and would be carried out "voluntarily".  Jefferson believed that voluntary rotation would, over time, erode and that is exactly what happened.
<p>
	But Jefferson <i>was</i> in France and it now settles upon our shoulders to complete a task that wasn't concluded in Philadelphia in 1787.  It is our role to write into the Constitution a principle that was inherent in the design of the institution of Congress--but which has eroded to the point of nonexistence: the principle of rotation and citizen responsibility for self-government.   
<p>
	In other words, the principle of term limits is a principle on which the national government was founded and one on which our notions of self-government are grounded.  The health of our democracy is at stake unless we restore this principle to our Constitution.   
<p>
	Second, any term limitation should treat the House and the Senate equally.  As we all recall from our history and civics classes, the first great hurdle at the Constitutional Convention was the tension between the small and the large states.  "The Great Compromise" that created the bi-cameral Congress with both a House and a Senate, based on separate forms of representation to accommodate the concerns and anxieties of BOTH small and large states, was the central underpinning of the constitutional convention.  Absent that compromise and the agreement to establish a Congress with 2 houses--equal in stature and authority, but differently designed--there would have been no constitution.   
<p>
	I do not believe that it is our task here to tamper with that design.  We are not here today and we should not be in the business of tinkering with the relative strength of the House vs. the Senate.  That is why I am here today urging you to adopt a term limits bill that treats the House and Senate equally under term limits: with 12 year limits on service in either House of Congress.  I believe that such an approach allows us to address the problems and the issues related to term limits without doing damage to the relative balance of power between the House and the Senate or the Great Compromise of the Philadelphia convention.   
<p>
	Further, it is the principle of term limits for members of Congress that is important.  There is a very real political consideration insofar as promoting a term limits measure that has some hope of success.  What that means, in my opinion, is that the Senate should not be promoting a bill that is dead on arrival in the House.  I served 8 years in the Oklahoma legislature as a member of the House of Representatives.  It is my considered opinion that there is not a House of Representatives anywhere on the planet that will pass a measure that allows Senators to serve in office twice as long as they can.  I believe that we should be focusing our energy on the principle of term limits and garnering support for a measure that can be successfully achieved--rather than wasting time fighting over something that is neither desirable nor attainable, namely, the 6 year term limit for House members.   
<p>
	Third, those who argue that the "people" are demanding a six year term limit for House members are, in my opinion, incorrect.  I know of no opinion poll that has asked the American people to state whether they would be supportive of a 12 year term limit if that's all the Congress was willing to pass.  If the choice is between a 12 year limit for House members and NO limit for either the House or Senate, I daresay that the people would choose 12 year term limits for all members of Congress.  That is a perfectly reasonable approach and it is one that, I believe, is achievable, which, again is part of the task before you.   
<p>
	The experience in the states is not as one-sided in favor of 6 year limits for House members as some might have you believe.   
<p>
	In the only state that has voted on both 6 year and 12 year limits on the members of the House of Representatives, Colorado, the 12 year limit received 153,000 more votes than did the 6 year limit.  While I realize that in the past few years there have been polls indicating that people were so angry at Congress that they would probably have supported a term limit of 6 months, I also believe that when the American voter steps into the polling booth, a sense of great responsibility sets in--and the evidence from Colorado is, I think, compelling.   
<p>
	Further, the reason that 6 year term limits for House members have been enacted in most states has not been a grassroots decision, but a requirement for receiving funds from the national term limits group that is dedicated to 6 year term limits.  It was important in the early days of this movement to bring the debate on term limits from the notion of 18 or 24 year term limits, which certain national figures who professed a commitment to term limits were actually promoting.  I believed in those days that it would be useful to promote the 6 year term limit for the purpose of insuring that the outer limits of discussion would ultimately be set at 12 year limits.  That goal has been achieved because no one is discussing anything today beyond a twelve year limit.  Today, however, we must move beyond  political rhetoric and name-calling and get about the business of seriously considering the public policy issues related to term limits and how the goals we espouse can best be achieved.
<p>
  	We must do everything in our power to see that the 104th Congress sends to the States a constitutional amendment to limit congressional terms.  That is what we are here today to discuss and I hope it is what this Congress is serious about doing.   
<p>
	President Clinton spoke over the weekend about the problems of the American people having become political "couch potatoes".  I find that objectionable for two reasons.  First, the American people have gotten up from their couches and spoken very loudly and firmly about their desire for term limits for members of  Congress.  To ignore our voices is to say "Go back to your couch.  We want you to become involved, but only if you agree with those of us who do this political stuff full time."  The second problem I have with the "political couch potato theory" is that those of you who lead our government can't have it both ways:  you can't tell us, the people, that we don't know enough to govern ourselves, that you have to be an "expert" to be involved in politics and government, and then wonder why normal everyday people throw up their hands and drop out of the process.  I believe that supporting term limits is essential to a revitalizing of our national democratic health and affirming our commitment to self-government.
<p>
	In  closing, I believe that we must approach this task with a love of the Congress and a careful concern for its design that was understood by our Founding Fathers.  That is why George Will entitled his book supporting term limits Restoration.   I join Mr. Will in his belief that by limiting the terms of members of Congress, we will be able to restore to Congress its rightful place of honor in our national life and in the hearts and minds of the American people.   	
<p>
	I urge your swift consideration and passage of the amendment to the Constitution to establish 12 year term limits for members of the United States House and Senate.   
<p>
	Thank you.

<b>Chapter 2</b>
<P>
In the last chapter, we learned that ABIC had pointed the finger at the 67 House members who voted against the Metcalf Amendment -- an amendment offered by Rep. Jack Metcalf (R - WA) to stop the automatic pay increase scheduled for members of Congress.  The House adopted the amendment and under its provisions, Congress would receive no payraise this year.  (Note:  Congressional salaries in 1996 are $133,644 per year.)
<P>
We also learned that when the bill came out of the Senate committee, that the Metcalf amendment had <b><i>vanished without a trace</i></b>.  No one knew how it disappeared or whodunnit! ABIC pointed the finger at the prime suspects:

<p>
<i>Excerpts from the Washington Times piece:</i>
<p>
The Federal Government's Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) "doles out corporate welfare through direct loans, loan guarantees and political risk insurance...
<p>
OPIC's welfare for multinational corporations can be very costly.  As of Sept. 30, 1995, the agency reported more than $4 billion in outstanding loan guarantees and $10 billion in outstanding insurance.  OPIC estimates that $14.6 million of its outstanding direct loans won't be repaid.  In the event that borrowers default on the direct or guaranteed loans, the ultimate risk is borne by the U.S. government (read: "taxpayers").
<p>
To balance the federal budget and downsize government, Congress claims to be scaling back wasteful spending programs and eliminating others.  No so for corporate pork, which has somehow survived the cuts and will even grow faster.  The bill to reauthorize OPIC through the year 2001 nearly doubles the ceiling on OPIC's investment insurance to $25 billion, and more than doubles OPIC's financing authority to $20 billion."

<h2>The Democratic Case for Term Limits</h2>
<p>
by <a href="/abic/cdmbio.html.cgi">Cleta Deatherage Mitchell</a>
<p>
<h5>(originally published in "The Mainstream Democrat", December 1990)</h5>
</center>
<p>
There are many good reasons for Democrats to embrace the issue of term limits, and not just because 70% of the American electorate support it.
<p>
For Democrats to step forward and claim limitations proposals as our own would abolish forever the perception of our party as the one which clings to congressional incumbency as a substitute for competitive elections, presumably out of fear that if we really had to compete, we couldn't win.
<p>
As a lifelong Democrat, I find that suggestion insulting.  I fully believe that Democrats can produce candidates for Congress whose ideas are more nearly those of the voting public than are the Republicans.  There is no doubt in my mind that Democratic candidates have the strength and vitality to defeat Republicans in truly competitive congressional elections.
<p>
But, if I am wrong, and we as Democrats cannot field candidates or platforms which enable us to maintain control of Congress without the ironclad advantage of incumbency, then incumbency is nothing more than an artificial life-support system which is keeping an otherwise brain-dead party alive.  If that is true, then term limitations should be enacted if for no other reason than to pull the plug and force our party to start breathing on its own again.
<p>
Limiting the number of years that members of Congress can serve used to be a Democratic idea.  Harry Truman recommended that the 22nd Amendment be applied to all federal officials, not just the President, to prevent, in his words, the "fossilization of the key committees."  Truman said a limit on congressional service would "help cure senility and seniority--both terrible legislative diseases."
<p>
While congressional senility seems to have faded as a public concern, another equally disturbing congressional trait has taken its place: the seeming loss of all common sense from the nation's capital.
<p>
The public perception is that people get elected to Congress and move away, and that the more time they stay in and around Washington, the less in touch with reality they become.
<p>
There is, unfortunately, an institutional force at work which is not the fault of any individual member of Congress, but is rather a reflection of the distance between Washington and most of the American electorate.  Most members of Congress can't commute daily and many can't commute weekly.  The more time one spends in and around the company town of Washington, the harder it is to identify with the people who live and work and try to survive in the rest of the country.  That is not an indictment of anyone--it is a fact of the system.
<p>
Members of Congress become like the non-custodial parent in a divorced family: they have visitations, they come on holidays and weekends, they send money... but they don't live with us.  And over time, it becomes harder and harder to really know one another very well.
<p>
To infuse Congress with a steady stream of new members and guaranteed turnover would provide not only the government, but also the Democratic party, with new blood, new ideas and a freshness that doesn't currently exist.
<p>
The unknown and unfamiliar are anathema to Washington, where the insider is revered.  Unfortunately, to most Americans, all those mutually beneficial relationships forged over years of service are exactly what's wrong with the country.
<p>
The millions of tax dollars spent by Congress on the franking privilege, congressional newsletters, perks, staff, salaries and retirement are issues which arise every time I have appeared to discuss limiting congressional terms.  The public is well aware of and furious that Congress continues to defend these expenditures while refusing to provide tax relief to working Americans.  Unless congressional Democrats start taking seriously the anger felt by millions of Americans, we will never earn their trust sufficiently to recapture the White House--and our long-term claims to congressional control may well be in jeopardy.
<p>
Imagine the reaction if Democrats were to step forward and say to the American people that we <i>do</i> recognize that Congress has become mired in the perks and PACs which surround the institution--and that to combat this anti-democratic situation of a 97% reelection rate for members of Congress, we are endorsing congressional term limitations.  If that happened, the popular support which would be generated for the Democratic party is inestimable.
<p>
Contrast that with the self-serving multi-million dollar losing campaign engineered by California's Democratic leaders against that state's legislative term limitation initiatives.  Isn't it time Democrats started caring more about the public and our democratic institutions than protecting our turf as the congressional majority?
<p>
We Democrats are always at our best when we take on the fight for fairness and belief in the people.  What could be more fair than the concept of taking turns in these offices of public trust?
<p>
My five-year-old daughter has to be constantly reminded to take turns and to share--basic and fundamental concepts of fairness, which we as Democrats hold dear.  We say we are not the elitist, upper-class snobs that Republicans are--yet we cling to this idea of a ruling congressional class as though it were our birthright.
<p>
Fairness.  Sharing.  Democratic with a small "d".
<p>
Public service, not life tenure.  Twelve years in each house of Congress and then out.  A quarter-century of Congressional membership ought to be long enough to get something done...  But if it isn't, then it surely is time to go home and let someone else take a turn at bat.
<p>
Term limitations for members of Congress is an idea which was tailor-made for Democrats to promote and support.  Let's not let the Republicans steal it away from us.

<CENTER><H2>Next Up on the Term Limits Agenda</H2>
by <A HREF="/abic/cdmbio.html.cgi">Cleta Deatherage Mitchell</A>
<H6>(originally published in the Washington Times--May 31, 1995)</H6></center>
<P><BR>
Those of us in the term-limits effort who've suffered the slings and arrows of the political and media elite in Washington these past five years on the issue must now endure another round of smug self-satisfaction from the insiders who truly believe the term-limits witch is dead.  But before anyone calls the mortician, people who support term limits should consider how far we've come--and what we have to do to finish the job of enacting term limits for all members of Congress.
<P>
<EM>The state term-limits laws were always a means to an end--not the end.</EM>  When the first term limits effort began in Colorado in 1989, culminating in Colorado's first-ever passage of a state constitutional amendment to limit the terms of its congressional delegation, the goal was not simply to limit the terms of those members of Congress from Colorado.  The original goal was to force the passage by Congress of a constitutional amendment to limit the terms of all members of Congress, from every state.
<P>
Such bills had been introduced since the very first Congress--but none had been acted upon.  When Colorado passed term limits in 1990, it had been 12 years since the last congressional hearing on a term-limits measure, and none had ever come to the floor of either house of Congress.
<P>
Now, five years and 25 million votes for congressional term limits later, the U.S. Supreme Court has said that to enact term limits, a constitutional amendment is necessary.  So, the court essentially has said that the original goal must still be the goal.
<P>
It is true that some term limits activists have gotten carried away with the strategy and have in the past year started to confuse the tactics with the goal.  Some began to argue that the state laws should supercede the constitutional amendment as the end product of the term-limit movement.  But that was never the idea.
<P>
The reason the state actions were necessary was debate--when inside Washington wouldn't give the issue the time of day.  That has happened.
<P>
In these past five years, many dozens of congressional candidates in both the House and Senate have been elected pledging to support term limits--and to abide by them, even without an amendment.
<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Majority Leader Dick Armey are very committed to term limits and have worked with term-limits supporters to enact a constitutional amendment.  In fact, those two House leaders did everything term-limits supporters requested during the term-limits fight earlier this year, reports to the contrary notwithstanding.
<P>
Many, many members of the House and Senate are personally dedicated to winning the issue of term limits--and are not deterred in any way by the Supreme Court's decision that the constitutional amendment is the only route to do so.  Those members of Congress already believed that.
<P>
The originial strategy of the term limits founders in Colorado (Paul Ogle, Shari Williams, and Terry Considine) has been fulfulled.  The issue of term limits has taken on a life of its own within the country and within the Congress--and the drive for a constitutional amendment has been jump-started from the states, just as they envisioned.
<P>
<EM>The organizing point for term-limits supporters is House Joint Resolution 1 in the 105th Congress.</EM>  The Supreme Court has focused the efforts and energies of term-limits proponents on Congress.  The blind alleys and rabbit trails that some term-limits supporters had been suggesting are foreclosed.  The shotgun is traded in for the rifle--and in plenty of time to make that a reality in the 1996 elections.
<P>
On the night of the term-limits vote in the House, Speaker Gingrich closed the debate in favor of term limits by promising that the Republicans would continue to push for limits and that the issue "will not go away."  The speaker pledged that if the Republicans are still in control, the very first issue in the 105th Congress will be House Joint Resolution 1, the term limits constitutional amendment.
<P>
That establishes for term limits supporters a tangible target around which to organize.  The language of H.J. Res. 1 must be developed carefully and thoughtfully with the input of members and constituents who support term limits.  House Joint Resolution 1 must contain the most stringent term limitation that can pass.
<P>
It does no good to argue for shorter term limits for House members if the resolution can't pass.  Likewise, it doesn't do much good to pass a term limitation that isn't meaningful.  Careful consideration and research must be given to these questions in order to reach consensus--and then all those who are serious about a constitutional amendment should rally 'round.
<P>
One version, one version only.  Not everyone's pet.  Not four or five different votes.  Some will have to give up on their personal preferences.  House Joint Resolution 1, period.
<P>
To accomplish this goal, the House and Senate leadership should appoint a joint task force on term limits.  No one should be appointed to the task force who didn't vote for at least two of the term-limits proposals considered by the House in March.
<P>
Open minds are needed here.  The task force could conduct public hearings around the country and work with the organizations who are seriously committed to passing a term limits amendment to develop the language of House Joint Resolution 1.  That task should be concluded this year.
<P>
Once H.J.Res. 1 is finalized, it will give organizers a chance to spend 1996 developing support for the specific amendment among the candidates and voters and to make the issue of term limits a priority in the presidential and congressional campaigns--without miring the issue in ancillary details.
<P>
<EM>The public is entitled to know where members of the Senate stand on the issue of term limits.</EM>  The timing of the Senate vote should be scheduled to maximize support.
<P>
There have been various ideas flying around as to when the Senate will vote, what the Senate will vote on and who's in charge.
<P>
Enough.  The Senate leadership should designate the leader(s) of the effort and term-limits supporters should work with that person or group to plan a schedule and a strategy to maximize support.  Even if we don't have the votes today, the process will be a learning experience that we can take to the American people in the same way we can the recorded vote in the House.  The Senate effort should be part of the strategic thinking developed by the joint task force.  (See <a href="/abic/sentlvotenote.html.cgi">note</a>.)
<P>
Amending the Constitution isn't easy--nor is it supposed to be.  The heavy-lifting in the term-limits effort is just getting under way.
<P>
There are plenty of people in Washington's high places who've always hated term limits and never really believed the issue was alive in the first place.  Just because those same people now say the issue is dead is only more reason to rededicate ourselves to the original goal:  getting a constitutional amendment to limit the terms of all members of Congress.

<P>
<img src="/abic/images/rogers.jpg" align="left">
"Cowboy humorist" and star of stage and screen Will Rogers was commissioned to write 
about the 1920, 1924, 1928 and 1932 national political conventions, a job he thoroughly
enjoyed as these quadrennial politicalfests provided ample fodder for a humorist.  ABIC has been pleased
 to offer just a sampling of Rogers' observations during the 1996 convention season.
  You'll note that in many cases things haven't changed much.  But in some cases 
things have changed so much that his statements offer even more ironic humor.
<P>
Each day we focused on a different aspect of the convention.  And as Rogers covered both the Democratic and Republican conventions, so did we.  First we published his thoughts from the Republican conventions (see below) and two weeks later it was the Democrats' turn!

</P>

There are few issues that so clearly separate the Republicans and Democrats in Washington as the issue of amending the U.S. Constitution to provide for limits on the number of terms members of Congress may serve.  These facts tell the story:
<p><img src="/abic/images/mitchell.gif" ALIGN="right" ALT="Cleta Mitchell" HSPACE=25>
<UL>
<LI>There have been proposals in many Congresses, for decades, to amend the Constitution and enact congressional term limits:  under the Democrats, NO term limits measure was ever allowed to be debated or voted on in subcommittee, full committee or on the floor of either the House or Senate.
<P>
<LI>Conversely, in the first 100 days of the 104th Congress, the House of Representatives voted on the term limits constitutional amendment in the Judiciary Committee AND the floor of the House of Representatives.  
</ul><p>
<table hspace="10"><tr>
<td align="left"><hr><b>
THE DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS<br> 
ARE VOTING AGAINST THE
 WILL<br> OF NOT ONLY
THE 
VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE 
IN THE COUNTRY, BUT 
AGAINST THE WISHES
OF 
THEIR OWN PARTY'S 
VOTERS AS WELL.</b><hr></td>
<td><ul>
<LI>In the historic first floor vote in the House in 1995, 82% of the House Republicans voted YES on term limits.  82% of the House Democrats voted NO. (See <a href="/abic/hstlvote.html.cgi">Chart</a>.)
<LI>Speaker Gingrich has already announced that term limits will be the first issue voted on in 1997 if the Republicans still control the House of Representatives.
</ul></td></tr></table>
<ul>
<LI>In the House Judiciary Committee in 1995, the Democrats unanimously voted AGAINST allowing term limits to be brought to the House floor for consideration.  Thanks to the Republican majority, the bill went to the floor despite the Democrats' opposition.
<P>
<LI>In the Senate this year, the Republicans unanimously voted in favor of bringing term limits to the floor for final consideration.  All but five Democrats voted AGAINST allowing the measure to proceed to the Senate floor for a final vote, thus blocking consideration and passage
 <P>
<LI>The GOP Platform has included term limits for members of Congress since 1984.
</UL><P>
What difference does it make if the Republicans overwhelmingly favor term limits and the Democrats in Washington oppose the issue so strongly?
<P>
The American people want to limit the terms of members of Congress!  In poll after poll, it is clear that the voters believe that congressional tenure should be limited and that congressional paychecks are like welfare checks:  it's okay to receive them for awhile but NOT for life.
<P>
In January, 1996, the Tarrance Group conducted a national poll of registered voters on behalf of the Term Limits Amendment National Campaign.  According to the data, 77% of the American people favor term limits while only 17% oppose the idea. (See <a href="/abic
/peoplepie.html.cgi">Chart</a>.) Of those, 59% strongly favor term limits and only 9% strongly oppose it.
<P>
The curious fact is that support for term limits never drops below 64% in any demographic or political group.  Democratic voters support term limits by a wide margin and conservative Democrats support term limits more strongly than any other group!
<P>
That means the Democrats in Congress are voting against the will of not only the vast majority of people in the country, but against the wishes of their own party's voters as well.
<P>
Term limits for Congress is a basic idea fundamental to our democracy:  Congress is supposed to be comprised of citizen representatives, not professional politicians.  The Democratic majority over the past four decades came to believe that Congress belonged to them, not the people of America -- and it is still difficult for Democrats to believe in the importance of returning Washington to the control of the American people.
<P>
There is another, more deeply philosophical basis for the congressional Democrats' opposition to term limits:  the national Democratic party basically believes in an unlimited federal government, with control over every aspect of our lives.  That notion has its origins in the idea of "no limits" for the Congress of the United States.  No limits on time, no limits on money, no limits on the federal government.
<P>
Most Americans believe that it is time to place limits on the money the Washington politicians can spend (the Balanced Budget Amendment) and limits on the time that politicians can spend in Washington -- the Term Limits Amendment.  These are the bookends of the GOP's Contract with America and they were fundamental principles of the design of the American system of government.  Because the founding fathers didn't write the principles down, our country has strayed badly from them -- and it is time to include in the Constitution the actual language of the principles that the framers clearly intended.
<P>
These are also principles in which most Republican members of Congress believe as well.  There are still some veteran Republican lawmakers who take the idea of term limits personally and can't get over the idea of how it will affect their careers.  They have difficulty getting past their personal involvement to see how the issue is fundamental to bringing the  federal government Leviathan under control for the sake of our children and grandchildren.
<p>
<table hspace="10"><tr><td width="60%">
George Will has written that term limits is more important to balancing the budget than the balanced budget amendment -- because the end of careerism in Congress will remove the incentives of members of Congress (from both parties) to use our tax dollars for their own reelection purposes by making voters dependent on Washington and the federal government instead of free enterprise and individual initiative.
</td><td><hr><b>
TERM LIMITS ARE IMPOSED ON THE PRESIDENT, 40 GOVERNORS,
21 STATE LEGISLATURES AND THOUSANDS OF LOCAL OFFICIALS
ACROSS THE NATION. WHY NOT CONGRESS?  
</b><hr></td></tr></table>
<p>
Term limits are imposed on the President, 40 Governors, 21 state legislatures and thousands of local officials across the nation.  Why not Congress?
<P>
In 1996, term limits is a key issue that Republican candidates and activists can use to demonstrate conclusively the differences between the parties.  It is an opportunity that should not be lost.

<CENTER><H2>We the People</H2>
<STRONG><EM>We the people of the United States of America...</EM></STRONG></CENTER>
<P><BR>
Somewhere between the First Federal Congress of 1787 and the 104th Congress, this defining opening statement to the Constitution of the United States of America lost its meaning.  What was once a "government of the people, by the people and for the people" has become a mockery of what the Founding Fathers envisioned. The citizen congress has become a welfare state for career politicians. The limited government has become a limitless government. And powers once reserved for the people have been lost in the politics of self-preservation.
<P>
There is little doubt that the "government of the people" envisioned by the Founding Fathers was one of limited federal powers. The framers of the Constitution certainly never imagined a "government by the people" run by career politicians so entrenched in their position of power as to be almost entirely removed from their constituency. And their ideal of a "government for the people" surely could not have been one that passes on the burden of a huge national debt from one generation to the next.
<P>	
The historical principle of a limited central government cannot be ignored by any serious student of the origins of our Constitution. James Madison wrote that "[i]n framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: You must first enable the government to control itself." Thomas Jefferson professed: "I own that I am not a friend of a very energetic government. It is always oppressive."
<P>	
What a distance we have traveled since 1787. The seemingly endless involvement of the federal government in every facet of our lives has far exceeded the worst fears of even the most vocal anti-federalist in the late 18th century.
<P>
As we prepare to move into the next century - and the next millennium - it is time for "we the people" to reclaim the vision of the Founding Fathers. We can only do this by restating in the Constitution the principles of limits that were implicit in the Founders' view of the nation. And only then will we put Americans back in charge of the government of the people. 
<P>
<H3><CENTER>LIMITED TIME + LIMITED MONEY<BR>
= LIMITED GOVERNMENT</CENTER>
</H3>
Central to the concept of a limited government was the principal of limited national service, evidenced most clearly by the example of Washington, Jefferson and every President until Roosevelt, but also evidenced by the short tenure of Members of Congress in the 18th and 19th centuries. The idea of a representative government is that the people select one of their own, a member of their community, and dispatch that person to the seat of government for a short time to represent the views and perspectives of their community before he or she returns home to once again live and work in that community. If allowed to linger for a protracted period of time, the representative becomes the federal government's emissary to the people, instead of the other way around. The dynamic of representation has been reversed and become the opposite of what was intended.
<P>
Imposing limited tenure on Members of Congress restores the principal of representative democracy to its proper function. People who make laws for others should do so knowing with certainty that they will soon return to private life and live and work under those laws. This is the ultimate check on the powers of the legislature. This is what democratic self-rule was supposed to be about.
<P>
Term limits are an essential part of restricting the role of the federal government. If we can limit the time that politicians spend in Washington, we can fundamentally change the role of the federal government in our lives. If Members of Congress know coming in that there is a time certain that they must leave, it will change the mind set of the institution and of the Members themselves.
<P>
Term limits are the surest way to reform Congress, addressing the issues of campaign finance reform, lobbying reform, the seniority system and the perks and privileges of the ruling class that have become a plague on the institution.
<P>
Equally important to the concept of limited government is the principle of limited funds and fiscal responsibility. The Founding Fathers recognized this as they addressed economic issues throughout the Constitution. Never in their wildest dreams could they have imagined a national debt over $3.4 trillion.
<P>
Unfortunately, that principle has been lost on the Congress of today. Not having ended the year in a surplus for the past 25 years, they have habitually and routinely abandoned the concept of a balanced budget. They have shown themselves both unwilling and unable to spend within our means.
<P>
Federal spending is inextricably linked to tenure in Congress. Studies by the National Taxpayers Union demonstrate that junior Representatives have always been more fiscally conservative than senior Representatives. Stephen Moore wrote in 1994 that "if we truly want to get government spending under control, much more important than changing the party controlling Congress is reducing the length of congressional careers via term limits ... research indicates that the longer a member has been in Congress, the worse is his or her voting record (as to spending) - and that is true of members of both parties."
<P>
By writing the two axioms of limited time and limited money into the federal constitution, our national government and its leaders will, for the first time in decades, be subject to the external controls and boundaries envisioned by the Constitution in its original form.
<P>

<CENTER><H3>Term Limits and Balanced Budget Amendments:<BR>The Bookends of the Contract with America</H3></CENTER>

The constitutional amendments to limit congressional terms and balance the federal budget were (and still are) the "bookends" of the GOP Contract with America - enjoying massive public support and reflecting the ideal of a permanently restructured federal government. Much of the electoral success enjoyed by Republican candidates in 1994 can be attributed to these two wildly popular provisions.
<P>
These constitutional amendments continue to enjoy the overwhelming support of the American people. George Will wrote in 1992: "There are just two things that three-fourths of the American people want that Congress will not permit. One is a balanced budget amendment; the other is term limits for legislators. These are anathema to Congress because careerism is the shared creed of Democrans and Republicrats, and deficit spending - burdening future voters to buy today's voters - is the key to careerism... term limits would change the motives and behavior of legislators."
<P>
Since 1990, more than 25 million people have voted in favor of limiting the terms of their congressional delegations and twenty-three states have passed congressional term limits. In January, 1996, a nationwide survey of 1,000 registered voters conducted by The Tarrance Group found that 77 percent of the country's electorate favor term limits.
<P>
According to the survey, Republicans (80%), Democrats (71%) and Independents (81%) all favor limits on the number of terms federally elected officials can serve. The support is extremely widespread, never falling below 60% with any voter group. The term limits issue cuts across party lines, social strata and economic status, making it one of the most widely popular government reform measures ever proposed.
<P>
Support for the balanced budget amendment is equally strong. Several Gallup polls conducted at various times in 1995 consistently showed over 71 percent of the American people favoring the balanced budget amendment.
<P>
The American people instinctively know that term limits will permanently limit the time that politicians can spend in Washington and, further, that the balanced budget amendment will permanently limit the money that politicians in Washington can spend. Together, the two amendments will restore to the Constitution the notion of a finite federal government - something that was implicit in the design of our government and understood by the Founders as an essential element of the system they created.
<P>
With such strong public support for these two issues, why has there been so little action in the 104th Congress? What the public is still looking for is some measure of results, which are not yet apparent. The bottom line is that term limits and the balanced budget amendment - the two issues most popular with the American people in November, 1994 - have not yet passed. Those failures are symbols in the voters' minds of "business as usual" in Washington.
<P>
What went wrong? This book is an in-depth investigation into the politics of self preservation that have derailed the two most important reform initiatives in Congress. With a quick read, it becomes clear that the major opponents to the term limits and balanced budget amendments are Congressmen and women who are unwilling to sever their ties with Washington or release their grasp on the purse strings of the Nation.

<center><h3>Setting Limits:<br>
The Truth About Why Congress Defeated <br>
the Term Limits and Balanced Budget Amendments in 1995</h3></center>
<hr width="55% size="3">
<p>     
As America looks toward the end of an incredible twentieth century and the
beginning of both a new millenium and a new century, we are well served to think
about the kind of government we want as we move into this new era.

<p>
Most of us believe that it is time for new answers to the problems and
challenges we face as a country:  an aging population, staggering deficits, and a
government in Washington that seems unable to cope with the major issues of the
day.
<p>
<table><tr><td width="60%">
That is why overwhelming majorities of the American people favor
enactment of two constitutional amendments:  one to permanently limit the tenure
of members of the U.S. Congress and the other to permanently require a balanced
federal budget.
<p>
In the 104th Congress that convened in January, 1995 and will adjourn at the
end of this year, we have made progress toward the twin goals of the balanced
budget amendment and term limits -- but we haven't achieved the necessary 2/3
vote in both houses of Congress for final passage of either.

</center></td></tr></table>

<p>
We have much work to do in order to secure congressional passage of these
constitutional amendments.  Our Founding Fathers intended that it would be
somewhat difficult to amend the constitution -- but it shouldn't be impossible, and
it isn't.
<p>
The active participation in the political process by average, patriotic citizens
is what it will take to see both of these amendments through passage by the
Congress and ratification by the necessary 38 state legislatures.
<p>
We can -- and we must -- reclaim our government from the governing elite
in Washington, D.C. and return it to the oversight and control of the American
people in our  home towns and our states.
<p>
That is what the balanced budget and term limits amendments will help
accomplish -- and we must keep up the effort for both until we see these
amendments added to our constitution.

<H3>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Finally Apologizes<BR> to Elderly Maine Couple in "Takings" Case</H3> </td>
</tr>
</table>
In a classic story of unrestrained government, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) has finally apologized to an elderly Maine couple for illegally seizing their retirement "nest egg" property.  In a July letter, ACE admitted that Corps officials "were clearly guilty of innappropriate behavior in (this) case."
<P>
After 10 years of legal wrangling in which ACE claimed that the property was a protected wetland, even though it was surrounded by a road, railroad tracks and houses, the Corps finally settled a lawsuit filed by the couple, the Roberges.  Worse, during the course of the lawsuit, the Roberges' attorneys discovered a memo signed by an ACE caseworker, Jay Clement, in which he stated, <STRONG>"Roberge would be a good one to squash and (make into) an example."  </STRONG>Apparently, Mr. Clement continues to be employed by the Corps despite its July acknowledgement that the case was mishandled.

This is exactly the kind of big government arrogance that insinuates itself into 
Americans' lives every day.  As Thomas Jefferson professed: "I own that I am not a friend of
a very energetic government.  It is always oppressive."   ... How prophetic!

<p>
Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.ntu.org">National Taxpayers Union</a> released a study of the cost of running House members' personal offices.  The figure above represents the entire total cost of all 435 offices.  
<p>
According to the press release which accompanied the release of the study, "the biggest office spender was former California Rep. Walter Tucker, who spent slightly more than he was legally allowed.  The most frugal office spender was Rep. Andy Jacobs (D-IN), who spent $265,124 less than the average representative.  If all members had spent as little as Rep. Jacobs, House office spending could have been slashed by 35%."

<H3>Insider Tales of an Honorable Ex-Legislator</H3>
<P>
by <a href="/abic/cdmbio.html.cgi">Cleta Deatherage Mitchell</a>
Director and General Counsel, ABIC
<P>
Wall Street Journal - October, 1991
</center>
<P>
<P>
I was elected to the Oklahoma House of Representatives as a Democrat in 1976 and served for eight years.  During that time and in the six years since I voluntarily decided not to run for re-election, I have come to believe strongly that our American democracy badly needs limitations on the number of terms that legislators--state and federal--can remain in office.  Only mandatory term limits will fix what's wrong with America's legislative bodies.
<P>
When I was first elected, I felt like every freshman: "My people" had selected me, and I was eager to "straighten out that mess."  It always begins that way, with the newly elected representative feeling he or she has a mission to accomplish on arrival at the seat of government.  Over time, however, the legislator becomes the honored guest from the capital who sits at the head table and explains our government to us, instead of fixing it.
<P>
Within a few days after my election, I began to receive gifts in the mail.  Not big things, just small gratuities like calendars and such, all addressed to "The Honorable Cleta Deatherage," a title one can quickly learn to like.  The gift that really got my attention, though, was the set of crystal stemware that was to be engraved with my initials, with the style of the engraving up to me.  Etched crystal stemware?  From a lobby group?  Just for winning the election?  Or for a future vote?
<P>
I had already campaigned against legislative perks--and this flurry of presents struck me as more of the same.  So I sent them all back.  I paid for anything already ordered that had my name on it--and asked the lobbyists not to send anything else.  But time was on their side, and I eventually fell victim to the process of familiarity that is the stock and trade of the special interests.  After a while, those lobbyists became my friends and co-workers, and it began to be uncomfortable to return their calendars.
<P>
When I started my first term, I distinctly remember being terribly annoyed when I would raise questions about state government practices that seemed particularly wasteful, inefficient, outmoded or stupid, only to find my more senior colleagues responding by rolling their eyes, folding their arms and--with that tone of voice that comes when one has lost patience with another's naivete--sighing and saying, "Because we've always done it this way."
<P>
I pledged to myself that if I ever got that way, it would be time for me to leave.  And it happened.
<P>
After serving eight years--five years in the inner circle of the state's leadership, three of them as chairman of the House Appropriations and Budget Committee--I chose not to run again.  I had become too familiar with the issues, too familiar with the process and too familiar with the capital insiders to truly be as effective as I once was.  I knew on any given issue, idea or proposal who would be for it, who would be against it, and which side would probably prevail.  So I lost the fever and the fervor to fight battles that couldn't be won or to try things that would surely fail.
<P>
Just as battle-weary soldiers are replaced with fresh troops, the legislatures need a steady, guaranteed influx of new blood to keep them vibrant and vigilant in their war against the special interests.
<P>
Legislators should be forced to think of each re-election cycle as a step closer to the conclusion of their service, not another notch in their belts of lifetime tenure.  More important, if members who begin their legislative service with a set of defined goals knew for certain from the outset that they had only a limited time in which to accomplish them, they would get about their business before being consumed by the inertia of insider politics.  I have seen all too many legislators keep putting off doing anything very hard until after the next election, and then the next, and the next.  Legislators measure their political lives in two-, four- or six-year intervals that must be gotten safely beyond.
<p>
But even the traditional concept of facing the voters in a competitive race is foreign to most members of Congress after their first elections.  Congressional incumbents have little to fear from opponents who can't compete with the perks and the PACs that have helped create a permanent Congress.  American democracy is based, in part, on the concept of every good citizen taking his or her turn at public service.  If we can restore this basic concept of citizen control by mandating legislative turnover and forcing competition, we are obligated to try.

<p align="right">
<i>"If you can't say something nice,<br>
come sit by me."</i><br>

--Alice Roosevelt Longworth<br>

</p>
<p>
Last Tuesday (July 16th), the U.S. House voted on whether to raise congressional salaries.  By a vote of 352 to 67, the House decided not to raise their own salaries this year.  This week, ABICF wants to <b>point fingers</b> at the 67 members who felt they were doing such a great job that they deserved a payraise.</p>
<p>
<img src="/abic/images/rt.gif" ALIGN="left" ALT="Finger Pointing Right">
<img src="/abic/images/l.gif" ALIGN="right" ALT="Finger Pointing Left">
It is interesting to note that of the 67, over half have served more than twelve years and 17 have served more than 20 years!!  No wonder that 78% of them voted against term limits last year!</p> 
<p>
There are 48 Democrats and 19 Republicans on this list.  And the vast majority of these members have little fear of losing their jobs over this vote.  Of the 67, only five come from vulnerable seats, winning their 1994 reelection races with less than 55% of the vote.  
<img src="/abic/images/lup.gif" ALIGN="right" ALT="Finger Pointing Up and Left">
<img src="/abic/images/rtup.gif" ALIGN="left" ALT="Finger Pointing Up and Right">
And of those five, four aren't running this year!  So almost all of these members knew not only that they were safe in voting to give themselves a payraise but that they'd be around for a while to enjoy it!</p>
<p>
So ABICF is pointing the finger at each of these members this week because we thought you'd want to know!</p>

<title>ABICF - "Setting Limits" - "Hatfield and the Decoys"</title>

<h2>Hatfield and the Decoys</h2>
</center>
<p>
<p>



     When the Balanced Budget Amendment failed by one vote in the U.S. Senate in 1995, all eyes focused on Sen. Mark Hatfield, the lone Republican to vote against the BBA.  Less attention was paid to the real reason the BBA failed in 1995:  the six Democratic Senators who had previously voted "yes", had campaigned in favor of the BBA and then voted "no" when it really counted.  These are the "Decoys" who cost the American people passage of the BBA in 1995.
<p>
     In 1994, all of the following six senators had voted <i>for</i> a virtually identical Balanced Budget Amendment:
<p align=center>
Dianne Feinstein, D-California<br>
Wendell Ford, D-Kentucky<br>
Jeff Bingaman, D-New Mexico<br>
Byron Dorgan, D-North Dakota<br>
Ernest Hollings, D-South Carolina<br>
Tom Daschle, D-South Dakota<br>
</p align=center>
<p>
     What's worse, each and every one of them actually campaigned in favor of this issue.  They promised the voters of their states that they would vote "yes" when the amendment came to the floor.  They are the "Decoys" because they are Senators who pretended to support the BBA in an election year and switched in 1995 by voting "no".

<p>
<p>
<h2><b>Feinstein</b></h2>
     In a tough reelection race in 1994, Sen. Feinstein ran commercials touting her "yes" vote earlier that year on the BBA.  In October of 1994 during that campaign, while making an appearance on Larry King Live, Sen. Feinstein told a constituent caller that he could trust her to keep her promises.  When the caller asked her how she could expect him to vote for someone "wearing temporarily fiscally conservative clothing," she responded, "I said (in 1992) that I would vote for a balanced budget amendment and I voted for a balanced budget amendment."(1)  But when the vote actually came to the Senate floor in 1995 and was one vote away from passage, she voted "no".
<p>
<p>
<h2><b>Ford and Hollings</b></h2>
	Sens. Ford and Hollings voted <i>for</i> the BBA in 1986 and 1994.  Sen. Ford was quoted as saying that Congress "must begin to regain control of our spending policies.  . . . An amendment to the Constitution would do just that."(2)
<p>
	Sen. Hollings has been a frequent cosponsor of the Balanced Budget Amendment.  In a column sent to newspapers in 1994, he wrote, "(o)nly an amendment to the Constitution will have the clout to force the executive and legislative branches to pay the bills."(3)  He has further said, "by writing a balanced budget into the basic law of the land, we will compel Washington to do its job."(4)
<p>
<p>
<h2><b>Daschle</b></h2>
	Sen. Daschle deserves special status as a decoy--he led the charge against the Balanced Budget Amendment in 1995.  This is ironic considering that, like the others, he voted for the BBA in 1994 and in 1986 he ran a campaign ad declaring that when he first came to the Senate, "his first official act was to sponsor a constitutional amendment to balance the budget."  As is the case with others in Congress, perhaps the influence of Washington has caused him to listen to interests other than his constituents'.  Looking back on the failure of the BBA, Sen. Daschle smirked, "We had a good week."
<p>
<p>
<h2><b>Bingaman</b></h2>
	Sen. Bingaman voted yes on the BBA in 1994 in anticipation of a difficult reelection campaign.  After winning reelection to another six-year term in November, 1994, Sen. Bingaman apparently decided he could safely abandon his election year conversion to the BBA.
<p>
<p>
<h2><b>Dorgan</b></h2>
	Democrats fought the Balanced Budget Amendment last year with the claim that it would end up hurting the Social Security trust fund.  But all six Senators voted for the same amendment a year earlier.  At that time, Sen. Dorgan even disputed White House claims that the amendment would harm Social Security, saying, "the White House is not serving anyone's interests with these scare tactics on the balanced budget amendment."(5)
<p>
<p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
	The bottom line is that if even one of these decoy Senators had voted "yes" in 1995, as they had all voted only a year before, the Balanced Budget Amendment would now be before the state legislatures for ratification.

 <B><h2><CENTER>TAKING CONGRESS OFF WELFARE</h2></B>
<p>
<table border=1><tr><td>

<bR>
</FONT>
<P>
During the first 100 days of the 104th Congress,
the House of Representatives took up the issue of welfare reform.
 The legislation was aimed at ending welfare recipients' cycle
of lifetime dependence on the federal government and eradicating
the notion of being entitled to the receipt of a government check.


<P>
The week following the vote on welfare reform, the
House of Representatives voted against limiting their own dependency
on government checks.  Unfortunately, too many members of Congress
fail to see that they themselves have become dependent on their
own government program:  their careers in Congress.  Too many
members of Congress have come to believe that they are entitled
to their congressional seats and all the benefits they have created
along with it.

<P>
Congress has created for itself a welfare system
complete with salaries greater than those of the vast majority
of their constituents, pension programs that are far more lavish
than those of most private pension plans -- and other special
privileges that have resulted in scandalous and egregious breaches
of the public trust.

<P>
<I>The perks, pay and pension plans of the congressional
welfare system may be the real reason term limits didn't pass.

</I>
<P>
Let's compare two notorious examples of the abuse
created by the congressional welfare system--the &quot;midnight
payraise&quot; of 1989 and the House Banking Scandal of 1992--and
their effect on the vote on term limits.

<P>
While the congressional &quot;midnight payraise&quot;
was approved more than five years ago, there are 124 members who
voted for it still serving in the House of Representatives.  And
despite the public outrage at the abuses of the 1992 House banking
scandal, there are 144 House members still in office who were
revealed to have bounced checks.  These noteworthy episodes in
congressional history still linger.

<P>
And how did these Members of Congress vote on the
issue of term limits?  Not surprisingly, 71 percent of those members
who voted for the payraise and 61 percent of those members who
bounced checks opposed term limits.

<P>
All-in-all, there are 60 members of the House of
Representatives that have the dubious distinction of having all
three in common: they all voted to raise their congressional salaries,
they all bounced checks in the House bank scandal and they all
voted against term limits.  These are the reigning congressional
&quot;welfare kings and queens&quot;.

<P>
These 12 Republicans and 48 Democrats are the remnants
of the inside-Washington belief that receiving a government paycheck
is a lifetime entitlement.  Their dependence on the federal government
makes them unwilling and unable to limit congressional terms;
they are thoroughly opposed to ending congressional welfare as
they know it.

<P>
The congressional welfare kings and queens have pension
benefits worth an average of $1.73 million each.  These career
politicians have been in Congress for an average of 17.7 years.
 And they bounced an average of 86 checks each at the House bank.
 There is no better example of the need for term limits than these
career politicians building toward a cozy retirement.<BR>

<P>
The American people have said in clear and loud terms
that congressional checks are like welfare checks: they are okay
for a while but no one should get them for life.  It is time to
tell these members to get off the public dole and send them back
home to live and work under the laws they create.  It's time to
tell these Members of Congress to &quot;get a life.&quot;

<P>
The obstinate refusal of these Congressmen and women
to listen to the public will and behave accordingly is what keeps
Congress from making the changes the American people are demanding.
 These are the Members standing in the way of returning the federal
government to the role envisioned by the Founding Fathers.  As
long as these people are in Congress, the true change sought by
the voters in November 1994 will be never be realized.

<P>
Based upon the final passage roll call vote on term limits in
the U.S. House of Representatives on March 29, 1995, those members
who oppose term limits formed the basis of the study.  That list
was matched against the still-serving Members who voted in favor
of the congressional payraise in 1989, which legislation included
an automatic annual payraise for Members of Congress to avoid
the public pressure of having to ever again vote on a congressional
pay increase. Added to that list was the official record of the
Members of the House of Representatives who had at least one check
listed as paid without sufficient funds, which came to be known
as the House banking scandal of 1992 and resulted in the closing
of the House of Representatives bank.  The estimated lifetime
value of congressional pension benefits is taken from the National
Taxpayers' Union Foundation study published in 1994.  Pension
benefits are listed only for House members elected before 1984
as per the NTU study. <BR>

<center><h2>THE UN-REPRESENTATIVES</h2>

<P>


<table width="70%" border="1">
<tr>
<td><I>The strength of the grass-roots term limits movement comes
from the fact that Washington is simply out of touch with middle
America.</I>
<br>
<b>--Contract with America</b><BR></td></tr>
</table>

</center>
<P>
<br>
The very word &quot;representative&quot; charges our Members of
Congress with the responsibility to stand for the ideals, beliefs
and principals of the people they represent. A congressional district
sends one of their own to the House of Representatives to voice
their opinions and stand up for them in the halls of Congress.
That's why we call them <I>Representatives.</I>
<P>
So what would you call a Member of Congress who <I>does not </I>stand
for the interests and beliefs of his or her constituency, a member
who instead willfully acts in direct contradiction to those interests
and beliefs? We would call him or her an <I>un</I>-Representative.
<P>
The issue of term limits is unique among the thousands of measures
that have come before the Congress: there is no other issue voted
on by members of Congress that has also actually been voted on
by millions of American voters. Over 25 million votes have been
cast in 22 states in favor of congressional term limits since
1990 (Utah and New Hampshire passed congressional term limits
through their state legislatures).
<P>
There are 179 Members of the House of Representatives from those
22 states whose constituents have actually voted to support term
limits for Members of Congress.
<P>
One would think that those Representatives would follow the dictates
of the election results in their districts. These were, after
all, not opinion polls, focus groups or town meetings. These were
actual ballots cast by real voters in favor of limiting the congressional
terms of their own Representatives.
<P>
On March 29, 1995 the House of Representatives of the 104th Congress
held the first recorded floor vote in the nation's history on
a constitutional amendment to limit the terms of Members of Congress.
The measure, H.J.Res. 73, received a majority vote of the House
- but not the 2/3 super-majority required for a constitutional
amendment. The final vote was 227 in favor, 204 opposed and four
not voting (or present). The historic ballot on a term limits
constitutional amendment fell just 63 votes short of final passage.
<P>
So what is the correlation between the outcome of the congressional
district voting and the votes of the House members from those
districts?
<P>
Incredibly, there are sixty members of the U.S. House of Representatives
who voted &quot;no&quot; on final passage of the term limits constitutional
amendment whose constituents had voted &quot;yes&quot; on term
limits when it appeared on their general election ballots in 1990,
1992 or 1994. Sixty of the 179 Members of the House of Representatives
from those 22 states whose constituents have voted for term limits
violated their duty to act in accordance with the wishes of the
people they represent.
<P>
<I>These are the </I>un<I>-Representatives.</I>
<P>
The <I>un</I>-Representatives are the best, though not the only,
argument for term limitations for members of Congress. Every member
of Congress who opposes term limits does so in the face of clear,
consistent and continuing public opinion polls showing that three-fourths
of the American voters favor term limits.
<P>
Who are these <I>un</I>-Representatives? They include 51 Democrats
and 9 Republicans. They average 11.87 years in Congress, or nearly
six full terms. The three highest-ranking House Democrats are
<I>un</I>-Representatives: Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, Minority
Whip David Bonior, and Democratic Caucus Chairman Vic Fazio. The
longest tenured member of Congress (39.5 years), John Dingell,
is an <I>un</I>-Representative whose constituents voted &quot;yes&quot;
on term limits by a 16 percent margin.
<P>
But the most egregious <I>un</I>-Representative member of the
House is Sam Gibbons (D-FL), whose constituents voted &quot;yes&quot;
on term limits with a whopping 78 percent of the vote ... only
to have their &quot;representative&quot; vote against the constitutional
amendment for term limits.
<P>
There are many more House members who voted against term limits
but who escape this list only because their states do not permit
the initiative process enabling voters to vote on term limits.
Nonetheless, in considering where to begin to press for the 63
votes needed to pass the term limits constitutional amendment
in the House of Representatives, the <I>un</I>-Representatives
offer a natural starting point for public focus--and special criticism.

<h3>Welcome to the home page of<br>
Americans Back in Charge Foundation!</h3></center>
<p>
Our reason for existing is exactly what our name implies:  we want to put the American
people back in charge of their government, instead of the other way around.
<p>
<b>Americans Back in Charge</b> grew out of the original term limits statewide initiative effort in Colorado in 1989-90.  That state effort was known as "Coloradans Back in Charge".  A group of citizens circulated petitions calling for a state constitutional amendment to limit the terms of politicians in Colorado -- including limits on the Colorado congressional delegation.  The initiative was passed by over 70% of Colorado voters in November, 1990.  Soon thereafter, "Coloradans Back in Charge" established <b>Americans Back in Charge</b> in order to help other citizens do what they had done.
<p>
<b>Americans Back in Charge</b> has been a leading force on behaf of term limits for
politicians ever since it was formed in 1991.
<p>
But there is a broader purpose of <b>Americans Back in Charge</b>:  helping citizens take charge of government and American politics at every level.
<p>
We believe that was the original purpose of the <b><a href="/abic/declaration.html.cgi">Declaration of Independence</a></b>.  
<p>
We believe that the reason the colonies separated from England in 1776 -- an event we
celebrate every year on the Fourth of July -- was essentially rebellion against tyrannical government.
<p>
There is a need in 1996 -- just as in 1776 -- to be ever vigilant against governmental
excess, over-taxation, and bureaucratic arrogance and tyranny.
<p>
That is what <b>Americans Back in Charge</b> is all about.  Through this web site, Americans Back in Charge Foundation wants to provide the tools, the information and the support for you to take charge of your government.
<p>
We hope you enjoy our site!

This graphic of the Declaration of Independence is a photo of the actual Declaration read by
George Washington to his troops in July, 1776.</small></blockquote></center><p></small>
<p>
When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
<p>
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.
<p>
Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.
<p>
But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.
<p>
Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain [George III] is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.
<p>
He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
<p>
He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained, and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
<p>
He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
<p>
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
<p>
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
<p>
He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.
<p>
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
<p>
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.
<p>
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
<p>
He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.
<p>
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies, without the consent of our
legislatures.
<p>
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.
<p>
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution and
unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:
<ul>
<li> For protecting them by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:
<li>For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:
<li>For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:
<li>For depriving us in many cases of the benefits of Trial by Jury:
<li>For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:
<li>For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:
<li>For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
<li>For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
</ul><p>
He has abdicated Government here by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.
<p>
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.
<p>
He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.
<p>
He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.
<p>
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the
inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.
<p>
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms. Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
<p>
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. 
<ul>
<li>We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an
unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.
<li>We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here.
<li>We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence.
</ul><p>
They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore,
acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.
<p>
We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress,
Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by the authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare
<p>
That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is and ought to be totally dissolved;
<p>
and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce,
<p>
and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.
<p>
And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine
Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.

<CENTER><H2>The Antagonists</H2></center>
<P><BR>
<CENTER><i><H5>Election Day, November 8, 1994, was a turning point.  America's voters dismantled the forty-year lock the Democrats had on Congress...  Obviously the voters believed there was a difference between the way the two parties envisioned the role of government in their lives, and the difference mattered.</H5></i></CENTER>
<P align="right"><font="-2">Contract with America</font></align>
<P><BR>
During the first 100 days of the 104th Congress, constitutional amendments to require a balanced federal budget and to limit the terms for Members of Congress were taken up in the U.S. House of Representatives as part of the GOP <EM>Contract with America</EM>.  The U.S. Senate also took up the issue of a balanced budget amendment, but, as of January 1996, has yet to vote on the final passage of term limits.  (See <a href="/abic/sentlvotenote.html.cgi">Note</a>.)  All three votes--two in the House and one in the Senate--failed.
<P>
By electing Republicans, voters believed that they would finally get their way on term limits and the balanced budget amendment.  But as voters look back at the first year of Republican control of Congress following 40 years of Democratic rule, Republicans will have a hard time claiming that the direction of the federal government has been permanently changed.  So who is really to blame for the failure of these amendments?  Republicans?  Democrats?  Or both?
<P>
Amendments to the constitution require passage by 2/3 of the membership of both houses of Congress.  Although Republicans control the majority in both houses, the GOP falls well short of the super-majority required for passage.  Under the current makeup of both houses, it takes a fairly sizable number of Democratic votes in favor of any amendment to be able to pass it--even if 100 percent of the Republicans vote "yes".
<P>
<EM>The absence of a respectable bloc of Democratic votes in the 104th Congress for term limits and the balanced budget amendments was the chief cause of failure of both amendments.
</EM><P>
Simply by checking the recorded votes in Congress on the term limits and balanced budget amendments in 1995, a dramatic breakdown emerges along party lines.  Let's compare the votes of Republicans and Democrats with public support for these issues, starting with the U.S. House of Representatives.
<P>
Although term limits are supported by 77 percent of the American people, 82 percent of the House Democrats voted <EM>against</EM> the term limits amendment in 1995 while only 35 Democrats (18%) voted with the American people (see Chart 2-1).  Similarly, only 67 Democrats voted "yes" in the 1995 House vote on the balanced budget amendment, although it is supported by 71 percent of the American people (see Chart 2-2).
<p>
<center>
<img src="/abic/images/chart2-1.gif" alt="Chart 2-1">
</center>
<p>
In stark contrast, House Republicans supported both measures in large numbers, with over 82 percent voting for term limits and an overwhelming 99 percent voting in favor of the balanced budget amendment.
<P>
<center>
<img src="/abic/images/chart2-2.gif" alt="Chart 2-2">
</center><p>
Meanwhile, in the U.S. Senate, while the first actual, recorded vote on a term limits constitutional amendment won't occur until April, 1996, (See <a href="/abic/sentlvotenote.html.cgi">Note</a>) there was a "sense of the Senate" resolution regarding term limits in October of 1995.  Only three of the Senate's 46 Democrats (7%) voted with term limits supporters, compared to 42 of the Senate's 53 Republicans (see Chart 2-3).
<P><center>
<img src="/abic/images/chart2-3.gif" alt="Chart 2-3">
</center><p>
The nail-biting Senate vote on the balanced budget amendment in early 1995 provided great drama, falling just one vote short of passage.  But the reason the amendment failed was not because one Republican voted no; it failed because only 28 percent of the Senate Democrats voted yes.  Incredibly, 72 percent of Senate Democrats voted against an amendment favored by 71 percent of the American people (see Chart 2-4).
<P>
<center><img src="/abic/images/chart2-4.gif" alt="Chart 2-4">
</center><p>
Clearly, Republican Members of Congress are more in tune with the American people in their support of the term limits and balanced budget amendments, while a majority of Democrats are out of touch.  However, Republicans are not without blame for the failure of these key provisions of the GOP <EM>Contract with America</EM>.  In fact, there are 40 Republicans in the House who signed the <EM>Contract with America</EM> but voted against term limits, despite their pledge: "If we break this <EM>Contract</EM>, throw us out."
<P>
But there is a group of people who deserve to be singled out for their opposition to both the term limits and balanced budget amendments.  They are primarily Democrats.  In fact, just one Republican appears on this list. They are the reigning opposition to real reform of the Federal government.  We call them the Antagonists.

<title>Biography: Michael S. Joyce</title>

<h3>Biographical Sketch<br>
Michael S. Joyce</h3>
</center>

Michael S. Joyce is President and Chief Executive Officer of The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation in Milwaukee. Throughout a twenty-year career in private philanthropy, which has included leadership of the John M. Olin Foundation in New York and of the Goldseker Foundation in Baltimore, Mr. Joyce has seen and compared the ideas, the actions and the results of thousands of programs that have sought to address the challenges of modern life and has, in consequence, become convinced that the best hope for our time lies in the renewal of the institutions of civil society. The Bradley Foundation has coined the term, "New Citizenship," to express its aspiration for a return to a pre-welfare state understanding of civic participation in which citizenship is not defined merely as "occasional voting" but as a deep and active engagement in community life.<p>

Beginning his career as a teacher of history and political science at the secondary and college levels, Mr. Joyce spent six years with the Educational Research Council of America before entering the world of private foundations and maintains a strong commitment to educational reform as a supporter of parental choice in education.<p>

Mr. Joyce has served on many presidential and national commissions, including the Presidential~Transition Team at the outset of the Reagan years in 1980. On the other end of the Reagan-Bush era, in the fall of 1993, he joined with William Kristol to found the Project for the Republican Future.<p>

As a scholar, Mr. Joyce, who holds degrees in history and philosophy and a Ph.D. in politics and education, has been the author of many research studies as well as a contributing editor to a textbook series in the social sciences. As a contributor to a wide variety of journals, he has also published many essays and articles on contemporary issues, with a special emphasis on restoring the central role of civil society -- of family, church, and community institutions -- in the wake of a period dominated by unchecked expansions both of government controls and of personal license.

<P>
RE: WHAT'S HOT AT CAPITAL RESEARCH CENTER
<P>
The record-breaking high temperatures that swept through the country
during July and August were matched by Capital Research Center.
We've been red-hot this summer.
<P>
Capital has added new staff, upgraded its technology, refurbished
its meeting facilities and taken on new projects. We have published
an annual report, distributed ground-breaking issues of our monthly
newsletters, and made substantial progress on our annual corporate
giving study and special reports scheduled for publication by
year's end.
<P>
The board elected a new director, the Hon. William E. Simon, former
secretary of the U.S. Treasury, past president of the U.S. Olympic
Committee, and chairman of William E. Simon &amp; Sons. But the
highlight of the summer was watching House Republicans reform
the federal grant system. All this and more is inside <I>Capital
Report</I>, so read on!
<P>
<a name="reform"></a>
<h3>Congress Reforms the Grant Process;</B> <B>Calls on CRC for
Help </h3>
<P>
Americans are becoming more and more aware of how federally-funded
nonprofits use taxpayer money to influence public policy. Tax-exempt
advocacy groups get almost <B>$40 billion</B> a year in federal
grant money, and much of it goes directly or indirectly to lobbying
for even more tax dollars. Ending this unethical use of taxpayer
money has long been Capital Research Center's goal. For 11 years,
CRC has monitored the flow of government and private funds to
nonprofits and researched how that money was used. We believe
a nonprofit organization should deliver services to those in need
-- not use taxpayers' forced charity to lobby the government for
higher taxes, increased spending, more regulations -- and additional
money for an organization itself. Capital spreads this message
in its publications and public statements. For instance, CRC Research
Director Robert Huberty discussed the issue this summer as a panelist
during a Heritage Foundation seminar.
<P>
This was about the time Congress addressed the problem of charities
soliciting government welfare for their lobbyists. CRC President
Terry Scanlon testified before a U.S. House of Representatives
subcommittee in June about how to stop tax-exempt special interest
groups from using tax dollars to promote their own public policy
agendas. His message: break this vicious circle.
<P>
&quot;Federal agencies go to Congress asking for more money while
funding the groups that lobby for more government funding. Having
become accustomed to receiving their treasury checks, these groups
have a vested interest in the perpetuation of the status quo.
It is a vicious circle,&quot; Scanlon told the House National
Economic Growth, Natural Resources and Regulatory Affairs Subcommittee.
<P>
In August, the House passed legislation by Republican Reps. David
McIntosh (IN), Ernest J. Istook, Jr. (OK) and Robert L. Ehrlich,
Jr. (MD) that goes a long way toward restoring integrity to the
federal grant process. Using information developed in part by
CRC, House reformers won support for a law prohibiting tax-supported
charities from using any federal grants for lobbying purposes
and to make them accountable if they spend their non-federal dollars
on advocacy. The legislation provides for auditing and reporting
how grant money was used and how much advocacy is practiced. The
House approved the legislation as part of the Labor/Health and
Human Services appropriation. The Senate, which earlier passed
legislation regarding nonprofits in its lobbying reform bill,
will take up the Labor/HHS appropriation in the fall.
<P>
&quot;Nonprofit advocacy groups who rely on federal grants must
realize that government money is not necessary to amplify their
appeals for charity. Until they realize this, every organization
that criticizes the McIntosh legislation should be obligated to
disclose how much government money they accept and how much they
lobby.&quot; Scanlon said. Of course, CRC does not solicit nor
accept any government money.
<P>
<a name="scanlon"></a>
<B>A Plan for Reform</B> 
<P>
The practice of nonprofit advocacy groups lobbying for public
policy changes that benefit themselves is a vicious circle that
Congress has recognized must be broken. The scope of the problem
is broad. For instance, the American Association of Retired Persons
receives about one-quarter of its budget ($85.9 million) from
the federal government. The National Council of Senior Citizens,
a charitable lobbying group, gets 96 percent of its budget (almost
$70 million) from the federal cash cow.
<P>
CRC President Terry Scanlon testified before Congress in June
and recommended that leaders enact a four-part plan to show it
is serious about reforming the federal grant process and to preserve
the independence and integrity of the nonprofit sector. Scanlon
suggested Congress:
<OL>
<LI>Break the circle. Congress should enact legislation severely
capping the amount of non-government dollars that charities accepting
federal grants can spend on advocacy. Of course, the ideal solution
would be to bar nonprofit advocacy groups from receiving <U>any</U>
taxpayer funds.
<LI>Don't let them launder their money. The law should extend
the cap on advocacy to affiliate organizations. If Congress skips
this step, grant recipients will set up affiliates and subsidiary
organizations -- often run out of the same office -- to engage
in lobbying activities.
<LI>Let the sun shine in. Agencies should be required to provide
the public, on a regular basis, detailed information about its
grantmaking. Government officials should name and describe the
organizations that receive their grants, the size and purpose
of the grants, and what kind of lobbying a grantee has performed.
Furthermore, committee and subcommittee chairmen should require
panelists testifying at congressional hearings to reveal the amount
of taxpayer dollars their organization has received during previous
years.
<LI>Give the law sharp teeth. The law should contain an effective
enforcement mechanism that will levy steep fines on officials
who break the rules and retrieve the grant from government-funded
nonprofits that violate the advocacy restrictions. Also, groups
that break the law should be ineligible for future government
grants or contract.
</OL>

<P>
The House recently passed legislation that closely mirrors Scanlon's
recommendations. The Senate was scheduled to consider the bill
after the August recess.
<P>
<a name="advice"></a>
<B>Scanlon Advice Hits Home</B> 
<P>
Republicans hadn't held the majority for forty decades when the
tidal wave class of 1996 allowed it to take control of the 104th
Congress. Unfortunately, the party was a bit rusty when it came
to the hearing process. In many cases, members were absent, inattentive
or unprepared for hearings. Chairmen failed to invite key conservative
witnesses to testify and allowed Democrat members to interrupt
their testimony with patronizing dismissals, sarcastic rebuttals
and blatant attempts to intimidate.
<P>
CRC President Terry Scanlon, former chairman of the Consumer Product
Safety Commission under Ronald Reagan, knows what it was like
to face a well-organized congressional committee. That's why he
penned an op-ed for <I>The Washington Times</I> that advised the
new Republican chairmen to control the selection and questioning
of witnesses to present their causes in the best possible light.
<P>
After the piece appeared, Republicans made efforts to tighten
up their hearings. House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-TX) distributed
the op-ed to all committee chairmen. First-termer Rep. Bob Barr
(R-GA) passed it out at a freshman class meeting. And after the
Whitewater and Waco hearings, which were widely seen as a fumbled
opportunity for the majority, the leadership developed a two-page
primer on how to conduct hearings. When Congress returns from
the August recess they will have another opportunity to enact
the public agenda that votes supported last November.

When the Republican House began reviewing the effectiveness of
Americorps, the President's expensive and faulty attempt to invigorate
the spirit of service, they turned to Capital Research Center
for information. Rep. Christopher Shays (R-CT), House Human Resources
and Intergovernmental Relations Subcommittee chairman, invited
<I><a href="/crc/books/pcs/">Philanthropy, Culture and Society</a></I> Editor Jill Lacey to
testify at a May hearing.
<P>
Lacey gave Congress an eye-witness account of the Georgia Peach
Corps, a $2.8 million Americorps demonstration project she visited
last year. She outlined on the obviously discernible problems
of the program: the teenagers not being volunteers (they were
paid $4.25 an hour plus a $5,000 tuition grant); the grossly under-estimated
cost (the Georgia program's high drop-out rate rocketed the cost
per graduate to $35,000 a year); and the marginal value of their
projects to the community (because by law Americorps cannot displace
any government workers).
<P>
&quot;We often hear that Americorps is 'making a difference.'
But the phrase is an empty one. Everything we do makes a difference
-- even spending money foolishly makes a difference. The question
is: What kind of difference?&quot; Lacey asked the subcommittee.
<P>
The answer exposes as flawed the very premise for Americorps.
While the idea of volunteering is to help others, Lacey said,
Americorps focuses more on the volunteer -- not the populations
they purportedly serve.
<P>
&quot;Continual pulse-taking in the form of rap sessions, journaling
exercises and self evaluation sends this message loud and clear:
self esteem, not self sacrifice, is the order of the day,&quot;
Lace observed. This summer, the House zeroed out Americorps' appropriation.
<P>

<h3>CRC: GROWING BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS</h3> 
<P>
As Capital's work becomes more prominent and effective, the think
tank is called on to accomplish more and more. The result is Capital's
evolution into a more comprehensive and efficient operation.
<P>
After 11 years of steady growth, CRC's profile has risen high
enough to warrant an in-house communications department. Natasha
L. DeWees joined Capital's staff as director of communications
on May 30 to get this operation up and running. Communications
services were previously provided by Hugh C. Newton and Associates.
<P>
DeWees is former press secretary for U.S. Rep. Porter J. Goss
(R-FL). She has two degrees in journalism, including a master's
from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University
in Evanston, Ill. The communications position was funded for two
years by a donor who wishes to remain anonymous.
<P>
One major emphasis of CRC's new communications department is to
reach the enormous audience of talk radio. In June, DeWees attended
the annual convention of the National Association of Radio Talk
Show Hosts in Houston. She introduced hosts and producers to CRC's
mission and promoted the center's latest studies. The event enabled
CRC to build a network of radio contacts throughout the nation.
Capital Research associates have already been invited to speak
on radio shows around the country, most recently in Seattle, Salt
Lake City and Detroit.
<P>
<U><I>Facilities Upgrade</I></U> 
<P>
CRC's external growth has prompted comprehensive internal improvements
in our facilities, from upgraded computers to our new E.L Wiegand
conference room.
<P>
Thanks to a new computer system installed in May, CRC's staff
now has access to two new research tools: the Federal Awards Assistance
Data System (FAADS) and Nexis. Nexis is a private database of
national and international news and information on politics, business
and industry. FAADS is a federal database that documents the thousands
of groups that receive millions of taxpayer dollars through the
federal grant process. Using this information, CRC can track organizations
that might use government money to influence public policy.
<P>
Equally impressive is CRC's refurbished conference room. The room's
new paint, trim, carpet, furniture and fixtures provide a more
professional and comfortable environment for meetings and special
projects. Both the computer system and the new conference room
were made possible through the kind generosity of the E. L . Wiegand
Foundation.
<P>
<B>CRC Appoints New Patterns Editor</B> 
<P>
New to the CRC roster is <a href="/crc/about/people.html#Fulk">Austin Fulk</a>, a Little Rock native who
will serve as principal researcher and author of the ninth annual
edition of <I><a href="/crc/patterns/">Patterns in Corporate Philanthropy</a></I>. A 1992<B>
</B>graduate of John Hopkins University, Fulk has considerable
experience in the Washington policy community, serving most recently
the 104th Congress as press aide to freshman Rep. George Radanovich
(R-CA). Fulk's experience includes an internship with U.S. Rep.
Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA).
<P>
Fulk replaces Stuart Nolan, who will attend law school at the
Catholic University of America. Nolan will continue to share with
us his extensive knowledge of corporate philanthropy as a CRC
adjunct fellow.
<P>
<B>Interns Gain Big Experience</B> 
<P>
Capital Research Center was fortunate this summer to have three
dedicated student interns. Jennifer J. Waite, a political science
major at Georgetown College in Kentucky, served a six-week internship
with CRC's new communications department. We are grateful to the
Fund for American Studies which supported her internship with
us. We are equally grateful to the Charles Koch Foundation for
providing CRC with two of its Koch Fellows. Eliot Jamison, an
economics and philosophy major at Columbia, and Boris Shor, an
international affairs major at Princeton, ably assisted our research
staff in preparing our annual <I>Patterns in Corporate Philanthropy</I>
and a forthcoming book on environmental groups. Each also authored
an independent study for future CRC publications. Jamison's study
examines the effect of the proposed flat tax on charitable giving.
Shor's study explores the impact of consumer advocacy groups on
international trade issues.
<P><a name="heats"></a>
<B>CRC <a href="/crc/about/pubs.html">Publications</a> Hot Off the Presses</B> 
<P>
Capital's efforts to affect more responsible philanthropy made
dramatic headway this summer. Monthly newsletters set the tempo
for many public policy debates in the media and in Congress. We
expect these studies to become even more effective, because we
began distributing them to all conservative members of Congress.
And as always, Capital's single-subject books continue to provide
in-depth coverage of the forces influencing the nation's social
philosophy. (Already in the first seven months of 1995 our book
sales have exceeded 1994 sales.) Here are the some of the highlights
of the summer's publications.
<P>
The July <I><a href="/crc/trends/">OT</a></I> looked at the heavily politicized agenda of
an organization that ought to be a model of nonprofit community
service -- the National Trust for Historic Preservation. In recent
years, however, the organization has dramatically changed and
expanded its activities to promote political advocacy of public
policies at odds with a free society. The National Trust fights
legal and public relations battles against commercial expansion
that creates jobs and builds the tax base for local communities.
And it does this with the help of taxpayer dollars. In an unprecedented
challenge to the Trust's appropriation of federal funds (which
accounts for 20 percent of its $33 million budget), the House
this summer voted to phase-out funding for the trust over two
years.
<P>
Professor James T. Bennett continued his expos&eacute; of the
American Cancer Society in the July <I><a href="/crc/ap/">Alternatives</a></I>. The report
revealed how ACS utilizes federal funds to lobby for higher taxes
on tobacco, rather than educate smokers about health risks. The
report also related financial mismanagement by the society's state
officials. Weeks after this newsletter hit the streets, several
of the officials spotlighted by <I>Alternatives</I> were reassigned,
and another was arrested for forgery.
<P>
Last spring CRC released <I><a href="/crc/books/neighbor.html">The Rise of the Nanny State</a></I>, visiting
fellow Tom Holt's history of the consumer movement. The report
is a startling account of how Ralph Nader's organizations form
an iron triangle with trial lawyers and federal agency bureaucrats
to put a choke-hold on consumer choice and individual responsibility.
Holt shows how this relationship has turned America into a &quot;nanny
state.&quot; The author appeared on many talk shows to discuss
how the federal government interferes with Americans' lives, and
he often debated representatives of the consumerists movement
that he profiled. During one memorable appearance, Holt coaxed
a US PIRG representative to agree that it is a good idea to make
public the financial relationships among these three groups.
<P>
Clinton administration officials at the U.S. Information Agency
(USIA) carefully read CRC's report on the federal government's
academic exchange program, <I><a href="/crc/books/fulbrit.html">The Fulbright Program After 50 years.</a></I>
Facing intense pressure from congressional budget-cutters, USIA
officials convened several formal meetings to discuss what they
called &quot;The Gayner Report,&quot; CRC author Jeffrey Gayner's
recommendations for reduced U.S. funding and increased private
and foreign support for the student and scholar exchange program.
The death of former Arkansas Sen. J. William Fulbright one week
before the report was released also heightened interest in the
study.
<P>
Finally, the business community sat up and took notice of <I>Patterns
VIII</I> after House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-TX) wrote CEOs
of the Forbes 250 companies we study and questioned whether their
corporate giving was indeed pro-business. The side effects of
the Leader's much-publicized letter generated a remarkable amount
of publicity and howls of protest from Ralph Nader, <I>The Washington
Post</I>, Hillary Clinton and liberal members of Congress. We
knew we had hit our target! Since then there has been an increase
in cooperation from corporations releasing their giving information
to us. Several of the companies and advocacy groups have even
asked CRC how they can reform their giving practices and improve
their rating. American Airlines and the Nature Conservancy are
among those who have contacted CRC.
<P>
<a name="lagacy"></a>
<B>Provide a Legacy for Enlightened Giving</B> 
<P>
One of Capital Research Center's best selling books, <I><a href="/crc/books/pdi.html">The Great
Philanthropists and the Problem of Donor Intent</a>
</I>, studies how
the last wishes of yesterday's great philanthropists are less
and less a factor in the giving philosophy of their foundations
today. Careful estate planning, however, can ensure that a donor's
intentions will be honored.
<P>
By carefully thinking through giving objectives, pre-determined
gifts to groups like CRC can benefit donors as much as the beneficiary.
Such a gift to Capital accomplishes several worthwhile objectives.
Not only does it ensure that your bequest will be used as you
wish, but it provides resources enabling Capital to promote informed
giving practices; educate policy makers and opinion leaders about
nonprofit advocacy groups; and highlight the real achievements
of individual charity and the liabilities of much professional
philanthropy. Further, such a gift reduces your estate tax burden
by providing a charitable deduction equal to the value of the
bequest at the time of your death.
<P>
<I>Types of Bequests</I> 
<P>
Bequests are provision made in your will or living trusts that
specifically set forth the portion or actual dollar amount that
you wish transferred to a charity after death.
<P>
A <B>general bequest</B> is a gift that is payable from the general
assets of your estate. The usual general bequest directs that
a certain sum of money be paid to Capital Research Center.
<P>
A <B>specific bequest</B> gives a particular item or real or personal
property to CRC. For example, &quot;I direct that 5,000 shares
of XYZ Corporation stock be transferred to Capital Research Center.&quot;
<P>
A <B>residuary bequest</B> provides CRC with the remainder of
your estate after all of your debts, expenses and taxes have been
paid and all general and specific bequests satisfied. For example,
&quot;I direct that all (or a specific percent) of the rest, residue
and remainder of my estate be given to Capital Research Center.&quot;
<P>
A <B>contingent bequest</B> makes CRC a beneficiary of you estate
only when designated beneficiaries fail to survive you. For example,
&quot;If any of the above-named beneficiaries should predecease
me or no longer exist, I direct that the share of the beneficiary
be transferred to Capital Research Center.&quot;
<P>
A <B>bequest by codicil</B> allows people who have completed their
will to make a bequest to CRC without rewriting the entire will.
For example, &quot;I, (your name), a resident of (your address),
make this codicil to my last will and testament executed by me
on (date). I hereby modify and amend my last will and testament
as follows: (enter a type of bequest as suggested above). Except
as my last will and testament is expressly modified or amended
by the codicil, I ratify and reaffirm my last will and testament
in its entirety.&quot; This codicil then must be signed by you
and witnessed in accordance with the laws of your state.
<P>
These are just a few of the possible choices available to individuals
who want to continue to help causes they believe worthy. All of
the above examples and suggested language are provided by CRC
for informational purposes only. But you can learn more by contacting
Capital's Director of Development Julie Taylor at 202-393-2600.

<h2>The American Cancer Society</h2>
<p>
<h3>Feeding at the Tax Trough</h3>
<p>
<b>By Dr. James T. Bennett</b>
<p>
In recent years, the American Cancer Society (ACS) has become increasingly active in politics.  Some of its state-level affiliates have lobbied for increases in state tobacco taxes, only to have the new tax revenues earmarked to themselves and their political allies.  This has clearly detracted from the ACS's mission of providing services to cancer victims.  Donors to the ACS must ask themselves why they should continue to support an organization that is increasingly political and funded by tax dollars.
This article examines how ACS state divisions in Massachusetts and Arizona have sought and received government funds.
<p>
<h3>ACS's Old Policy:<br>
No Tax Dollars</h3>
For almost 20 years, the American Cancer Society (ACS), as a matter of policy, refused government support.  Although the ACS had sought and obtained federal funds in the past, on November 11, 1978, ACS's Board of Directors adopted a resolution known as Financial Policy 19:
<ul>
<li>"RESOLVED: that acceptance of federal, state, or local governmental funds by the American Cancer Society directly or indirectly be discontinued as soon as practicable;
<li>FURTHER RESOLVED: that to accomplish the above, the following course of action be taken:
<li>1. No new tax-funded program is to be authorized.
<li>2. Divisions [of ACS] that can withdraw from existing arrangements without severe repercussions should do so as soon as feasible.
<li>3. Where Divisions have contractual or strong obligations to continue joint programs, they may continue to do so but should look for ways to phase out such arrangements gradually.  No obligation should exceed five years.
<li>4. Co-sponsorship of activities may continue provided it does not require the Society to accept federal, state or local governmental funds."1
</ul>
The reasons for this ironclad prohibition were explained by Lane Adams, ACS's executive vice president, in the ACS's annual report the following year: "Freely contributed dollars are simply not the same as tax dollars.  The need to win public support every year, year after year, imposes an important discipline on the Societya need to keep the public informed and involved.  It's a myth that government programs are the heavy artillery in social improvement because they're often more generously financed."2
After adopting Financial Policy 19, the ACS repeatedly emphasized its stance.  For instance, in the book, Crusade: The Official History of the American Cancer Society, published in 1987, author Walter Ross stated that "The Society is supported entirely by private donations. . . .  The Society accepts no money from federal, state, or local government.  Nor does it participate in jointly funded research or other activities with any government agency."  Ross claimed that because ACS fundraising was conducted by volunteers and "contributions are generally small, averaging about $10 . . . , this extraordinarily broad base of support frees the ACS of obligation to any individual, group, or foundation."3
Both Adams and Ross were correct to note that private donations are inherently different from taxpayer funds.  Government money inevitably carries restrictions on its use.  Moreover, reliance on tax dollars requires a charity to be involved in the political arenaan activity that necessarily detracts from its charitable mission.  And unlike private contributions, the quest for tax dollars does not require a charity to convince the public that its activities are worthy of support.
The ACS's policy against accepting taxpayer funds was commendable.  Unfortunately, that policy turned out to be expendable.
<p>
<h3>ACS's New Policy:<br>
"If You Can't Beat 'Em, Join 'Em"</h3>
During the 1980s, two events made ACS officials reconsider the ban on accepting tax money:
<ul>
<li>Through intense political advocacy, the AIDS lobby was able to obtain hundreds of millions of dollars from the government to assist AIDS victims and educate the public about AIDS.  Despite IRS regulations that limit nonprofit lobbying, the AIDS lobby's advocacy was largely ignored.  Other old-line health charities, most notably the American Lung Association, also became highly proficient at obtaining government funds without losing tax-exempt status.  (See Dr. James T. Bennett, "Health Charity Lobbying: Imitating the AIDS Movement," Alternatives in Philanthropy, December 1994.)4
<li>Second, and more importantly, rising competition among health charities for increased funding dramatically lowered the rate of growth in contributions to the ACS.  During most of the 1980s, the ACS saw double-digit percentage increases in its yearly income.  But in 1990, the ACS raised only 2.8 percent more than in 1989, causing considerable concern among ACS executives.5  If private contributions could not keep pace with rising expectations, the ACS would have to follow other health charities and feed at the tax trough.
</ul>
In 1993, a decision was effectively made to quietly abandon Financial Policy 19.  This is apparent in ACS president Reginald Ho's 1993 report to the board of directors: "One of the barriers to growth and health in the Society has been flat fund raising. . . .  A situation has arisen in certain states, namely, California and Massachusetts, in which a high excise tax on tobacco was lobbied for by the American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association, and the American Heart Association jointly.  The tax was passed, and millions of dollars were released. . . .  The Lung Association and the Heart Association competed for these programs.  However, the ACS Division was not allowed to compete for funds. . . .  New sources of funds are becoming available which did not exist in the 1970s.  Perhaps it is time for a paradigm change in this area of policy."6
Indeed, the ACS's Executive Committee had already taken up the issue of abandoning Financial Policy 19 so that state and local tax funds could be accepted: "The Society recognizes that state and local health departments are sources of indirect funding through privately operated programs and will look with greater favor on the acceptance of funding through these programs, with the flexibility and discretion they offer, than on the acceptance of direct government funding" (emphasis added).7  In other words, nonprofit intermediaries could channel state and local tax dollars to the ACS so that the organization could still publicly proclaim that it did not accept government funds while discreetly doing so.
<p>
<h3>Massachusetts' Question 1 Referendum</h3>
In 1992, anti-smoking activists in Massachusetts succeeded in raising state cigarette taxes through a referendum called Question 1.  A 25 cents-per-pack tax increase took effect on January 1, 1993.  Proponents expected the tax to generate about $176,000,000 annually in revenues, $80,000,000 dollars of which would be earmarked for anti-smoking programs run by government agencies and nonprofit organizations.  In addition, $17,900,000 would support a media campaign and millions more would be distributed to local health departments that would award grants and contracts to anti-smoking groups.
The Massachusetts referendum closely mirrored a tobacco-tax initiative in Colorado, described in detail in "The National Cancer Institute and Colorado's Project ASSIST" (Dr. James T. Bennett, Alternatives in Philanthropy, February 1996).  Candace Pierce-Lavin, an ACS-Massachusetts employee, helped spearhead the referendum under the auspices of a front group called the Massachusetts Coalition for a Healthy Future.  According to the Boston Globe, "Candace Pierce-Lavin . . . said [that] her group of 200 or more health and professional associations will keep the pressure on Beacon Hill [the Massachusetts legislature] to make sure the funds are spent as proposed in the petition [i.e., given to anti-smoking groups].  'The coalition will stay together after the campaign and aggressively lobby the legislature,' Pierce-Lavin said."8
The Massachusetts Department of Health was charged with awarding grants and contracts to anti-smoking groups.  The Boston Globe described Dr. Gregory Connolly, a state health department official who helped organize the referendum, as a "strident antismoking activist:" "Connolly and his associates at the Department of Health have brought aboard many of the individuals and institutions that helped them pass the referendum" by making "grants for dozens of projects intended to batter smokers into submission. . . ."9
<p>
<h3>ACS-Massachusetts' "Quitline":<br>
Make-Work for Anti-Smoking Activists</h3>
One such grant, in the amount of $800,000, was given to ACS-Massachusetts to operate a smoking "Quitline."10  A copy of the grant, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, shows the Quitline to be a bloated bureaucracy.  The contract calls for three telephone "counselors," each paid $26,000 per year,who offer advice to smokers.  Assisting them are two "screeners/data entry" personnel, each paid $20,000, to screen callers and record demographic data.
But in addition to these five, the grant also calls for the following:
<ul>
<li>Program Manager at $55,000;
<li>Program Director at $43,500;
<li>Supervisor at $33,800;
<li>Promotion Coordinator at $28,000;
<li>Assistant Program Director at $25,000;
<li>Data Manager at $28,000;
<li>Office Manager at $22,000;
<li>Administrative Assistant at $22,000;
<li>Secretary/Receptionist at $18,000;
<li>Finance Coordinator/Payroll employee at $22,000.
</ul>
In addition, 12 percent is added for payroll taxes and another 13 percent for fringe benefits.  More telling, however, are those slated for the positions.  According to the contract, the Program Manager position "will be carried out by Candace Pierce-Lavin, ACS' Director of Tobacco Control and Government Affairs.  Ms. Pierce-Lavin has been with ACS since 1982, has played a leadership role in the coalition that secured passage of the Question 1 Referendum, and is extremely knowledgeable about tobacco control and smoking cessation issues."  But Ms. Pierce-Lavin's only "qualification" appears to be that she "recently conducted a site visit to the California Quitline, where she consulted at length with the Director, and with key staff members, and observed the Quitline in operation."
The contract also specifies that Karen Zweig, J.D., fill the Program Director position.  Ms. Zweig's credentials include "building inter-agency collaborations" (i.e., forming political coalitions) and "[visiting] the California Quitline to learn about their [sic] operation."
Obviously, the Quitline is a "make-work" project for ACS employees and anti-smoking activists.  Considering the hundreds of millions of dollars that federal, state, and local governmentsas well as private sourcesalready spend on anti-smoking programs each year, the Quitline is redundant.  And given the severity of the nation's cancer epidemic, surely more effective uses for $800,000 could be found, such as free mammograms for low-income women.11
<p>
<h3>Arizona's Tobacco Tax Initiatives</h3>
In 1994, the head of ACS-Arizona, Matt Madonna, organized a coalition to collect petition signatures to place a cigarette tax increase, known as Proposition 200, on the state ballot.  ACS-Arizona contributed $24,000 to the initiative, which voters passed in November.  As in California, the increased revenues, estimated at about $90,000,000 annually, were partly earmarked for groups such as ACS-Arizona.  The Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) was charged with distributing grants and contracts to nonprofit groups for educational and research purposes.12
Since ACS-Arizona and the ADHS worked together to pass the cigarette tax increase, their continuing collaboration is not surprising.  What is surprising is how closely the two operate.
<p>
<h3>ACS-Arizona:<br>
Fundraising with Tax Dollars</h3>
A January 30, 1996 "Memorandum of Understanding" between ACS-Arizona and the ADHS discloses how ACS-Arizona obtains taxpayer support.13  Ostensibly, ACS-Arizona and ADHS operate a joint project, officially administered by ADHS, called the "Women's Cancer Control Project."14  But the memorandum specifies "five core areas" of concern for ACS-Arizona that go far beyond the control of women's cancer.  These are: "Breast Cancer, Tobacco Use Reduction, Fundraising, Resources and Information, and Volunteer Involvement."  To support ACS-Arizona in these areas, ADHS's Women's Cancer Control Project has "[designated] an ADHS staff person to participate in activities of the ACS, including . . . fundraising efforts [and] other areas agreeable to both parties" (emphasis added).
Why should a state agency assign a tax-paid employee to assist in ACS-Arizona's fundraising?  Moreover, the memorandum specifies that "The ADHS will promote reciprocal assistance from local ADHS funded agencies to their ACS Regional offices in volunteer recruitment and ACS fundraising as feasible and appropriate" (emphasis added).
At issue is whether the government should give preferential treatment to one nonprofit organization over others that address health and other problems.  More fundamentally, should the government use taxpayers' money to raise money and recruit volunteers for a nonprofit?
<p>
<h3>ACS-Arizona:<br>
A Poor Steward of Donations</h3>
There is ample evidence that ACS-Arizona is a poor steward of the donations it receives.  A January 1995 expos on ACS-Arizona by John Dougherty, an investigative reporter at the Phoenix New Times, found that the organization spent $3,600,000 in 1994 on its own internal operations but only $47,000 on direct services for cancer victims.  According to Dougherty, between 1988 and 1994, total expenses at ACS-Arizona grew by 10 percent; salaries rose by 25 percent; and overhead costs increased by 7 percent.  But spending on direct services for cancer victims declined by 51 percent.15
Dougherty also revealed that anti-smoking advocates in Arizona, as in Massachusetts and California, lobbied against measures in the state legislature to redirect the new cigarette tax revenues away from their own coffers: "A battle has already erupted in the Arizona legislature over the spending formula, with some Republican leaders trying to have all the money placed into the general fund.  ACS-Arizona and other groups who supported the legislation have hired lobbyists to keep the money from being reallocated. . . .  There is no doubt that ACS-Arizona intends to fight to keep the current distribution of tobacco tax dollars as is.  'We will do whatever we can to make sure the funds . . . are used where they are supposed to go,' [ACS-Arizona's Matt] Madonna says."16

<h3>Should Donors Support the ACS?</h3>
The American Cancer Society has abandoned its long-standing prohibition against accepting taxpayer support.  By campaigning to raise state cigarette taxes and lobbying to earmark the new revenues to itself, it has found a way to revive its sagging financial fortunes.
By accepting tax money, the ACS is undermining the rationale for its own existenceindeed, the rationale for all charities: they do what neither government nor the profit-making private sector can or will do.  But if the ACS already receives taxpayer support, why should contributors give generously to it?

<B>Introduction by Julie M. Taylor</B>
<DD><I>Today, women control 60 percent of the wealth in the United States.  Yet research has found that women donors 
have traditionally shown less interest than men in supporting national nonprofit organizations that promote changes in 
public policy.  With a growing number of women in the workforce as business owners, entrepreneurs, and executives, women 
are increasingly positioned to affect public policy through their charitable giving.
<DD>This issue features articles by four women who serve in key positions at private foundations: Ethelmae 
Humphreys, Chairman of the Board and CEO of the Humphreys Foundations; Heather R. Higgins, Director of The 
Randolph Foundation; Sue Anschutz-Rodgers, President and Executive Director of the Anschutz Family Foundation; and 
Kristen A. Avansino, President and Executive Director of the E.L. Wiegand Foundation.  We asked them to discuss why 
their foundations support public-policy organizations and initiatives.  Specifically, we asked:
<UL>
<LI>With so many competing needs for foundation support, why does your foundation award grants to 
public-policy organizations?
<LI>How do these grants help your foundation fulfill its mission?
<LI>If your foundation supports direct-service charities, how does this relate to your public-policy giving?
<LI>What factors cause you to reject public-policy grant proposals?
<LI>What issues do you believe public-policy groups have not sufficiently addressed?
</UL>

<BR>Chairman of the Board and CEO
<BR>The Humphreys Foundations</B>
<P>
<DD>The several foundations created by the Humphreys 
family have as a key part of their mission the demonstration 
of the superiority of a voluntary society over a political 
society.  Over 60 percent of our funding goes to 
market-oriented public-policy groups that are helping to promote a 
society of free and responsible individuals.
<DD>We have for many years supported the Foundation 
for Economic Education, which publishes the monthly 
journal <I>The Freeman</I>.  Other major recipients are the 
market-liberal Cato Institute, the Institute for Humane Studies, 
and the Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation.  We are 
also a major supporter of the National Right to Work 
Legal Defense Foundation.  We believe each of these is 
doing important yet unique work to promote a free society.
<DD>Other public-policy grant recipients include the 
Acton Institute for the Study of Religion and Liberty, 
Advocates for Self-Government, the Center for Independent 
Thought, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, Consumer Alert, 
the Critical Review Foundation, the Discussion Club, 
Families Against Mandatory Minimums, the Free 
Enterprise Institute's debate project, the Federalist Society, the 
Future of Freedom Foundation, the Heartland Institute, the 
Institute for Justice, the Institute for Policy Innovation's 
tax action analysis, the Landmark Legal Foundation, the 
National Endowment for Liberty, New York 
University's Austrian Economics program, the Reason Foundation, 
the Social Philosophy and Policy Center, the U.S. Term 
Limits Foundation and, of course, the Capital Research 
Center, which provides valuable insight into philanthropic activity.
<DD>We support some direct-service charities (mostly 
local), but only those that do not receive funding from 
government tax revenues.  That is the first stipulation of all our giving. 
 Most of this giving is done anonymously.  Recipients 
are generally charities that serve young people and 
families, from scouting and &quot;Y&quot;-type organizations to direct 
assistance to a young quadriplegic who inspires young people 
to take responsibility for themselves.  Each year we 
also provide local elementary school children with 
educational materials about the effects of smoking.
<DD>Over the years, we have supported a few 
direct-service groups that we later discovered were accepting 
government money.  When we learned that the local theater group 
had accepted funds from a state agency, we turned down 
support for its expansion project.  At our urging, the 
theater board changed its bylaws to exclude government funding. 
 But in many cases, we've had to cut off support.  We 
gave to the local Girl Scouts until we learned it was 
accepting volunteer services from a tax-supported agency.  We 
had also supported with a sizable gift the local biennial 
international piano competition until I saw in the newspaper that 
it had received a grant from a state arts agency.
<HR>
<blockquote>I think those who favor a free society have spoken very convincingly 
on economic issues.  But we haven't paid enough attention to social 
issues such as welfare and poverty.</blockquote><HR>
<BR>
While we support very few bricks-and-mortar 
projects, we do not exclude them out-of-hand if they meet 
our general funding criteria.  We supported construction of 
the new Cato Institute building in Washington, D.C.  We 
are also supporting construction of a community center 
building in a small town where one of our businesses is located.
<DD>We generally reject public-policy grant proposals 
that don't seem timely or relevant to today's key issues.  But 
we try to help any organization that has a good business 
plan for promoting a worthwhile project.  It's interesting 
to watch new groups spring up in response to the 
changing constellation of public-policy concerns.  Our funding 
priorities have changed somewhat to accommodate 
these changes.
<DD>In public policy, I think those who favor a free 
society have spoken very convincingly on economic issues.  But 
we haven't paid enough attention to social issues such 
as welfare and poverty.  This is partly a shortcoming 
of academia in not researching this area sufficiently and in 
not communicating its findings to public-policy groups that 
can influence the media and public.  Ideally, the needy 
should be helped through private charity.  But do we have 
enough rigorous research to convince Americans that this is 
possible?
<P><a name="hea">
<B>Heather R. Higgins
<BR>Director
<BR>The Randolph Foundation</B>
<P>
<DD>Public-policy grantmaking is not a traditional area 
of charitable giving, in large measure because 
historically such efforts, having no defined beneficiary, would not 
have legally qualified as charitable.  But as times have 
changed such giving has come to be viewed as a proper domain 
of philanthropy, just as in roughly the same period our 
understanding of government has generally changed to 
encompass a much broader view of its proper tasks.  In 
contrast, &quot;government&quot; used to be a word that was always 
modified, as in &quot;federal government,&quot; &quot;family government,&quot; 
&quot;church government,&quot; or &quot;school government,&quot; because 
different spheres of life were thought to be best governed at 
different levels and in different ways.
<DD>If the primary purpose of philanthropy is to alleviate 
the sufferings of mankind and to do what we can to improve 
life on earth, then it is important not only to directly 
assist individuals but to help create conditions which will 
help them to help themselves.  This is the purpose of 
public-policy grantmakinga purpose that should be of 
equal interest to citizens of both sexes.  Much of the 
original impetus for such grantmaking came from those who felt 
that government should and could solve our problems.  In 
fact, most public-policy advocacy and lobbying by charities 
is based on that assumption.
<DD>In recent years, however, a contingent of 
grantmakers has become convinced that well-meaning but 
misguided attempts by government to remedy problems it has not 
fully <HR>
<blockquote>
Public policy itself has not only come to affect whole new spheres of 
daily life but has often done so in ignorance. . . .  Unless those errors 
are corrected, in the long run all the direct charity in the world will not 
keep our society whole.<HR>
</blockquote>
<BR>
understood has caused more harm than good, and that 
to remove government-created obstacles to effective 
charity is the first obligation of citizens who wish to improve 
the human condition.  Public-policy grantmaking, done 
properly, is an application of the Confucian maxim that if 
you give a hungry man a fish he will be hungry again 
tomorrow, but if you teach him to fish he will be fed for life.
<DD>That leveraging principle is important to The 
Randolph Foundation's grantmaking, particularly since we are a 
small grantmaker.  In almost all our public-policy 
grantmaking we seek to encourage those attitudes and principles 
which lead to the right and necessary conduct of our citizens.  
We believe that good work has been and is being done in 
the realms of economic and regulatory policy, and that the 
area which currently needs our attention is the cultural 
underpinnings of free and democratic societies.
<DD>Though public policy is our primary area of focus, we 
do occasionally support direct-service organizations.  
When we do so it is generally because their work is 
extraordinary, and we lend support to help them &quot;franchise&quot; their ideas.  
A more likely approach for us, however, is to support 
work that can be used by a variety of local service providers 
to make their own efforts more effective.
<DD>In our view, public-policy grantmaking is 
particularly important at this time, because public policy itself has 
not only come to affect whole new spheres of daily life but 
has often done so in ignorance and in violation of those 
central principles of human nature and natural law which are 
the cornerstones of our society.  Unless those errors are 
corrected, in the long run all the direct charity in the world 
will not keep our society whole.
<P><a name="sue">
<B>Sue Anschutz-Rodgers
<BR>President and Executive Director
<BR>The Anschutz Family Foundation</B>
<P>
<DD>Although the Anschutz Family Foundation focuses 
primarily on community organizations, we do make 
some grants to public-policy organizations.  We recognize 
that public policy affords us the opportunity to invest at 
the &quot;macro&quot; level.  The interplay between business, 
government, and the nonprofit sector can be best addressed through philanthropic contributions to public policy.
<DD>Our foundation's goal is to promote individual 
self-sufficiency and traditional values.  Over the past 
four decades, government has grown to become the 
principle provider of human, educational, and health services.  
We believe that the best delivery of these necessities is 
through families, churches, and organizations at the 
community level.  Government as a primary resource provider has 
too often caused a retraction of the vital roles of 
voluntary institutions.  Further, charitable investments bring a 
much greater return if directed through community-based 
organizations instead of through government.
<DD>However, we are challenged to understand how 
devolution will affect services to those who are truly in need.  
We believe that no greater resource exists than that of 
the collective capacity of our citizens to serve their 
communities.  But our convictions for limited government, a 
thriving free-market economy, and a compassionate and civil 
society require a successful balance of interests.  
Recognizing historical imbalances, businesses must become more 
responsible.
<DD>Public-policy investments allow us to keep a 
larger perspective.  Americans living in the West often 
decry Washington as myopic, which in some cases is true.  
But state and local governments have also expanded
their domains, and must be reckoned with.  With our focus on 
the community level, it is often difficult to keep abreast 
of national and state issues.  Our support of public 
policy keeps us alerted to legislative, executive, and 
judicial actions at all levels of government.
<DD>What causes foundations to hesitate about investing 
in efforts to affect public policy?  Generally, it is due to 
other questions that arise when contemplating such grants: 
How many think tanks are really necessary?  How many 
high-priced speakers are needed to tour college campuses?  
How many Washington-based public-policy groups rely on 
glossy proposals with no substantiating documentation on 
requested funding or expected results?  How many 
groups champion causes beyond objectivity and common sense?
<DD>Sometimes our being so far from Washington helps 
to filter out the noise.  The question all of us must 
ask ourselves is how do we better assist individual citizens 
as they go about their daily liveslives based on work, 
family, and community?  We believe in the importance 
of public policy, whether it serves to check the growth 
of government or to stimulate debate and discourse.
<P><a name="kri">
<B>Kristen A. Avansino
<BR>President and Executive Director
<BR>The E.L. Wiegand Foundation</B>
<P>
<DD>Contemporary philosophers, politicians, and 
philanthropists are plagued by the poignant questions, &quot;Where are 
we going?  How will we get there?&quot;  Too often, they 
are beguiled by the parlance of the 
day&quot;beyond postmodernism,&quot; &quot;spiritual acedia,&quot; &quot;quantum 
physics,&quot; &quot;social capital,&quot; &quot;devolution revolution,&quot; &quot;cybertots.&quot;  
As the millennium closes, prophetic cynicism often prevails.
<DD>In contrast, at the E.L. Wiegand Foundation, 
the poignant words of James Joyce resonate: &quot;The now, 
the here, through which all future plunges to the past.&quot;  The Foundation is the living legacy and embodiment of 
our benefactor, Edwin L. Wiegand.  As President and 
Executive Director, I view the Foundation's expedition 
through his enduring eyes.  His life-vision embraced a reverence 
for the sacred, for democracy, for free-market principles, 
and an adherence to the work ethic.
<DD>In 1996, this oracle's prescience remains constant.  
Public-affairs grants, one of the five areas that comprise 
the Foundation's mission, exemplify the heightened use of 
our Benefactor's Litmus Test.  Components of the test 
include fiscal responsibility, synergy of mission, project 
uniqueness, geographic parameters, administrative utility, 
societal impact, accountability, other funding sources, 
and board composition.
<DD>Historically, our Foundation's public-affairs grants 
have reflected a strict adherence to E.L. Wiegand's 
principles, and in recent years these grants have totaled nine percent 
of our philanthropic effort.  The average number of 
grants reviewed has decreased while the representative 
grant awarded has increased.  Geographic preference has 
shifted from Washington, D.C. to the West, with special 
preference assigned to small, exemplary, less-institutional 
organizations.  Since 1993, we have awarded occasional 
multi-year grants and have given special consideration to 
projects supporting the emerging democracies in Eastern and 
Central Europe.  Increasingly, the Foundation 
receives unsolicited letters of inquiry, though we currently elect 
to initiate more proposals for Trustee review.
<DD>The preservation of donor intent is serious business.  
As President, I strive to achieve the magical coalescence 
of dreams and due diligence.  Winston Churchill once 
said that &quot;money melts.&quot;  However, the Wiegand 
professional motto is &quot;money melds&quot; with endeavors that are worthy 
in the eyes of our beloved benefactor.<BR>

<h2><B><FONT SIZE=4>Welfare Reform in the States: Part II<BR>
</FONT></B></h2>
<p>

<i> This month we conclude our survey of state-level welfare reform
with articles by analysts from ten state think tanks.</i>

<a href="#ala">Alabama: Lessons from a School that Works</a><p>
 Sally C. Pipes and Katherine Post, president and policy fellow,
respectively, of the San Francisco-based Pacific Research Institute,
applaud a major welfare reform plan for California and highlight
two charities that offer effective alternatives to state welfare
programs.  By contrast, Joseph Bast, president of the Heartland
Institute in Palatine, Illinois, criticizes recent reforms, noting
that political leaders in Illinois seem uninterested in fundamental
change.
<P>
 Amy Frantz, research director at the Public Interest Institute
in Mount Pleasant, Iowa, and Peter S. Barwick, research associate
at the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania-based Commonwealth Foundation,
emphasize the importance of work requirements for welfare recipients.
 Barwick addresses three criticism often made against work-based
welfare reform while Frantz notes that nonprofit organizations
may help Iowa's needy through newly created Individual Development
Accounts.  This is also a feature of South Carolina's reform package,
discussed by Mike Hubbard, Senior Policy Analyst at the South
Carolina Policy Council Education Foundation in Columbia.
<P>
 Kelly McCutchen, executive director of the Atlanta-based Georgia
Public Policy Foundation, discusses recent reforms and notes the
importance of building public support for changes in Georgia's
welfare policy.  The significance of obtaining federal waivers
to achieve change in Ohio's welfare system is emphasized by Samuel
R. Staley and Douglas Hyne, vice president for research and research
assistant, respectively, of the Buckeye Institute for Public Policy
Solutions in Dayton.  John Hood, president of the Raleigh-based
John Locke Foundation, warns that Medicaid, the nation's most
expensive welfare program, must be overhauled before its costs
overwhelm both federal and state budgets.
<P>
 Finally, effective private alternatives to government welfare
programs are highlighted on pages 4 and 5.  Writing for the Reno-based
Nevada Policy Research Institute, State Senator Maurice E. Washington
describes three faith-based organizations that are helping the
needy achieve self-sufficiency.  Gary Palmer, executive director
of the Birmingham-based Alabama Family Alliance, discusses a Christian
elementary school that can serve as a model for private efforts
to prevent welfare dependency.
<P>
<B><a name="cali">California:</a></B>
<P>
<B>A Promising Reform Plan</B>
<P>
<B>by Sally C. Pipes and Katherine Post</B>
<P>
 Perhaps no other issue in California is as pressing as welfare
reform.  In 1995, approximately 2.7 million (one in twelve) Californians
were on AFDC.  Californians account for 12 percent of the nation's
taxpayers, but support 17 percent of the national AFDC caseload.
 Worse, California's payment of high AFDC benefits--the fourth
highest in the country and the highest among the ten most populous
states--accounts for more than a quarter of the nation's welfare
expenditures.  Finally, and perhaps most damning, an astounding
60 percent of adult (over 18) AFDC recipients in California have
been on welfare longer than two years.  As Governor Pete Wilson
has said, welfare should be a safety net, not a hammock.
<P>
 Debate over welfare reform in California begins in earnest this
spring.  In January, California's Department of Social Services
issued a proposal for redesigning the state's welfare system.
 Devised by Director of Social Services Eloise Anderson and endorsed
by the governor, it is the most promising welfare reform plan
in recent state history.  However, it relies on the President
signing into law block grant legislation to end the fundamentally
flawed federal welfare system.
<P>
 Ms. Anderson notes that the single most important element of
reform is a reduction in welfare payments.  To a large extent,
California's history of high AFDC benefits is responsible for
the entrenched cycle of poverty that many now decry.  The Governor's
reform package would introduce a &quot;flat grant&quot; to replace
the current system of sliding benefits.  This would have four
main elements:
<P>
<ul>
 <li>Benefit levels would be lowered and one standard payment set,
based on equity for lowincome families.  Welfare would not pay
more than work.
<P>
 <li>The grant would be flat, i.e., not adjusted for any increase
in the number of adults or children in the household.  It would
thus restore the principle of personal responsibility and establish
fairness, since working families do not receive wage increases
when they have more children.
<P>
 <li>Eligibility would be timelimited, encouraging recipients to
view welfare as a temporary handup rather than as a career path.
<P>
 <li>The grant would eliminate eligibility requirements that make
aid available only when one parent is deceased, disabled, missing,
or unemployed.  Eligibility would instead be based on a simple
income and asset test, as well as on the presence of a child under
18 years of age.  This would hopefully restore the state's endorsement
of the traditional two-parent family.
</ul>
<P>
 A second key component of the governor's plan is a set of four
programs designed to move recipients from welfare into the labor
force.  Two of these seek to move families toward independence
as quickly as possible.  One sets a twoyear limit on aid, and
the other, for persons with little or no previous job history,
sets a fiveyear limit but provides noncash benefits such as vouchers.
 The other two programs address the needs of those who face the
greatest barriers to independence.  One, for families with a disabled
child or parent, provides aid for the duration of the disability.
 The other provides unlimited assistance for children living with
relatives in lieu of foster care, but puts a twoyear limit on
aid for parents who are themselves ineligible for aid.
<P>
 While these proposals sound promising, California's welfare record
is far from outstanding.  The state has been fundamentally unable
to respond to the particularities of individual cases.  Herein
lies an opportunity for philanthropic alternatives.  Pacific Research
Institute's 1995 privatization competition, titled &quot;Beyond
the Welfare State: Celebrating Private Initiative in Social Services,&quot;
examined social-service programs that receive less than 25 percent
of their funding from government.  We found programs throughout
California that were meeting human needs in meaningful ways without
relying on the state for funds or oversight.  Two programs in
particular stood out:
<P><ul>
 <li>Chrysalis: Jobs for L.A.'s Homeless, is a nonprofit group in
Los Angeles that helps the homeless become economically selfsufficient
through steady jobs.  Its mission states that &quot;Chrysalis
doesn't give people jobs.  We teach them how to find jobs themselves,
by providing intensive classroom instruction and the simple resources
they need to find work.&quot;  Resources include resume assistance,
personal-case managers, bus fare to interviews, a mail and message
center, a set of interview clothes, and food and hygiene items.
 By the end of 1995, Chrysalis had helped almost 3,000 homeless
people find fulltime jobs in the private sector.  It did so with
no government funding.
<P>
 <li>The Redwood Gospel Mission, a 30-year-old faith-based organization
located in a small town in Northern California, likewise shares
a commitment to the ideals of personal responsibility and selfsufficiency.
 It is the only 24hour, fullservice shelter and recovery facility
in a fourcounty area, providing 6,116 hot meals and 2,256 beds
in a typical month.  With the aim of &quot;teach[ing] men how
to fish,&quot; it offers both practical and spiritual support.
 Its tough-love approach has a proven record of moving residents
into society as productive, independent adults.  Like Chrysalis,
it neither accepts nor solicits government money.
</ul><P>
 Welfare reform in California must be a partnership between public
and private assistance, with the common goal of restoring personal
responsibility and selfsufficiency.  This is not simply an economic
necessity, but a social imperative.  The governor's plan offers
dramatic steps to reform welfare, but we must emphasize the importance
of private efforts that are successfully addressing the critical
and massive problem of repairing the damage done by the welfare
state.  Private programs offer powerful, individual-oriented approaches
that no government initiative can match.

<B>Behind the Curve</B>
<P>
<B>by Joseph Bast</B>
<P>
 Efforts to reform welfare in Illinois have taken three forms:
steps that are too small, throwing good money after bad, and reshuffling
bureaucracies.  In 1994, Governor James Edgar proposed enrolling
Medicaid beneficiaries in a $5-billion-a-year state-run health
maintenance organization.  Many observers questioned whether the
state was competent to run such an enormous new program.  A proposal
to issue health-care vouchers to the needy, redeemable by an array
of private insurance companies, was dismissed as too radical.
<P>
 Recent attempts to reform the Department of Children and Family
Services, the chief child welfare agency in Illinois, are also
fundamentally flawed.  Rather than reconsider the agency's far-reaching
mandate, and perhaps return it to its original mission of enforcing
child abuse laws and inspecting foster homes and other child-care
facilities, the state has poured hundreds of millions of dollars
into new computers, caseworkers, and consultants.  The result
has been even longer delays in placing children into safe homes
and more children returned to abusive parents.
<P>
 In his 1996 State of the State Address, Governor Edgar proposed
creating a welfare super-agency by merging seven cabinet-level
agencies and many other boards, commissions, and programs.  A
background paper distributed by his office noted that such consolidation
would mend the &quot;fractured&quot; state of current welfare
services and allow the government to &quot;focus on the entire
person or family unit and their needs.&quot;
<P>
 While there is certainly a need to consolidate--and scale back--the
state's welfare leviathan, other reforms could generate much greater
benefits more quickly:
<P><ul>
 <li>Issue health-care vouchers that would give the needy a wider
choice of medical providers and insurers.
<P>
 <li>Turn the care of abused and neglected children over to private
agencies that have a better track record of placing children into
safe and stable homes.
<P>
 Two reforms of AFDC would also produce immediate positive results:
<P>
 <li>Limit eligibility to two years, rather than offer the current
lifetime entitlement.
<P>
<li>Remove from the rolls all those who fail to report to state
offices when told to do so.  In November 1995, fewer than half
of 8,000 recipients responded to a call-in for a job-training
workshop--and half of those who responded failed to attend a follow-up
meeting.  Those 6,000 recipients who did not fulfill even the
simple obligation to attend these meetings should be dropped from
the rolls.</ul>
<P>
 The key to welfare reform in Illinois may lie in <I>Building
Communities from the Inside Out</I>, a new book by John P. Kretzmann
and John L. McKnight of Northwestern University's Center for Urban
Affairs and Policy Research.  The authors call for replacing government
programs with &quot;capacity-focused development&quot; driven
largely by private community-based  organizations.  The role of
government, write Kretzmann and McKnight, should be to gather
data on the capacity of the community and remove barriers to job
creation.  Other researchers have noted how Illinois' zoning laws,
occupational licensing laws, corrupt and under-performing public
school system, and politicized economic development program have
reduced job creation and income growth, undermined local self-improvement
efforts, and contributed to welfare dependency.
<P>
 Unfortunately, Illinois' current crop of elected officials--both
Democratic and Republican--is conspicuously lacking the vision
needed to dismantle the state's welfare complex.  As a result,
Illinoisans will carry a costly and counterproductive welfare
burden into the foreseeable future.

<B>Investing in Families</B>
<P>
<B>by Amy Frantz</B>
<P>
 In 1993, the Iowa state legislature enacted a welfare reform
program designed to help welfare recipients become self-sufficient.
 With several waivers from the federal government, AFDC was replaced
with the Family Investment Program (FIP).  FIP provides cash benefits
to participants based on their assets, income, and family size.
 Participants may also be eligible for Medicare, food stamps,
and other assistance.
<P>
 FIP participants must sign a contract, called the Family Investment
Agreement, in which they promise to participate in Iowa's employment
program, Promise Jobs.  This is administered by several state
agencies, including the departments of human services, employment
services, and economic development.  Services provided by Promise
Jobs include education and job training, resume writing, and interviewing
techniques.
<P>
 Each participant must meet with a caseworker, who helps identify
the individual's work and educational background, child-care and
transportation needs, and barriers to work.  After identifying
steps that must be taken to become self-sufficient, the contract
is negotiated by the participant and caseworker.  The participant
must agree to meet a timetable for achieving self-sufficiency.
 The state agrees to offer assistance in exchange.  Those who
fail to make progress toward self-sufficiency due to circumstances
beyond their control, such as the absence of child care, may renegotiate
their contracts.
<P>
 Exemptions to the Promise Jobs program include the disabled,
those with children under three months of age, and those already
working at least 30 hours per week in unsubsidized employment.
 Parents under the age of 19 who have not completed high school
or an equivalent must pursue their diplomas to receive benefits,
regardless of the age of their children.
<P>
 Those who refuse to sign a Family Investment Agreement must enter
a Limited Benefit Plan.  This pays reduced benefits for three
months, then terminates all benefits.  Individuals and any other
household members affected by a cut-off are ineligible for benefits
for six months.  After that time, they may negotiate a Family
Investment Agreement.  However, if they do not earnestly try to
become self-sufficient, benefits are terminated again for six
months.
<P>
 According to the Iowa Department of Human Services, the number
of families participating in the Family Investment Program fell
from 36,583 in October 1993, when the program was implemented,
to 33,091 by February 1996.  In addition, the percentage of families
participating in FIP who have at least one employed member increased
from 18 percent in 1993 to 33 percent by early 1996.  This success
is likely attributable to individuals' helping to tailor their
own self-sufficiency plans and to the reduction or termination
of benefits for those unwilling to pursue self-sufficiency.
<P>
 Iowa has also created programs that allow private organizations
to help those in the Family Investment Program.  One of these
is the Individual Development Account (IDA) pilot program.  IDAs
are held by low-income individuals and can be used for post-secondary
education, the purchase of a home, or starting a small business.
 They are opened with private banks and managed by community-based
organizations.  In addition to funds that individuals contribute
to their IDAs, community-based organizations can provide matching
funds.

<P>
<B>Changing Welfare by Requiring Work</B>
<P>
<B>by Peter S. Barwick</B>
<P>
 The single most important and politically feasible step that
can be taken to reform welfare in Pennsylvania is to impose up-front
work requirements on all able-bodied recipients.  The state must
enact this change if it is serious about helping welfare recipients
achieve long-term self-sufficiency.
<P>
 Governor Tom Ridge recently unveiled a welfare reform plan that
moves in this direction, but it does not go far enough.  For a
better example of how to use welfare to promote work, Pennsylvania's
policymakers should consider the Full Employment model, first
developed in Oregon.  This approach takes money already allocated
for the three largest welfare programs--AFDC, Food Stamps, and
Unemployment Insurance (UI)--and uses it to subsidize jobs for
welfare recipients in the private sector.
<P>
 Full Employment legislation, known as JOBS Plus, was passed by
the Oregon legislature in 1993, and has operated on a pilot basis
for the past two years.  Because of its impressive results in
reducing both welfare costs and caseloads, the legislature voted
last year to implement JOBS Plus statewide.  The Oregon model
has been influential in shaping reform in nearly a dozen states
to date, including Arizona, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Tennessee,
Virginia, and Wisconsin.
<P>
 Participation in JOBS Plus is required of virtually everyone
who qualifies for AFDC, Food Stamps, or UI.  Participants initially
receive help in finding regular full-time jobs.  Those unable
to find traditional employment are placed in subsidized jobs with
private-sector employers, who are reimbursed by the state for
the minimum wage plus the employers' share of social security,
unemployment insurance, and workers' compensation premiums.  Subsidized
jobs are temporary, lasting four months, with an optional two-month
extension.  Child care and health care are available to all participants.
<P>
 The benefits of JOBS Plus are numerous.  Most importantly, it
recognizes that work requirements are essential to helping the
poor escape from dependency and enter mainstream society.  As
today's welfare system so clearly shows, without the salutary
influence of employment, self-destructive and anti-social patterns
of behavior are often left unchecked, resulting in the degradation
and destruction of welfare recipients' lives.
<P>
 Other benefits of the Full Employment approach include:
<P><ul>
 <li>Providing participants with practical work experience;
<P>
 <li>Involving the business community in the fight to reduce poverty;
<P>
 <li>Eliminating the perverse incentives of the current welfare
system, which reward non-work and penalize work;
<P>
 <li>Eliminating fraud perpetuated by those who collect benefits
while simultaneously earning unreported income.</ul>
<P>
 Despite offering clear benefits, work-based welfare reform raises
important questions.  Foremost among these is how it will affect
the family.  Some critics, noting that most of those on welfare
are unmarried mothers with children, argue that putting these
women to work will further erode the family by separating mothers
from their children--children who lack the presence of fathers
to begin with.  This concern, while valid, must be weighed against
the danger of children learning habits of dependency from mothers
who have no constructive goals.  If our experience with welfare
over the past 30 years is any guide, the harm resulting from welfare
dependency is far worse--both for welfare recipients and society
in general--than the harm of separating children from their mothers
during the working day.
<P>
 A related concern is the impact of work-based welfare on family
formation.  Some critics believe that work requirements may discourage
marriage by enabling unmarried women to earn enough income to
stay unmarried.  This concern also has validity, but it does not
change the fact that as long as welfare exists, benefits must--for
the good of those receiving them--be linked with work requirements.
 Furthermore, by making welfare less attractive, work requirements
may actually encourage single mothers to marry.
<P>
 Finally, some believe that work-based welfare does little to
help participants achieve self-sufficiency because it places them
in dead-end, low-wage jobs.  These critics view work-based reform
as a thinly disguised attempt to provide business with a pool
of cheap labor.  This criticism is misplaced for two reasons.
 First, Full Employment programs actually require a great deal
from employers.  Under JOBS Plus, employers must provide participants
with on-the-job training and mentors to assist them in learning
the personal and job-related skills necessary for success in the
workplace.  They must also contribute funds to an education account
for each employee.  Second, since poverty often stems from a non-existent
work ethic, putting the needy to work will help them learn positive
habits such as perseverance and punctuality which are necessary
for achieving self-sufficiency.

<P>
<B>Headed in the Right Direction</B>
<P>
<B>by Mike Hubbard</B>
<P>
 South Carolina has joined a growing number of states that have
enacted major welfare reform.  Last year, the General Assembly
passed the Family Independence Act, requiring the South Carolina
Department of Social Services to reorient its mission from distributing
welfare checks to helping welfare recipients find jobs.
<P>
 To implement several proposed reforms, the federal government
must give South Carolina waivers from certain federal laws and
regulations.  Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration is fighting
the state over most of these, delaying the full impact of reform.
<P>
 Nonetheless, the Family Independence Act is a good step in the
right direction.  Among its provisions:
<P><UL>
 <li>&quot;Success&quot; for state agencies is defined as a shrinking
caseload and an increase in the number of recipients placed in
jobs.
<P>
<li>New welfare applications are not processed unless applicants
can prove they have been looking for work.
<P>
<li>The state helps recipients relocate to areas with better job
opportunities.
<P>
<li>Employers are given a tax credit for hiring and maintaining
recipients.
<P>
<li>Benefits are limited to 24 consecutive months, and 60 months
in a lifetime.  Exceptions are made for those truly unable to
work.
<P>
 <li>Mothers who give birth to children showing evidence of maternal
substance abuse are ineligible for AFDC unless they submit to
drug testing and/or undergo treatment.
<P>
<li>Teenage unwed mothers must live with a parent or guardian,
unless doing so would jeopardize their safety or that of their
children.
<P>
<li>The Department of Social Services must eliminate its &quot;no
daddy&quot; rule, thereby making two-parent welfare families eligible
for programs in financial planning, parenting, and the like.
<P>
 <li>Individual Development Accounts are created, encouraging families
to save money for a small business or home.
<P>
 <li>Drivers licenses, hunting and fishing licenses, and professional
licenses are revoked if fathers fail to pay child support.</ul>
<P>
 In addition, a federal rule that requires state welfare agencies
to keep a large portion of each child support payment is revoked
under the Family Independence Act.  All child support will be
passed on to mothers and their children.
<P>
 South Carolina has also sought to involve nonprofits and businesses
in welfare reform.  The Job Training and Partnership Act provides
funds to private organizations that teach job skills.  The future
of welfare in South Carolina will rely increasingly on such private
initiatives.

<P>
<B>Making Progress</B>
<P>
<B>by Kelly McCutchen</B>
<P>
 Many of the welfare reforms implemented in Georgia in recent
years lack the boldness of initiatives in other states and contain
too many exceptions to be truly effective.  However, Governor
Zell Miller's most recent reforms, combined with a thriving state
economy, appear to be having a positive effect.  From August 1994
through July 1995, the number of families on welfare decreased
by 6,000, from 141,000 to 135,000.
<P>
 Probably the greatest problem facing Georgia's welfare system
is the state's illegitimacy rate, among the highest in the nation.
 Georgia has enacted two reforms designed to discourage out-of-wedlock
births:
<P><ul>
 <li>In 1994, it began to deny benefits to unwed teen mothers who
choose to live on their own.  The following year, the number of
teen mothers living independently dropped by 50 percent.
<P>
 <li>As of 1996, it no longer increases benefits to welfare recipients
who have additional children.  Although it is too early to judge
the success of Georgia's &quot;family cap,&quot; a similar policy
in New Jersey has shown favorable results.</ul>
<P>
 Georgia also recently enacted three reforms intended to encourage
work:<UL>
<P>
 <li>Able-bodied welfare recipients who quit or refuse to take full-time
jobs face a reduction in benefits.
<P>
 <li>In a pilot project in ten counties, able-bodied recipients
are required to work 20 hours per month in assigned jobs at government
or nonprofit agencies.
<P>
 <li>The newest initiative, Work First, seeks to change the character
of welfare in Georgia from income maintenance to employment. 
The state is advising social workers that finding jobs for recipients
is their number one objective.  It is also offering businesses
tax credits and subsidies, giving them an incentive to hire and
train welfare recipients.</ul>
<P>
 Public support is vital to achieving any controversial change
in public policy.  To better gauge public opinion on welfare reform,
the Georgia Public Policy Foundation (GPPF) conducted a statewide
survey of registered voters in December 1994.  We found strong
support for many fundamental reforms.  Surprisingly, support was
uniform across racial and party lines:
<P><UL>
 <li>Nine out of ten Georgia voters support requiring unwed mothers
on welfare to name the fathers of their children.
<P>
 <br>Nine out of ten favor requiring able-bodied recipients to work
40 hours per week.
<P>
 <li>By a better than 5-to-1 margin, Georgia voters support limiting
welfare payments so that recipients cannot receive more than those
working at minimum-wage jobs.
<P>
 <li>A majority favor allowing recipients to be paid less than the
minimum wage to increase the likelihood that they will look for
work.</ul>
<P>
 GPPF supports three key elements of welfare reform:
<P><ul>
 <li> <I>Establish paternity at birth</I>.  Georgia has had great
success in recovering child-support payments.  As one of the first
states to privatize child-support collection, Georgia now ranks
sixth in the nation in removing families from welfare by finding
fathers and making them support their children.  The state must
send a clear message to teenage boys that they will be held financially
responsible for any children they engender.
<P>
 <li><I>Reduce benefits</I>.  Welfare recipients should not be better
off than those who work.  According to the Cato Institute, the
wage equivalent of the overall welfare benefits received by a
Georgia mother with two children greatly exceeds the amount most
Georgians earn in entry-level jobs.  Their benefits total $8.37
per hour, the equivalent of a $17,400 annual salary.
<P>
 <li><I>Require work</I>.  Welfare recipients must not be allowed
to stay at home and collect benefits.  We must return to a system
that expects a full day's work in return for assistance.</ul>
<P>
 Although these steps are important, effective reform must go
beyond establishing paternity, reducing benefits, and requiring
work.  Most welfare recipients face tough problems that they cannot
solve on their own, and experience shows that one-size-fits-all
government programs will not promote self-sufficiency.  When government
moved into social welfare, other institutions--families, businesses,
churches, and charities--were shunted aside.  They must once again
assume primary roles.
<P>
 Worthwhile organizations must be identified.  GPPF is currently
working with Robert Woodson of the National Center for Neighborhood
Enterprise to identify grassroots organizations in Georgia that
have a proven record of helping the needy achieve self-sufficiency.
 These groups, including the Georgia-based Habitat for Humanity,
will form the foundation for effective alternatives to government
programs.
<P>
 A successful approach to welfare reform requires a balance of
compassion, fairness, and common sense.  It would be an easy but
tragic mistake to simply transfer federal programs to the states.
 Instead, Georgia will create welfare reform approaches that work
by requiring more responsibility from the needy and by engaging
an active citizenry in the &quot;tough love&quot; initiatives
of local organizations.

<P>
<B>From Welfare to Work</B>
<P>
<B>by Samuel R. Staley and Douglas Hyne</B>
<P>
 Welfare spending rose dramatically in Ohio during the 1980s.
 As a result, the state has either scaled back, restructured,
or eliminated several welfare programs.  General Assistance, which
gave over $100 per month to more than 146,000 able-bodied adults
in 1991, began to be phased out in 1992 and was eliminated in
1995.  This has already saved the state $900 million since the
phase-out began and should save an additional $885 million over
the next four years.
<P>
 Ohio has also implemented the federally mandated Job Opportunities
and Basic Skills (JOBS) program.  This requires a large number
of welfare recipients to enroll in job-training programs.  Refusal
to participate results in a loss of welfare benefits.
<P>
 A recent federal waiver also allows Ohio to require recipients
of Aid to Dependent Children (ADC) to participate in JOBS or lose
benefits.  This is expected to dramatically increase the number
of JOBS participants, which already is higher than in any other
state.  Combined with state-mandated self-sufficiency contracts
that outline steps recipients must take to prepare for employment,
Ohio's JOBS participation sanctions are considered some of the
toughest in the nation.
<P>
 Another federal waiver has allowed Ohio to &quot;cash out&quot;
ADC and food stamp benefits as wage supplements.  In a pilot project
now operating in five major urban counties, welfare recipients
are placed in jobs paying between $8 and $11 per hour.
<P>
 In 1989, Ohio implemented the Learning, Earning and Parenting
(LEAP) program.  This offers teen mothers $62 per month to stay
in high school.  The governor's office reports a 10 percent decline
in the dropout rate since 1991.  It also credits the program with
encouraging 13 percent of dropouts to return to school.
<P>
 In addition, ADC parents are required to establish paternity
and support their dependents or face penalties.  And those who
have committed welfare fraud are required to pay back benefits.
 Even those under the age of 18 risk losing Medicaid coverage
if they have received benefits under false pretenses.
<P>
 Additional federal waivers will allow Ohio to implement Ohio
FIRST, a comprehensive welfare-reform initiative.  Spearheaded
by Governor George Voinovich and passed by the General Assembly
with strong bipartisan support, it will:
<P><ul>
<li> Increase the income families may earn before losing ADC benefits;
<P>
 <li>Eliminate work-history requirements for able-bodied married
couples.  (These encouraged divorce since only single parents
without work histories qualified for welfare.);
<P>
 <li>Increase the maximum allowed value for an automobile, allowing
recipients to take jobs that require personal transportation;
<P>
 <li>Allow married couples who work more than 100 hours per month
to retain benefits.  (Previously, only single parents could do
so.).</ul>
<P>
 Another key component of recent welfare reforms is timelines.
 Under these:
<P><ul>
 <li>JOBS participants enrolled in a GED program must complete their
schooling within two years to retain benefits.
<P>
<li> ADC benefits are limited to three years.</ul>
<P>
 Ohio is also testing a version of the Electronic Benefits Transfer
(EBT) smart card.  Similar to ATM bank cards, EBT cards are issued
by the state and can be used by welfare recipients to purchase
food, housing, and other goods.  The cards are expected to reduce
both administrative costs and fraud.
<P>
 These and other efforts appear to be paying off.  Ohio's welfare
caseload fell from 811,219 in 1991 to 569,405 by February 1996,
a 30 percent drop.  ADC payments are nearly $300 below the national
average.  The number of ADC recipients fell 25 percent between
1992 and February 1996.  And Medicaid spending, expected to consume
30 percent of the state's General Revenue Fund Budget over the
next two years, grew by only 1.4 percent between 1994 and 1995--the
slowest growth in twenty years.  Ohio has also received a federal
waiver that will let it place more low-income families in cost-efficient
managed-care programs.
<P>
 Ohio should explore additional welfare reform options.  Tax credits
and other incentives could be used to encourage donations to charities
serving the needy.  By restructuring its own tax code, Ohio could
help relieve some of the welfare burden without having to deal
with the federal bureaucracy.
<P>

<P>
<B>Untangling the Medicaid Mess</B>
<P>
<B>by John Hood</B>
<P>
 Lawmakers and the general public most often think of welfare
as cash assistance programs such as AFDC.  These are the least
popular and, to many, the most infuriating.
<P>
 But AFDC is not the largest welfare program.  That distinction
belongs to Medicaid, the joint federal-state program designed
to subsidize health care for about 36 million poor, disabled,
and elderly Americans.  Federal taxes support two-thirds of this
$160-billion program while state and local governments contribute
the remainder.  Astonishingly, the cost of Medicaid has tripled
just since 1988.  If welfare reform is to succeed in its twin
goals of reducing dependency and costs, it must include serious
federal and state reforms of Medicaid.
<P>
 Nationwide, Medicaid pays for one-third of all births, more than
half of all nursing home bills, and a significant part of the
bill for those with mental illness, physical disabilities, and
AIDS.  In North Carolina, the scope of the program is even larger,
paying for nearly half of all births and three-quarters of all
nursing home bills.
<P>
 The costs of Medicaid are rapidly outstripping the ability of
federal and state governments to pay the bill.  The Congressional
Budget Office estimates that Medicaid costs will almost double
by 2002.  A recent study by the Heritage Foundation estimates
that by the same year states will spend a combined $100 billion
on the program, up from $70 billion in 1995.  Such increases would
likely be funded by higher taxes or cuts in other state programs
such as education and crime control.
<P>
 A viable reform strategy must recognize that Medicaid is not
a program but a set of programs with different goals and different
problems.  Created in 1965 as a health insurance program for the
poor, Medicaid has become an amalgam of at least three social
welfare programs.  These cover:
<P><ul>
 <li>Poor children and adults;
<P>
 <li>Disabled children and adults;
<P>
 <li>Elderly residents in nursing homes.</ul>
<P>
 These three populations have very little in common.  Most of
the Medicaid population qualifies through eligibility for cash
welfare programs such as AFDC.  While these low-income individuals
certainly have health-care needs, their main problem is welfare
dependency.  They need help learning job skills, getting off drugs,
and becoming self-sufficient.
<P>
 Instead of automatically being enrolled in Medicaid, these recipients
should receive vouchers to purchase private health insurance,
enroll in managed care, or make deposits in medical or other savings
accounts.  These would be subject to the same time limits, work
requirements, and other rules set for welfare benefits.
<P>
 Medicaid recipients who are disabled may be thought of as long-term
wards of the state.  Per capita, their health-care costs are the
highest.  But being less numerous than the elderly, they do not
account for the largest share of Medicaid spending.  Disabled
Medicaid recipients should receive care as part of subsidized
assigned-risk pools and through competitive contracting.
<P>
 Finally, elderly recipients in nursing homes, who are a minority
of the Medicaid population, account for the largest share of Medicaid
spending.  Often, they are middle-class Americans who have transferred
their assets to their children in order to qualify for Medicaid.
 They must be encouraged to plan for their own health-care needs
through individual savings and long-term care insurance.
<P>
 One way to do this is to amend the income-tax system to treat
premiums for long-term care insurance the same as for medical
insurance.  Also, the payment of long-term care benefits, either
from insurance or medical savings, should not be considered taxable
income.  The potential savings to taxpayers of this change would
be massive.  According to the American Health Care Association,
if most people over age 55 had long-term health-care insurance,
the percentage of those subsidized by Medicaid in nursing homes
would fall from a current 67 percent to 25 percent within 25 years.

<B>Private Alternatives to Welfare</B>
<P>
<B>by Senator Maurice E. Washington</B>
<P>
<I> &quot;It has so happened in all ages of the world that some
have labored and others have without labor enjoyed a proportion
of the fruits.  This is wrong and should not continue.  To secure
to each laborer the whole product of his labor or as nearly as
possible is a most worthy object of any good government.&quot;
 Abraham Lincoln</I>
<P>
 Lincoln's statement distills the essence of what I have learned
about life and human nature in relation to the current welfare
morass.  As a pastor and member of the black community, I have
watched the traditionally strong morals and family structure of
black families destroyed by the false god of welfare entitlement.
<P>
 In 1994, when I was elected to the Nevada State Senate, I began
work on a sweeping welfare reform proposal.  Dubbed the Nevada
Self-Reliance Act, its goals are to end welfare entitlements,
strengthen the fragmenting family unit, and restore individual
responsibility.  It also seeks to build partnerships between the
public and private sectors and provide relief from the escalating
tax burden caused by welfare programs.
<P>
 Three programs with which I am familiar underscore the vital
role that local nonprofits can play in welfare-reform efforts:
<P><ul>
 <li> The Center Street Mission in Reno provides a full range of
services to help the needy become productive members of society.
 Founded in 1989 by Mickey Lafkin, C.M.S. and funded by individuals,
foundations, churches, and local government, it provides showers,
clean clothes, evening meals, and help in finding housing and
employment.  It also offers spiritual support.  Over 2,000 participants
have found jobs and a new start in life--a 92 percent success
rate.  The Mission also reaches out to prisoners and parolees
through weekly Bible study programs.
<P>
 <li>Friends in Service Helping (FISH) in Carson City was created
17 years ago to provide temporary and emergency assistance to
the needy.  Private contributors, including individuals, churches,
businesses, and civic clubs provide over 90 percent of FISH's
support.  FISH operates a food pantry, dining room, temporary
homeless shelter, and immunization clinic.  It also provides counseling,
free G.E.D. classes, and an interim housing project for eight
families.  Nearly 150 families are served each month.  FISH's
effectiveness is evident from the fact that Carson County, the
third largest county in Nevada, employs only one part-time state
social worker.  Residents have chosen to support an effective
private organization over a government bureaucracy.
<P>
 <li>Center of Hope Christian Fellowship in Sparks is the church
that I pastor.  When I helped create it six years ago, many of
our members were on welfare.  Today, every one is employed.  None
receive welfare.  Like the Center Street Mission and FISH, our
programs are locally controlled and operate in partnership with
the community.  Paid staff are few.  Volunteers provide most services.
 In return for spiritual and moral support, recipients are expected
to change self-defeating or self-destructive behavior.</ul>
<P>
 The principles by which these organizations operate should serve
as models for future welfare reform efforts.

<P>
<B>Lessons from a School that Works</B>
<P>
<B>by Gary Palmer</B>
<P>
 Perhaps the best example of what true welfare reform could be
in Alabama is the Cornerstone School.  Located in a low-income
minority community in Birmingham, Cornerstone is a privately funded
Christian elementary school which charges no tuition.
<P>
 According to Cornerstone's executive director, Dr. Vernard Gant,
the best way to break the cycle of dependency is through a combination
of strong character and morals, a good education, and a vision
for the future.  Gant insists that students from inner-city, low-income
families can excel in school and learn the social skills necessary
for success as adults.
<P>
 As soon as students are admitted to Cornerstone, they are given
a battery of tests to identify educational deficiencies.  Teachers
then tutor individual students to bring them up to the appropriate
grade level.  The wisdom of this approach is evident in the results.
 Third grade students with barely a second grade education who
enrolled in August 1995 saw their achievement scores jump an average
of 54 percent as of January 1996.  The fifth grade class, half
of whom enrolled with less than a fourth grade education, improved
its overall score by 38 percent.  Math skills for both classes
are now above the national average.
<P>
 Cornerstone makes parental involvement a high priority.  Before
a child is admitted, parents must sign a covenant, pledging to
participate in their children's education.  They are required
to have their children to school on time, attend all report card
conferences and parent meetings, work with faculty to promote
appropriate speech, behavior, and social development, and provide
a distraction-free environment for doing homework.  Teachers stay
in constant contact with parents through meetings, after-school
visits, and by telephone.  Despite these demands, there is a waiting
list for admission to Cornerstone.
<P>
 Religious education is central to Cornerstone's effort to elevate
students above poverty and dependency.  A recent Heritage Foundation
report shows that religious values are critical factors in avoiding
unwed pregnancy, drug use, alcoholism, crime, divorce, and other
circumstances that can lead to welfare dependency.  It found that
students who receive a religious education also place a higher
value on academics, are more likely to dismiss racism as an obstacle
to reaching their goals, and are more likely to have serious and
realistic goals for the future.
<P>
 Cornerstone judiciously selects its teachers on the basis of
the &quot;Three M's:&quot; mentor, model, and mission.  Every
teacher is a mentor and a model of integrity and determination.
 Each is also a missionary to both students and parents.
<P>
 Cornerstone students are admitted from the surrounding area,
primarily on the basis of need.  Tuition and operating funds come
from individuals, foundations, corporations, and churches.  Cornerstone
also has a &quot;Partners&quot; program for those who make an
annual contribution of $2,500.  Partners agree to be mentors and
role models and to attend up to four Partners' Day programs each
year.
<P>
 Governor Fob James recently visited Cornerstone to see first-hand
how private, faith-based education helps future generations of
at-risk children from becoming welfare victims.  He saw that private
initiative can accomplish what government programs have so often
failed to do: prepare a generation to be responsible, self-supporting
adults.

<P>
 Welfare reform is well under way in the states.  Despite President
Clinton's recent veto of welfare reform legislation, many states
have received or are seeking waivers from the federal government
to reform their welfare systems.  This issue presents contributions
by leaders of state public-policy think tanks.  It examines reforms
already made in six states and proposes new ideas to make charities
and nonprofit organizations key providers of private welfare services.
<P>
 Lawrence W. Reed, president of the Midland, Michigan-based Mackinac
Center for Public Policy, describes Michigan Governor John Engler's
ambitious welfare reforms.  He notes, however, that charities
must become more involved in these efforts.  David G. Tuerck,
executive director of Boston's Beacon Hill Institute, offers a
tax-credit proposal that would address Reed's concern.  It would
shift welfare responsibilities from government to charities.
<P>
 Three articles follow which emphasize the importance of moving
welfare recipients into the workforce.  Andrew Bush, a research
fellow and director of the Welfare Policy Center at the Indianapolis-based
Hudson Institute, argues that Indiana should adopt an aggressive
work-based welfare program.  Michael E. Hartmann, Director of
Research at the Milwaukee-based Wisconsin Policy Research Institute,
describes a strong workfare program likely to be signed into law
this month by Governor Tommy Thompson.  Tom Tancredo and Dwight
Filley, president and senior fellow, respectively, of the Golden,
Colorado-based Independence Institute, discuss the role of fatherlessness
in long-term welfare dependency and propose workfare and other
programs to address this problem.
<P>
 Two concluding articles from Washington state think tanks emphasize
why private efforts to help the needy are more likely to succeed
than government programs.  John Carlson, chairman of the Seattle's
Washington Institute for Policy Studies, uses a &quot;thought
experiment&quot; to outline principles that should be the basis
of any welfare reform effort.  Lynn Harsh and Bob Williams, executive
director and president, respectively, of the Olympia-based Evergreen
Freedom Foundation, discuss ways to implement some of these principles
in their state.
<P>
 Next month's issue will carry additional articles by state think
tank leaders on state-level welfare reform.
<P>
<B><A NAME="mich">Michigan: Have We Gone Far Enough?</A></B>
<P>
<B>by Lawrence W. Reed</B>
<P>
 Welfare programs may well be the most unpopular of all government
initiatives--criticized by social scientists who observe the results,
disdained by taxpayers who pay the bills, and often unloved by
many of those who collect the benefits.  Even the Maryland State
Conference of the NAACP says that welfare &quot;is a major contributory
factor to the crime problems we face today.&quot;  Unlike private
efforts that stress character-building, one-on-one mentoring and
a spiritual dimension, the impersonal public dole does nothing
to overcome &quot;behavioral poverty&quot;--the breakdown in values
and behavior needed to promote self-sufficiency and build stable
families.
<P>
 Michigan Governor John M. Engler recognized this in 1991 when
he embarked on what has become one of the most ambitious efforts
to reform welfare in the states.  Michigan abruptly ended the
General Assistance program for able-bodied, childless adults in
October 1991 and adopted a &quot;social contract,&quot; whereby
welfare recipients are expected to seek work, go to school, or
perform community service in exchange for benefits.
<P>
 To encourage work, the state now allows welfare recipients to
keep more of their earnings without having that count as income
against their welfare checks.  Before this change, the tax-free
value of AFDC, food stamps, and Medicaid for a family of three
in Michigan (about $1,000 per month) was roughly equal to the
income one could earn at a minimum wage or entry-level job.  This
hardly promoted work over welfare.
<P>
 The Engler reforms have produced tangible results.  Nearly 25
percent of Michigan's AFDC recipients are now working.  This is
three times the national average and up from 16 percent just two
years ago.  Average earnings from work and hours spent in volunteer
activity are up as well.  Fewer families are receiving assistance
than at any time since 1989.
<P>
 While those results are welcome, it's too early to break out
the champagne.  Governor Engler himself expressed a healthy skepticism
about both federal and state welfare reforms when he told ABC's
David Brinkley in November 1994, &quot;Replacing liberal micromanagement
with conservative micromanagement would only be a slight improvement;
it's time for wholesale reform.&quot;  By this, he means further
reducing the role of government and making welfare a largely private
initiative.  In the words of columnist John Fund of the <I>Wall
Street Journal</I>, &quot;Ask yourself: If you had a financial
windfall and wanted to help the poor, would you even <I>think</I>
about giving time or a check to the government?&quot;
<P>
 In Michigan, a growing number of private initiatives to help
the poor are already underway, some of which sprouted in direct
response to the state's abolition of General Assistance.  For
instance, Hard Times Cafe in Harrison provides counseling, job
placement, and other services to the needy.  Clients earn &quot;Hard
Times Dollars&quot; that are redeemable for personal-needs items
such as soap and toothpaste.  These are donated by individuals
and local businesses.
<P>
 With hardly a murmur about separation of church and state, the
state of Michigan has contracted with the Salvation Army to operate
a statewide network of 120 homeless shelters.  For the amazingly
low cost of $10 per person per day, the Army provides a bed, two
meals, and personal interaction with the needy aimed at reducing
behavioral poverty.
<P>
 The privatization of welfare could be pursued in a number of
ways.  A cold turkey approach would simply abolish welfare and
rely on families, churches, and charities to help the needy. 
The response might pleasantly surprise some who think that only
government can perform this task.  A more gradual transition to
a privatized scenario would provide more public recognition of
charities and greater incentives for charitable giving.  State
and local governments might also contract out more welfare services,
giving those in need a choice between increasingly proscriptive
and punitive government programs and private charity, which is
more likely to offer personalized help.
<P>
 Our welfare system has produced such disastrous consequences
that it's hard to imagine how a radical overhaul could make things
worse.  If we revitalize the American ideals of charity and self-help,
we might end up spending less for success than the government
now spends for failure.
<P>
<B><A NAME="mass">Massachusetts: Why State-Level Reform Won't Work</A></B>
<P>
<B>by David G. Tuerck</B>
<P>
 Welfare reform is progressing in many states.  Even if President
Clinton vetoes future federal welfare reform bills, a number of
states will continue to undertake reforms of their own.  Massachusetts,
justifiably infamous for its bloated welfare state, adopted sweeping
reforms last year under Governor William Weld:
<P>
<ul>
 <li>Ablebodied welfare recipients whose youngest children have
entered school must work at least 20 hours per week in a job or
community service program.
<P>
 <LI>Parents under age 18 must live with a responsible adult or
in a supervised group home.  They must stay in school or in a
GED program.
<P>
 <LI>A family cap denies additional benefits to recipients for children
born after August 1996.
<P>
 <LI>Ablebodied recipients' benefits are cut by 2.75 percent.
<P>
 </ul>Just to make a point, Massachusetts renamed its welfare bureaucracy:
the Department of Public Welfare became the Department of Transitional
Assistance.

<P>
 Overdue as these reforms are, they do not go to the heart of
the problem.  The reason lies in the method by which we fund welfare.
 Under the existing system, taxpayers send their money to Washington,
where most flows into a welfare bureaucracy and only a fraction
eventually reaches the pockets of the poor.  As long as welfare
is taxpayer-funded but government-controlled, it will remain an
expensive entitlement offered by a faceless bureaucracy.  The
seeds of poverty will be left to sprout anew.
<P>
 The best reform approach is to make welfare taxpayer-funded and
taxpayer-controlled.  A Beacon Hill Institute Policy Study, <I>Giving
Credit Where Credit Is Due: A New Approach to Welfare Funding</I>,
proposes that individual taxpayers, both itemizers and non-itemizers,
receive a 100 percent federal tax credit for contributions to
eligible charities for up to 25 percent of their federal tax liability.
 This would shift control of $115 billion in federal welfare spending
from government to individuals.  Eligible charities would be 501(c)(3)
organizations that offer services now provided by government under
meanstested programs, such as AFDC, Food Stamps, and housing assistance.
 These organizations would vie for taxpayer support by offering
superior services to the needy.
<P>
 Why so radical a proposal?  A few facts show why the welfare
system is broken.  Although the poverty rate declined from 1959
to 1994, there are still more than 38 million Americans (14.5
percent of the total population) living in poverty.  Poverty affects
women and children more than others.  The poverty rate was 54
percent for single female headsofhousehold in 1994.  The rate
for children rose from 14.9 percent in 1970 to 21.8 percent in
1994.
<P>
 These statistics stand out against the backdrop of a vastly expanded
welfare system.  Combined federal and state spending on direct
public aid increased tenfold from $15 billion in 1970 to $142
billion in 1990.  Furthermore, government welfare spending is
highly inefficient.  Only 41 percent of all povertylevel families
receive any government benefits at all.  And almost half of those
receiving benefits are not poor.  More than two-thirds of all
federal welfare spending ultimately ends up in the pockets of
people who are not poor.
<P>
 Welfare is commonly viewed as something the government provides.
 But this view is highly myopic.  Individuals currently give about
$17 billion to private charities that provide services similar
to those provided by government.  Total spending for direct-service
programs is about $132 billion, equal to the $115 billion spent
by the federal government plus $17 billion spent by private charities.
 Contrary to those who believe that charity cannot compensate
for a loss of government welfare payments, a tax credit can be
expected to increase the total amount of welfare for at least
four reasons:
<P>
<ul>
 <LI><I>Increased giving</I>.  The provision of a tax incentive
for charitable contributions amounts to a reduction in the price
of private giving.  This price is equal to the cost, after taxes,
of giving an additional dollar.  Under present law, the price
of giving for a federal taxpayer in the 28 percent tax bracket
is 72 cents.  A 100 percent tax credit would reduce this price
to zero (for donations up to a 25 percent limit).  Provision of
a full tax credit would cause private giving to expand by more
than tax revenues contract, thus causing the total amount of welfare
to expand.
<P>
 <LI><I>Increased voluntarism</I>.  A recent Gallup poll finds that
29 percent, or 70 million, of all Americans volunteer in their
communities.  Those who volunteer also give more to charities.
 The creation of a tax credit would add at least 2 million people
to the pool of volunteers.
<P>
 <LI><I>Increased efficiency and savings</I>.  Most research has
found that the private sector is more cost-efficient than government
in delivering services.  Moreover, nonprofit organizations rely
more on unpaid volunteers than either government or businesses.
<P>
 <LI><I>Reduced crowd-out</I>.  Government spending has been shown
to crowd out private giving.  A one-dollar increase in government
spending decreases private giving by an estimated 10 cents.  The
proposed 100 percent tax credit would eliminate this problem.
</ul>
<P>
 Devolving welfare to the states is one path to reform.  But it
will not succeed if states merely substitute their bureaucracies
for federal bureaucracies.  Optimum welfare reform would shift
responsibility for welfare to private charities.  And tax credits
are the most effective public-policy instrument for achieving
this change.
<P>
<B><A NAME="ind">Indiana: Reorienting Welfare</A></B>
<P>
<B>by Andrew Bush</B>
<P>
 Whether or not the federal government introduces welfare block
grants to the states, Indiana should use the considerable flexibility
it already has to transform the way it helps its neediest families.
 The focus of Indiana's welfare policy should be to help families
become self-sufficient.  Government can best achieve this goal
by recognizing its own limitations and by drawing on the strengths
of charities, community-based organizations, and other private
service providers.
<P>
 The Indianapolis Independence Initiative, or I-3, probably offers
the best model for reforming Indiana's welfare system.  As a graduated
work-based plan currently proposed as an alternative to AFDC in
Marion County, I-3 would dramatically change the orientation of
welfare in two ways:
<P>
<ul>
 <LI>Consistent employment by at least one parent is about the closest
thing there is to a ticket out of poverty.  I-3 would focus on
giving needy families that opportunity by helping able-bodied
parents find immediate work.  Unsubsidized, private-sector employment
would be the primary goal, but those not yet able to obtain such
employment could build their skills and work histories through
partially subsidized jobs or fully subsidized community-service
jobs.  Those with temporary disabilities could &quot;earn&quot;
cash support by performing tasks that would prepare them to support
their families.  I-3's focus on employment and earnings would
help families move quickly into the mainstream working world and
become acclimated to the lifestyle it demands.
<P>
 Rather than ending assistance when parents find jobs, I-3 would
treat initial employment as a first step.  Money used for welfare
benefits would be channeled into services and subsidies to help
low-income working parents remain employed and increase their
capacity to be self-supporting.  Child care, health care, employment
services, and counseling would be available to help families become
and remain employed.
<P>
 <LI>I-3 would open public aid to a wide range of non-government
service providers that would help families pursue self-sufficiency.
 Networks of provider organizations would operate under performance-based
contracts.  By opening up the public-assistance provider system
and judging organizations by performance standards, public assistance
would become more useful, creative, and efficient.
</ul>
<P>
 Private charities and other community-based organizations have
an important role to play in systems such as I-3.  The danger
is that they might seek to recreate the current welfare system.
 It is essential that charities summon all their creativity and
expertise to make work-based public assistance a reality.
<P>
<B><A NAME="wis">Wisconsin: Work Requirements for All Welfare Recipients</A></B>
<P>
<B>by Michael E. Hartmann</B>
<P>
 Wisconsin has imposed stringent work requirements on welfare
recipients and has successfully moved many able-bodied recipients
into productive work.  Only hard-core recipients remain on welfare
in Wisconsin.  A bill that has just passed both houses of the
state legislature by wide margins, &quot;W-2--Wisconsin Works,&quot;
would require all recipients to work.  Spearheaded by Governor
Tommy G. Thompson, it is likely to be signed into law this April.
<P>
 A January 1995 study by welfare expert Lawrence W. Mead found
that between 1989 and 1993, the national AFDC caseload grew by
29 percent, from 10.2 million to 14.1 million.  State caseloads
increased by an average of 35 percent.  But according to the Wisconsin
Department of Health and Social Services, Wisconsin's welfare
caseload fell by 24.5 percent from January 1987 to July 1995--from
98,300 to 70,300 cases.  According to Mead, this was partly because
Wisconsin implemented the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills (JOBS)
program in 1988.  Mandated by Title II of the federal Family Support
Act, JOBS required caseworkers to closely monitor and motivate
welfare recipients in their search for employment.
<P>
 In July 1993, Wisconsin implemented an even tougher employment
requirement for some AFDC recipients, called &quot;Work, Not Welfare&quot;
(WNW).  WNW limits AFDC payments to two years and offers major
job-training services.  To determine the number of hours a recipient
must work or participate in training, WNW combines food stamps
and AFDC into one lump-sum payment that is then divided by the
federal minimum wage ($4.25).  WNW can be credited with reducing
AFDC rolls in Fond du Lac County from 627 in December 1994 to
385 in July 1995 (a 38.6 percent decline), and in Pierce County
from 191 in December 1994 to 117 in July 1995 (a 38.7 percent
decline).
<P>
 If signed by Governor Thompson as expected, the latest proposal--W-2--Wisconsin
Works--will create a &quot;self-sufficiency ladder&quot; for welfare
recipients based on four graduated work options:
<P>
<ul> 
<LI><i>W-2 Transitions</I>.  Recipients unable to perform self-sustaining
work will engage in work activities (e.g., sheltered workshops),
vocational rehabilitation, and counseling.  Twenty-eight hours
of work activity plus 12 hours of job training at $518 per month
will be imposed.  Food stamps will be available.  A time limit
of 24 months may be extended on a case-by-case basis.
<P>
<LI><I>Community-service jobs</I>.  Recipients will learn work
habits and job skills necessary for employment in the private
sector.  Thirty hours of work per week plus ten hours of training
at $555 per month will be imposed.  Like W-2 Transitions, food
stamps will be available and participation will be limited to
24 months.
<P>
<LI> <I>Trial jobs (subsidized employment)</I>.  Recipients' transition
to unsubsidized private employment will initially be subsidized--for
example, when a recipient is willing to work but has little or
no work history.  Forty hours of work per week at market wages
will be imposed, and employers will receive up to $300 per month
in subsidies.  Food stamps and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)
will be available.  Time in the program will be limited to 24
months.
<P>
 <LI><I>Unsubsidized employment</I>.  Recipients will be guided
to the best available immediate job in the private sector.  Forty
hours of work per week at market wages will be imposed, and food
stamps and the EITC will be available.
</ul><P>
 The bill that has just passed the state legislature says that
&quot;the W-2 agency will operate the four major components .
. . in an integrated fashion so that participants are always entering
the highest (i.e., least subsidized) workforce stage possible,
and are moving up to the next level at the earliest opportunity.&quot;
 Those eligible for participation will be &quot;families consisting
of custodial parents and their children age 18 or younger, with
incomes below 115 percent of poverty and with low assets.&quot;
 Health-care and child-care benefits (to which recipients must
make co-payments) are included.  However, to meet predictable
legal challenges to the program by those denied benefits, the
bill states that &quot;an individual is not entitled to benefits
or services under [W-2].&quot;
<P>
 The state legislature modified the governor's original proposal
by:
<P>
<ul>
<LI>Strengthening health-care provisions for pregnant mothers and
new mothers;
<P>
 <LI>Lowering participants' co-payments for child care;
<P>
 <LI>Allowing those in vocational or four-year college programs
to complete their schooling without losing benefits;
</ul>
<P>
 Democratic Assembly Minority Leader Walter J. Kunicki remarked
before passage that &quot;People are afraid not to vote for [W-2].
 No one wants to be on record voting against welfare reform.&quot;
 W-2 is expected to affect more than 53,000 women and their children
and cost $2.1 billion in its first two years--$110 more than under
current welfare spending.
<P>
  Hopefully, Congress will soon pass block grant welfare legislation.
 Otherwise, Wisconsin will have to seek waivers from the Department
of Health and Human Services to implement W-2.  Nonetheless, state
welfare officials see W-2's self-sufficiency ladder as a realistic
way to encourage all welfare recipients, even those heretofore
considered unemployable, to become productive members of society.
<P>
<B><A NAME="colo">Colorado: An Agenda for the State Legislature</A></B>
<P>
<B>by Tom Tancredo and Dwight Filley</B>
<P>
 What if one thing caused most of Colorado's social ills?  And
what if government policies were encouraging that one thing?
<P>
 If these two statements are true, then we can go a long way toward
curing those ills by simply reversing the policies that encourage
that single development.  There is a growing body of evidence
linking the following social pathologies to a common factor: juvenile
delinquency, drug abuse, gang membership, dropping out of school,
homelessness, teenage pregnancy, illiteracy, high infant mortality,
poor prenatal care, poverty, and welfare dependency.  That factor
is the absence of a married father in the household.  Obviously,
the lack of a father is not the only cause, but there is a strong
correlation between these problems and a childhood spent in a
fatherless home.
<P>
 One might think that in an advanced Western democracy, public
policy would be directed toward reducing the number of fatherless
homes and toward encouraging marriage.  But current federal policy
does exactly the opposite.  It penalizes those who are married
and rewards those who are not.
<P>
 The penalties?  A couple considering marriage must get permission
from the government by obtaining a license.  If the government
approves, the couple must pay a fee--a fine if you will.  Once
married, the couple will probably pay a much larger fine--the
so-called marriage penalty of the federal income tax.  They must
pay the fine every year they remain married.  Newspapers have
carried stories about couples who divorce and then live together
to reduce their income taxes.
<P>
 And the rewards for being unmarried?  Government benefits: housing
vouchers, food stamps, day care, and a cash reward--AFDC--that
is paid every month for a child born out of wedlock.  In most
states, this reward is increased with each additional child.
<P>
 What we have here, as they say, is a failure to communicate.
 If the single strongest predictor of the above-mentioned problems
is the absence of a father, why does government policy seem geared
toward driving fathers away?
<P>
 Although Colorado lives under an oppressive burden of federal
laws, we still have considerable latitude to end the perverse
incentives that wreck families and contribute to our social ills.
 AFDC, for example, is a matching fund program.  If the Colorado
legislature refused to fund its share, AFDC would end in the state.
 Similarly, Colorado could revise its income tax code to offset
the federal marriage penalty.
<P>
 The state legislature might also take the following considerations
into account in drafting welfare reform legislation:
<P>
<ul>
 <LI>Recognize that shielding people from the natural consequences
of their destructive actions will result in more destructive actions.
<P>
<LI> Freeze welfare spending at current levels.  This is the only
way to reduce welfare in the long run.
<P>
 <LI>Do not cut funding for current welfare programs that provide
for the disabled and the elderly.
<P>
 <LI>Do not provide government assistance to people who can work.
 If such people are forced to be accountable to their families,
churches, communities, and private charities, they are more likely
to enter the job market and end their destructive behavior than
if they receive aid from an impersonal bureaucracy.  When Michigan
terminated General Assistance for employable, childless adults,
welfare rolls fell by 82,000, and welfare payments by 17 percent.
<P>
 <LI>Enact a meaningful workfare program.  Do not allow a two-year
waiting period before applying workfare requirements.  If workfare
is to succeed in discouraging able-bodied people from going on
welfare, its effect will be strongest at the time of welfare enrollment,
not two years later.
<P>
 <LI>Workfare costs taxpayers more when unmarried mothers have children
under the age of five, because day-care must be provided.  Accordingly,
apply workfare first to able-bodied recipients other than mothers
with young children.  However, mothers who choose to have additional
children while already on welfare should not be exempt from workfare
requirements.
<P>
 <LI>Do not provide welfare to women under 18 unless they live with
a parent or legal guardian.  Too often, the prospect of money
for one's own apartment is an incentive to become pregnant.  Exceptions
should be made if teenagers have left home because of abuse, and
if teenagers lived independently for at least a year before applying
for welfare.
<P>
<LI> Do not increase payments to women who bear more children while
they are welfare recipients.  Working parents get no pay raise
when they have more children.  This policy is already law in New
Jersey, where the number of births to welfare recipients has fallen
by 16 percent.
<P>
<LI> Make AFDC funding contingent upon the mother identifying the
father, if the child was born after 1994.  DNA testing can verify
or refute disputes about paternity.  Require all fathers of AFDC
children born in 1995 or thereafter to pay child support.  If
the father claims that he cannot find employment, put him to work
in community service.  As word spreads that fathering an illegitimate
child will result in a two-decade-long financial obligation, fewer
men may be tempted to &quot;prove their masculinity.&quot;
<P>
 <LI>Consider abolishing AFDC altogether.  Redistribute AFDC funds
to group homes for unwed mothers, adoption programs and, possibly,
orphanages.  A cut-off for AFDC benefits could be phased in to
apply first to women under age 18 (or 21), then extended to women
25 and under (who bear two-thirds of all illegitimate children),
and then to the entire population.  Group homes and orphanages
should be carefully evaluated.
<P>
 <LI>Encourage sex education programs that promote abstinence. 
Many of these have cut pregnancy rates by 40 percent.  By contrast,
programs that provide contraceptive information have virtually
no success in reducing pregnancy.

<P>
<LI> Encourage adoption as the best choice for women who bear children
and lack the resources to raise them properly.

<P>
<B>I. Needed: A Strong Dose of Common Sense</B>
<P>
<B>by John Carlson</B>
<P>
 &quot;We absolutely will not tolerate the sort of back-door discrimination
against families and children that many today call 'welfare reform.'&quot;
 I can understand Washington Governor Mike Lowry making that statement
in 1966.  But in 1996?  Such unabashed '60s-speak explains much
about the governor's political unpopularity.  He has not learned
from experience.  Experience should tell him that efforts to reform
welfare don't discriminate against the family--the status quo
does.  A young mother can receive a welfare check only if she
doesn't marry the father, doesn't live at home, doesn't find a
job, and doesn't save any money.  You can't get much more anti-family
than that.
<P>
 Statistics bear this out.  Between 1962 and 1992, welfare spending
in the U.S. went up by nearly 1,000 percent in inflation-adjusted
dollars.  At the same time, as former Education Secretary William
Bennett recently wrote in <I>Commentary</I> magazine, poverty
dropped by less than five percent, and illegitimacy soared by
400 percent.  As single-parent households have proliferated, so
have crime rates, drug abuse, drop-out rates in inner-city schools
and teenage pregnancy, keeping the cycle of decay in perpetual
motion.
<P>
 A couple of years ago, after a gang-related shoot-out in one
of Tacoma's rough neighborhoods, a TV station sent in a camera
crew to get people's reactions.  As expected, community leaders
on the scene called for more jobs, fewer guns, and better social
programs.  But one local women knew better.  She looked at the
reporter and simply told the stark truth: &quot;You gotta start
asking, where are the fathers?  What happened to all the men?&quot;
<P>
 That is the question our welfare system cannot answer.  Young
men who father children out of wedlock don't have to take responsibility
for their actions.  The welfare system does it for them.  And
the mother isn't required to identify the father of the child.
 Again, you can't get much more anti-family than that.
<P>
 So what's the answer?  Before getting specific, let's be clear
about standards.  Welfare is supposed to be a temporary, stop-gap
measure to help people who have fallen on hard times.  In that
sense, we should apply the same kind of common sense to welfare
reform that we would use if someone in our own family experienced
trouble.
<P>
 Suppose your divorced sister lost her job.  She has two kids.
 Naturally, you would want to help.  First, you'd give or loan
her some money to pay some bills due at the end of the month.
 Then you'd try to help her find a job.  You'd back up her efforts
to get child support from her ex-husband.  You might buy her some
groceries.
<P>
 But for how long?  Suppose she stopped looking for work.  Suppose
you found out she was using your temporary financial help to buy
drugs.  Or that she was just hanging out with friends at the local
tavern.  Suppose she let her husband off the hook for child support.
 Would you keep subsidizing her behavior?  Of course not.  Which
raises the question, If you wouldn't subsidize the irresponsible
or illegal behavior of your own sister, why are we doing it through
our welfare system for complete strangers?
<P>
 Suppose your sister wasn't irresponsible--she just wasn't motivated.
 Let's say she couldn't find a job that paid as much as she was
earning before.  Wouldn't you expect her to accept a temporary
job that paid less and wait for a better-paying job to come along?
 Would you keep sending her money if she refused to take a lower-paying
job?  What if she couldn't find any jobs in the small town where
she lived?  Wouldn't you tell her after awhile that it was time
to move on to a place where she could find employment?
<P>
 This is the kind of genuine safety net that family members erect
for each other hundreds of thousands of times a year.  It is a
net that would unravel if not tightly woven with reasonable and
sensible expectations about how best to help others.  Why not
apply that same common sense to our welfare system?
<P>
 Fortunately, state Representative Suzette Cooke (R-Kent) has
crafted a welfare reform bill that begins to do exactly that.
 It would limit welfare benefits and include an additional period
of reduced benefits for welfare recipients who are working.  Recipients
who don't look for work would have their benefits reduced.  They
could save money without being penalized, but cash benefits would
not be increased for recipients who have more children.
<P>
 Governor Lowry might find this unfair, but I know him well enough
to say that if he were spending his own money to help someone
in his family, he'd find these conditions perfectly reasonable.
 Extending these standards of common sense to government programs
is long overdue.
<P>
<B><A NAME="washii">II. Dismantling the Welfare Culture</A></B>
<P>
<B>by Lynn Harsh and Bob Williams</B>
<P>
 There she was: a teenage mother pleading her case on TV, warning
state lawmakers of the hardships she would face if her welfare
payments were reduced.  The nicely-dressed, high school dropout
lived with her middle-class parents, but they were financially
stretched, she explained.  The baby's father?  He was not helping
out, nor did she expect him to.  She said that she needed more
time on welfare to get a college education.
<P>
 It was a picture of a welfare system gone awry--a system undergirding
promiscuity and making fatherhood irrelevant; rewarding personal
irresponsibility with a free trip to college; and allowing able
grandparents to shift the responsibility of caring for their grandchild
to the government.  Most Americans have heard similar stories
and realize that the &quot;welfare culture&quot; created by our
current system must be changed.
<P>
 In reviewing new welfare responsibilities that might soon become
the responsibility of states, legislators need to carefully examine
each current program and ask:
<P>
<ul>
 <LI>Is the program a proper function of government?
<P>
 <LI>What is the program's mission, and is that mission worth pursuing?
<P>
<LI>Given the option, would we have mandated the program?  If not,
can it be eliminated?
<P>
 <LI>If government at some level should operate the program, how
can it be done in the most efficient and cost-effective manner?
</ul><P>
 Block-granting welfare money to states should only be viewed
as a short-term approach since it does not substantially change
the relationship between givers (taxpayers) and receivers (welfare
recipients).  As soon as possible, givers must become individuals
and private charities, not different levels of government.  To
move in that direction, states should block grant funds directly
to counties and require them to contract out the delivery of welfare
services on a strict performance basis.  Counties should receive
incentives for involving private charities, and block grants at
all levels should be reduced over time.
<P>
 Washington state legislators began serious welfare reform negotiations
in 1995.  Talks broke down when the Senate refused to discuss
limiting the number of months recipients could collect benefits.
 Negotiations began again this year, but once again faltered over
the issues of time limits, family caps, and cash payments to recipients.
 The House proposal, which will likely be revived again next year,
moves in the right direction.  Among its major provisions:
<P>
<ul>
 <LI>A maximum of 36 months of assistance.  Benefits would be cut
over time.  However, there would be exemptions to the time limit
for those caring for an incapacitated person, a child under two,
and for victims of domestic or sexual assault.
<P>
 <LI> Recipients would sign contracts outlining their responsibilities
and would be required to participate in a job-training and job-search
program (with certain exemptions).
<P>
<LI> Unwed teen mothers would receive no cash payments and would
be restricted in their living arrangements and in the amount of
benefits they could receive.
<P>
<LI> Recipients in job programs would receive full child care and
transitional child care.
<P>
<LI> Unwed mothers would be required to identify the fathers of
their children.
</ul><P>
 We recommend that the state legislature also undertake the following
reforms:
<P>
<ul>
<LI> Stringently enforce child support.
<P>
<LI> Ease restrictions that make adoption difficult.
<P>
<LI> Ease regulations on private charities and offer greater tax
incentives for charitable contributions.
<P>
<LI> Change program incentives so that state welfare agencies redefine
success as the number of people removed from welfare rolls and
placed in long-term employment.
</ul>
<P>
 Interestingly, the mere talk of tough welfare reform seems to
be having an effect.  Fewer people are applying for welfare in
Washington state than last year despite no significant changes
in the law or the economy.  Experts have no explanation for this.
<P>
 We are, however, concerned about the curt dismissal of some programs
that are religious in nature.  Religion-based charities have a
far better track record of helping the needy than centralized
bureaucratic programs.  Mississippi Governor Kirk Fordice's program,
&quot;Faith and Families,&quot; should be replicated in Washington.
 It pairs welfare recipients with a church of their choice and
offers personal, practical, and spiritual guidance.
<P>
 Hundreds of charities, nonprofit organizations, and privatesector
job-training and placement programs already serve the needy. 
Many of them have a proven record of operating efficiently and
with a high degree of accountability.  In the long run, we advocate
abolishing government-run welfare entirely.  Far from being a
cruel or reckless approach, this change would help renew our families,
neighborhoods, churches, and communities--the institutions best
able to serve the needy.  Each of us must set an example and lead
the way.  No government program can compete with that kind of
first-person compassion.

<h2><B><FONT SIZE=4>The Nonprofit Sector Abroad<BR>
</FONT></B></h2>
<p>
<I> How does the nonprofit sector in the U.S. compare to that of
other countries?  What are American charities and foundations
doing to promote nonprofit organizations abroad?  This issue discusses
the role of nonprofits in Russia, China, and Sweden.  It shows
that the nonprofit sector in each country has evolved differently,
often producing marked differences, and that the involvement of
U.S. organizations in each country varies significantly.
<P>
 Jeffrey Gayner observes how a developing nonprofit sector in
Russia dealing with the aftermath of the collapse of communism
to propel Russia toward a liberal, democratic order.  Mr. Gayner
opened and directed the Moscow Office of the Heritage Foundation
from 1992 to 1994.  He is author of CRC's recent monograph The
Fulbright Program After 50 Years: From Mutual Understanding to
Mutual Support.
<P>
 Eric Brodin discusses China's less visible nonprofit sector and
describes the role U.S. foundations can play in helping to move
China toward free markets and limited government.  He also offers
an interesting case study in how Sweden's nonprofit sector is
dominated by government-subsidized interest groups and how voluntary
initiative in Sweden has been largely supplanted by the welfare
state.  Mr. Brodin is Director of the Foundation for International
Studies in Buies Creek, North Carolina.  He served as the Burrows
T. Lundy Chair Professor at Campbell University from 1980 to 1988.</i>

<H2>Russia's Emerging Nonprofit Sector:</H2>

<H3>An Interview with Jeffrey Gayner</H3>

<B> Q.</B> <I>Are U.S. foundations, corporations, and philanthropists
taking a greater interest in Russia than, say, five years ago?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> There has been an extraordinary growth of American
involvement in Russia since the collapse of Communism.  This is
best reflected in an extensive survey conducted by the Citizens
Democracy Corps, a Washington, D.C. private nonprofit organization
that has sent over 400 U.S. volunteers from the private sector
to help build democratic institutions and free markets in the
central and eastern Europe.  What began as a short survey, which
I assisted in when directing at the Moscow Office of the Heritage
Foundation, eventually became a 347-page book covering U.S. organizations'
involvement in all of central and eastern Europe.  The study revealed
that as of 1994, 407 American organizations had programs in Russia
and 128 had set up offices there.
<P>
 This only included academic and philanthropic activities.  Business
activities have also expanded rapidly.  Currently, over 800 U.S.
companies are registered with the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.  Moreover,
of an estimated $4 billion in foreign private investments in Russia,
$2.2 billion has come from American companies.
<P>
<B> Q.</B> <I>What are some of the main economic, political, and
social reforms that nonprofits have helped to promote?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> Thus far, nonprofits' involvement in social reforms
has lagged behind their push for political and economic reforms.
 Their main endeavors have been academic and research-oriented.
 American universities have established or broadened existing
exchange programs.  Research institutes have studied aspects of
economic and political reform.  And religious and humanitarian
groups have rapidly moved into Russia where their activities were
once prohibited or largely non-existent.
<P>
 Since virtually no academic freedom existed under communism,
serious research was narrowly constrained.  Western groups have
brought a whole new way of operating and thinking into Russian
society.  Individuals promoting free-market economic reforms,
who remained largely underground until recently, readily make
use of the advice and assistance provided by U.S. and other Western
groups.
<P>
 The Heritage Foundation worked directly with leading members
of the parliament in drafting legislation in areas where we offered
American expertise--agriculture and land laws, bankruptcy, banking,
privatization, and regulating lobbying activities.  In the political
realm, the system of creating parties and holding elections relied
heavily on Washington, D.C.-based groups such as the Krieble Institute,
the National Endowment for Democracy and its international Republican
and Democratic Institutes, and the International Foundation for
Electoral Systems, an election monitoring group.
<P>
<B> Q.</B> <I>Are voluntary associations, such as relief organizations,
clubs and associations increasing in number?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> Yes.  In particular, business groups are forming that
have published an avalanche of materials and have held numerous
meetings to better understand the new economic environment.  The
Enterprise and Economic Development Program in Moscow, started
by the Citizens Democracy Corps, has sought to create a mechanism
for cooperation among emerging Russian business organizations.
<P>
 Numerous humanitarian organizations have also proliferated, often
started by established Western groups.  Both the Salvation Army
and World Vision have set up relief operations with Russian counterparts.
 Some Russian Orthodox religious leaders have promoted similar
activities, such as Alexander Borisov, who has established a support
mechanism for the Russian Children's Hospital.  Through a coordinated
effort, several Western protestant groups have created Co-Mission,
which seeks to infuse the teaching of ethics and morality into
Russian schools.  The Christian Legal Society was created in Moscow
with the help of the Law and Liberty Trust, based in Virginia,
to create a legal basis for religious freedom in Russia.
<P>
 In addition, individual and group efforts to lobby arose so quickly
in 1992 that the parliament, then the Russian Supreme Soviet,
restricted access to its building to prevent &quot;interruptions&quot;
in its work.  Since the December 1993 elections, which created
a new parliament, more public input has been welcomed.
<P>
<B> Q.</B> <I>What are some of the main obstacles voluntary organizations
face?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> Many people are reluctant to join organizations because
they retain a lifelong wariness of speaking and acting in an open
and forthright manner in dealing with controversial issues.  Another
main problem is financial: no recent tradition exists for paying
membership dues.  In a relatively poor society, even modest membership
fees are difficult to collect.  Moreover, the communist party
was the only large membership organization--not an encouraging
precedent.  Furthermore, new businesses, struggling to survive
high taxes and heavy regulation, are largely unwilling to make
contributions to organizations, or even to advertise in publications,
unless they are guaranteed a favorable news story on their behalf.
<P>
<B> Q.</B> <I>What are some areas in which the voluntary sector
can begin to replace government functions?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> Given the dismal state of government services, voluntary
organizations have quickly moved in to offer alternatives in a
vast range of areas.  Private education, from non-government schools
to day care to summer camps, has emerged.  Western religious groups
as well as the Russian Orthodox Church have expanded activities,
particularly in providing relief services, such as soup kitchens.
 Neighborhood associations have formed to deal with common housing
problems as well as with setting up security networks to supplement
the police.
<P>
<B> Q.</B> <I>How many market-oriented research organizations
are there now in Russia?  What are the main issues they are studying
and how effective have they been?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> Nearly all the research organizations that exist now
in Russia claim the moniker &quot;market-oriented.&quot;  Using
that phrase almost magically opens the door to Western financial
support.  Unfortunately, many longstanding research organizations
simply changed the nameplates on their doors after the demise
of communism and pay mostly lip service to a market philosophy.
 Only six or seven groups have consistently and seriously pursued
the kind of radical economic reform needed to bring about a transformation
of the economy.
<P>
 Most prominent among them have been the Institute for the Study
of the Russian Economy, a small group of independent, market-oriented
scholars; the International Center for Research in Economic Reform,
which has worked as a semi-autonomous research unit closer to
government; and particularly, the Institute for the Economy in
Transition, created by Yegor Gaidar, who headed Russia's Choice
Party in the parliament last year.  These organizations have largely
supplemented the often stagnant work on economic reform done by
government ministries.  But by being outside the formal ministries,
they have avoided much of the bureaucratic legacy that haunts
new Russian policy initiatives.
<P>
 With the recent expulsion of the last leading reformers from
the Russian government, particularly Anatoli Chubais as Deputy
Minister for Economic Policy, it is uncertain how effective genuine
reform-oriented research groups will be in affecting government
policy.  More attention will probably shift to the parliament,
public debate in the press, and work with Western groups and governments
to sustain reform initiatives.
<P>
<B> Q.</B> <I>What promising signs or trends do you see in Russia
that offer hope for the reemergence of civil society?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> The most encouraging developments remain the general
openness of Russian society and the genuinely free debate on all
issues.  Unfortunately, as the recent elections have shown, demagoguery
can accompany democracy and adversely impact the election results.
 But important generational differences also exist, with younger
people both acting and voting in a more Western manner.
<P>
 Perhaps most important in the long run is the extensive interchange
of Russians and Westerners at the non-government level, whether
through university educational programs or other exchange programs.
 The Washington, D.C.-based National Forum Foundation and the
San Francisco-based Center for Citizen Initiatives have brought
over 400 Russians to the U.S. to intern with private companies,
news organizations, and research institutes.  This interaction
has hopefully fostered an appreciation of what Russia could become.
<P>
 In Russia, people are quickly coming to realize that they must
rely on themselves and their local communities to improve their
lives.  With a growing understanding of how the non-government
sector addresses problems elsewhere in the world, Russians are
seizing such opportunities.
<P>
<B> Q.</B> <I>What are some of the worrisome signs?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> Overcoming the psychological legacy of communism is
proving far more difficult than eradicating its political institutions,
especially among the elderly.  While appalled by the former communist
system, many people nonetheless retain much of the communist criticism
of capitalism.  Many remain wedded to dependency on government
subsidies.  They know that prices, such as for bread, should not
be artificially low, but they rebel against market prices.  People
remain suspicious of anyone who makes money.  The egalitarian
impulse coupled with widely reported abuses under the existing
system has created a reaction against reform.
<P>
 The situation, especially in the political area, will likely
retrogress in the immediate future.  But government incompetence
will also give individuals and local communities wide latitude
to solve problems on their own.
<P>
<B> Q.</B> <I>How can donors identify organizations that are actually
helping the needy or promoting civil society while staying clear
of groups run by con artists or groups that are not really committed
to change?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> Donors need on-the-ground-experience to ensure that
their programs reach intended targets.  They must look beyond
the names of organizations and the eloquence with which some Russians
speak English.  Although it is initially more expensive to have
Westerners direct foreign offices, only over time can properly
trained Russians be brought to leading levels of responsibility.
<P>
 Five years has elapsed since the fall of communism, and it is
now fairly easy to tell who actually promotes reform.  Whenever
possible, donors should work with those who challenged the system
from the beginning.  Since many of these people spent time in
prison instead of in academic settings, they may not be particularly
&quot;polished,&quot; but they clearly have the most fervent commitment
to creating a durable civil society.  Similarly, younger people
are among the easiest to deal with since they can absorb change
more rapidly.
<P>
<B> Q.</B> <I>What can donors do to ensure that their gifts are
not diverted?  Can sending in-kind gifts help guard against diversion?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> Donors should always try to provide direct or in-kind
support.  It best to bring fax machines and computers directly
into the country, rather than send money.  Equipment can also
be purchased locally, but can be much more expensive.
<P>
 As a demonstration of goodwill, donors should seek out local
organizations to provide additional support.  Avoiding government
institutions is critical because of the expense and bureaucratic
quagmires.  Donors who are harassed about bringing in-kind support
into the country should seek help from local contacts or possibly
the U.S. Embassy.
<P>
<B> Q.</B> <I>What are some organizations that you have a high
regard for?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> The most admirable groups are the ones fighting for
the most radical changes, often under the most adverse conditions.
 The Glasnost Foundation, for example, began work by taking advantage
of the initial openness under President Gorbachev.  It has pressed
vigorously for respect for human rights and a complete end to
the totalitarian system.  In recent years, despite continuous
harassment, it has critically examined the role of the KGB, both
in the past and present.  Helsinki Watch and Freedom House, both
in New York City, and the Democratic Russia-USA Foundation and
the Jamestown Foundation, both in Washington, D.C., have similarly
monitored and assisted in the expansion of civil liberties.  All
have offices in Moscow.
<P>
 The New York City-based Soros Foundation/Open Society Fund, created
by Hungarian-born businessman George Soros, has provided massive
private support to the academic community and has supported conferences
that have played a valuable role in stimulating thinking about
the nature of a free society.  The Washington, D.C.-based Krieble
Institute has created a network of fellows throughout Russia and
has held conferences that have made a major contribution to the
development of a reform-oriented political order.
<P>
<B> Q.</B> <I>What do you think the voluntary sector will look
like in Russia five years from now?</I>
<P>
<B> A.</B> The voluntary sector will play an increasingly critical
role in the transformation of Russia in the next several years,
particularly if communists and ultra-nationals do as well in the
presidential election this June as they did in parliamentary elections
last December.  With a government apparently retreating from reform,
the effort to sustain and expand upon reforms already made will
have to rely more on non-government organizations.  The government
may ultimately decide to take action against these groups.  Thus,
the higher international profile they develop in the next six
months may be critical not only to their influence but to their
survival.<P>

<H2>The Giant Awakes:<BR>
The Emergence of Nonprofit Organizations in China<BR></H2>
by Eric Brodin<BR>
<P>
 Napoleon is reputed to have said, &quot;Let China sleep, for
when she awakes, the world will tremble.&quot;
<P>
 The giant is very much alive today.  The People's Republic of
China is the world's most populous country with an estimated population
of 1.4 billion.  It is third largest in land area and the eighth
richest.  GDP is expected to grow from $2,838 billion (U.S. 1994
dollars) to $8,877 billion by 2010.<SUP>1</SUP>  While these statistics
look impressive, however, China's immense population must be kept
in mind: annual per capita income is only about $350.
<P>
 The Heritage Foundation's <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I> says
this about China: &quot;[It is economically] more advanced and
open than it was several decades ago.  Many of the economic reforms
of the 1980s were undone following the Tiananmen Square massacre
in 1989.  However, since that time, China once again has pursued
economic liberalization.&quot;  However, the report warns that
&quot;an overwhelmingly large part of [China's economy] remains
under state control.&quot;<SUP>2</SUP>
<P>
 Wealth is now being created--both legally and illegally--at an
almost furious pace in the coastal areas, such as Fujian province.
 But the as-yet underdeveloped legal system, which is needed to
protect contracts, and oppressive government regulation remain
serious hindrances to liberalization, and China's human rights
record is dismal.  Still, barring unanticipated reversals by China's
aging political leadership, a cautiously optimistic view of China's
future--and the development of its voluntary sector--is warranted.
<P>

<HR>
<H2>China's &quot;Voluntary Sector&quot;</H2>

 Little is known about the voluntary sector in China today, although
China has a rich history of philanthropy.<SUP>3</SUP>  Early in
this century, every large city had voluntary organizations that
provided relief to the needy and promoted civic betterment.  By
the end of World war II, private and semi-private organizations
supported one-third of China's educational institutions, and churches
joined with other charities to provide medical care, education,
and relief services.
<P>
 With the rise of the communist state in the 1950s, independent
charities were forced to cease operation as the government assumed
responsibility for poverty relief, education, and welfare.  Ostensibly,
voluntary organizations such as youth groups, residents' committees,
and professional associations flourished.  Not until the 1980s,
under a policy of decentralization and denationalization, did
genuine charitable organizations again become officially recognized.
<P>
 According to one 1989 study, there are well over one million
organizations in China today, including political organizations,
scientific and professional associations, social clubs, unions,
residents' committees, self-help organizations, and private welfare
agencies.  Most of these, however, receive government funding.
<P>

<HR>
<H2>The Rise of NGOs in China</H2>

 In 1993, leaders of several American foundations, headed by John
W. Cook of the Henry Luce Foundation, traveled to the cities of
Beijing, Shanghai, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Hong Kong to learn about
the role of China's so-called &quot;non-government organizations.&quot;
 The other delegates were: David M. Lampton of the National Committee
on U.S.-China Relations (NCUSCR); Kevin F.F. Quigley, formerly
with the Pew Charitable Trusts; Peter Riggs of the Rockefeller
Brothers Fund; William J. Van Ness, Jr. of the Henry M. Jackson
Foundation; Patricia D. Wright of the Amoco Foundation; and Jon
Vondracek of the Johnson Foundation.
<P>
 A NCUSCR report, <I>The Rise of Non-Governmental Organizations
in China: Implications for Americans</I>, summarizes the group's
findings: &quot;Economic reform . . . is having wide-ranging consequences.
. . .  New social groups, with economic resources at their disposal,
[are] arising and making demands. . . .&quot;  This has provoked
a mixed response from government, which favors new wealth to &quot;help
solve social problems and generate resources, but at the same
time . . . deeply fears the loss of control that such developments
entail.&quot;<SUP>4</SUP>
<P>
 The report notes that the Chinese government is heavily involved
in what can loosely be described as a nonprofit sector, and it
gives examples of what it paradoxically calls &quot;government-owned
non-government organizations.&quot;  These do things quite similar
to Western nonprofits:
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> The China Youth Development Foundation's
Project Hope seeks to educate children in 25 of China's poorest
provinces.  It has created 62 primary schools and provided funds
to 328,000 school dropouts.  In 1993, it gave financial assistance
to about 1,000 secondary school students and 100 college students.
 The report notes, however, that Project Hope's degree of autonomy
is difficult to determine: &quot;It is unclear what relationship
the [foundation] has to local government agencies.&quot;<SUP>5</SUP>
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> The Hwa Nan Women's College was
created around the turn of the century by the Ladies Missionary
Society of Baltimore.  By 1917, it had a fully accredited B.A.
program.  In 1951, the communist regime took it over, merging
it with Fukian Christian College and the Provincial Agricultural
College.  Hwa Nan College has since been reestablished, but like
Project Hope, its autonomy is ambiguous: it remains heavily dependent
on public funding, although individual donors and tuitions provide
some revenue.
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> The Beijing Energy Efficiency
Center is a joint project of Batelle Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory
and China's State Planning Commission.  It seeks to promote energy
efficiency &quot;to achieve economic development and environmental
protection.&quot;  While partly managed by the government, it
is financially independent, receiving all funds from its U.S.
founders.  Its charter calls for eventual independence from the
government.
<P>

<HR>
<H2>Creating a Framework for Nonprofits</H2>

 To support the creation of a nonprofit sector in China, the NCUSCR
report makes the following recommendations:
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> Laws must be passed that would
establish and regulate non-governmental organizations, assuring
their autonomy and requiring accountability;
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> The development of a vibrant
NGO sector would require an updated banking system and effective
taxation practices;
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> NGOs in China must develop good
management practices, including systems that establish organizational
purposes and methods to accomplish them;
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> Control procedures must be adopted
to strengthen the legal status of NGOs.  This would require a
greater openness in accounting and control procedures.  Well-established
American foundations could do much to help establish methods for
fiscal responsibility.
<P>

<HR>
<H2>What U.S. Nonprofits Can Do</H2>

 U.S. nonprofits have a vital role to play in China because the
development of nonprofits there is so uncertain.  While many U.S.
foundations and public policy groups have visited China, those
that have sought to promote a market economy are perhaps doing
the most to create conditions for a genuine nonprofit sector.
 Both the Washington, D.C.-based Cato Institute and the Fairfax,
Virginia-based Atlas Foundation have hosted conferences in Beijing.
 The latter event, co-hosted by the market-oriented Friedrich
Naumann Foundation of Germany, attracted 60 scholars, half of
them Chinese.  To support the creation of a liberal and stable
democracy, both conferences highlighted ways to promote free markets,
privatization, private property, civil rights, and private initiative.
<P>
 While encouraging a nonprofit sector in China, U.S. nonprofits
need to anticipate three trends likely to affect China's future:
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> A growing, educated, and affluent
middle class can be expected to organize itself and express its
concerns;
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> The Chinese traditions of family
self-help and loyalty to one's clan (tong) may serve as catalysts
for locally based private initiatives if China moves toward a
more limited role for government;
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> Under the most favorable scenario,
continued trade with Taiwan and Hong Kong as well as the incorporation
of Hong Kong into mainland China in 1997 may help propel China
toward freer markets and create more opportunities for voluntary
initiatives.

<H2>The Nonprofit Sector in Sweden:<BR>
Personal Reflections<BR></H2>
by Eric Brodin

<P>
 As a young boy I remember walking the streets of my native city,
Gothenburg (G&ouml;teborg), Sweden's second largest city.  On
occasion I would come across a large building on whose facade
was written <I>stiftelse</I>, signifying that this was a charitable
institution founded by a wealthy family with old money.  In the
class-based Sweden of my youth, it was understood that the wealthy
were to part with some of their fortune to help the needy.
<P>
 But when Sweden became a socialist welfare state, the role of
<I>stiftelse</I> diminished.  Since the Socialist Party won a
parliamentary majority in 1932, it has remained in power but for
two brief periods, 1976-82 and 1991-94.  As a result of socialist
legislation, propaganda, and other pressures, the nongovernmental
sector of society has lost much of its independence and sense
of mission.  Instead of allowing a rich diversity of independent
charities to flourish, the Swedish government today heavily subsidizes
organizations that serve protected special interests.
<P>

<HR>
<H2>Nonprofits: Wedded to Government</H2>

 Unlike American nonprofits, most organizations in Sweden are
closely tied to local and central government.  In this respect,
the are more like the &quot;non-government organizations&quot;
of China.  John Boli of Sweden's University of Lund makes these
observations:
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> With some 200,000 organizations
and over 31 million memberships in a population of 8.3 million,
Sweden's per capita membership in organizations is among the largest
in the world;
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> Swedish organizations focus on
social reform and political advocacy, recreation, and the protection
of organized interests;
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> There are few private organizations
that run Swedish schools, provide health care, or offer welfare
services.  Charitable efforts are directed primarily to poor countries
in Africa and Asia.
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> Swedish groups work closely with
local and central government.  They are heavily dependent on taxes
and receive little private funding.<SUP>1</SUP>
<P>
 Observers of Swedish society have noted that individualism is
little valued by Swedes while membership in and identification
with groups is widely approved.  Roland Huntford notes that &quot;the
country is adapted to dealing, not with the individual, but with
corporate bodies, and the citizen is therefore expected to belong
to some organization catering to his occupation and interests.&quot;<SUP>2</SUP>
 Swedish national life is dominated by <I>f&ouml;reningar</I>,
or associations representing workers, renters, the elderly, and
other interest groups.  These serve as ombudsmen or official moderators
between organized interest groups and the government.
<P>
 Organizations associated with the socialist and labor movements
receive particularly heavy government subsidies.  In 1986-87,
adult education groups also received 70 percent of their revenues
from government.  A 1980 survey of six municipalities found the
following proportions of government funding: sports groups, 29
percent; scouting groups, 43 percent; temperance societies, 51
percent; religious groups, 25 percent.<SUP>3</SUP>  Even the Lutheran
Church, the official state church of Sweden, to which 90 percent
of the population belongs, is funded by general tax revenues and
a special church tax.  Until recently, non-Lutherans were required
to pay 60 percent of the church tax on the grounds that the Church
maintained vital records.
<P>
 Most other religious groups also receive government subsidies
for their youth and charitable work.  These include mainline evangelical
groups, such as the Methodists, Baptists, and Pentecostals, and
so-called &quot;foreign&quot; churches, including the Roman Catholic
and Greek Orthodox faiths.  Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses, however,
have refused all forms of state aid.  Interestingly, these are
the fastest growing religious denominations in Sweden.
<P>

<HR>
<H2>Associations and Foundations</H2>

 Sweden has many charities and foundations that benefit children
and the disabled, that support museums and theaters, and that
recognize athletic achievement.  Many of these were created by
wealthy families and individuals, and some are still controlled
by private companies or descendants of the original donors.  As
in the U.S., Swedish charities and foundations are generally exempt
from taxation if they serve a &quot;public good.&quot;  However,
contributions to charities are not tax-deductible.  Unlike U.S.
nonprofits, most Swedish organizations now receive much of their
funding from government.
<P>
 A look at the Stockholm telephone directory shows a tremendous
range of foundations, charities, and advocacy groups similar to
those in the U.S.:
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> The Women's Forum Foundation
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> Friends of Sobriety Foundation
<P>
 <FONT FACE="Wingdings"></FONT> Computers for the Handicapped

<H2>&quot;The Atrophy of Personal Charity&quot;</H2>

 The role of associations, charities, and foundations in Sweden
today largely reflects a political atmosphere created by a half-century's
growth of the public sector.  Acts of voluntarism that many Americans
would praise are often viewed with suspicion or hostility by Swedes.
 Volunteers in hospitals and at school crossings are often opposed
by vested interests such as unions.
<P>
 Sweden is therefore an instructive example of what the late Russell
Kirk called &quot;the atrophy of personal charity.&quot;  When
the government is expected to provide an array of services funded
through taxes, we feel less obliged to practice small acts of
personal kindness and giving.  The desire to overcome common difficulties
through voluntary effort is largely lost.<BR>

<H2>A Village Called Washington<BR>
Hillary Clinton's <I>It Takes a Village<BR>
</I></H2>

 Recent years have seen an outpouring of books, reports, and articles
examining the status of children in the U.S. and proposing largely
political remedies to the problems they face.  To this can be
added Hillary Rodham Clinton's <I>It Takes a Village and other
Lessons Children Teach Us</I> (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster,
1996, 318 pages).  Writing from the perspective of one who has
been both &quot;mother, daughter, sister, and wife&quot;--and
staff attorney at the liberal Children's Defense Fund--Mrs. Clinton
seeks to offer &quot;lessons&quot; to help us better understand
and satisfy the needs of children.
<P>
 The irresolute reader is cautioned: despite Mrs. Clinton's claim
that the book is not &quot;a textbook or an encyclopedia,&quot;
it often resembles a discourse on anything and everything related
to children.  Included are tips on child-rearing--&quot;Applaud
and encourage learning for learning's sake, whether it's cloud-watching
or understanding what keeps a kite in the sky or mixing paints
to make new colors&quot;--as well as nutritional advice--&quot;[eat]
more grains, beans, fish, fruits, and vegetables and less meat,
fat, and sugar.&quot;  Some remarks reminded this reviewer of
the proverbial dinner guest who stays until three in the morning--&quot;It
surprised us to discover that Chelsea did not like hot dogs and
hamburgers--when we went to McDonald's, it was strictly Chicken
McNuggets for her.&quot;
<P>
 Despite its long-windedness, the book is less concerned with
how to raise children than with drumming up support for federal
laws, regulations, and programs that the author believes are needed
to protect children.  According to Mrs. Clinton, children today
are &quot;under unprecedented threat&quot; from &quot;anti-government&quot;
extremists.  We may soon see &quot;a decrease in federal pollution
standards&quot; and &quot;the elimination of federal regulations
that protect us from outbreaks of contaminated drinking water.&quot;
 Current efforts to devolve authority in these areas to state
and local governments are ignored by the book's not-so-subtle
theme: federal downsizing will hurt children.
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton believes that the main challenge facing us today
is to agree on &quot;a common vision&quot; of how &quot;to build
strong families and communities&quot;--what she calls a caring
&quot;village&quot; that will help children reach their full potential.
 But what she offers is the status quo, plus a few more federal
programs.  The key institution of the village is a strong central
government that provides extensive support to parents and communities
in all aspects of child care, from vaccinations to food assistance
to day care.  The author never recognizes that to fund the many
programs she favors, resources must be taken from the private
sector, leaving parents and communities with fewer resources of
their own to meet childrens' needs.
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton does have some reasonable ideas.  She wants to reduce
foster-care and adoption roles by 100,000 annually, partly by
terminating biological parents' rights more quickly.  She favors
charter schools and choice among public schools.  She also praises
community-based programs that are addressing crime, drug abuse,
and other problems.  But while urging readers to resist &quot;the
lure of extremist rhetoric,&quot; she seems unable to resist the
lure of greater federal activism.
<P>
 Among the responsibilities she sees for government: &quot;to
provide essential services,&quot; &quot;to support families at
work and at home,&quot; and &quot;to build communities that fulfill
their obligations to families, the environment, and those who
need and deserve support.&quot;  This everything-under-the-sun
role prompts her to call for more government-funded job training,
an increase in the minimum wage (&quot;a modest increase,&quot;
she claims, &quot;does not cost jobs&quot;), and praise for a
host of supposedly vital programs that many Americans have never
heard of, such as C. Everett Koop's Shape Up America, the U.S.D.A.'s
Team Nutrition, and the President's Council on Physical Fitness
and Sports.
<P>
 But Mrs. Clinton suggests that the federal government do more.
 The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which allows employees
of large companies to take 12 weeks' unpaid leave to care for
newborns, is a &quot;good beginning.&quot;  The real models, however,
are Germany, which grants tax-funded paid maternity leave for
14 weeks, and Sweden, which pays a full 15 months' leave.  France
is praised for its extensive government-funded preschool system
which provides &quot;sparkling classrooms&quot; and highly credentialed
teachers.  The author notes in passing that &quot;the price for
such generous social programs is felt across the board in higher
taxes.&quot;  She might have also mentioned less economic growth,
higher unemployment rates, and staggering national debts.
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton often seems oblivious to the benefits of choice
in the marketplace as well as to the costs of her suggestions.
 A major problem with day care in the U.S., she believes, is the
&quot;dizzying&quot; variety of options: care in private homes,
commercial day-care centers, university and parochial preschools,
nannies, relatives, and babysitters.  &quot;Many parents do not
know what to look for when choosing child care.&quot;  Presumably,
the local bookstore or library--can best address this &quot;problem&quot;
the government--not advice from neighbors or information from
of too many choices.  She also suggests a need for federal oversight
of day care, since home-based and commercial day-care providers
are subject to a &quot;hodgepodge&quot; of regulations and licensing
requirements that vary by state.  That federal requirements would
drive up day-care costs, adversely affecting lower-income parents,
goes unnoticed.
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton believes that Americans do not want a &quot;rollback&quot;
of government, only &quot;reform.&quot;  Yet more Americans seem
to think that the cost of big government--both in terms of dollars
ill spent and in weakened responsibilities for families, charities,
and voluntary associations--has become too high.  The voluntary
institutions that comprise real villages will thrive--as her husband
suggests--only by ending the era of big government.

<h2>Tax-Funded Politics</h2>
<HR>
<P>
<small>Reformers in Congress want to strengthen laws restricting tax-funded
politicsthe practice of federal departments and agencies awarding
grants to nonprofit organizations that use the money to lobby
for higher taxes, more government, and more grants for nonprofits.
No one knows exactly how much is spent on political advocacy of
the estimated $39 billion that the federal government gives to
nonprofits each year. But the Capital Research Center and other
groups have disclosed many questionable grants. Although there
are many laws that restrict such activity, they have not been
well enforced.
<P>
This issue contains two articles that examine grants made by
the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control
to nonprofit anti-smoking organizations. James T. Bennett, a professor
of economics at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia,
and Thomas J. DiLorenzo, a Senior Fellow at the Capital Research
Center and professor of economics at Loyola College in Baltimore,
discuss how tax dollars intended for disease research and public
health education have been diverted into political advocacy. These
articles should serve as a wake-up call for Congress, taxpayers,
and nonprofit donors.

<h3>The National Cancer Institute and Colorado's Project ASSIST</h3>
<P>
by Dr. James T. Bennett 
<P>

<P>
The July 1995 issue of <I>Alternatives in Philanthropy</I> (&quot;Project
ASSIST: Image and Reality&quot;) described how the National Cancer
Institute (NCI), part of the federal government's National Institutes
of Health, has provided anti-smoking organizations with as much
as $100 million in federal tax revenues to lobby for higher tobacco
taxes at the state level. The NCI's Project ASSIST, the American
Stop Smoking Intervention Study for Cancer Prevention, is the
major funding vehicle for this campaign.
<P>
Project ASSIST was largely spearheaded by the American Cancer
Society (ACS), the nation's largest and best-known health charity.
Officially launched in 1991, ASSIST ostensibly supports grassroots
groups that organize public education campaigns to discourage
smoking. This follow-up article examines the actual operation
of ASSIST in the state of Colorado. It shows how federal funds
were illegally used to promote a ballot initiative to raise the
state's tobacco tax.
<P>
Far more is known about operations of ASSIST in Colorado than
in other states where ASSIST grants have been awarded because
a lawsuit was recently filed against the Colorado Department of
Health, the agency charged with disbursing ASSIST funds in that
state. The suit alleged the improper use of ASSIST funds and illegal
lobbying by state health department officials. Documents related
to this case provide revealing information about how ASSIST was
developed in Colorado, its activities, and the personalities involved.
<P>
What emerges is a complex and twisted tale: front groups were
created to provide a smokescreen for lobbying; state bureaucrats
used state offices to facilitate lobbying; and positions of authority
were sold, with those hoping to acquire a share of the projected
tax revenue paying &quot;front money&quot; to secure their positions.
<P>
<B>Colorado's Amendment 1: Self-Interest Disguised as Public Health</B>

<P>
Colorado was in many ways an ideal state from the perspective
of those organizing Project ASSIST. For more than a decade, anti-smoking
groups had been active, and one of their prime objectives had
been to raise tobacco taxes. Colorado's constitution also allowed
citizen-initiated referenda. Against this backdrop, the National
Cancer Institute awarded the Colorado Department of Health (CDH)
an ASSIST contract, providing $6,976,683 for the period September
20, 1991 to September 29, 1998. The CDH would in turn provide
ASSIST funds to local anti-smoking groups.
<P>
On November 19, 1993, anti-smoking activists filed an &quot;initiative
regarding Tobacco Taxes&quot; with the Colorado Department of
State. If the initiative passed, taxes on cigarettes would be
raised on July 1, 1995 by 50 cents per pack and taxes on cigars
and smokeless tobacco would be increased by 50 percent of the
manufacturer's list price.
<P>
Purportedly, the goal of anti-smoking activists was to reduce
smoking by 43 percent in Colorado. If improved public health were
the sole objective, however, the disincentive of higher tobacco
prices should have been sufficient. But substantial tax revenuesan
estimated $130 million per yearwere to be distributed as follows:
<UL>
<LI>$65 million to medical professionals and hospitals for health
care of the needy;
<LI>$39 million to anti-smoking activists and health charities
for educational programs to reduce tobacco use;
<LI>$13 million to academics and public interest groups for research
on tobacco use.
</UL>

<P>
Another $13 million was to be divided among municipalities, counties,
economic development initiatives, and an 11-member citizens' commission.
This would be composed of individualsmost likely health charity
officials, medical professionals, and anti-smoking activistswho
would oversee the disbursement of revenues. While they would be
unpaid, no doubt they would take many expense-account trips to
anti-smoking meetings held at pleasant venues in the U.S. and
abroad.
<P>
<B>The Fair Share For Health Committee and Colorado ASSIST</B>

<P>
In March of 1993, the Fair Share for Health Committee (FSFHC),
a 501(c)(4) lobbying organization, was created to promote the
tax initiative. As shown in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>, its membership was essentially
a who's who of the Colorado hospital, medical, and health charity
professions. The overlap between FSFHC membership and membership
in Colorado ASSIST, a 501(c)(3) educational organization created
to receive Project ASSIST funds, is substantial. Colorado ASSIST's
executive committee included representatives of the American Cancer
Society, Colorado Department of Health, and the Coalition for
a Tobacco-Free Colorado (CTFC), a 501(c)(3) organization instrumental
in securing the ASSIST grant.
<P>
The activities of one anti-smoking activist, Arnold Levinson,
illustrate the ties between FSFHC and Colorado ASSIST. Levinson,
formerly an assistant city editor for the <I>Colorado Springs
Gazette</I>, served as a Colorado ASSIST consultant, helping &quot;extensively
in the design of Colorado ASSIST.&quot; He was also executive
director of FSFHC, and was thus in charge of promoting the tobacco
tax initiative.
<P>
Colorado ASSIST paid Levinson $50 per hour for his services under
an initial contract for 930 hours. Other contracts followedone
for $46,500 during the period 1992-1993 and another for $60 per
hour for the period 1993-1998. Thus, Colorado ASSIST, a federally
funded organization, paid Levinson while he organized the tax
initiative. It also reimbursed Levinson for travel costs to Grand
Junction and Durango, where he gave &quot;presentation[s] on tobacco
taxes.&quot;
<P>
<B>The Coalition for a Tobacco-Free Colorado</B> 
<P>
Another anti-smoking activist, Walter F. &quot;Snip&quot; Young,
served as director of Prevention Programs at the Colorado Department
of Health and was also the director of Colorado ASSIST. CDH's
&quot;Best and Final&quot; grant proposal to the NCI noted that
Young learned in 1987 of a possible ASSIST grant in Colorado:
&quot;[Young] informed the Coalition for a Tobacco-Free Colorado,
which includes representatives of the American Heart Association
of Colorado and the American Lung Association. . . . In Spring
1988 . . . , Mr. Young convened a series of informal discussions
with the executive directors of ALA-Colorado and AHA-Colorado
to discuss their prospective roles in the project. As national
ASSIST planners disclosed information about the Project, Mr. Young
shared this information with the voluntary health agencies through
formal discussions with an ad hoc committee of the [CTFC]. .
.&quot;
<P>
CTFC's 501(c)(3) status would seem to preclude political activity,
but this restriction was ignored in the early stages of the tax
initiative. On January 6, 1993, Young and Peter Bialick, president
of the anti-smoking group GASP of Colorado, sent a letter on CTFC
stationary to anti-smoking activists. It said that &quot;The Coalition
for a Tobacco-Free Colorado is on its way to placing a ballot
initiative to increase the state tobacco tax before the voters
in 1994. We need your help to construct the language of the petition
[at a day-long retreat]. . . . Morning presentations will explain
the rationale for tobacco taxes and the successful experiences
of California and Massachusetts. The afternoon will be a work
session where we will discuss and agree on the principal objectives
of the petition language. . . .&quot;
<P>
A main topic of the retreat was money. Participants approved an
organizational structure for promoting the initiative that included
a board of directors and an executive committee charged with conducting
campaign operations. Organizations that wanted to obtain a seat
on the boardand thus influence in determining what groups would
receive the projected tax revenuewere required to pay $10,000.
<P>
Significantly, more than half the organizations on CTFC's initial
board were also members of the lobbying group Fair Share for Health
Committee (see Table 1, entries marked &#167;). Four other groups
involved in FSFHC were also affiliated with CTFC (Table 1, entries
marked ). By January 1993, CTFC had more than a dozen sponsors
or affiliated organizations who were also members of FSFHC. Thus,
for all intents and purposes, these two organizations were indistinguishable,
even though one was ostensibly a tax-deductible, tax-funded educational
group and the other a political lobbying organization.
<P>
<B>The National Cancer Institute</B> 
<P>
NCI was aware that the objective of Colorado ASSIST was to raise
state taxes and that federal funds would be used for this purpose.
Documents that the Colorado Department of Health submitted to
NCI clearly and repeatedly emphasize the tax theme:
<P>
<ul>
<LI>Colorado should &quot;increase economic incentives and taxation
to discourage the use of tobacco products;&quot;
<P>
<li>&quot;The price of tobacco products needs to be greatly increased
through taxes and/or sales-license fees;&quot;
<P>
<li>&quot;The Colorado ASSIST Alliance will work to increase public
knowledge of the need to increase the cigarette tax substantially;&quot;
<P>
<LI>&quot;Educational presentations will be made to all [areas] regarding
the need and current efforts to increase tobacco taxes;&quot;
<P>
<LI>&quot;Strategies to advocate increased tobacco taxes will be
incorporated into the ASSIST media plan;&quot;
<P>
<li>&quot;Information will be presented . . . regarding the rationale
and need for sales license fees on tobacco sales.&quot;
<P></ul>
Other CDH materials clearly show that ASSIST funds were used for
political activity. Expense reports submitted by Connie Acott,
an ASSIST consultant and founding board member of CTFC, to the
CDH note that Colorado ASSIST meetings concerning the &quot;tax
initiative&quot; and the &quot;coalition tax initiative&quot;
were held in August and November 1992. Another Colorado ASSIST
expense report refers to a meeting of the organization's &quot;Political
Advocacy Team,&quot; held on April 15, 1993.
<P>
<B>Tax Dollars Down the Drain</B> 
<P>
Organizations promoting the tax initiative lost little time in
obtaining ASSIST money from the CDH. <a href="#table2">Table 2</a> is a partial list
of groups that received ASSIST contracts during 1993-1994. A comparison
of Tables 1 and 2 shows that substantial funds were given to organizations
involved in the Fair Share For Health's tax initiative.
<P>
How were these funds used? Recipients were required to complete
contract reimbursement forms and an &quot;Activity Matrix,&quot;
one of whose goals&quot;Economic Incentive to Decrease Tobacco
Use&quot;lists the following activities: &quot;Educate re excise
taxes,&quot; &quot;attend training,&quot; and &quot;coordinate
publicity/media.&quot; Activities related to the tax initiative
were reported on this form. Reports submitted by grant recipients
requesting payment are also revealing. They show that substantial
amounts were paid for activities that apparently involved very
little effort:
<UL>
<LI>The American Lung Association received $5,000 in October 1993
for having &quot;completed orientation and review of implementation
responsibilities for the Annual Action Plan&quot; and for &quot;[establishing]
recruitment and operating systems for Field Coordinator.&quot;
In November 1993, the ALA received $5,000 for exploring &quot;preparations
for a legislative breakfast.&quot; The following month, it received
$5,000 for identifying speakers to make &quot;presentations on
tobacco taxation,&quot; initiating &quot;development of a list
of influential contacts,&quot; and examining &quot;existing databases
and resource directories that identify Denver Metro tobacco youth
cessation resources;&quot;
<LI>Valley Wide Health Services received $2,083 in October 1993
for &quot;papers contacted/articles written.&quot; Similar amounts
were given in November and December 1993 for identifying &quot;community
groups&quot; and writing articles for newsletters;
<LI>The Weld County Health Department received $2,000 in December
1993 for having &quot;developed Action Plans&quot; and for attending
a CTFC meeting.
</UL>

<P>
ASSIST funds were also spent freely on business amenities:
<UL>
<LI>That Personal Touch Catering company received approximately
$300-$400 per month for catering Colorado ASSIST executive committee
and Alliance board meetings;
<LI>Nearly $5,000 was spent in 1993 to host a Colorado ASSIST
banquet;
<LI>Throughout 1990 and 1991, an average of $1,000 per month was
spent on temporary employees;
<LI>Ramada Inn was paid $1,055 to host a Colorado ASSIST board
meeting;
<LI>Nancy Salas, a CDH employee who often attended ASSIST training
sessions in Washington, was reimbursed $36.70 for a letter opener.
</UL>

<P>
<B>Politicking in the PICS</B> 
<P>
Petitioners for the tax initiative were organized in twelve cities
and regions, called &quot;Primary Intervention Communities&quot;
or &quot;PICs.&quot; Active in Aspen, Alamosa, Boulder, Colorado
Springs, Craig, Denver, Durango, Fort Collins, Grand Junction,
Greeley, Montrose, and Pueblo, their role was to raise funds for
the initiative and gather signatures. Additionally, 130 &quot;community
organizations&quot; throughout Colorado formed a coalition called
the Colorado ASSIST Alliance. Evidence of widespread lobbying
by these organizations can be found in the minutes of their meetings
and in newsletters used to communicate with and motivate the petitioners.
<P>
The Colorado ASSIST Alliance published its own newsletter using
ASSIST funds. In the March 1992 inaugural issue, it reported that
the American Cancer Society had contacted 120 individuals &quot;concerned
with tobacco control across the state . . . with a reminder to
urge their Representatives to achieve legislative passage of House
Bill 1239 Pat Sullivan's measure to add an additional 25 cents
tax on the purchase of a pack of cigarettes. . . . We urge everyone
to let your representatives know your feelings about this measure.&quot;
<P>
In the fifth issue (July 1993), ACS-Colorado's Madelyn Parker
praised the political activism of ASSIST participants in an article
entitled &quot;PICs Take on Policy Advocacy:&quot; &quot;Though
carefully nourished personal interaction at the state and local
levels, ASSIST alliance members who recently attended orientations
in the process of political advocacy are now working to educate
public policy makers about health and safety issues related to
tobacco.&quot;
<P>
The same issue carried another article by the Fair Share for Health
Committee's Arnold Levinson. Headlined &quot;To Get Rid of Tobacco,
TAX IT!,&quot; it described how a &quot;coalition of organizations
has now been formed to increase Colorado's tax on cigarettes .
. . and other tobacco products. Leading the effort is a broad
coalition of health organizations, including the largest voluntary
health agenciesthe American Lung Association, the American Cancer
Society, and the American Heart Association.&quot; The article
noted that more information about the initiative was available
from the FSFHC's Amanda O'Neill.
<P>
Colorado ASSIST's &quot;Annual Action Plan&quot; (AAP), submitted
to the National Cancer Institute in August 1993, explicitly stated
that politics was the organization's central focus. Under the
heading &quot;Year One Objectives,&quot; Colorado ASSIST announced
that &quot;By October 1994, a state bill will be introduced in
the Legislature to license tobacco sales, and active support for
the measure will come from businesses, labor, medical professionals,
educators, youth and the religious community. . . . By October
1994, policy advocacy will be provided to PIC representatives.&quot;
<P>
Arnold Levinson also made numerous presentations to PIC representatives
throughout the state, financed with ASSIST funds. The minutes
of a meeting of the Larimer County PIC, held June 9, 1993, note
that Levinson &quot;gave a presentation on the campaign his organization
[FSFHC] is heading to place a cigarette sales tax initiative on
the 1994 election ballot. . . . [FSFHC] is asking for our help
in collecting signatures on petitions.&quot; According to travel
expense reports that Levinson submitted to the Colorado Department
of Health for reimbursement, similar appearances were made in
June to PICs in Boulder and Pueblo.
<P>
<B>GASP of Colorado</B> 
<P>
One anti-smoking group which received ASSIST funds, GASP (Group
to Alleviate Smoking Pollution) of Colorado, offers insight into
how federal money was used to promote the tax initiative. As one
of the oldest and most energetic anti-smoking organizations in
the state, GASP's newsletter, <I>The Nonsmokers' Voice</I>, relentlessly
promoted the initiative. One issue contained the following articles:
<P>
<ul>
<LI>&quot;<I>Cigarette Tax Efforts Underway</I>. GASP of Colorado
is teaming up with other pro-health groups to put on the ballot
an initiative to increase Colorado's cigarette tax . . . under
the name Fair Share For Health Committee.&quot;
<P>
<LI>&quot;<I>President's Challenge to Our Members: One Completed
Petition Per Member</I>. I would like to ask each able-bodied
GASP member to help complete at least one petition.&quot;
<P>
<li>&quot;<I>Contributions Needed</I>. Initiatives take much time
to organize. . . . [We] will contribute some money and in-kind
support. . . . Pitch in now with your contribution.&quot;
<P>
<LI>&quot;<I>Annual Meeting to Focus on Cigarette Tax Efforts</I>.
Candace Pierce-Lavin, the coordinator of the successful Massachusetts
cigarette tax campaign, will be GASP's special guest at our annual
meeting . . . this fall.&quot;
</ul><P>
<B>Two Questions</B> 
<P>
Despite the efforts of ASSIST-funded organizations, the Colorado
tobacco tax initiative was defeated by voters on November 8, 1994.
The story of the political campaign for Colorado's Amendment 1
raises two serious questions:
<P>
<ul><LI>Is it proper for the National Institutes of Health and its divisions,
including the National Cancer Institutewhose mission is to research
the causes of and to find cures for diseaseto divert millions
of dollars to advocacy group politics?
<P>
<li>Is it proper for health charities such as the American Cancer
Society, American Heart Association, and American Lung Association
to increasingly embrace politics while abandoning their traditional
mission of providing assistance to disease victims? Obviously,
when health charities use funds for political activities, fewer
resources are available for helping disease victims.

<h2>Tax Funded Politics</h2>
<HR>
<small>Reformers in Congress want to strengthen laws restricting tax-funded
politicsthe practice of federal departments and agencies awarding
grants to nonprofit organizations that use the money to lobby
for higher taxes, more government, and more grants for nonprofits.
No one knows exactly how much is spent on political advocacy of
the estimated $39 billion that the federal government gives to
nonprofits each year. But the Capital Research Center and other
groups have disclosed many questionable grants. Although there
are many laws that restrict such activity, they have not been
well enforced.
<P>
This issue contains two articles that examine grants made by
the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control
to nonprofit anti-smoking organizations. James T. Bennett, a professor
of economics at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia,
and Thomas J. DiLorenzo, a Senior Fellow at the Capital Research
Center and professor of economics at Loyola College in Baltimore,
discuss how tax dollars intended for disease research and public
health education have been diverted into political advocacy. These
articles should serve as a wake-up call for Congress, taxpayers,
and nonprofit donors.

<h3>The Centers for Disease Control and the American Lung Association</h3>
By Thomas J. DiLorenzo
<P>
The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which most
Americans think of as a federal agency that conducts research
and dispenses advice on disease, is heavily involved in funding
political advocacy. This article examines a $30,000 grant the
CDC recently awarded to the American Lung Association (ALA), the
oldest and one of the largest health charities in the U.S.
<P>
The grant supported the ALA's May 1993 conference, &quot;Seize
the Initiative: A National Training Conference for Increasing
Tobacco Excise Taxes Through Initiated Acts,&quot; one of several
recent ALA seminars designed to train anti-smoking activists in
how to lobby for higher tobacco taxes.1 The California Department
of Health also contributed $68,958 in state cigarette tax revenues.
<P>
A third co-sponsor was the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a Princeton,
New Jersey-based private philanthropy that has spent tens of millions
of dollars promoting socialized medicine, including the ill-fated
Clinton health care plan. The Foundation had considerable influence
in the Clinton Administration's secret White House Health Care
Task Force. It has also funded efforts to enact broad-reaching
state-level health reforms compatible with the Clinton plan.2
<P>
<B>From Charity to Politics</B> 
<P>
The conference was organized by the staff of the ALA with assistance
from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. A Freedom of Information
Act inquiry to the CDC regarding the conference drew this response
from Lynn Armstrong, Assistant FOIA Officer: &quot;Program staff
stated that proceedings of the conference were not compiled. Also,
there were no handouts.&quot;3
<P>
In fact, there were handouts, and a considerable record of the
proceedings exists. These were obtained from a state public health
department official who attended the conference and who apparently
felt it was his duty to share this information with the taxpaying
public.
<P>
The overall theme of the conferencewhich underscores the direction
many health charities such as the ALA have taken in recent years was
announced on the first page of an ALA publication: &quot;Health
advocates assumed a new, sometimes treacherous, exhilarating and
definitely challenging role in the past decade. The genteel `Smoking
is bad for your health' posters were replaced by determined action
through legislation and the initiative process.&quot;4 In other
words, many health charities are no longer content with providing
services to disease victims and educating the public about health
issues. They are now committed to using the coercive power of
government to force Americans to adopt &quot;healthy&quot; lifestyles.
<P>
<B>The How-To's of Lobbying</B> 
<P>
One segment of the conference, &quot;Ingredients for Success,&quot;
featured several speakers who offered advice on how to organize
an effective statewide initiative campaign. Karen Rouse, vice
president for marketing and communications at the Massachusetts
division of the American Cancer Society (ACS), amused attendees
with &quot;war stories&quot; of her state's successful effort
to raise tobacco taxes. She emphasized that the initiative was
carefully designed to channel much of the estimated $120 million
in new tax revenues to anti-smoking organizations such as the
ACS.5
<P>
This strategy was virtually identical to one used in 1988, when
anti-smoking groups in California successfully promoted Proposition
99, an initiative to raise that state's tobacco taxes. As discussed
in the July 1994 <I>Alternatives in Philanthropy</I>, Proposition
99 generated millions of dollars for anti-smoking organizations'
&quot;educational&quot; programs. Anti-smoking groups gave gifts
such as backpacks and gift certificates to high school students
who promised to quit smoking. The groups also spent tax revenues
earmarked for education on political campaigns aimed at enacting
local anti-smoking ordinances. When state legislators learned
of this, they reappropriated some of the revenues to medical care
for the needy.6
<P>
Another speaker, political campaign consultant Jack Nicholl, offered
tips on how to &quot;tap an emotional issue,&quot; the importance
of &quot;aggressive negative campaigning,&quot; and the use children
as an &quot;emotional symbol and message of the campaign.&quot;
As a key organizer of Proposition 99, Nicholl recalled that &quot;Press
events were held in child care centers. Children marched with
organizers.&quot;
<P>
Nicholl also explained steps taken to encourage lifestyle-tolerant
Californians to support Proposition 99: &quot;Early tobacco tax
polling showed that voters were not anti-smoking zealots and did
not support coercive measures to force smokers to stop. In fact,
supporters believed overwhelmingly that `smokers have a right
to smoke.'&quot; Consequently, &quot;leaders of the coalitionsuch
as the American Cancer Society and the American Lung Association
. . . put their own militant antismoking rhetoric on the shelf
for the duration of the campaign,&quot; and decided instead to
pitch their message as follows: &quot;We are not an anti-smoking
campaign. Adults can choose to smoke, but if they do, they must
pay their fair share of the costs associated with smoking.&quot;7
<P>
This approach was disingenuous in two ways. First, according to
ALA CEO John R. Garrison, the ALA's goal is to achieve a &quot;smoke-free
society&quot; through &quot;advocacy efforts,&quot; not to make
smokers to pay their &quot;fair share&quot; of health care costs.8
Second, contrary to Proposition 99 proponents, tobacco taxes already
more than cover the costs of health care for diseases attributable
to smoking, according to comprehensive studies by the Rand Corporation
and Congressional Research Service.9
<P>
Another speaker, Doug Barr, CEO of the Canadian Cancer Society,
suggested that U.S. health charities stop using their millions
of volunteers to provide direct services to disease victims and
instead employ them in political campaigns: &quot;If we are willing
to learn the political ropes and mobilize our volunteers to exercise
their political clout, our organizations can bring about significant
legislative change. . . .&quot;10
<P>
A representative from the polling firm of Abacus Associates, based
in Hatfield, Massachusetts, also made a presentation on political
polling intended &quot;to develop a strategy and message for winning.
. . . The purpose of polling is to help you develop and deliver
the most effective message for moving the voters you need to move
in order to win.&quot;11
<P>
Conference participants received numerous materials, including
the ALA's <I>Guidebook for State Action to Increase Tobacco Taxes</I>,12
a 124-page manual providing detailed information on coalition
building, petition drives, polling, and how to present one's case
to potential coalition members and the public. The <I>Guidebook</I>
also offers the successful tax-increase campaigns in California
and Massachusetts as models for other states and discusses how
anti-smoking activists in Florida recently celebrated that state's
increase in tobacco taxes. Revenues in Florida, the <I>Guidebook</I>
explains, will be used by anti-smoking groups to conduct door-to-door
leafleting, phone banking, public opinion polling, mail-in petition
efforts, training of anti-smoking activists, and fundraising (said
to be a &quot;high priority&quot;).
<P>
<B>A Tax-Funded Assault on Freedom</B> 
<P>
Anti-smoking organizations such as the ALA ignore the fact that
if smoking is specially taxed or prohibited because it involves
health risks, many other freedoms are in danger of being curtailed
or lost. After all, eating fatty foods, exercising too little
or too much, riding a bicycle without a helmet, and driving a
car also involve risks and may lead to illness, injury, or death.
It is a travesty that taxpayers are forced to support a political
movement that prohibits their freedom of choice.
<P>
Although the CDC's mission is to conduct disease research and
educate the public about health issues, its grant to the ALA was
used to teach the nuts and bolts of political organizing, a blatantly
illegal use of tax money. It is time that Congress investigated
the CDC's politicized grantmaking.

<TITLE>From Foster Care to Adoption: An Interview with Conna Craig -- CRC</TITLE>

<P>
<h2>From Foster Care to Adoption: An Interview with Conna Craig
</h2>
<I>America's state-run foster-care system is increasingly under
attack. Many complain that the system is woefully slow in placing
children into permanent adoptive homes and that it too often shifts
children from one temporary foster home to another. This, critics
charge, leaves children with a sense of rootlessness and without
normal bonds of familial love. Many also say that adoption into
permanent families is taking a back seat to long-term foster care.</I>
<P>
<I>It was not always this way. Until early in this century, adoption
was generally handled informally within communities and by private
charities that helped to place abandoned children and orphans
into stable, loving homes. This work has been largely supplanted
by a state-run, tax-funded foster-care system.</I>
<P>
<I>We recently interviewed Conna Craig, president of the Institute
for Children, a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based private nonprofit,
to learn more about how we reached the current morass and what
can be done to revive the voluntary sector's role in adoption.
She advises governors, other policy makers and opinion leaders
both here and abroad on practical steps that can be taken to restructure
foster care and adoption. Adopted at age eight into a family that
has cared for 110 foster children, Ms. Craig believes that children
are better off in a permanent, loving family and that every child
deserves such a start in life. The Institute can be reached at
(617) 491-4614.</I> 
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>There are currently some 50,000 children who the
courts have declared legally free to be adopted, yet who are still
in foster care. Why is this?</I> 
<P>
<B>A.</B> Fundamentally, because the notion has arisen that the
state can or should be a parent. There are three major reasons
for the demise of adoption. One is government involvement in what
was once a largely private endeavor. The second is an anti-adoption
bias that, with the help of the media, is taking on frightening
proportions. The third is what some call the culture of victimization.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>Let's start with the firstgovernment involvement.</I>

<P>
<B>A.</B> Some people have an interest in perpetuating the current
system. Many of the studies on foster care are conducted by the
government or by organizations that receive government funding.
That makes me question the bias of those studies.
<P>
In 1980, Congress mandated that the states report on the number
of children in foster care and their status. Yet today, there
is no government agency that can say with certainty how many children
are in foster care, where they are, whether they are free to be
adopted, or if they're OK. Since 1980, Congress has also required
that every child have a permanency plan within 18 months of entering
foster care. This is usually a plan for a return to the child's
biological parents or adoption.
<P>
It's been 15 years since this law was passed, but one in ten foster
children is still in state care for longer than seven years. Clearly,
such planning isn't resulting in permanent homes for children.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>What about state regulations governing adoptions?</I>

<P>
<B>A.</B> Several states require that an adoptive family be identified
before a child is legally free to be adopted. Children in those
states become caught in a Catch-22: they cannot be free to be
adopted until a family is identified, but a family is more likely
to be identified when a child is already free to be adopted. We're
conducting a study of children who are free to be adopted in each
state, and some of the numbers we've found are alarming. In California,
there are more than 9,000 children free to be adopted but who
are still in foster care.
<P>
I don't think we should rely only on social work and adoption
recruitment before freeing these children. For the sake of the
children, people who wish to adopt should be given an accurate
picture of the number of children who need permanent homes.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>What about the anti-adoption bias you mentioned?</I>

<P>
<B>A.</B> There's an organization called the National Association
of Black Social Workers in Detroit which believes that there are
&quot;many compelling reasons&quot; to reject transracial adoptionsplacing
children of one race with parents of another. NABSW believes that
if same-race homes cannot be found for black children, the &quot;full
range of permanency planning&quot; should be used. That includes
returning children to their biological parents or keeping them
permanently in state foster homes.
<P>
Rita Simon, a distinguished sociology professor at the American
University, has conducted a 20-year study summarized in <I>The
Case for Transracial Adoption</I> (Washington, DC: American University
Press, 1994) which looks at transracial adoptions. The Search
Institute in Minneapolis has conducted the largest-ever study
of adopted adolescents (&quot;Growing Up Adopted: A Portrait of
Adolescents and Their Families&quot;). Both find that transracially
adopted children fare very well on a number of indicators.
<P>
I grew up in a multi-racial, multi-ethnic adoptive family, and
I'm incredulous when so-called experts imply that I could have
loved my brothers and sisters more if our skin color had matched.
I find that mystifying and even racist. I think the NABSW and
those who are against transracial adoption are partly responsible
for the fact that black children on average spend twice as long
in foster care as white children.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>What's the culture of victimization?</I> 
<P>
<B>A.</B> In essence, it's the view that child abuse and neglect
have their roots in social factorsracism, economic inequality,
broken homesnot the uncoerced actions of parents. There is a group
called Concerned United Birthparents (CUB), headquartered in Des
Moines. As an organization, its message is that long-term foster
care is preferable to adoption, although not everyone who belongs
to CUB is anti-adoption. Its arguments are fueled by socialist
feminists who claim that the two-parent family is an old, outmoded
ideal. When this idea infuses the thinking of social workers,
we see children being returned to abusive homes or kept permanently
in the limbo of foster care.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>Are there any other obstacles that prevent children
from being adopted?</I> 
<P>
<B>A.</B> Another major problem is the categorizing of many foster
children as having special needs. Originally, this designation
was intended to help children who might otherwise not be adopted.
But today, some 70 percent of children in foster care are categorized
as having special needs. Sometimes, this simply means having been
in foster care for a certain number of years or being part Native-American.
Not surprisingly, a federal subsidy comes with this categorization.
<P>
Of course, some children do have special needs. But over-categorization
has two harmful consequences. First, it tends to carry a stigma
that discourages many people who want to adopt. Some of those
people eventually decide to adopt a child from another country.
While international adoption is commendable, not everyone can
afford it. I've heard parents say they tried to adopt a child
from the inner-city, but were discouraged by the system. Second,
the term special needs ignores what one father with several adopted
children recently told me about one of his daughters: &quot;She
is special, and she needs us.&quot;
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>Why is the debate over foster care and adoption happening
now?</I> 
<P>
<B>A.</B> It's a positive response to what happens under dire
and unfortunate circumstances. I don't think you'll find many
people who would agree that long-term foster care is working.
Children are dying in foster care. Seventeen percent of incarcerated
criminals in state prisons are former foster children. Forty percent
of former foster kids &quot;graduate&quot; to welfare. Thirty-nine
percent of the homeless youth in Los Angeles County are former
foster children.
<P>
The real solution is a private one. Adoption is the ultimate form
of privatization: it is the wresting of authority over a child's
life away from the state. It allows the child to be freeto be
raised not by government but by loving parents. This results not
only in much better outcomes for children, but also in huge savings
to taxpayers. When you look at children who have been adopted
into permanent homes, these kids do far better as measured by
a variety of indicators than foster children and also better than
national samples of children.
<P>
Foster care is a $10-billion-a-year industry, and it's growing.
I think what we're seeing is 30 years of big-government failure.
People are re-examining the role of the state. We recognize that
government cannot raise children. Even President Clinton said
so in his first State of the Union Address. Mrs. Clinton recently
hosted a White House ceremony celebrating National Adoption Month.
She urged Americans to help find an adoptive home for every child
free to be adopted.
<P>
One of the most tragic failures of the welfare statewhat I call
the dirty little secret of the welfare stateis foster care. Part
of the reason it's taken so long to realize how bad things have
become is because many states and government agencies are loathe
to share their information. But with the &quot;information explosion&quot;
of the last ten years, people are learning about what's going
on through the Freedom of Information Act, good reporting, and
academic studiesand they're blowing the whistle.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>How were adoptions generally handled by earlier generations
of Americans?</I> 
<P>
<B>A.</B> Through most of America's history, adoption and child
welfare were handled privately with very little government intervention
or regulation. In <I>The Tragedy of American Compassion</I>, Marvin
Olasky talks about how charities ran orphan trains that took orphans
to adoptive homes all over the country. More often, an adoptive
home was available in the immediate community. Adoptions weren't
usually recognized by law. But there was an informal recognition
by neighbors and those in the community.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>What about adoption as an alternative to abortion?
That seems to be an area where pro-life and pro-choice groups
could find common ground. Do you see anything happening here?</I>

<P>
<B>A.</B> Right now, women faced with an unplanned pregnancy are
not encouraged to look at their full range of (continued after table)<BR>

choices from raising the child to looking to one's family for
support to getting married. I'm hearing more from the pro-life
community about making adoption work better. The pro-choice side
more often raises the question of who will care for the children.
I would encourage them to look at the number of people who wish
to adopt.
<P>
My sense is that there are tens of thousands of peopleif not morewaiting
to adopt. I'm certain that there are more families than there
are children free to be adopted; and it is not true that these
families are only interested in adopting healthy white babies.
The National Adoption Center in Philadelphia reports that there
are 650 families waiting to adopt older, special-needs children.
AKIDS in White Plains, New York, has a list of 150 people waiting
to adopt special-needs kids. The San Francisco office of Adopt
a Special Kid, which has 27 offices nationwide, receives 1,500
calls a year from people who wish to adopt children with disabilities.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>There seems to be a stigma attached to the woman
who has a child out of wedlock and then places the child for adoption.
She's seen as irresponsible because she's chosen not to raise
her own child. Maybe more women are having abortions because of
this. Can anything be done to change this perception?</I> 
<P>
<B>A.</B> In England, I've seen the same trendbasically blaming
a woman for choosing adoption. Professor Richard Whitfield is
writing a paper on adoption for the Institute of Economic Affairs
in London. He tells the story of a young girl who wanted to place
her child for adoption but was totally discouraged by state social
workers. Also, when I talk to young, pregnant girls who live in
group homes, they consistently tell me they would never place
their children for adoption. They know what the system is. If
we got government out of the business of parenting, the system
would improve and attitudes about adoption would begin to change.
<P>
We see a lot of public service announcements about getting food
stamps and other welfare benefits, but we don't see a message
telling young, pregnant girls about adoptionthat bringing a baby
to term and placing it for adoption can be a morally courageous
choice.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>Your Institute is seeking to get governors to take
the lead in reforming the foster care/adoption system.</I> 
<P>
<B>A.</B> Yes. Governors are the natural champions of foster children,
who under law are wards of the state. We are trying to convince
every governor to get his or her state out of the business of
parenting. Governors can also take the lead in helping to knock
down barriers that prevent the voluntary sector from doing more.
For example, we wanted to have a Thanksgiving dinner this year
for foster children in shelters and group homes. A friend volunteered
his beautiful home, which happens to be just over the state line
in New Hampshire. We discovered we couldn't take the children
into another state. Next year, we hope to have Thanksgiving dinners
for foster children in every state.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>What role can grantmaking foundations play in promoting
the adoption process?</I> 
<P>
<B>A.</B> Foundations have an exciting opportunity to invest now
in reshaping the system. Foster care and adoption are enmeshed
in an array of social issues: crime, teen pregnancy, abortion,
family violence. Foundations that support community-based approaches
to these issues would do well to consider how they can help knock
down some of the barriers that keep foster children languishing
in state care. I would also urge foundations that support economic
research to examine this pressing economic issue: foster care
and public-agency adoption is a $10-billion-a-year industry. The
Atlas Economic Research Foundation in Fairfax, Virginia saw this
connection and became our first investor.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>What about charities, and for that matter, businesses?
What role can they play?</I> 
<P>
<B>A.</B> There is a tremendous role for both. There's a charity
here in Massachusetts whose mission is to ensure that no foster
child experiences the holidays without a toy. It's all-volunteer
and receives no government money. It also provides football and
baseball tickets and pays for prom dresses and tuxedos for teenage
foster kids as well as for Little League teams and driver's education.
It now reaches 5,000 foster children in Massachusetts each year.
This is a wonderful example of the promise of the private, voluntary
sectorof individuals and corporations working together to help
foster children. I think that with a devolution from federal entitlement
programs to state-level accountability, we'll see more and more
of these kinds of initiatives.
<P>
Charities and businesses can also help cover some of the costs
of adopting, which can run into the thousands of dollars. Let's
say you have a child in South Boston who is free to be adopted
and a family waiting to adopt in Dallas. Delta Airlines, which
calls itself the airline for kids, and other major carriers could
each pay for 1,000 newly adopted children to go to their new homes.
People could even donate their frequent flyer miles for these
kids.
<P>
We're launching an initiative in 1996the Moses Projectthat will
seek to engage the community of faith more fully in the adoption
process. Our first step is to find out why churches and synagogues
do not always get involved in foster care and adoption, and what
they perceive as the barriers to doing so.
<P>
Another problem is medical conditions that some foster children
have. Some who would otherwise be adopted have long-term or episodic
health conditions. Blue Cross/Blue Shield, other major insurance
companies, and HMOs could agree to cover the medical bills of,
say, ten newly adopted children in their communities.
<P>
<B>Q.</B> <I>What can individuals do?</I> 
<P>
<B>A.</B> We receive letters and phone calls from individuals
across the nation who are seeking advice and who want to help.
We are considering setting up a network of state-level citizen
groups and are seeking funding for this project. In the meantime,
individuals can support their local private and faith-based foster-care
and adoption providers. Also, I urge individuals to write to their
governors and ask that reform of foster care and adoption be made
a top priority.

<h2>Undermining the Founder's Intent: Five Case Studies</h3>
<BR>


By <a href="/crc/about/people.html#Wooster">Martin Morse Wooster</a>
<P>
The issue of donor intent continues to vex the philanthropic world,
particularly some of America's largest foundations. This article
expands on my recent book, <a href="/crc/books/pdi.html"><I>The Great Philanthropists and the
Problem of &quot;Donor Intent&quot;</I></a> (Washington, DC: Capital
Research Center, 1994). It continues the stories of foundations
that have violated their founders' wishes, adding new information
on recent developments. It also includes new material on the views
of Henry Ford II and a discussion of the recent &quot;Lee Bass
Case.&quot; A summary offers advice for donors who may wish to
create a private foundation.1

<B>The Barnes Foundation: &quot;A Dangerous Precedent&quot;</B>

<P>
The Barnes Foundation board of trustees continues to violate the
wishes of Albert C. Barnes (1872-1951), an entrepreneur and art
collector who created a world-renowned gallery of French modernist
art in Merion, Pennsylvania. Although Barnes' will firmly states
that no paintings are ever to leave the museum, many paintings
have been sent to exhibits around the world.
<P>
The Foundation continues a legal battle with the Violetta de Mazia
Trust, created by a student of Barnes who was also a trustee of
the Foundation until her death in 1988. The Trust contends that
the Foundation's board has improperly diverted grants intended
for the Foundation to Lincoln University, an African-American
school which under the terms of Barnes' will appoints most of
the Foundation's directors. The Foundation counters that most
of the de Mazia Trust's assets (including paintings) were stolen
from the Foundation and that the Trust should legally be part
of the Foundation, not an independent entity.
<P>
In January 1995, the Foundation and Trust reached an out-of-court
settlement. The Foundation agreed to permanently offer art courses
based on Barnes' views and agreed that the Trust is an independent
organization over which it has no legal authority. In return,
the Trust agreed to donate $2,750,000 over seven years to pay
for the art courses. It also agreed not to object to the Foundation's
efforts to alter Barnes' will by increasing admission fees, allowing
fundraising events at the museum, and letting the Foundation invest
in areas other than government bonds and railroad stocks, as Barnes
had wished.2
<P>
In July 1995, however, Montgomery County Orphans Court Judge Stanley
Ott rejected the settlement. The Trust, along with Concerned Students
of the Barnes and Friends of the Barnes Foundation (two organizations
not included in the original settlement), have resumed their suit.
Foundation president Richard Glanton, who has led the effort to
alter Barnes' will, continues to criticize Barnes supporters:
&quot;The courts have given standing to any Tom, Dick, or Harry
to heave spitballs at us. Anywhere else in the world we'd be heroes
for doing what we've done. What have our critics ever done for
the Barnes? Nothing. They're nobodies.&quot; Glanton also called
Barnes supporters a &quot;small, mean-spirited group.&quot;3
<P>
The Foundation has been more successful in efforts to send its
paintings around the world. In 1992, Orphans Court Judge Louis
D. Stefan allowed a limited tour of certain paintings. In February
1994, he extended the tour to include museums in Fort Worth and
Toronto. This has proven to be a big moneymaker: by March 1995,
the tour had raised $14,600,000. Visitors to the Philadelphia
Museum of Art paid $9.50 to see the paintings ($8.50 more than
they would have paid at the Foundation) and spent $1,500,000 on
memorabilia, including CD-ROMS, even though Barnes' will firmly
prohibits any reproduction of the paintings.4
<P>
The foundation also successfully petitioned the Pennsylvania Superior
Court in May of 1995 to allow the paintings to be transported
to the Haus der Kunst, a museum in Munich. (A month earlier, Orphans
Court Judge Stanley Ott had denied the request, citing the fragility
of the paintings. The Superior Court gave no explanation for its
reversal. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court declined to hear the
case.) The paintings have been sent overseas in return for a payment
of $2,250,000 from the Haus der Kunst. It is unclear when they
will be returned.
<P>
The <I>New Criterion</I>'s Roger Kimball recently told the <I>National
Law Journal</I> that the assault on Barnes' will is &quot;a smear
campaign pure and simple. Barnes set up a rigorous educational
mission, and it is being undermined by certain people for their
own aggrandizement. Barnes was not crazy; he was betrayed.&quot;
&quot;The Barnes affair is one of the great scandals in American
art museums,&quot; adds Thomas Freundenheim, the Smithsonian Institution's
assistant secretary for museums, &quot;and it sets a dangerous
precedent. If a will isn't sacrosanct under the law, what is?
The Fricks, Barnes, and Carnegies of the future are going to think
very carefully before donating their masterpieces to our institutions
and to our future generations. And that is a more dangerous situation
than the public understands it to be.&quot;5
<P>
<a name="buck"></a>
<B>The Buck Trust: From Charity to Alcohol Prohibition</B> 
<P>
The $427,000,000 Buck Trust, created by Beryl Buck (1896-1975),
an oil heiress and longtime resident of Marin County, California,
supports programs and causes increasingly removed from those specified
by the donor. According to Buck's will, distributions from the
Trust are to be &quot;used for exclusively nonprofit, charitable,
religious, or educational purposes in providing care for the needy
in Marin County . . . and for other nonprofit charitable, religious
or educational purposes in Marin County. . . .&quot;6
<P>
After a 1986 lawsuit in which the San Francisco Foundation, the
Trust's administrator, tried unsuccessfully to alter Buck's will
to allow the distribution of funds throughout the San Francisco
Bay area, a court ordered that the Trust's wealth be transferred
to a newly created Marin Community Foundation. The court also
ordered the funding of three new Marin-based nonprofits with Buck
Trust funds: the Buck Center for Research on Aging, Beryl Buck
Institute for Education, and Marin Institute for the Prevention
of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Problems.
<P>
In June 1991, the Trust's board agreed to spend $4,500 in Trust
funds to study whether the self-esteem of Marin County residents
would be harmed by the Buck Center's plans to use rats in laboratory
experiments. According to Mary McEachron, administrative director
of the Center, &quot;rodent activists&quot; had prompted the study
by protesting construction of the facility.7
<P>
The 1994 annual report of the Marin Institute shows that Trust
funds are being used to support nonprofit lobbying to increase
regulation of the production and distribution of alcoholan activity
unrelated to Beryl Buck's desire to help the needy of Marin County.
In collaboration with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a major
promoter of government-run health care, the Marin Institute recently
began a three-year program &quot;to provide in-depth support for
policy initiatives to prevent alcohol and other drug problems&quot;
in seven major cities. In addition, the Marin Institute:
<UL>
<LI>Continued to collect a &quot;Hall of Shame&quot; of alcohol-industry
merchandise of which it disapproved.
<LI>Purchased $1,000 worth of stock in Anheuser-Busch and Canandaigua
Wine in order to introduce shareholder resolutions at annual meetings.
<LI>Joined with alcohol prohibitionist organizations in Sweden,
Norway, and the United Kingdom to create the Global Alliance to
Prevent Alcohol-Related Harm.
<LI>Held at least six &quot;media advocacy&quot; workshops designed
to train activists in ways to urge journalists to support government
regulation of alcohol.
<LI>Provided &quot;technical assistance&quot; to such organizations
as the Advocacy Institute, a tobacco prohibition group; American
Lung Association, now a major anti-tobacco lobbying organization;
and Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights, the Center for Science in
the Public Interest, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.8

<B>The Estate of Doris Duke: Lost in Probate</B> 
<P>
Little change has occurred in the Duke Endowment, the Charlotte-based
regional foundation created by tobacco and hydroelectric power
magnate James B. Duke. But the estate of Doris Duke, his recently
deceased daughter, is more unsettled than ever.
<P>
Doris Duke willed most of her fortune to a proposed Doris Duke
Charitable Foundation. With $1.2 billion in assets, this would
be the sixteenth largest foundation in the U.S.slightly larger
than the Carnegie Corporation of New York ($1.2 billion) but smaller
than the Annenberg Foundation ($1.3 billion).9 With the turmoil
surrounding the Doris Duke estate, however, it is unclear who
would run the foundation or if it will be created at all.
<P>
Duke revised her will at least six times in the two years before
her death in October 1993. In her last will, she named Bernard
Lafferty, her butler, co-executor (along with U.S. Trust) and
awarded him a $500,000 salary plus a $5,000,000 executor's fee.
In January 1995, however, Duke's nurse, Tammy Payette, charged
that Duke did not die of natural causes but was killed by a &quot;massive
sedation regime&quot; administered by Lafferty.10 Manhattan Surrogate's
Court Judge Eve Preminger appointed former district attorney Richard
Kuh to investigate the allegations and other charges of irregularities
in the management of Duke's estate.
<P>
Other Duke employees have also questioned the legality of Duke's
will. Colin Shanley, Duke's cook, and Ann Bostich, Duke's housekeeper,
charged that Duke was disoriented when she signed her last will.
Bostich also accused William Doyle, the lawyer who prepared the
last will, of holding Duke's hand and pushing it &quot;along the
page, guiding the hand&quot; until a signature was obtained.11
<P>
In April, Kuh's report was unsealed in Surrogate's Court. It supported
Payette's charges, saying that though Duke was terminally ill
in October 1993, her death was hastened by a fatal morphine overdose.
It also accused Lafferty of severe mismanagement of the estate,
saying that several charitable gifts made in Duke's name to Duke
University ($2,000,000), the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation
($1,000,000), and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals
($1,000,000) may have been made by Lafferty himself while Duke
was in no condition to agree. It further accused Lafferty of reckless
spending and of improperly borrowing $853,000 in interest-free
loans from U.S. Trust.
<P>
As Kuh's report was being released, Chandi Duke Heffner, a belly-dancing
instructor whom Duke adopted in 1988 and then un-adopted in 1991,
settled her longstanding dispute with the estate for a figure
reported to be $65,000,000. As for Tammy Payette, she recently
pleaded guilty to stealing $500,000 in art and jewels from six
wealthy patients.
<P>
In May, Judge Preminger ousted Lafferty and U.S. Trust as co-executors
and replaced them with Morgan Guaranty Trust and Alexander D.
Forger, a former chairman of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley, and McCloy
who served as executor of the estate of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.
Preminger, citing Lafferty's admitted alcoholism and &quot;lack
of appreciation of the most basic financial matters,&quot;12 also
noted that U.S. Trust should have noticed Lafferty's deficiencies
and not loaned him the $853,000: &quot;U.S. Trust has failed to
discharge this duty to the estate and the charitable beneficiaries.&quot;13
In October, a New York appeals court upheld Preminger's ruling,
although Lafferty and U.S. Trust plan to appeal a second time.
<P>
So it remains unclear who the final executor of the Doris Duke
estate will be, whether the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation will
be created, whether Chandi Duke Heffner's settlement with the
estate will be overturned, and whether Duke University, the Elizabeth
Taylor AIDS Foundation, and People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals will have to return the questionable donations made in
Doris Duke's name. Nearly every question about the Doris Duke
estate, including what her charitable intentions were, remains
unanswered.
<P>
<a name="ford"></a>
<B>The Ford Foundation: &quot;A Horrible Mistake&quot;</B> 
<P>
New information concerning how Henry Ford II (1917-1987) lost
control of the Ford Foundation his family created has emerged
in the form of taped interviews conducted between 1980 and 1985.14
Ford stipulated that the tapes not be made public until five years
after his death. The tapes' contents were recently summarized
by the <I>Detroit News</I> in a multi-part series.15
<P>
Although Ford is already known to have regretted his decision
in 1948 to relinquish family control over the Foundation, the
interviews are more candid. &quot;I made a big mistake on the
Ford Foundation. I had the Ford Foundation in my hand at one time.
Then I lost it, and I lost it on my own volition. I gave it away
on my own. I was young, inexperienced, and stupid. I just muffed
it. It got out of control, and it stayed out of control. And now
it's gone, of course.&quot;16
<P>
Ford added that he should have used the Foundation mostly to fund
causes created by his grandfather, including the Henry Ford Hospital,
Edison Institute (now the Henry Ford Museum), and Fair Lane, his
grandfather's estate (now a conference center). &quot;It could
have been done so easily,&quot; he said. &quot;It could have been
done with a penin four seconds. We had three trustees. We could
have done anything we wanted. We could have taken the [Ford Motor]
stock and given it to any nonprofit company, nonprofit Edison
Institute, nonprofit Henry Ford Hospital, nonprofit Fair Lane,
nonprofit whatever you want. And done a much better job for the
whole family than I did. I did it all on my own and I made a horrible
mistake. I'll never live it down, and I regret it sincerely. But
what the hell can I do about it? I can't do anything about it.
Just have to lie and die with it.&quot;17
<P>
The Ford Foundation recently announced that longtime president
Franklin Thomas will step in down in 1996. His replacement is
Susan Berresford, a Foundation vice-president and employee since
1970. In a lengthy interview with the <I>Chronicle of Philanthropy</I>,
Berresford did not say how she intended to uphold the charitable
ideas of Henry Ford or Henry Ford II. In fact, she did not mention
the Fords at all.18 Writing in the <I>New Republic</I>, David
Samuels predicts that Berresford will continue the Foundation's
longstanding pattern of funding the &quot;professional advocacy
industry,&quot; including the Ms. Foundation for Women, Women's
Legal Defense Fund, National Women's Law Center, and Institute
for Women.19

<B>The Case of Lee Bass: I Want My Money Back</B> 
<P>
One place where donors have had a great deal of trouble expressing
their ideas is in universities. Pro-capitalist donors have spent
tens of millions of dollars creating &quot;free enterprise chairs&quot;
at universities, most of which have done little to advance free
markets.20 Others have had a hard time convincing universities
to accept their ideas as well as their checks. Consider the case
of Lee Bass.
<P>
Bass, who graduated from Yale University in 1979, is heir to an
oil fortune. Inspired by Yale historian Donald Kagan, Bass decided
in 1991 to give $20,000,000 to his alma mater to create courses
that would promote Western civilization. Kagan became the first
&quot;Bass Professor&quot; and was charged with designing the
program.
<P>
In the meantime, Yale hired a new president, Richard Levin, who
found that the university had a $12,000,000 budget deficit that
Bass' grant could close. Although the Western civilization program
was scheduled to hire four new professors, one clause of the Bass
indenture said that &quot;full-time faculty [should] take direct
responsibility for the teaching at the heart of the program.&quot;
Levin interpreted this to mean that existing faculty could be
assigned to the program and paid with Bass funds. According to
Bass professor of history Henry Turner, &quot;We were asked to
design a Rolls Royce of a course [but] were told to put in a Chrysler
engine and Plymouth upholstery.&quot;2l
<P>
Meanwhile, Yale undergraduate Pat Collins began investigating
the program. He found that several professors objected to a new
course upholding the works of &quot;dead white males.&quot; Collins'
work was picked up by the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, which editorialized
that &quot;There can be little doubt that the faculty quarters
ideologically opposed to the Western Civilization program . .
. played a crucial role in derailing the initiative and, not incidentally,
the intentions of the grant.&quot;22
<P>
According to the <I>Washington Post</I>, Bass first heard his
program was in trouble from the <I>Journal</I> editorial. He had
received no response to several requests for information on the
status of the program between September 1993 and November 1994.
For some reason, Yale president Levin was unable to find time
to talk to Bass. In February 1995, Bass imposed an additional
condition on his grant: that he have the right to approve the
professors teaching the program. Levin refused to accept the condition,
so Bass withdrew his grant in March 1995.
<P>
Yale's response has been to deny that the episode had anything
to do with ideology. But Yale subsequently rejected an offer by
members of Yale's class of 1937 to raise the $20,000,000 lost
by the Bass grant for a new Western civilization program.
<P>
The publicity surrounding the Bass case may lead increasing numbers
of alumni to question the wisdom of giving to their alma maters.
&quot;I don't think the problem is simply dealing with Western
Civilization or the humanities at Yale,&quot; says Russell Reynolds,
a 1954 Yale graduate. &quot;I think it's dealing with the governance
of Yale and the way the institution is currently being run.&quot;23
<P>
The Bass case suggests that universities can be remarkably impervious
to outside influence. Perhaps a better way for alumni to influence
their alma maters is to donate books or magazine subscriptions
to the college library, or to support nonprofit organizations
that seek to aid college students and professors, such as the
Institute for Humane Studies, Intercollegiate Studies Institute,
Madison Center, National Association of Scholars, or Young America's
Foundation.
<P><a name="advice"></a>
<B>Advice for Donors</B> 
<P>
What lessons can be drawn from these stories?
<UL>
<LI>The Barnes case shows that trustees can successfully challenge
a will in court even if the donor's wishes are explicit. Donors
would thus be wise to consider giving most or all of their wealth
during their lifetimes. Nonetheless, examples of other foundations,
such as the Duke Endowment and Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, show
that an explicitly worded bequest is more likely to be honored
than a vaguely worded one.24
<LI>The Buck case shows the importance of carefully selecting
an executor. Had the San Francisco Foundation honored Beryl Buck's
will, the court would not have created the Marin Community Foundation
and programs with no relation to Buck's wishes.
<LI>The Duke case likewise shows the importance of the executor,
and the kind of lengthy probate court contest that may occur if
a highly competent one is not chosen.
<LI>The Ford case suggests that family control of a foundation
can help uphold donor intent. But, as the accompanying article
on the Pew Charitable Trusts shows, family involvement by third-
or fourth-generation heirs is probably less effective, as they
will have little or no direct knowledge of the founder's ideas.
Family control is likely to keep a foundation on track only in
the short run.
<LI>The Bass case shows the advantage of giving during one's lifetime.
Lee Bass was able to withdraw his gift when he saw that his wishes
would not be fulfilled.
<LI>In short, there are no guarantees that one's bequest will
be honoredonly varying degrees of probability that it will be.
Donors can increase the likelihood that their wishes will be followed
by explicitly stating their objectives and carefully choosing
trustees. They should also consider giving more during their lifetimes
and limiting the life of their foundations.<BR>

<h2>The Pew Charitable Trusts: Revitalizing &quot;the Spirit of
the 60s&quot;</h2>
<BR>
By Dr. Robert Lerner and Dr. Althea K. Nagai
<P>
The family of Joseph Newton Pew, founder of the Sun Oil Company,
created seven charitable trusts beginning in the late 1940s to
carry out their philanthropic ideals. As Martin Wooster relates
in <a href="/crc/books/pdi.html"><I>The Great Philanthropists and the Problem of &quot;Donor
Intent,&quot;</I></a> the Pews were strongly religious conservatives
who often gave to charity anonymously, believing that &quot;charity
should be a private matter between God and one's conscience.&quot;1
<P>
Two Pew brothers, J. Howard Pew (1882-1971) and Joseph N. Pew,
Jr. (1886-1963), took over the family oil business after their
father's death in 1912. J. Howard Pew attended Grove City College,
which was largely developed and financed by his father, and briefly
studied at MIT. His scientific contributions to the oil business
included the development of Sun Red Stock, a more versatile lubricating
oil than had been used, and hydrolene, the first commercially
successful petroleum asphalt.2 Joseph N. Pew, Jr., a graduate
of Cornell University, became heavily involved in national politics
as vice president of Sun Oil. He led the effort to overturn Franklin
Roosevelt's National Recovery Act, a system of government-organized
cartels declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1935.
<P>
Both brothers were strong supporters of religious organizations
and black colleges. Both also strongly supported the Republican
Party, giving an estimated $2,000,000 between 1934 and 1940. Joseph
N. Pew, Jr. also purchased a number of magazines, including the
<I>Farm Journal</I> and <I>Pathfinder</I>, to advance his anti-New
Deal views.
<P>
<B>The Founding of the Trusts</B> 
<P>
Starting in 1948, J. Howard Pew, Joseph N. Pew, Jr., and their
sisters, Mary Ethel Pew and Mabel Pew Myrin, gave at least 80
percent of their fortunes to seven charitable trusts: the Pew
Memorial Trust, J. Howard Pew Freedom Trust, Mabel Pew Myrin Trust,
J.N. Pew Jr. Charitable Trust, Medical Trust, Mary Anderson Trust,
and Knollbrook Trust. These were intended to support education,
social services, religion, health care, and medical research.
The Trusts' first president was Sun Oil executive Robert G. Dunlop,
who succeeded J. Howard Pew as president of Sun Oil in 1947.
<P>
Major changes began with the death of J. Howard Pew. Robert I.
Smith was appointed administrator of the Glenmede Trust Company,
the holding company of the Trusts, and later served as president
of the Trusts from 1977 to 1986. He began the practice of consulting
outsiders, such as Yale University president A. Bartlett Giamatti
and future Harvard University president Neil Rudenstine for advice
on what the Trusts should do.3
<P>
Even though the Pews believed in giving anonymously, Smith oversaw
publication of the Trusts' first annual reports. He also broadened
the base of Pew funding to include large grants to major research
centers, mainstream social agencies, and Ivy League schools, even
though J. Howard Pew detested the liberalism of Ivy League schools.
In 1981, the Trusts also stopped supporting hospital wings and
disease research, shifting funds to initiatives intended to change
public health policy.4
<P>
<B>Radical Restructuring</B> 
<P>
The transformation of the Trusts accelerated with the 1987 appointment
of Dr. Thomas W. Langfitt as president. A former neurosurgeon
and vice president of health affairs at the University of Pennsylvania,
Langfitt fired 17 of 20 executives, including the executive director,
three vice presidents, and 13 program officers. The only prominent
executive to remain was Rebecca Rimel, a former nurse who was
promoted to executive director. (She became president in 1993.)
During Langfitt's tenure, two of five board members also resigned,
one under pressure for &quot;meddling&quot; in staff affairs and
another, John G. Pew, a distant relation, in protest of the foundation's
increasingly liberal leanings.5
<P>
Langfitt explains the Trusts' operating principles: &quot;In the
past, we'd identify a problem and fund private agencies. Now we
see that most of the responsibility for dealing with major social
problems rests with the government. However, it lacks the money
for new programs. So instead of working on a parallel track we
build partnerships between government and private agencies.&quot;6
Likewise, Rimel says, &quot;If we could infuse the spirit of the
'60s into our work it might get the country out of this morass
of feeling that problems are insolvable.&quot;7 According to Rimel,
&quot;The political ghosts of Pew's past are gone.&quot;8<BR>

<B>Analysis of Pew Grantmaking: The Environment</B> 
<P>
To determine the extent of change at the Pew Charitable Trusts,
we examined all grants in 1986, 1987, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1993,
and 1994. We categorized these as ideological or non-ideological,
then subdivided the ideological grants into liberal and conservative
categories.
<P>
The results of our analysis are startling. We found that in 1986,
the Trusts gave about three times as many grants and three-and-a-half
times as much money to liberal groups as to conservative ones.
By 1994, the Trusts were giving 22 times as many grants and 40
times as much money to liberal groups. The total number of grants
and amount of money given to conservative groups actually decreased
from 1986 to 1994. (See <a href="#chart1">Chart 1.</a>) 
<P>
The liberal orientation of the Trusts is evident in a number of
policy areas, particularly the environment. The Trusts are now
the nation's largest environmental grantmaker. Most funding comes
from the trust created by Joseph N. Pew, Jr., although there is
no evidence that he was interested in conservation.
<P>
The <I>1985 Annual Report of the J.N. Pew Jr. Charitable Trust</I>
shows that 19 conservation grants were awarded in 1984. These
supported such goals as protecting &quot;the natural environment
and genetic diversity.&quot;9 In 1986, the J.N. Pew Trust made
grants totalling over three million dollars to such moderately
liberal environmental groups as the Nature Conservancy, National
Wildlife Foundation, and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute's
Marine Policy and Ocean Management Center.
<P>
The J.N. Pew Trust has since embraced radical environmentalism.
In 1991, it awarded 98 environmental grants totalling over $13
million. These addressed such concerns as &quot;Deforestation
and the Loss of Biodiversity&quot; and &quot;Global Warming and
Climate Change.&quot; By 1994, the J.N. Pew Trust was giving $17
million to environmental groups, and the combined trusts were
providing over $23 million in environmental funding (see <a href="#chart2">Chart
2</a>).
<P>
This sweeping change is probably due to the 1990 appointment of
Joshua Reichert, the Trusts' program director in conservation
and the environment. Reichert is a former liberal organizer associated
with Caesar Chavez's United 
Farm Workers10 who, according to Langfitt, &quot;understands environmental
issues from the ground up. He has worked at both the program and
policy level to effect environmental change, has had considerable
domestic and international experience, and is particularly familiar
with the important and oftentimes understated linkages between
economic, social, and environmental problems.&quot;11
<P>
In 1994, the Trusts adopted an interdisciplinary approach to the
environment. Under the rubric &quot;the Global Agenda&quot; and
&quot;the Pew Global Stewardship Initiative,&quot; funds are drawn
from the Pew Memorial Trust and support such nonprofits as the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences ($230,000), Environmental
Defense Fund ($180,000), Global Action Plan for the Earth ($150,000
to teach children &quot;to lead environmentally sustainable lives&quot;),
International Institute for Sustainable Development ($150,000),
International Women's Health Coalition ($150,000), League of Women
Voter's Voter Education Fund ($75,000), National Council for International
Health ($50,000), Planned Parenthood Federation of America ($130,000),
and Zero Population Growth ($150,000). Funding from other Trust
programs in 1994 supported the Center for Public Interest Research
($115,000), Environmental Defense Fund ($140,000), Friends of
the Earth ($45,000), Natural Resources Defense Council ($1,175,000
[three grants]), and Rainforest Action Network ($160,000).12
<P>
<B>Undoing the J. Howard Pew Freedom Trust</B> 
<P>
J. Howard Pew created his trust to support individual initiative,
free markets, lower taxes, and less regulation
. The Trust's charter proclaims that &quot;[S]ocialism, welfare-stateism,
Marxism, Fascism and any other like forms of government intervention
are but devices by which government seizes the ownership or control
of production.&quot; Pew also expressed his belief that the &quot;enemies
of freedom employ sophistry, obfuscation, and semantics in order
to destroy the true meaning of liberty. . .&quot;
<P>
Despite its explicitness, the new leadership has diverted the
Trust from its founder's intent. Incredibly, the Trust, which
once supported numerous conservative domestic public-policy organizations,
has virtually abandoned these efforts. In 1993, the Trust made
no grants to conservative domestic public policy groups. In 1994,
it made only one such grant to the National Right to Work Legal
Defense and Education Foundation ($150,000). The conservative
Heritage Foundation also received a grant of $300,000, but this
was to study international trade. In contrast, as late as 1989,
the Trust made 10 such grants totalling $1,775,000. In 1981, conservative
grants totalled $2,432,000 and were awarded to the Alternative
Education Foundation ($22,000), American Enterprise Institute
($1,000,000), Committee for a Free World ($25,000), Ethics and
Public Policy Center ($200,000), Heritage Foundation ($100,000),
and Rockford Institute ($30,000) (see <a href="#chart3">Chart 3</a>).
<P>
Grants since 1991 have supported public policy initiatives in
the former Communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
In 1994, the Trust made 27 such grants, mostly to ideologically
indeterminate groups. According to the <I>Chronicle of Philanthropy</I>,
however, the Trust is phasing out its support of Central and Eastern
Europe this year &quot;to focus its $10-million public-policy
program on similar efforts in the United States.&quot; Whether
such funding will promote free markets and limited government
is questionable, since the Trusts are currently &quot;pouring
money&quot; into the Pew Center for Civic Journalism in Washington,
D.C. in order &quot;to alter news coverage of government and politics
to focus more attention on solutions to problems than on political
differences.&quot;13 This may be an effort to counter the recent
Republican sweep of Congress and the Contract with America.
<P>
<B>Family Involvement: An Effective Safeguard?</B> 
<P>
Four seats on the Trusts' eight member board are held by Pew descendants,
who according to <I>Town and Country</I> are &quot;philosophically
attuned to the founders' spirit.&quot; They are R. Anderson Pew,
a great nephew of Joseph N. Pew, Jr., who has long been involved
in the Trusts; Joseph N. Pew III, the son of Joseph N. Pew, Jr.;
J. Howard Pew II, a grandson of Joseph N. Pew, Jr., who is listed
as &quot;an environmental activist in Chester, Nova Scotia;&quot;
and Dr. Joseph Pew IV, another grandson of Joseph N. Pew, Jr.,
who &quot;practices medicine in disadvantaged neighborhoods.&quot;14
<P>
These members appear to be at least complacent, if not supportive,
of the recent changes, although all but one refuse to be interviewed.
R. Anderson Pew says he sees no inconsistency between the founders'
intent and current grantmaking: the Trusts' founders &quot;never
saw any inconsistency between holding to their beliefs and adapting
to a changing world. If Uncle Joe and Uncle Howard were sitting
here today, they'd approve of the direction we've taken.&quot;15
He also purports to be &quot;mystified&quot; by the idea that
the founders were conservative: &quot;Our Aunt Harriet Pew in
Civil War days ran an underground railroad helping slaves. . .
. You can't get much more liberal than that.&quot;16 Of course,
such efforts occurred before the Trust-founding Pews were born.
And while admirable, the underground railroad was not the kind
of &quot;public-private partnership&quot; now endorsed by the
Trusts, but a wholly private endeavor in defiance of federal law.
<P>
The fact that the Pew Charitable Trusts' grantmaking is now far
removed from the vision of its founders suggests that in the long
run family involvement may not be an effective means of upholding
donor intent. As Martin Wooster writes, &quot;the longer a foundation
exists, the less likely it is to heed donor intent. This is due
in part to fading memories, as friends and associates of donors
die and are succeeded by people who did not personally know the
founder.&quot;17 This is a warning that donors should take to
heart.

<B>The J. Howard Pew Freedom Trust</B>
<P>
Created in 1957, the J. Howard Pew Freedom Trust exists to:
<UL>
<LI>&quot;Acquaint the American people with the evils of bureaucracy
and the vital need to maintain and preserve a limited form of
government in the United States as intended by our forebears and
expressed by them in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights;&quot;
<LI>&quot;Acquaint the American people with the values of a free
market, the dangers of inflation, the need for a stable monetary
standard, the paralyzing effects of government control on the
lives and activities of people;&quot;
<LI>&quot;Support and expound the philosophy that we must first
have faith in God before we can enjoy the blessings of liberty;&quot;
and
<LI>&quot;Bring about the realization that our failure to fight
for the preservation of our liberty is a crime, the punishments
for which is servitude.&quot;
</UL>

J. Howard Pew, a pioneer in the petroleum industry, was an outspoken
defender of free enterprise and a critic of big government. Here
are some excerpts from his numerous speeches and writings:
<UL>
<LI>&quot;No economic planning authority could possibly have foreseen,
planned, plotted, and organized such an amazing spectacle of industrial
progress as the world has witnessed in the last century. No trust
or combination, private or governmental, could have accomplished
it.&quot;
<LI>You can't mix government and business &quot;any more than
you can mix pure water with contaminated water and get anything
but contaminated water.&quot;
<LI>&quot;The hand of Government on business is the cold clammy
hand of death and it must eventually destroy everything it touches.&quot;
<LI>&quot;It has been because of its freedom from regulatory interference,
its full opportunity to deal, unhampered, with its manifest problems,
that the petroleum industry has been able so well to serve the
public interest.&quot;
<LI>&quot;Nobody must be barred, no innovation rejected, no idea
untried; everybody must have his chance. . . . That is our great
American heritage. With so many political witch doctors abroad
in the land teaching communism, fascism, planned and dictated
economies, governmental paternalism and all the others, I urge
you to guard well that heritage and turn a deaf ear to all their
sophistries. When a people come to look upon their government
as the source of all their rights, there will surely come a time
when they will look upon that same government as the source of
all their wrongs. That is the history of all planned, dictated
economies. That is the history of tyranny.&quot;

On February 8, President Clinton, with much fanfare, signed the 1996 Telecommunications Act.  The law heralds a new era of growth and competition in the rapidly expanding communications sector, which now accounts for one-seventh of the American economy.  The first overhaul of communications policy in 60 years, the legislation promises to unleash a market free-for-all by tearing down anti-competitive barriers and allowing heretofore segregated industries to enter each others' markets.  Soon, local phone companies will offer long distance services; long distance carriers will provide local service; and both will provide video services.  Cable companies are eager to provide phone service, and users of the Internet and digital technology, restricted only by their imaginations, are already revolutionizing how people communicate with one another.
<p>The main thrust of the new law is laudably deregulatory.  But despite its promising framework, the devil is in the details.  The Federal Communications Commission must conduct scores of rulemaking proceedings to implement the new law.  That means there are many opportunities for mischief on the part of special interests seeking to use the process to restrict competition in one way or another.  
<p>Much has already been written about the various corporate supplicants jockeying for their respective "fair advantage."  Yet the corporate turf wars are only part of the picture.  The law provides plenty of opportunities for big government types eager for a handout.  And a horde of nonprofit pleaders  all claiming to represent the public interest  are queuing up to get their chunk of the pie.  Having failed to derail telecommunications reform, they are now doing their best to gum up the process.  
<p>Smelling money, this vast array of activist groups hopes to use the law's universal service provision to establish a new communications entitlement that will encompass everything from free services for schools to HUD grants for wiring housing projects to the Internet.  The activists are egged on by federal agency officials who see deregulation as a threat to their sinecures.  Unconstrained competition is great for consumers, but scary to those whose power depends on maintaining government control.

<h3>The Birth of a New Entitlement</h3>
"Up for Grabs," appropriately enough, was the title of a June 10 conference at Gallaudet University in Washington sponsored by the Benton Foundation, with funding from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur, W. K. Kellogg, and Charles Stewart Mott foundations, as well as the Carnegie Corporation and Ameritech.  Billed as a discussion of the public interest in the new telecommunications environment, it attracted a multitude of progressives representing such groups as People for American Way, Child Welfare League of America, Planned Parenthood, American Library Association, and OMB Watch.  This professional assembly of the socially concerned pondered what the information age meant for them. 
<p>The conference participants shared certain assumptions.  They generally agreed that unfettered markets threaten the fabric of society, that a "referee" is needed to correct the inevitable injustices caused by competition, and that corporate power, left unchecked, will overwhelm the right of other voices to participate in the decisionmaking process.  The participants were unsympathetic to Republican policy ideas and argued for the public's "right" to have access to the new technology.  Needless to say, for the right to be real it would have to be subsidized by the federal government.  
<p>Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) set the tone for the conference at its morning session.  Markey outlined his scheme for a new telecom entitlement centered on his proposal for an "E-Rate."  Schools would receive "free" a core of communications services under the proposal.  Additional advanced services would be acquired at a discounted E-Rate.  Calling for an E-Rate "crusade," Markey urged activists to rally editorial opinion behind it and warned that a "social disaster" was in the making unless schools received these services.  Enthusiastic applause greeted Markey's prediction that by next year he would again be chairman of the House subcommittee dealing with telecommunications issues.
<p>(The alphabet seems central to Markey's policy initiatives.  He is also an architect of the "V-Chip," which in theory allows parents to screen out violent programming.)
<p>Markey's remarks revealed much about the cozy relationship between government and nonprofit advocacy groups.  Liberal interest groups serve the political class, which rewards them for generating grassroots support.  Conferences like this one enable activists to meet with their political comrades to discuss how both can survive and flourish.  Indeed, the event was co-sponsored by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), a part of the Commerce Department.  NTIA administers the Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance Program, which is considered one of the top slush funds for government grants to nonprofits.
<p>Thus, Markey implored participants to "ruthlessly participate" in the process.  At the same session, Bob Rowe, a commissioner on the Montana Public Service Commission, warned the crowd that utility regulators were too exposed to business interests and needed to hear more from the "public interest community."  Later, in a small discussion group, he urged advocates to take a grassroots organizing approach.  A lawyer from the Agriculture Department volunteered his agency to subsidize the new technology entitlement.
<p>Senator Robert Kerrey (D-Neb.) provided a further illustration of how nonprofits and government sustain one another.  During a question and answer session after lunch, Kerrey was asked how Indian and rural communities could obtain access to advanced telecommunications.  When the questioner offered to send Kerrey more information, the Senator shot back, "Don't send me the information, send me [legislative] language."  
<p>Many discussions bordered on the surreal.  Some participants seemed convinced that inability to access the internet was a serious cause of many social ills.  Coralee Whitcomb, president of a Boston group called Virtually Wired, worried that the disadvantaged would be "railroaded" off the information mainline and appealed for assistance in connecting battered women to the internet.  She was particularly concerned that those in homeless shelters were unaware of the internet's value.  One might as well have demanded HMOs for Bosnia or Enterprise Zones in Liberia.  
<p>Some conferencegoers shaded their political demands by employing corporate-inspired jargon about "leveraging" grants and "strategic interventions," but there were also class warriors like Gigi Sohn from the Media Access Project, a liberal public interest law firm, who spoke of a "handful of big companies controlling what people hear and see."  Richard Sclove of the Loka Institute deplored the process by which Americans became "atoms up against global economic forces and multinational corporations."
<p>Most participants, however, seemed less inspired by radical activism or liberal ideas than by an envy that the technology revolution is generating enormous wealth.  Sohn summed it up:  "It comes down to money."  Contemporary interest group liberalism is not about new ideas or protecting individual rights: it is focused on protecting and enlarging privileges that depend on maintaining streams of funding from government.

<h3>Universal Service: The Politics of Magic Words </h3>
The rallying cry for telecom collectivists is universal service, the belief that everyone should have access to phone service.  In practice, universal service has meant that urban and long distance phone customers, regardless of income, subsidize the cost of providing equivalent services to rural users.  Proponents assert that phone service is almost a corollary to the constitutionally-protected right to free speech.  Activists now seek to extend the concept of universal service to other forms of electronic communications.  They have good reason to think they can win this fight because the 1996 Telecommunication Act has a universal service mandate.  It sets up a Federal-State Joint Board to make recommendations for implementing the law's universal service provision.
<p>By early fall the FCC is expected to issue a universal service rule.  The rulemaking process, which invites comments in response to the agency's initial "Notice of Proposed Rulemaking," has attracted an unusually broad range of interested parties.  Hundreds of organizations from consumer and civil rights groups to the U.S. Catholic Conference have filed comments.  The large number of participants reflects the amount of money that is at stake.  As Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation observed in its reply comments, "This proceeding will largely determine who will receive universal service subsidies and who will pay for them."
<p>Probably the most vocal and visible player in the universal service debate is the Consumer Federation of America.  CFA was actively involved in the debate over the telecom act, and it has been a thorn in the side of the exponents of telecom deregulation.
<p>According to Bradley Stillman, CFA's telecommunications policy director, not only is every American consumer entitled to have "access to the full panoply of services available over the telecommunications network," there should also be a "guarantee that they will have some level of actual <i>service</i> as well [emphasis in original]."
<p>For CFA, affordability is the bedrock of universal service.  In comments filed jointly with Consumers Union and American Association of Retired Persons, CFA argues that an expansive "relative" definition of affordability "should be a basic concept of universal service."  In other words, people should not have to "seriously diminish their standard of living" or face "serious inconvenience" as a result of paying for telecommunications services.
<p>CFA and its nonprofit allies believe universal service should include not only basic access, but also flat-rate service, directory assistance, the provision of directories, Call Trace, and 900-number blocking service.  (A number of groups, including the U.S. Catholic Conference and the National Coalition for the Homeless, contend that the universal service package should also include specialty services like voice mail.)
<p>The joint comments filed by nine other activist groups, including People for the American Way, Benton Foundation, Center for Media Education, National Council of La Raza, and National Rainbow Coalition, are even more explicit.  Prepared by counsel for People for the American Way and the Media Access Project, they assert unabashedly that "full, equal, and affordable access to a broad range of telecommunications services is a birthright of citizenship."  Put bluntly, "Those without access to telecommunications services are disenfranchised."
<p>No doubt, most of us would prefer to receive a "universal service" for anything; how about cars or televisions?  But as CSE Foundation notes, "to the extent the definition of universal service becomes more expansive, it becomes more expensive."  And the costs of such a policy are likely to be passed on to ordinary telecommunications consumers, and "may hurt those who do not qualify for subsidies yet cannot afford to pay the inevitable costs."
<p>It is important to understand that those mobilizing to affect the law's provision for universal service are not simple do-gooders ignorant of economic consequences.  Advocates of the new communications "right" believe that the communications revolution can become a vehicle to further their political aims.  Hence, People for the American Way and friends emphasize the "role of institutions" in applying an expansive notion of universal service that includes "institutional access to advanced services."  Institutions, they maintain, can provide "fundamentals training, skills building, information exchanges, and technical support" and can "even function as access providers for community networks." 
<p>According to Gary Bass, the head of OMB Watch, "Whether it's the Million Man March or the Stand for Children, we saw the Internet was a tool for organizing . . .  These are empowering mechanisms."  Bass insists that activists must "fight for the right of community groups across the country to have access to the bells and whistles."  The activist left would like nothing more than for the government to provide a free communications apparatus for its lacework of alliances and networks.

<h3>Consumer Federation of America: Suspect Source</h3>
CFA and its allies have been the primary stumbling blocks to greater telecommunications competition.  CFA's Stillman claims to welcome the outbreak of competition among telecom providers.  He says, "We must have competition as soon as possible," that "competition is the only effective outcome", and that competition and universal service are "not conflicting goals."  Yet while the legislation was before Congress, CFA claimed that the telecom bill would cost consumers billions of dollars in higher phone costs.  By contrast, Citizens for a Sound Economy, a group with considerable policy expertise in regulatory issues, estimates that the bill may lower consumer prices by 20 to 30 percent.
<p>CFA has a poor track record in predicting communications costs.  When the old Bell system was broken up in 1984, it contended that local rates would skyrocket, forcing consumers to give up their telephones.  But when one takes inflation into account, phone rates have actually decreased during the past decade.  And phone usage is way up, requiring phone companies to add new area codes at a record rate.  Since the AT&T divestiture the consumer price index consistently has grown at a rate faster than changes in basic local phone rates.  Was this a surprise to CFA?  Probably not.  In 1986, then-CFA Legislative Director Gene Kimmelman, who is now co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union, CFA's sidekick in the telecom wars, was quoted in the <i>New York Times</i>:  "To be honest, we painted the worst case scenario and it hasn't been that bad."
<p>CFA was also the prime force behind the 1992 Cable Act, which has been largely repealed by the new Telecommunications Act.  Most analysts have concluded that by 1992 cable rates had peaked and that service was on the upswing.  A classic case of regulatory overkill, the main repercussion of the '92 act was to confuse consumers with nearly unintelligible bills.  Wayne Leighton, an economist at CSE, notes that "while it is true that prices were increasing somewhat before passage of the Cable Act, the quality of services was rising at a faster rate.  The law capped rates, and, as one would expect, services dropped drastically."
<p>CFA's actions on the telecommunications front have been driven by the group's anti-free market ideology.  Railing against "increased concentration" in the industry is characteristic of CFA's enmity toward business and free enterprise.  A glance at CFA's policy resolutions shows that, on virtually every issue, CFA supports more government control and regulation over private action.  It opposes both the flat tax and a consumption-based income tax, supports taxpayer funding of political campaigns, opposes the line-item veto; opposes term limits; opposes a balance budget amendment, supports Canadian-style single-payer health care reform, and opposes medical savings accounts.
<p>Notwithstanding its clear ideological makeup, CFA has been enormously effective at getting its message out.  A Nexis search joining the terms "Consumer Federation of America" and "telecommunications" resulted in 459 citations since the beginning of 1995.  Even AT&T resorted to a CFA study in a television commercial as evidence of the baleful consequences of the then-pending telecom act.

<h3>Competition Policy Institute: Whose Interest is Served?</h3>
A new telecom "public interest" watchdog group was in the news recently when it was revealed that long distance giants AT&T and MCI were among its main sources of funding.  The Competition Policy Institute was co-founded in March by Ron Binz, former head of Colorado's Office of Consumer Counsel, and Debra Berlyn, executive director of the National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates and a prominent critic of deregulation.  The group made the news when the <i>Washington Post</i> reported that John Windhausen had left his job as a Commerce Committee staffer for Senator Ernest Hollings (D-SC) to work for CPI.  Hollings was a major force in crafting the 1996 Telecom Act.  CPI received $500,000 in seed money from AT&T, MCI, and other communications companies (see box for list of companies).
<p>A first look at CPI's advisory Committee would lead one to believe that it was simply another ideological advocate of big government.  It includes CFA's Stillman, as well as Rich McClintock of the Colorado Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) and Susan Weinstock of AARP.  Yet its mission will be to promote policies "that introduce competition in telecommunications and energy markets in ways that benefit consumers," focusing initially on implementation of the new telecom law.  Interestingly, in the group's press release, Binz specifically points to the need for "competition for local phone service."  But ironically there is no mention of competition in long-distance phone service.  The long distance providers bankrolling CPI are eager to enter the local phone markets.  They are not thrilled, however, at the prospects of the Bell Operating Companies (Baby Bells) entering their long distance business. 
<p>

<h3>Children's Television: <br>
Effective and Constitutional?</h3>
Implementation of the Telecommunications Act is only one area attracting the attention of special interest nonprofits.  "Children's Television" remains a lively issue engaging the attention of activist groups.  The FCC announced recently that it will move forward to adopt a rule requiring broadcasters to air three hours weekly of so-called educational television.  This follows a barrage of statements by politicians and interest groups supporting a programming quota, an idea strongly supported by FCC Chairman Reid Hundt, alter ego of Vice President Gore.  President Clinton, the prominent advocate of school uniforms and curfews, also voiced his support.
<p>On May 29, Massachusetts' Rep. Markey held a press conference with representatives of supportive nonprofits to announce that 220 members of Congress  a majority of House members  had signed a letter urging the FCC to adopt the three hour rule and "defend the rights of children."  Markey had the support of the Consumer Federation of America, National Education Association, the U.S. Catholic Conference, Children's Television Workshop, the national PTA, and Children Now, to name a few.  Shortly thereafter, dubious holdouts at the FCC surrendered, clearing the way for adoption of the rule.
<p>Will the rule do what it's supposed to do?  Writing in the <i>Weekly Standard, American Spectator</i> media critic James Bowman observes, "The truth that everybody really does know, but doesn't quite say, is this:  TV, whether 'commercial' or 'educational,' isn't good for you. . . .  At best, television is light entertainment."  So-called educational television, notes Bowman, may only be marginally more beneficial to children than entertainment programming.  The skeptical critic argues that if contemporary children "have no intellectual context in which to place the constant stream of moving images, [they] will never gain anything of any educational use from it."
<p>First amendment expert Robert Corn-Revere, a partner at Hogan & Hartson and adjunct professor at Catholic University's law school, offers a second and more severe argument against a programming quota.  He notes that "no court has ever upheld a specific programming mandate by the FCC."  "Compelling speech is no different than censorship," adds Corn-Revere, who sees the three-hours-a-week proposal as further evidence that there is "less sensitivity" to constitutional concerns at the FCC these days.
<p>
<a name="ed"></a>
<h3>Center for Media Education</h3>
The Center for Media Education is a leading proponent of children's television mandates.  Headed by Jeff Chester, CME is the "designated successor to Action for Children's Television," a nonprofit founded by Peggy Charren, a longtime crusader against television advertising.  CME organized a coalition of groups that called for a mandate of at least one hour per day of educational programming.  
<p>CME has also received wide notice for its work to protect children from what it calls "exploitive media industry practices."  With major funding from the philanthropic Carnegie Corporation of New York, CME launched "Action for Children in Cyberspace" to fight "over-commercialization" and "manipulative forms of advertising."  Pursuing Charren's anti-commercialism theme, it has proposed new rules to restrict what it sees as "deceptive and unfair advertising practices" on the internet.
<p>Founded in 1991, CME has cultivated the concept of "electronic redlining," the notion that unless government and nonprofits intervene to protect the public interest the information highway will bypass the poor and minorities.  Along with CFA, it seeks to "protect consumers from price gouging and other abuses on new telephone and TV systems."  CME has called on the FCC to adopt special rates for nonprofits.
<p>CME has received funding from the Annie E. Casey, Maximilian E. & Marion O Hoffman, John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur, and Nathan Cummings foundations, and the Pew Charitable Trusts.
<p>
<a name="media"></a>
<h3>Media Access Project</h3>
The furthest left of the telecom nonprofit activists is the Media Access Project.  MAP got its start fighting on behalf of the FCC's fairness doctrine, which was supposed to provide equal time for alternative views.  While the fairness doctrine was also supported by some conservative groups (it was significantly repealed in the 1980s), MAP regarded it as a means to "open the networks to anti-war and civil rights activists."  Focused mainly on broadcast and cable, MAP supports government rules that promote minority and female ownership of telecom industries and policies that insure "access for divergent points of view and alternate artistic perspectives."  MAP shares office space in Washington, D.C. with People for the American Way, and the two groups work closely together.
<p>Like the Consumer Federation of America and People for the American Way, MAP is motivated by hostility toward free enterprise.  It wants to impose greater public interest requirements on broadcasters such as "free" airtime for political candidates.  It also favors regulations to restrict the concentration of ownership in the mass media, and it has criticized recent Baby Bell mergers.
<p>MAP opposes attempts to restrict indecent programming.  It attacked a 1992 law that encouraged cable TV operators to ban indecent programming on public access channels.  MAP Executive Director Andrew J. Schwartzman accused the legislation's sponsor, North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms of "trying to get cable operators to do the government's bidding."  Likewise, MAP joined a bevy of other parties, including the ACLU and People for the American Way, in challenging a 1995 Circuit Court ruling upholding limits on the hours during which indecent programming may be broadcast on TV.  The Supreme Court declined to review the lower court decision.
<p>MAP actually agrees, to a limited extent, with many conservatives on the issue of digital spectrum.  Conservative groups like The Heritage Foundation, as well as Republican presidential candidate Robert Dole, argue that the lucrative digital spectrum should be auctioned off rather than given to broadcasters as currently planned.  MAP opposes the idea of a corporate "give away," but not out of any desire to privatize the radio spectrum.  Instead, it wants to extort nonprofit giveaways.  It proposes that a portion of the money raised through auctions be diverted for "public purposes" like children's programming or public broadcasting  or to "fund nonprofit access to advanced telecommunications networks."
<p>Alternatively, MAP would have the FCC require broadcasters to reserve part of their frequencies for nonprofits or agree to carry additional "public programming" in exchange for the digital spectrum licenses which they want so desperately. 
<p>MAP has received funding from the Nathan Cummings Foundation and the J. Roderick MacArthur Foundation.

<h3>The New Luddites</h3>
In the past decade communications has become the most dynamic sector of our economy.  The little-understood and as yet largely unimplemented Telecommunications Act of 1996 could arguably be the most significant piece of legislation passed by Congress in a long time.  It presents endless opportunities for growth and prosperity.  But like the Luddites of old, there are those eager to block change.  Fearing technology, or more accurately, fearing the loss of established political power that new technologies always undermine, they stand in the way.

Republican presidential candidate Robert Dole has proposed a charity tax credit, which will allow taxpayers to earmark a portion of their taxes ($500 for individuals and up to $1,000 for couples) to private and religious charities that spend over 75 percent of their money on poverty relief.  Dole said it would give Americans the choice of giving their money "to Big Government, or to Big Brothers and Big Sisters."

We observed the MAOIST INTERNATIONALIST MOVEMENT distributing its newsletter at the CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND rally "Stand for Children" on June 1.  There's no need to ask them for a copy; it's on the internet: http://ursula.blythe.org/mim
<p>
Unlike the Maoists, most rally participants were not so foolish as to favor the overthrow of the government that provides so much grant money to advocacy groups.  Among the horde of left-wing organizations endorsing the event, 102 received federal grants totalling over $392,468,000.  Participants who merited space at the official information tables included AARP, NATIONAL COUNCIL OF SENIOR CITIZENS, SIERRA CLUB, NATIONAL WILDLIFE FEDERATION, SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION (SEIU), AFL-CIO, and the ETHICS AND MEANING group started by the first of Hillary Clinton's gurus, Michael Lerner.

WLF will provide all of the Counsel's legal work free of charge.  CAPITAL RESEARCH CENTER President Terrence Scanlon is a member of Counsel's board of governors.  Contact WLF for more information:  2009 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.  20036.
<p>
Congress is expected to pass legislation making it easier for citizens to get information about tax-exempt groups.  The measure is designed to assist the public in getting access to the Form 990 that most nonprofits must file.  Under the proposed change, nonprofits would have to mail a copy of the form within 30 days of a written request. 
<p>
Former United States Attorney General and Capital Research Center Trustee Edwin Meese III is the advisory board chairman of a new research group that will focus on improving the management of America's corrections and prison system.  The ENTERPRISE PRISON INSTITUTE will explore the efficacy of prison industries and the potential for corporate involvement in prisons.  Contact Adam Dubitsky, 202-628-0063, or Knut Rostad, 202-466-7001.

Conspiracies involving traffickers in illegal drugs are covered
extensively in the media. So are stories about individual drug
users who would like to grow, obtain and use drugs legally. But
very little has been written about the prominent individuals and
nonprofit organizations that have made the legalization of drugs
an issue in public policy. A worldwide network of people and groups
is coalescing to work to end the criminal penalties attached to
the sale and use of currently illegal drugs. Most Americans are
not aware of how serious and determined these efforts are. But
the public needs to realize that the availability of drugs, the
extent of drug use, and even the corrupting effects of illegal
drug trafficking are only part of the story. What has not been
adequately discussed is the political influence of the pro-drug
legalization movement and the economic, social, cultural and moral
consequences of its activities. 

<P>
Because most experts in law enforcement agree that the &quot;war
on drugs&quot; launched by President Nixon in 1970 has not been
won, much of the public has become skeptical of claims that authorities
are committed to fighting drugs. Increasingly indifferent to the
anti-drug rhetoric of politicians, many Americans are starting
to listen more attentively to a growing, widespread, and well-targeted
public relations campaign aimed at making them more accepting
of public policies that would tolerate drug use. 
<P>
Contributing to this are well-intentioned and well known individuals
such as financier George Soros, Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke,
and commentator William F. Buckley Jr., who have become convinced
that legalization is the answer. They are among the most prominent
public figures who have lent their voices -- and their respectability
-- to calls for drug legalization. 
<P>
Television &quot;documentaries&quot; are often supportive
of legalization arguments. MTV's &quot;Straight Dope&quot; (April
1994), ABC's &quot;America's War on Drugs: Searching for Solutions&quot;
(April 1995), and The Discovery Channel's &quot;The Cronkite Report:
The Drug Dilemma&quot; (Fall 1995) were all sympathetic to legalization
and calls for so-called &quot;alternative&quot; drug policies.
PBS programs, including <I>Firing Line</I> and <I>The Charlie
Rose Show</I>, have questioned the wisdom of the drug war and
the prohibition of illegal drugs -- as have <I>National Review</I>,
<I>New York Magazine</I>, <I>The New York Times</I>, and <I>The
Los Angeles Times</I>. All use phrases like &quot;harm reduction,&quot;
&quot;responsible use,&quot; &quot;alternatives,&quot; and &quot;decriminalization,&quot;
which have become code words used to mask a pro-legalization agenda.

<P>
The cover story in the February 12, 1996 issue of William
Buckley's magazine, <I>National Review</I>, was devoted to drug
legalization, with a series of essays making the case for ending
the legal prohibition. The journal that arguably established the
intellectual foundations for the modern conservative movement
is now providing a forum for these opinions. Most politicians,
government officials, as well as the majority of the American
people still dismiss pro-drug legalization arguments. But a broad
array of well-funded nongovernmental organizations across the
political spectrum is developing programs to legitimize drug legalization.

<P>
The financial backing and political and social support for
legalization arguments comes from a variety of sources, including
George Soros's Open Society Fund, the Soros Foundation and his
own Lindesmith Center, the Drug Policy Foundation, and the National
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML). Together
with such organizations as the American Civil Liberties Union,
ACT-UP, and the New York chapter of the American Bar Association,
they make up the pro-legalization chorus. 
<P>
In addition, a number of other groups, including prominent
foundations like the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation,
Twentieth Century Fund, Carnegie Corporation, RAND Corporation,
and the Ford Foundation, do not advocate legalization, but provide
indirect support. They fund projects that not only criticize current
law enforcement policies, but lend support to the argument that
the drug war is a lost cause. Contending that the supply of drugs
can never be halted, these groups call instead for more treatment
facilities and programs for drug users and less law enforcement
and interdiction against drugs. They insist that many drug offenders
are non-violent and should not be imprisoned. Yet their arguments
confuse the consequences of drug use with its cause. As Robert
Peterson, the former Illinois drug czar, has said, &quot;You cannot
win the war by treating the wounded.&quot; 
<P>
Political figures like Representative Barney Frank (D-MA)
and former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders have spoken out, joining
Hollywood notables like producer David Geffen and actor Richard
Dreyfuss, and writers Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, John LeCarre,
Jorge Castaneda, and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, in seeking decriminalization
of drugs. 
<P>
Arguments that lend support to the pro-legalization movement
are advancing on all fronts. They are adapted and modified to
persuade different segments of the public. Thus, taxpayers are
warned that drug prohibition wastes public resources and is not
cost-effective. Law enforcement officers are reminded that an
unsuccessful drug war breeds disrespect for all laws. Parents
are counselled that kids are more likely to respect them and keep
themselves safe if they aren't forced into back alleys in dangerous
neighborhoods to buy their &quot;recreational drugs.&quot; The
health conscious are enlightened with data that purports to show
that cocaine is a &quot;unique source of vitamins and minerals&quot;
and that government needle bans promote unsafe and unnecessary
needle exchanges that are responsible for HIV infection among
those who inject their drugs. The arguments are unending to help
Americans overcome the repressions of a &quot;hypocritical&quot;
society. 
<P>
<a name="soros"><B>An Evening At Soros's</B> </a>
<P>
<I>Editor's note: Ms. Ehrenfeld attended the event she describes
below.</I> 
<P>
&quot;Cocaine is as good a stimulant as coffee with less harmful
effects on the body,&quot; said a drug legalization advocate in
New York. A colleague from Duke University chimed in, &quot;And,
it fills a spiritual vacuum in the deep void left by our shallow,
materialistic society.&quot; 
<P>
Caricature? Not at all: These are some of the comments made
by the respected guests of billionaire financier George Soros
at a gathering at his opulent Upper East Side Manhattan duplex.
Having spent hundreds of millions of dollars to foster the democratic
values of an &quot;open society,&quot; and claiming credit for
bringing down Communist rule in Eastern Europe, Soros is now mobilizing
some of his vast resources to fight against the &quot;evils and
misguided policy of the drug war.&quot; During last September's
Gorbachev Foundation &quot;The State of the World Forum&quot;
meeting in San Francisco, Ethan Nadelmann, director of Soros's
Lindesmith Center, introduced those ideas as part of the New World
Order while moderating the session on &quot;creative approaches
to the international drug crisis.&quot; 

<p>Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott has described Soros
as &quot;a national resource -- indeed, a national treasure.&quot;
Yet the sixty-six-year-old, Hungarian-born Soros seems to be the
treasury of the movement to legalize drugs. He is the godfather
of the pro-legalization, decriminalization, harm reduction and
&quot;responsible use&quot; movements, all of which are interconnected.

<P>
Since the early nineties, Soros has donated $6 million dollars
to the Washington-based Drug Policy Foundation (DPF), and he apparently
hosts DPF's New York office in his own offices on 7th Avenue.
Soros also gave at least $4 million dollars to the Lindesmith
Center, and $3 million dollars to Drug Strategies, which, according
to its president, Mathea Falco, promotes &quot;more effective
approaches to the nation's drug problem.&quot; 
<P>
In 1994 Soros, through his foundations, made grants totalling
at least $13 million dollars to a variety of organizations involved
in drug policy-related projects. In 1995, he &quot;provided $450,000
to Human Rights Watch for their first ever project on the abuses
of the war on drugs worldwide.&quot; Other non-American organizations
that have benefitted indirectly from Soros's largesse include
the Canadian Foundation for Drug Policy, which was formed in 1993;
the International Anti-Prohibitionist League, which is based in
Montreal and has offices in Europe; and the Australian Drug Law
Reform Foundation. 
<P>
These and other Soros-funded groups organize and help to fund
international conferences to promote marijuana and drug legalization
policies, and &quot;harm reduction,&quot; a term that refers to
programs designed to reduce the ill effects of illegal drugs.
They have played key roles in organizing and funding meetings
in the U.S., Italy, the Netherlands, Australia and Canada. They
also arrange for overseas legalization advocates to speak in public
forums in the U.S. and elsewhere, by covering their expenses and
providing honoraria. 
<P>
Soros poses as being open-minded on the drug issue, and in
public he calls for debate. Yet in press interviews his spokesman
on drugs Ethan Nadelmann has recalled that Soros told him: &quot;We
are basically in agreement . . . [I] empower you to accomplish
our common objectives.&quot; Nadelmann's objective is to &quot;legalize
the personal use of drugs by adult Americans. . . .&quot; And
Soros &quot;is comfortable with that,&quot; says Nadelmann. He
must be, because he is paying for it. 
<P>
Other guests were equally unrestrained at this memorable evening
at Soros's. New York district judge Robert Sweet, who favors decriminalization,
remarked, &quot;This [drugs] is a phony issue. People want to
change their state of mind because they don't have jobs, they
are deprived . . . And it is a lie that violence is caused by
drug addicts . . . The harm comes from the drug laws, not from
drugs.&quot; &quot;And let's not forget that drugs are fun,&quot;
added a well-known pro-legalization jazz musician. 
<P>
Interviewed by <I>High Times</I>, a magazine published by
NORML, Nadelmann asserted: &quot;It is important to see drugs
as a human rights issue,&quot; said Nadelmann, because &quot;it
is typically the same sorts of people who mount major wars on
Communists and major wars on drugs.&quot; He added that &quot;.
. . from a scientific perspective cocaine is not a dangerous drug
for the large majority of the people who use it&quot; -- and as
for legalization, &quot;take the chance and come out of the closet
. . . the way homosexuals . . . came out. . . . When all of a
sudden your cousin or your childhood friend or your daughter comes
out, your whole view of it begins to get normalized.&quot; 
<P>
He passionately added that &quot;Millions of Americans have
to lie to their kids because they think if their kids know they
smoke pot they'll report them. . . . That's a tremendous travesty.
The fear that children will put loyalty to the state ahead of
loyalty to the family is a lot more like Stalinist Russia or Nazi
Germany than traditional American values.&quot; 
<P>
Comments of this kind aim to establish a new intellectual
climate. Those who make such assertions see America's distrust
of drugs as an expression of its hangups. They think people who
oppose drugs are also opposed to sex, rock 'n roll, good times,
freedom, and love. The counter-culture of the 1960s and 1970s
lives on: But its most influential partisans are not on college
campuses or in Greenwich Village coffee houses. They are meeting
at receptions and conferences where the well-connected and well-to-do
gather. 
<P>
The president of a leading &quot;harm reductionist&quot; organization
told the gathering at Soros's that the U.S. should emulate Colombia.
In 1991, Colombia decriminalized drugs and made the corrupt profits
legal. Of course the violence continues, and Colombia is to the
international drug rackets world what Cicero was to Chicago in
the days of Al Capone. In March, the United States finally decertified
Colombia's eligibility for foreign aid because of its failure
to combat drugs. 
<P>
Yet despite Colombia's example, the pro-legalizers in the
U.S. receive a respectful hearing. With former Surgeon General
Joycelyn Elder's invitation to study legalization, Bill Buckley's
endorsement of legalization, and Soros's munificent funding, it
is not surprising that many well-intentioned people who began
as firm opponents of drugs have mistakenly concluded that, &quot;If
you can't beat 'em, join 'em.&quot; 
<P>
<a name="drug"><B>Drug Policy Foundation</B> </a>
<P>
In Washington, D.C., every cause needs its own think-tank.
In 1987 Arnold Trebach, a law professor at American University
in Washington and a long-time proponent of drug legalization,
established the Drug Policy Foundation (DPF). 
<P>
DPF represents the Brooks Brothers wing of the decriminalization
movement. Besides Trebach, DPF's board includes Yale law professor
Steven Duke, ACLU Executive Director Ira Glasser, Hoover Institution
Fellow Joseph MacNamara, Judge Robert Sweet from New York, Baltimore
Mayor Kurt Schmoke, Harvard psychiatrist Lester Grinspoon, Milton
Friedman, and David Boaz, executive vice president of the Cato
Institute. The media organ of DPF is <I>The Drug Policy Letter.</I>

<P>
In the May 5, 1994 issue of <I>Rolling Stone</I> magazine,
Aryeh Neier, president of Soros's Open Society Fund, was quoted
as saying, &quot;Soros doesn't think the drug war makes any sense
from an economic standpoint.&quot; The article explained that
in 1993 Soros gave DPF a &quot;set of suggestions to follow if
they wanted his assistance: Come up with an approach that emphasizes
`treatment and humanitarian endeavors,' he said . . . target a
few winnable issues, like medical marijuana and the repeal of
mandatory minimums.&quot; Apparently, they took his advice.

<P>
Besides generous support from Soros, the group has over 20,000
dues-paying members who are urged to be forthright, not furtive,
in their advocacy. Says David Condoliffe, DPF's vice-president
and the former New York City &quot;drug czar&quot; during the
Dinkins administration: &quot;Each person who cares about drug
reform must become actively involved, paying what he or she can
for DPF membership and listing five or more friends or associates,
and hosting fundraising events -- even on a small scale.&quot;
It has also received funding from such prominent philanthropies
as the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, J. Roderick
MacArthur Foundation, Harold Simmons Foundation, Public Welfare
Foundation, and the Chicago Resource Center. 
<P>
The DPF organizes educational lobby sessions with documentaries,
coffee, and cake on Capitol Hill. They train drug legalization
advocates from Canada, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany,
England, Australia, and Israel. 
<P>
A common feature of DPF activities is its careful avoidance
of direct references to drug legalization. Instead, spokesmen
call for &quot;alternative drug policies,&quot; harm reduction,
needle exchange programs, and &quot;responsible drug use.&quot;
DPF is also a grantmaker. According to <I>The Drug</I> <I>Policy
Letter</I>, DPF's Grant Program awards funds to &quot;successful
harm-reduction programs looking to expand their efforts, ranging
from needle exchange programs to peer counseling projects aimed
at `street youth'; for action-oriented grass-roots groups using
both the Internet and other communications methods to link reformers.
Furthermore, DPF believes that the drug policy debate cannot be
advanced unless Americans learn more about pioneering experiments
overseas.&quot; Perhaps the U.S. can emulate Switzerland, where
heroin and syringes are provided by the government. 
<P>
DPF grants have gone to such groups as the Cannabis Action
Network in Berkeley, California ($25,000), the Foundation on Drug
Policy and Human Rights in Amsterdam, the Netherlands ($15,000),
and Clean Needles Now in Los Angeles ($25,000). (See box).

</UL><P>
According to the its<I> Drug Policy Letter</I>, DPF expected
to award one million dollars in additional grants by the end of
1995. However, the DPF and the Soros foundations do not publicly
list all the grants they award. 
<P>
DPF shares offices with several computer on-line groups such
as the Marijuana Policy Project (MPP), formed in January, 1995,
and the Drug Reform Coordination Network (DRCNet), in action since
1993. Together with an on-line service run by the Lindesmith Center,
these services alert drug legalization advocates to what's happening
in Congress on drug issues and of current information on drug
enforcement, prevention, and treatment efforts. They also provide
warnings when more stringent laws are under consideration or when
new or extended anti-drug activity is undertaken. And they offer
advise on how to undermine government efforts to control drugs
and how to lobby for &quot;drug reform.&quot; 
<P>
<a name="NORML"><B>NORML: Selling Freedom?</B> </a>
<P>
Whereas DPF courts the establishment, the National Organization
for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) speaks for the beads
and sandals crowd. It makes no attempt to conceal its clear pro-legalization
stance. Founded by attorney Keith Stroup in 1970, NORML, which
is also based in Washington, is probably the best known of the
pro-legalization groups, and it was the first to lobby for the
legalization of marijuana in the U.S. Richard Cowan, who currently
heads the organization has claimed for NORML: &quot;We are selling
freedom, not marijuana.&quot; (<I>USA Today</I>, Nov. 25, 1994)

<P>
NORML contends that the ban on the use and sale of marijuana
threatens &quot;basic civil liberties.&quot; It supports the &quot;removal
of all penalties for the private possession of marijuana, cultivation
for personal use, and casual non-profit transfers of small amounts.&quot;
Large scale distribution would be taxed and regulated. 
<P>
NORML's board includes Kary Mullis, winner of the 1993 Nobel
Prize in chemistry; Louis Lasagna, Dean of the Sackler School
of Biomedical Science at Tufts University and chairman of the
National Academy of Science committee to study marijuana; Professor
John Morgan, author of the drug abuse section in the celebrated
<I>Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy</I>, and Lester Grinspoon,
a Harvard psychiatrist. 
<P>
NORML receives funds from eclectic sources. In addition to
grants from DPF and private contributions, rap groups such as
<I>Sacred Reich</I>, <I>Blues Traveler</I>, and <I>Cypress Hill</I>,
that perform under labels owned by Sony and Time Warner, are forwarding
to NORML the proceeds from the sales of their joint album <I>Hempilation</I>
(Capricorn Records), suggesting that &quot;because hemp is marijuana,
this will further the marijuana legalization efforts.&quot; (The
quote appears on the liner of the album along with a NORML membership
application.) The collection of songs is devoted to the &quot;wonders
of weed.&quot; These groups often display the marijuana leaf on
their albums, at their concerts, and on their promotional posters,
T-shirts and hats. Some of this merchandise is made of hemp, which
NORML promotes as an environment-friendly source for paper.

<P>
The group has over 100 chapters and affiliates around the
country. 
<P>
<a name="moral"><B>Moral Leadership: Where is it?</B> </a>
<P>
It is surprising that in this election year, drugs are not
a significant issue. Although there are no quick or easy fixes,
our political leaders ought to exercise moral leadership in speaking
out against the easy availability of drugs and those who sell
them. First Lady Nancy Reagan's &quot;Say No to Drugs&quot; campaign
demonstrated leadership. George Soros, on the other hand, is demonstrating
yet again what money can buy. What is spare change for him has
made important inroads in the public's opinions about drugs.

<P>
The counter-offensive against the drug war is succeeding by
causing the American public to begin to doubt its wisdom. Americans
need to understand the full magnitude of the movement to surrender
to drugs. 
<P>
The pro-legalization movement is far from winning the &quot;war
against the war.&quot; But if the proponents of legalization are
victorious, it would not be the first time that a persistent counterculture,
led by highly educated individuals in elite institutions, heavily
funded, and supported by many in the media, was able to reverse
deep-seated beliefs and the will of the majority of the American
people. Only this time, it will lead to the devastation of our
culture and society.

Pick up any news article about crime and somewhere in it you are likely to come across a reference to the  
Sentencing Project, a little known Washington, D.C. think tank which focuses on crime issues.  A Nexis  
search reveals that the group's name has appeared in 219 stories, 71 of them since the start of last year.  <p>
  Although obviously a press darling, the Sentencing Project (TSP) is unlike other Washington think tanks.   
It has none of the glitz of better-known policy groups:  no fancy offices or panelled conference rooms or  
glossy annual report.  What is remarkable about TSP's success is that it promotes its agenda while  
remaining obscure as an organization.  <p>
  Housed in a run-down part of Washington around the corner from the tour buses parked outside Ford's  
Theater, the group promotes what it calls "alternative sentencing programs."  From dingy offices reached  
by an antique elevator, it issues a stream of reports and policy papers whose titles - "Building Alternatives  
Instead of Jails"; "Racial Disparity in `Crack' Cocaine Sentencing"; and "Why `3 Strikes and You're Out'  
Won't Reduce Crime" - remind the reader that the absence of subtlety or nuance is not an invention of talk  
radio.  <p>
  These reports generally hammer away at two points.  The first is that locking up criminals does not reduce  
crime.  The second is that the criminal justice system is rigged against racial minorities.  These conclusions  
find their way to the front pages of major newspapers, the evening television news broadcasts, and the  
speeches of politicians.  <p>
  TSP is virtually a conservative caricature of liberal crime policy.  Rather than focus on the finding of guilt  
and the appropriate punishment for criminal acts, it seeks to uncover the sociology of "root causes" of  
crime.  And it attacks the political motivations of those who favor penalizing criminal behavior.  What is  
astounding is that we are paying for TSP.  The nonprofit 501(c)(3) group is funded through a "major grant"  
from the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Assistance.  <p>
  TSP was founded in 1986 by Malcolm C. Young, who had been associated with the National Council on  
Crime and Delinquency, another liberal crime group.  Young remains TSP's Executive Director.  Assistant  
Director Marc Mauer is its chief spokesman and he writes many TSP reports.  <p>  
  Although most people would consider TSP's notions of justice to be marginal and even kooky, the group  
is not without influence in the criminal law arena, where liberal judges, criminal defense attorneys, and law  
professors continue to take these ideas seriously.  TSP in 1992 increased its visibility by establishing a  
professional association, the National Association of Sentencing Advocates.  TSP also runs the Campaign  
for an Effective Crime Policy, a coalition of "criminal justice professionals" working against  
"demagoguery on crime."  <p>
   Public faith in the criminal justice system has been strained for some time.  Doubts about the system's  
fairness have fueled citizen disgust with political leaders who seem more concerned about the procedural  <p>
rights of criminals than with the suffering of their victims.  How can public confidence be restored when  
tax money is used to finance the advocates of the very policies which provoke the mistrust?  Is it any  
wonder the public is angry?   <p>
  
<a name="race"><b>Race and Imprisonment: What's the Connection?</b></a>  <p>
  The Sentencing Project is best known for its much-publicized work on the nexis between race and  
incarceration.  In 1995, the group released a study which showed one in every three black men between the  
ages of 20 to 29 was under the supervision of the criminal justice system:  either in jail or prison, or on  
parole or probation.  Entitled Young Black Americans and the Criminal Justice System, the study was  
reported in virtually every major media outlet, including the New York Times, Washington Post, Los  
Angeles Times, CNN, and National Public Radio.  Jesse Jackson invoked it during his speech at the  
"Million Man March" in Washington.    <p>
  One major finding of the report is that the war on drugs has a disproportionate impact on minorities.  It  
concludes that the effort by law enforcement authorities to stamp out illegal drugs and various proposals to  
get tough on crime are contributing to a "growing racial disparity in the criminal justice system."  Indeed, it  
claims that the war on drugs has been an "unmitigated disaster" for young blacks.  <p>
  TSP blames the increase in the number of blacks in the criminal justice system on what it sees as a  
lopsided emphasis on convictions relating to crack cocaine.  It attributes this to "police practices that target  
inner-city communities for intensive drug enforcement. . . ."  <p>
  TSP's illogical evasion of responsibility is evident when it blames not drugs but the war on drugs for the  
destruction of a generation of young black males.  Crack cocaine is destructive.  The evidence shows that  
violence is associated with crack cocaine far more than with the powder variety.  As social policy expert  
Douglas Besharov of the American Enterprise Institute has observed:  "The evidence is quite clear . . .  
Crack is a more addictive, violence-creating drug than is powder cocaine.  Period."  <p>
  Underlying TSP's report is the belief that many of those convicted and sent to prison are low-level drug  
offenders who do not pose a threat to society.  However, as Princeton Professor and crime expert John  
DiIulio noted recently in the Washington Post, "virtually all drug offenders behind bars are in for drug  
trafficking, not mere possession" _ and most "have long criminal records."  Says DiIulio, "anyone who  
thinks U.S. attorneys or big-city cops focus their enforcement energies against petty drug criminals must be  
either statistically illiterate or smoking something."  <p>
  The black community has indeed suffered from the scourge of crack cocaine.  But this argues for greater  
vigilance in stamping out its sale and use.  Black families will suffer most from any slackening of law  
enforcement.  While TSP argues that the war on drugs serves to "exacerbate" racial "inequities," its  
solution is to go easy on the drug criminals who devastate inner-city communities.    <p>
  TSP Assistant Director Marc Mauer proposes a "renewed dialogue on drug policy."  He notes obliquely  
that the disciplining of former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders "for advocating a discussion of drug  
policy" indicated a lack of "serious discussion" about substance abuse.  Elders was talking about legalizing  
drugs, and Mauer's euphemistic call for "dialogue" is nothing more than an excuse for starting down the  
road toward drug legalization.    <p>
  TSP's policy research has usefully documented how drug crimes have led to the imprisonment of all too  
many young black men.  But it is tragic for the black community that this research should result in such  
misguided policy recommendations.  These proposals should make the public wary of "policy experts" who  
claim to know the significance of their own findings.  
  <p>
<a name="crime"><b>To Let the Punishment Fit the Crime </b> </a><p>
  TSP's ideas about race and the criminal justice system follow from the group's premise that incarceration  
just doesn't work and that it's simply not an enlightened way to deal with persons convicted of crimes.  The  
group opposes mandatory minimum sentences and "three-strikes-and-you're-out" proposals that require life  
sentences for three-time violent offenders.  TSP says the latter are "harsh" and "divert public attention from  
a full discussion of the causes of violent crime."  Likewise, it opposes truth in sentencing measures that  
restrict parole, and it is hostile to just about anything that increases the penalty for committing a crime. <p> 
  TSP dismisses attempts to introduce greater accountability in criminal law and certainty in sentencing as  
unsophisticated responses to the public's alarm over crime.  It also denigrates them as a way for politicians  
to exploit middle class hysteria.  In 1994, Mauer told the press, "Part of what is driving this [effort to crack  
down on crime] is politicians' simplistic approach to dealing with crime and part is suburban America's  
fears."  <p>  
  Testifying before Congress in 1994, Mauer said that incarceration "has a limited impact on crime" and  
there is no "clear relationship between crime and incarceration."  But if keeping criminals out of prison  
does not increase crime rates one might as well believe that keeping Congress in session will not lead to  
more laws.<p>    
  The Council on Crime in America, a project of the New Citizenship Project, has demonstrated the relation  
of crime and punishment in a recently published study entitled The State of Violent Crime in America.  It  
takes note of the "obvious reality that prisons restrain convicted criminals from committing large numbers  
of crimes that they would be committing if free."  In other words, much serious crime is averted each year  
by keeping convicted criminals behind bars.  The report cites a number of empirical studies which estimate  
that for each additional incarcerated felon, anywhere from 12 to 17 additional crimes will not be committed  
each year.  <p>   
  Moreover, by applying 1973 crime rates to the 1989 population, the report estimates that there were  
60,000 fewer rapes, 323,000 fewer robberies, and 380,000 fewer assaults in 1989.  In other words, contrary  
to the assertions of TSP, increasing the prison population in the 1980s significantly reduced violent crime  
below what it would have otherwise been.  (This is not to suggest that one should take heart about the  
current crime situation; only that it could have been much worse.) <p> 
  This is common sense to most people, but not to TSP, which insists that increasing the number of prisons  
and prisoners has had no effect.  As the Council report observed, "It apparently takes a Ph.D. in  
criminology to doubt that if we released half of all prisoners tonight, we would experience more crime  
tomorrow."<p>  
  Another recent study, this one conducted by the Dallas-based National Center for Policy Analysis,  
bolsters these conclusions.  Focusing on crime in Texas, the report demonstrates how a more aggressive  
incarceration policy has lead to a dramatic reduction in the state's crime rate.  According to the study, the  
overall rate of serious crime in Texas has been cut by 35 percent and is at its lowest level since 1973.  This  
follows a four-year building boom, which has raised prison capacity from 49,000 to 150,000, with the  
state's prison population increasing to 64 percent above the national average.  The data is also interesting in  
that it refutes TSP's mantra that longer sentences do not deter crime:  In Texas, the average time served for  
serious crimes climbed from 1.9 years to 3 years.  <p>
  While TSP argues that prison is a failure, the evidence from the states paints a different picture.  Yet to  
the true believer facts are irrelevant; and TSP remains undaunted.  Not only does it reject the proposition  
that putting criminals in prison reduces crime, it also contends that increasing the number of police will not  
bring the crime rate down.  "There is little relationship between the number of police per capita and crime  
rates," Mauer wrote in a 1994 USA Today op-ed.   
  <p>
<a name="answ"><b>Bad Answers to Foolish Questions</b></a><p>	  
TSP is preoccupied with explaining the "causes" of crime.   
Predictably, it blames the failures on society.  This familiar refrain condemns "abuse and neglect" for crime  
and censures "attitudes toward women" and "the ready availability of firearms in this country" for violence.   
In Mauer's view, "incarceration speaks very little to poor schooling, dysfunctional families, or limited job  
skills."  <p>
  What then is the answer?  More government spending.  TSP wants to spend tax dollars not on stopping  
crimes or catching criminals, but on social programs for more treatment and counseling, for education and  
recreation.  Mauer testified that "programs such as Head Start and Job Corps are cost effective in reducing  
long-term crime control costs."  Washington liberals conclude that every ill plaguing society can be cured  
by a government program; crime is no exception.    <p>
  Mauer actually has gone so far as to suggest that Hillary Clinton's health care task force should serve as a  
"model" for how the country should approach crime policy.  He noted approvingly that President Clinton  
"assembled a team of hundreds of experts to dissect and analyze every aspect of the health care system. . .  
."  And he wondered why there has been no parallel effort with respect to crime.  (Hint:  Hillary's task force  
was a failure!)  TSP sees this as part of a "more rational and humane" approach to crime.  Given the voters'  
revulsion at Mrs. Clinton's health care machinations, what could be more cruel?  <p>
  Former U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese, a Capital Research Center trustee, says TSP operates in a  
"fantasy world."  "Of course crime reflects deeper societal problems," adds Meese, "but that doesn't answer  
the question of what to do about the criminals on the streets right now.  How do we keep known criminals  
from committing more crimes?"  The answer is to "put them where they can no longer harm others _ in  
prison."  <p>
  
<a name="edna"><b>Sources of Funding:  The Edna McConnell Clark Foundation</b></a>  <p>
  TSP reflects the world-view of its benefactor, the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation, a prime patron of  
left-wing causes from the ACLU to the Children's Defense Fund.  With assets of $500 million, the Clark  
Foundation is one of America's largest foundations.  Mrs. Clark's father was the founder of Avon Products,  
and her husband, with whom she established the Foundation in 1950, was chairman of the board of the  
cosmetics business.  The Foundation is unrelated to the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation (see April  
Foundation Watch).   <p>
  Like TSP, the Foundation wants to "move the corrections system away from an overreliance on jails and  
prisons."  Its annual report repeats the buzz phrases of anti-incarceration advocates:  "community-based  
punishments"; "inadequate investment"; "intermediate punishments"; "unnecessary incarceration";  
"nonviolent offenders"; and "alternatives."    <p>
  In 1994 TSP received three grants from the Clark Foundation totaling $195,271.  The year before the  
Foundation awarded TSP two grants totaling $334,000.  Besides providing financial backing to TSP, the  
Clark Foundation's Program for Justice also supports the Families Against Mandatory Minimums  
Foundation, which opposes laws setting minimum sentences for various crimes.  It also funds the American  
Civil Liberties Union's National Prison Project, awarding it $825,000 in 1994.  The National Prison Project  
is a prisoners' "rights" organization that litigates on behalf of incarcerated criminals.  <p> 
  This is elitism at its worst.  The folks at TSP and the Clark Foundation can win kudos from academics by  
theorizing about alternatives to prison.  But the urban poor who must suffer the consequences of crime as  
well as the consequences of naive crime policies have no such luxury.  They are not interested in  
speculating about root causes.  Instead, they want to see criminals swept from the streets.    
<p><a name="fund"><b>Federal Government Funding</b></a>  <p>
  TSP's private foundation funding is augmented by the federal government.  The Justice Department's  
support will enable TSP to "publish a guide for the establishment and operation of defense-based  
alternative sentencing programs."  (According to the most recent information available through FAADS,  
the federal grants database, the Justice Department awarded TSP $125,000 in the last quarter of 1993.)<p>  
  Last year, Congress failed to deal with the problem of government funding of nonprofit advocacy groups.   
Reps. Ernest Istook (R-OK), David McIntosh (R-IN) and Robert Ehrlich (R-MD) were unable to convince  
their colleagues that federal grants should not be given to nonprofit groups engaged in political advocacy.   
But TSP illustrates why action on this front is needed now more than ever.  You wouldn't know it by  
visiting its offices, but TSP is one of the most influential players in the ongoing debate about crime.   
Regrettably, it is the kind of influence we could do without.  <p>
  Media and political elites bemoan what they characterize as public cynicism toward government  
institutions.  They should not be so perplexed.  What else can one expect when citizens discover that their  
tax dollars are squandered so foolishly?  The public demands protection from crime, yet finds its money  
spent on those whose solution is keep criminals out of jail.

<P>
The scheme to impose a government-controlled health
care system on the American public was not buried by the 1994
elections.  It's not even dead.  Advocates of Hillary-style health
care, stung by defeat in 1993, have reformulated their strategy,
changed their terminology, and shifted their venue.  Instead of
a frontal assault on the private provision of health care, they
are now sneaking their statist health agenda through the statehouse
and schoolhouse door.</FONT>
<P>
  Health care reform has been reincarnated as welfare
and education reform.  With financial support from major private
philanthropies like the Robert Wood Johnson, Henry J. Kaiser Family,
Annie E. Casey, and Rockefeller foundations, and the Pew Charitable
Trusts, proponents of national health care have reorganized and
repackaged their ideas into a number of state-based programs.
Instead of universal health care mandates on an entire population,
they propose a new framework of public-private education and welfare
partnerships.  And since these are touted as serving the &quot;needs&quot;
of children, lawmakers find them much harder to oppose.</FONT>
<P>
* * * * *</FONT>
<P>
  The Pennsylvania General Assembly's House of Representatives
recently passed a resolution, introduced with bipartisan support,
which authorized its Education Committee to investigate how the
state's public school system was being used to provide health
programs for students and their families.  Hearings were held
last year, and many legislators were shocked to discover that
in several districts school-based health clinics were already
providing extensive health services.  These clinics were established
and funded to provide a battery of services without the knowledge
or consent of the Pennsylvania General Assembly.</FONT>
<P>
  The Pennsylvania state legislature is learning
what other state legislators are learning:  that its constitutional
authority has been ignored and its prerogatives undercut by officials
in the Clinton Administration and the National Governors' Association
who are working with bureaucrats in state departments of education,
health, and public welfare, and with officials from private philanthropic
foundations, including the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the
Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, the Pew Charitable Trusts,
the Kellogg Foundation, and the Annie E. Casey Foundation.  (For
more information on the Casey Foundation, which is headed by United
Parcel Service Chairman Kent C. Nelson, see the December 1995
issue of Organization Trends.)</FONT>
<P>
  Legislatures are also discovering that programs
and proposals that claim to be intended for America's children
actually represent the spearhead of a renewed assault on private
health care.  Hundreds of boxes of documents labeled &quot;confidential&quot;
assembled by the once secret and largely still mysterious Clinton
Health Care Task Force in 1993, which are as yet uncatalogued,
but in the custody of the National Archives in College Park, Maryland,
disclose the Administration's thinking.  They contain extensive
references to child health programs as a fallback position in
case the Administration failed to secure a comprehensive and universal
national health system.  As a matter of public policy and political
strategy, the Clintonites consciously had decided to use children
to phase-in health programs ultimately intended for all Americans.</FONT>
<P>
  The documents suggest that the Clinton Administration
looked  carefully at Goals 2000, an education initiative begun
during the Bush Administration, and Medicaid, the government health
program for the poor jointly funded under complicated formulas
by the states and the federal government.  These programs would
be the vehicles to integrate and coordinate publicly-funded health
and human service programs.  </FONT>
<P>
  They would use school districts as delivery sites
for providing greatly expanded health services.  And they would
be responsive to signals from private philanthropic foundations
that would provide start-up funds that, when combined with subsequent
tax dollars, could draw almost every American citizen into a web
of new government health programs. <BR>
<BR>

<a name="Children"</a>
<h3>The Children's Initiative:  It Takes A Child To Disguise
A Policy</h3>

  The Clinton Administration has elevated into an
art form the use of children as tools of social policy.  By devising
new social programs so that children are the first beneficiaries
of government entitlements, Administration policymakers get the
public to acquiesce to programs that have far more ambitious goals.
Hillary Rodham Clinton's new book on children, It Takes A Village,
is meant to be a cozy literary paraphrase of Administration policies.</FONT>
<P>
  In 1988, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Robert
Wood Johnson Foundation, and the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation
provided grant monies that enabled the National Governors' Association
(NGA) to produce a manual for Goals 2000, a series of vague pledges
by the states to set more rigorous standards for public education.
One year later, the Bush administration and the NGA, chaired
by then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, held an &quot;Education
Summit&quot; that further developed but did not clarify the goal
of national education standards.  </FONT>
<P>
  In 1994, while the Clintons' health reform proposals
were flailing, Goals 2000 became law.  Now a national mantra,
Goals 2000 is invoked by many in the education establishment to
justify the latest fads flowing through academia, e.g., outcomes-based
education.  Less noted is how it has been used as a cover to authorize
programs in health care.</FONT>
<P>
  Federal and state agencies and private nonprofit
organizations are currently seeking public and private funds for
the &quot;The Children's Initiative,&quot; which appears to be
a name assigned by the Philadelphia-based Pew Charitable Trusts
to describe the collaborative efforts of private foundations working
with government to develop, coordinate and support a panopoly
of health service programs in the nation's public school systems
_ a plan almost Byzantine in its complexity.  Particularly in
treating problems of student behavior, these programs have begun
raising eyebrows.</FONT>
<P>
  Under this initiative, Goals 2000 is creating a
system in which children selected by teachers are regularly tested
for emotional, social, mental, and physical disorders in clinics
established within public schools.  These disorders include what
is called Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) or Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).  Once children are diagnosed and
labelled as subject to this condition according to a scale of
supposed &quot;norms&quot; of mental and emotional health, school
health officials have the authority to treat them by prescribing
and administering such medications as Ritalin, Valium, Lorazepam
and Prozac.  These officials derive their authority from new,
looser prescription-writing standards developed under Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation initiatives to liberalize state restrictions
on who can prescribe medications, thus allowing nurse practitioners
and physician assistants to prescribe drugs.  The consent of parents
is sometimes required, and sometimes not.  </FONT>
<P>
  Goals 2000 proposals receive funding from federal
programs, including Medicaid and Maternal and Child Health (Title
X) block grants, comparable state programs, and philanthropic
foundations.  Some school districts and state legislatures have
resisted Goals 2000.  And at least four states, including Virginia,
have refused to apply for federal funds to implement it.  But
many Governors, unable to resist the lure of the hard coin, are
using Executive Orders to implement state programs to meet Goals
2000.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<hr>
<a name="Quiz"></a>
<h3>The School Quiz: It's Different</h3>

  How did the problem of student misbehavior in school
become a national health issue?  In 1991, the U.S. Department
of Education formally recognized ADHD as a handicap under the
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and Section 504 of
the 1973 Rehabilitation Act.  The Department directed all state
education officers to ensure that local school districts established
procedures to screen and identify ADHD children and provide them
with special educational and psychological services.  Naturally,
&quot;school-wide&quot; interventions are favored by the Department.
Programs are now being developed for all children in public schools
and their parents.  </FONT>
<P>
  The parents of elementary school children in Gateway
School District in Pennsylvania recently came face to face with
the implications of all this.  Two projects named &quot;Pharmacological
and Psychosocial Treatment for ADHD&quot; and &quot;Community-Based
Treatment for ADHD: Summer Treatment Programs and School-Wide
Interventions&quot; were funded by a private foundation grant
to the University of Pittsburgh and the Gateway School District
in Pennsylvania.  The Pittsburgh-based foundation will not allow
its name to be disclosed.  The federal National Institutes of
Mental Health provided matching public grant monies, in amounts
as yet to be disclosed.   </FONT>
<P>
  One portion of the project is called the Pittsburgh
School Wide Intervention Model (PSWIM).  The Principal of Pitcairn
Elementary School, Alex J. Balla, described PSWIM in a letter
to parents:  &quot;Many parts of the PSWIM program are designed
to help children get along better with one another.  One part
uses a procedure called sociometrics, in which children are asked
to answer questions about the kids in their class.  Each child
... will be asked about who their best friends are, who they do
not want to be friends with, and to rate how much they like the
other kids in the class ... All information is kept confidential
and children will be told that it is very important that they
do not discuss their answers with the other kids.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
  The PSWIM program produces daily &quot;behavior&quot;
report cards and a &quot;behavior&quot; Honor Roll.  &quot;Positive&quot;
report cards go to students who do their homework, return homework
assignment sheets signed by a parent and &quot;break two or fewer
rules during the day.&quot;  There are only six rules, and all
are benign (e.g. be respectful of others; stay in assigned seat;
work quietly; and obey adults).  </FONT>
<P>
  The Behavior Honor Roll seems merely to codify
the tradition of &quot;teacher's pet.&quot;  Honor Roll kids ages
5 to 8 &quot;earn special class jobs and/or privileges,&quot;
and wear special badges.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  However,
PSWIM also requires each teacher to fill out an eight page &quot;Teacher
Rating Scale&quot; questionnaire for each five to eight year old
and check the applicable descriptions:</FONT>
<P>

<ul>
<li> has run away from home overnight at least twice
while living in a parental or parental surrogate home.
<P>
<li> often initiates physical fights with other members of his or her household.
<p>
<li> has forced someone into sexual activity.
<P>
<li> often stays out at night despite parental prohibitions.
<P>
<li> has stolen while confronting a victim (e.g. mugging,
purse snatching, extortion, armed robbery).
<P>
<li> teases or calls other children names.
<P>
<li> is disliked by other children.
<P>
<li> is simply ignored by other children.
</font>
<P>
<font size=2 > For five to eight year olds?  Reading the list,
one is struck by the gross disparity in behaviors.  The descriptions
range from normal childhood pranks and grievances to criminality.
Where would teachers have access to such information?</font>  
<P>
<font size =2>  The answer is that comprehensive health and education
data on all the children who participate in PSWIM is contained
in records at the Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic at
the University of Pittsburgh.  Under the professional services
agreement between the University and Gateway School District,
PSWIM was implemented by an individual with a Masters degree in
education who was supervised by an individual with a Ph.D. _ not
an M.D. _ at Western Psychiatric Institute.  The individual with
the Masters degree interviewed the children in order to gather
the data.</FONT>
<P>
  Alarmed parents from PSWIM area elementary schools
protested the program, its taxpayer funding, and the use of undisclosed
private grant money.  Concerned parents met with baffled legislators
and recalcitrant state education officials, and made appearances
on local media.  They demanded that the program be ended.  It
was terminated on November 21, 1995.<BR>

<h3>Education Policy: <br>
Surrogate for Health Care</h3>

  Though it failed to pass health care reform in
1993, Congress in 1994 passed three major pieces of education
reform legislation sought by the Clinton Administration:</font> <p> 
<B>Goals 2000:</b><p>

<ol>
<li>Educate America Act;<p> 
<li> School-to-Work Opportunities Act;<p>
<li> The Improving America's Schools Act of 1994, which reauthorized
the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA).<p>
</ol></font>
<P>
  The way the Clinton Administration has implemented
these laws reveals that its health reform agenda did not fail
_ it only failed to pass the Congress.  Education reform has become
a road to health reform.  State agencies and private foundations
are the Administration's willing accomplices in skirting the legislative
process to change health policy.</FONT>
<P>
  Thirteen states now participate in the U.S. Department
of Education's Integrated Services Project, &quot;Creating Schools
That Work for Everyone&quot; (CSTWE).  CSTWE was created by the
Department of Education in 1994.  It aims to integrate within
the public school system many health and human services provided
by government.  This includes services from Medicaid programs,
Aid to Families with Dependent Children, Maternal and Child Health
block grants, and services created by new monies available to
school systems under the three new education acts: Goals 2000,
the School-to-Work law, and the reauthorization of ESEA.  The
thirteen states currently participating in CSTWE are California,
Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi,
New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Texas.</FONT>
<P>
  CSTWE project consultants have been hired by the
U.S. Department of Education.  They include several Washington,
DC-based 501(c)(3) organizations:  The Institute for Health Services
Management, the National Alliance for Restructuring Education
(NARE), the New American Schools Development Corporation (NASDC),
and the National School Health Education Coalition.  NARE and
NASDC are also working with the states of Arkansas, Kentucky,
New York, Vermont, and Washington, city governments in Rochester
(NY), White Plains (NY), and San Diego, and the Farrell Area School
District of Pittsburgh.  NARE claims that its state and city work
accounts for twelve percent of the nation's schoolchildren.  These
consultants are now embroiled in the New York State Attorney General's
investigation of the National Center for Education and the Economy
and its ties to prominent political figures, including Hillary
Clinton, North Carolina Governor James Hunt, former New York Governor
Mario Cuomo, and health care czar Ira Magaziner.  In part, the
investigation concerns payments made to Mrs. Clinton by the Rochester-based
Center.</FONT>
<P>

<h3>Kentucky's Brave New World</h3>

  While it is too early to say exactly what CSTWE
will accomplish, information uncovered through open records requests
in Kentucky give some indication of what its proponents seek.</FONT>
<P>
  For instance, Wade Mountz, Chairman of the Kentucky
Commission on Families and Children (set up by Governor Brereton
Jones to help implement the controversial Kentucky Education Reform
Act), has defined his Commission's goal as the &quot;provision
of a wide range of education, health, mental health, and social
services that are delivered in a coordinated and comprehensive
way to families and their children.&quot;  The Commission has
focussed its work on school districts in Louisville and Owensboro.
In seeking a grant from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, one which
required a matching grant of taxpayer dollars, Mountz wrote a
March 30, 1995 grant application to Casey's Associate Director
Anthony Cippollone.  After discussing the need to coordinate health
and human services in the school system, Mountz explained why
Kentucky was the right state for an investment of Casey Foundation
money:</FONT>
<P>
  &quot;We will have a change in administration in
December 1995.  The Commissions' [sic] job is to produce selected
local communities whose plans are so attractive that the new administration
and the legislature will be compelled to cooperate with the approach&quot;
(emphasis added).</FONT>
<P>
  What sorts of plans are envisioned?  The Kentucky
Legislative Research Commission in 1992 hired a consulting firm,
Leadership Development Associates, to assist the Kentucky Task
Force on Education Reform.  It proposed six alternative models
for local governments and school districts to govern the web of
human service programs envisioned by the Kentucky legislature:
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>

<ol>
<li> Total Educational Governance System for Lifetime Learning
<P>
<li> Reconstituting Local Government for Education and Well-Being;
<P>
<li>Educational Development Territories;
<P>
<li> Large Regional Operating Districts;
<P>
<li> Fine-Tuning the Present System; and
<P>
<li> The Unitary District Plan.<br>
</font>
<p>
<br>
</ol>
  The consultants, in the syntax expected of their
sort, explained that Model One's lifetime learning approach &quot;is
a much larger expectation for each citizen.&quot;  It suggested:
&quot;a reconsideration of the compulsory education requirements
pushing taxpayer responsibility both downward and upward through
the age ranges.  Obviously lifetime learning has tremendous implications
for educational finance moving away from traditional concepts
of funding toward new ideas such as individual entitlements to
be expended throughout the lifetime.  Each citizen would have
a lifetime learning account to draw on as needed.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
  Model Two, &quot;Reconstituting Government for
Education and Well-Being,&quot; strikes a tone reminiscent of
Brave New World:  The consultants imagine local-level &quot;Chancellors
of Well-Being&quot; who would govern as elected officials.  Leadership
Development Associates explained, &quot;Well-being does not have
the same political connotation as welfare often does.&quot;  The
Chancellors would be charged with protecting and enhancing community
well-being.  As the consultants explained:</FONT>
<P>
  &quot;Although the nation's commitment to general
well-being is anchored in the Constitution, we have treated it
casually, almost with indifference.  We have created units of
local government, such as school districts, and charged them with
part of the responsibility for well-being, but not the whole of
it.  Schooling may well be the flagship of a flotilla of approaches
to well-being but it is not the all of it.  Schooling must be
joined more fundamentally by other contributors of well-being
....&quot;</FONT>
<P>
  The proposal recommends that the Kentucky General
Assembly appoint a permanent &quot;Joint Well-Being Oversight
Committee,&quot; and replace the existing State Board of Elementary
and Secondary Education with a new fifteen member &quot;State
Board of Well-Being.&quot;  The State Board of Well-Being would
be led by the &quot;State Chancellor of Well-Being,&quot; which
runs the &quot;Division of Well-Being Services&quot; _ &quot;a
range of well-being oriented programs and services, including
many of those that traditionally have been offered through the
department of education.&quot;<BR>

<a name="Medicaid"></a>
<h3>The Medicaid Program in Pennsylvania:  Out of Control</h3>

  Officials in the Clinton Administration's Department
of Health and Human Services, including Heath Care Financing Adminstration
chief Bruce C. Vladeck (a former Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation
trustee and former vice president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation),
have indicated plans to expand Medicaid eligibility to 40 million
Americans.  By granting &quot;waivers&quot; from Medicaid's eligibility
restrictions, the Administration has nearly achieved that goal.
More than half the states currently operate their programs under
such waivers, which expand the definitions of the word &quot;provider.&quot;
Even school districts can now be considered &quot;Medicaid providers&quot;
and they can bill state and federal Medicaid authorities to be
reimbursed for services they provide.  </FONT>
<P>
  School-based health service programs take advantage
of Medicaid by drawing on its &quot;Early Intervention Services&quot;
program which offers a benefit known as &quot;Early Periodic Screening,
Diagnosis, and Treatment&quot; (EPSDT).  EPSDT provides vision,
hearing, and dental testing.  It also provides &quot;other necessary
health care, diagnostic services, treatment, and other measures
. . . to correct or ameliorate defects and physical and mental
illnesses and conditions discovered by the screening services
. . . whether or not such services are covered under the state
plan.&quot;  The 1989 Budget Reconciliation Act required the states
to make the EPSDT benefit available to all eligible Medicaid recipients
age 21 and under, even where a state's Medicaid plan does not
provide state funding for reimbursement.  In such cases, the federal
government must cover EPSDT payments.  </FONT>
<P>
  The law further provides that the state must take
&quot;effective&quot; steps to inform all those eligible for EPSDT
of its availability.  Moreover, a D.C. federal court has held
that the statute is sufficiently specific to create &quot;an enforceable
right of action&quot; under the 1964 Civil Rights Act.  </FONT>
<P>
  EPSDT is out of control.  In Pennsylvania, the
legislators did not know how it was affecting school decisionmaking
until they began to hear from parents.  That state's Goals 2000
plan specifically identifies school-based clinics as essential
to achieve its first Goal, &quot;Readiness for School.&quot; 
And an October 5, 1994 memorandum from the Pennsylvania Commissioner
for Elementary and Secondary Education, Joseph F. Bard, to Pennsylvania
School Administrators and Intermediate Unit Executive Directors,
describes how school officials will achieve the goal:  &quot;The
Department has initiated...a program which will allow [school
districts, intermediate units, and approved private schools]...to
obtain federal reimbursement for administrative costs incurred
in providing health related services to medical assistance eligible
students.</FONT>
<P>
  &quot;The use of these funds to supplement the
district's health program will not only provide additional need
health services to the district's student population, but will
increase the district's expenditures for health care services
and thus increase further drawdown of administrative funds under
Title XIX.&quot; </FONT>
<P>
  Pennsylvania's Department of Public Welfare has
applied to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to
amend the state's Medicaid plan to expand Early Intervention Services
so that schools can request reimbursement beyond the minimum vision,
hearing, and dental tests.  In a June 29, 1995 letter to HHS,
Deputy Secretary Nancy R. Thaler created a virtual &quot;wish
list&quot; of ten program services she would like to offer: social
work, audiology, nursing services, occupational therapy, physical
therapy, psychological services, speech pathology, initial &quot;early
intervention&quot; screening, special instruction, and service
coordination.  Under this proposal, school districts could bill
Medicaid for up to 20 units of service activity per year at $20.00
per unit for each program service it offered.  In other words,
Medicaid might be required to reimburse every school district
up to $4,000 annually per child eligible for the full list of
services.  </FONT>
<P>
  Currently six school districts _ Farrell, Towanda,
Allentown, Philadelphia, Lancaster, and Central Fulton _ operate
school-based health clinics under a Medicaid waiver.  Pennsylvania
still awaits approval of its wish list, but these districts currently
provide the following EPSDT services:  mental health/counseling,
health education, physical examinations/screening, anticipatory
health guidance, referral/tracking of health problems, and dental
services.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>

<h3>Robert Wood Johnson Foundation: &quot;Leveraging&quot;
Government Funding</h3>

  The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) began
its Mental Health Services for Youth Program in 1989, the same
year Congress authorized federal payment for EPSDT services. 
RWJF grants from this program to state agencies in Pennsylvania
and Kentucky are responsible for creating the procedures that
enable school districts to apply for and receive federal Medicaid
reimbursement for mental health services.</FONT>
<P>
  In 1989, the Johnson Foundation reached the one
billion dollar mark in grants distributed, a goal that took seventeen
years to achieve.  In 1995, just six years later, the Princeton,
New Jersey-based philanthropy awarded its two billionth grant
dollar. The Foundation has said, &quot;The work accomplished,
more than the money awarded, is the true measure of RWJF's achievements.&quot;
That claim bears examination.  The Foundation proudly extolls
the practice of &quot;leveraging public funds.&quot;  Not content
to wait for public agencies to pick up the costs of programs it
has started, the Foundation often requires co-funding committments
from government before it initiates new programs.   </FONT>
<P>
  For instance, RWJF awarded the state of Kentucky
a $100,000 planning grant from the Mental Health Services for
Youth Program.  Kentucky subsequently received Phase I and Phase
II Implementation grants of more than $2,400,000.  The Foundation
has stated, &quot;The major objective . . . is to improve mental
health services for seriously mentally ill children and youth
by developing comprehensive services systems under the aegis of
multi-agency, state-community partnerships that can make major
changes in financing, organization, and delivery of services.&quot;
 </FONT>
<P>
  Clearly, affecting state government policy is central
to RWJF's grantmaking.  The Foundation has indicated that it will
give priority to projects that demonstrate &quot;evidence of collaboration
of multiple agencies at both the state and community levels, including
agreements with institutional care providers to assure appropriate
movement among levels of care,&quot; and &quot;a high likelihood
that the project will continue following the conclusion of Foundation
support and that lasting changes will be made in the state's mental
health services delivery and financing systems.&quot; </FONT>
<P>
  Foundation documents are even more specific.  For
Kentucky, they reveal that &quot;every grant dollar is expected
to leverage five dollars in public monies.&quot;  By carefully
using its grant dollars to promote interagency agreements on mental
health for youth, RWJF is well on its way to achieving comprehensive
health reform in this area in Kentucky.</FONT>
<P>
  How does RWJF secure the cooperation of state officials?
Kentucky's participation was secured after North Carolina Governor
James Hunt, chairman of RWJF's national advisory board for its
Mental Health Services for Youth program, wrote Kentucky's then-Governor
Wallace Wilkinson and invited him to apply for a Foundation grant.
A grateful Wilkinson responded, &quot;The goals of the Robert
Wood Johnson Foundation Initiative are very much within the mission
of the CYSB [Kentucky Children's and Youth Services Bureau].&quot;
 </FONT>
<P>
  The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has used the
power of its private money to rearrange one state's public finances.
It has not been shy about what it expects from Kentucky state
lawmakers.  In Kentucky's proposal for grant funds _ which funds
it received _ the state Secretary for the Cabinet for Human Resources
promised:  &quot;We will be seeking major legislation that sets
in statute for the whole state the system of care for children
and youth with severe emotional problems.  Legitimating this effort
in statute will assure that changing administrations and their
shifting priorities will not hinder the system of care effort.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
  In 1990, the Kentucky Legislature passed a bare-bones
statute that was intended to apply to 54 identified children who
had severe mental health problems.  Yet RWJF grants of more than
$2.4 million plus state and federal funding in excess of $10 million
have had their effect.  Because almost any child can be examined
under the EPSDT benefit for &quot;mental health&quot; problems
in Kentucky, local school districts and state agencies can now
tap into both federal and state Medicaid funds.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<hr>
<a name="Final"></a>
<h3>Final Considerations</h3>
<P>
  It is time for Congress and state legislatures
to re-examine how children have become pawns in political struggles
over power and money.  They must also exercise rigorous legislative
oversight of state applications for federal Medicaid &quot;waivers.&quot;
Lawmakers need to examine whether it is appropriate for private
foundations to distribute grants to government agencies.  And
Congress should consider enlarging the federal Anti-Deficiency
Act, which prohibits the use of private monies to create and pay
for new staff positions at public agencies _ thereby creating
a deficiency since the taxpayers are eventually expected to foot
the bill.  Finally, a vigilant citizenry and press need to apply
more scrutiny to foundations, demanding greater accountability
than currently exists.<BR>

<h2>The Transportation Lobby: The Politics of Highway and Transit</h2>
<P>
<I><B>Social Engineers Compete with Special Interests in Drive
for Highway Dollars<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
by Peter Samuel
<P>
As anyone who drives to work knows, America's transportation policy
is in gridlock. Long steered by local interests, it is now hobbled
by the additional pestilence of an anti-growth ideology hostile
to roads and cars. As usual, taxpayers are the losers. New technologies
and privatization show promising potential. But transportation
lobbies have joined forces with environmentalists to stall innovative
efforts to relieve the nation's congested highways.
<P>
The automobile is an intensely ideological object. For the political
right, it is a symbol of freedom, fun and individual self-expression.
For the political left, it epitomizes consumerist excess and is
responsible for suburban sprawl, white flight, urban blight, and
the decline of community spirit. In <I>End of the Road: From World
Car Crisis to Sustainable Transportation</I>, author Wolfgang
Zuckerman sums up the view from the Left, declaring cars &quot;an
unchecked menace . . . to our hapless planet.&quot; Most Americans,
however, acclaim and even romanticize modern technology's greatest
contribution to individual mobility. Little wonder, then, that
political ideologues who are troubled by this development want
to restrict the free range of automobiles and seek public transportation
alternatives that organize mobility to achieve larger social goals.
As in the areas of energy and the environment, transportation
has become a target for Washington-based advocacy groups eager
to shape public policy.
<P>
But political advocacy tactics are also used by those whose livelihood
depends on America's love of cars. The highway lobbies have little
ideology beyond &quot;more roads,&quot; but they too see tax funding
as the only way to support their concrete interests.
<P>
<B>Cars Need Roads</B>
<P>
During the third quarter of this century America's cities were
substantially reshaped by an extraordinary spasm of gas-tax financed
highway construction. From 1957 through much of the 1960s state
highway authorities built an average of 2,000 miles of freeway
each year, a third of it in urban areas, in what has been rightly
called the largest public works program in world history. Ninety
percent of interstate freeway funding came from the federal government.
The hectic pace of early interstate construction was driven by
single-minded highway engineer technocrats; neither prices, costs,
nor alternative agendas entered their mental world.
<P>
Highway proponents brushed aside their early and feeble adversaries
the gas stations, motels, and small businesses bypassed by the
new freeways. But then liberals began to agitate. They complained
that aid to education and slum clearance deserved priority over
new highways. Urban freeways were especially controversial because
they required structural demolition. Fearful of losing battles
to anti-highway groups, highway planners looked for ways to appease
potential opponents. They came to accept in principle government
&quot;comprehensive planning&quot; of transportation and urban
land use and learned to adapt to federal oversight.
<P>
In 1973 the Nixon administration supported legislation that for
the first time allowed federal highway funds to be used for mass
transit projects. Washington, D.C. led the nation away from city
freeways. Other cities like Boston, San Francisco, and New York
City quickly followed. The highway lobby, apparently assuming
that tax revenues were limitless, shortsightedly supported federal
subsidies for rail, subway and bus transit systems, arguing that
they would complement highways.
<P>
The result? A national transportation lobby was created in Washington,
D.C. Once dedicated simply to more federal pork-barrel spending,
its appetites are beginning to change. The transportation lobby
increasingly represents the concerns of the social planners and
activists who voice a new ideology hostile to growth and concerned
about &quot;limits&quot; and &quot;sustainability.&quot;
<P>
Yet at least some of the ambitions of the new planning elite are
being thwarted: witness the overturn of the national 55 mile-per-hour
speed limit. In addition, federal spending cutbacks have targetted
transit more than highways in the FY1996 budget. Besides financial
pressures, the conservative political revolution is reviving entrepreneurial
alternatives to the transportation &quot;public works&quot; pork-barrel
and technological innovations are undermining the bicycle-to-work
ideologues. One all-but-forgotten American tradition the private
toll road has been rediscovered.
<P>
<B>Hey, Big Spender</B> 
<P>
Over $900 billion is spent annually in the United States on surface
road and rail transportation. It is not surprising, then, that
transportation looms large in federal handouts, or that there
is a formidable transportation lobby in Washington, D.C. Transportation
lobbies ranked second in campaign contributions $23 million to
Congressional candidates in 1994, exceeded only by labor unions.
<P>
Transportation funding is the purest political &quot;pork&quot;
for any congressman's district. News reports regularly cite Senator
Robert Byrd (D-WV) for his ability to bring huge dollops of highway
funding to West Virginia through arcane parliamentary maneuvers.
Byrd's colleague Alfonse D'Amato (R-NY) is affectionately known
as &quot;Senator Pothole&quot; for the deftness with which he
delivers transportation bacon to his constituents. And in central
Pennsylvania, Route 220 is named &quot;Bud Shuster Highway&quot;
after the heroic efforts of Representative E.G. (Bud) Shuster
(R-PA) in securing funds for bringing an interstate-style freeway
spur 25 miles north from the state Turnpike to the town of Altoona
(population 51,000). Ann Eppard, a longtime administrative assistant
to Rep. Shuster was in the news recently for her success as a
lobbyist. Ms. Eppard has signed up Federal Express, Amtrak, American
Road and Transportation Builders Association and other prominent
members of the &quot;transportation lobby&quot; apparently on
the basis of her access to Rep. Shuster and her intimate knowledge
of how the Congress does transportation business. Conveniently,
Ms. Eppard retains her position as Rep. Shuster's Washington fundraiser,
according to the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>.
<P>
The largest portion of the nation's transportation account is
spent privately on automobiles and freight. But the huge amount
controlled by governments is caught up in politics, lobbying and
advocacy.
<P>
Government spends over $70 billion annually on roads. By contrast,
the nationwide operating expense for transit train, subway and
bus transportation is a smaller but not insignificant $18 billion.
Only a little more than a third of this amount is covered by commuter
fares. Nearly two-thirds comes from taxes. At least until the
1994 elections, government spending on public transit has been
considered politically correct, with transit spending preferred
to highway spending: i.e., cars are bad, rail is good. Federal
grants for transit construction and equipment purchases have been
rapidly expanding from $3.0 billion in 1990 to $4.6 billion in
fiscal 1995.
<P>
Do motorists pay their way? This question is at the center of
many arguments over government transportation policy. The American
Public Transit Association (APTA), the chief lobbyist for the
transit systems, argues that motorists gain some $345 billion
in benefits while paying $44 billion in taxes, a net $301 billion
public windfall. However, highway interests, organized by lobby
groups such as the Highway Users Federation and the American Automobile
Association, calculate that motorists are net losers by $38 billion
annually, paying motoring-related taxes of $114 billion for only
$76 billion in road services.
<P>
Whatever the correct calculations, transportation economists agree
that there are major inefficiencies and inequities in the highway
and vehicle financing system. Some trucks and rush-hour commuters
pay too little. Light trucks and non-rush-hour motorists pay too
much. This is hardly surprising. Concentrated benefits, diffused
costs is an axiom of politics. Factions with a large and concentrated
interest in policy matters will tend to prevail over members of
the general public, who individually have a relatively small interest
and no way to voice it.
<P>
<B>The Song of the Open Road</B> 
<P>
For an illustration of the transportation lobby, consider the
trucking industry. It is represented by the American Trucking
Associations (ATA), a nonprofit 501(c)(6) trade group that provides
representation at the federal level for a federation of fifty
state associations. ATA has a budget of $35 million, a staff of
300, and an array of spinoff subsidiaries:
<UL>
<LI>TruckPAC, its political action committee;
<LI>The ATA Litigation Center, a non-profit law firm;
<LI>The ATA Foundation, a 501 (c)(3) research and education unit;
<LI>Team 2000, a grassroots network;
<LI>Deliver USA, an educational and publicity outfit;
<LI>TransSat, a satellite-based trucking broadcasting and news
service;
<LI>and the ATA Federation, which brings other industry transportation
groups within its compass.
</UL>

<P>
ATA successfully lobbied last year for passage of the National
Highway System (NHS) bill, which makes nearly 170,000 miles of
road eligible for federal aid. ATA President Thomas J. Donohue
also demands protection of the Highway Trust Fund from diversion
to &quot;non-highway purposes such as Amtrak and mass transit
funding.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Diversion&quot; is the term that the highway lobbies use
when they fight battles for taxpayers' money. The Highway Trust
Fund, created by legislation in 1956, is the U.S. Treasury account
from which money is drawn for federal highway aid. Its most spectacular
accomplishment was the completion of the Interstate Highway System,
first mapped in 1947. Current efforts to defend the Fund from
raids by transit and Amtrak are not new.
<P>
But the Highway Trust Fund, like the Social Security Trust Fund,
is a fiction. A real trust fund has a dedicated set of objectives
and independent trustees who control it. The so-called Highway
Trust Fund is merely a Treasury account drawn on annually as Congress
sees fit through the appropriations process. Since the 1970s,
federal government highway funds have been used for transit projects,
a &quot;diversion&quot; of funds that was regularized in 1983
when a separate Mass Transit Account was established within the
Highway Trust Fund. In this way, taxpayers' monies are used not
for highway expansion and improvement, but to fulfill the social
engineer's dream of remaking America. The image of a small north
European country where commuters happily walk or peddle to the
local tram terminal for their morning ride to work comes to mind.
<P>
<B>Toll Roads: Pay-As-You-Go or Highway Robbery?</B> 
<P>
How inevitable is the battle of special interests over public
highway funds? One alternative may be private toll roads, which
recently have been rediscovered by policymakers. Toll roads can
alleviate traffic congestion, spur economic development, and answer
commuter complaints without resort to the massive expenditure
of public funds. Financially strapped practical politicians are
begining to vie to be seen at toll road ribbon-cutting ceremonies.
And federal and state legislation on private toll roads is not
as obstructive as it once was. Despite continued resistance from
highway departments and interest groups, attitudes toward toll
roads are changing in the 1990s.
<P>
There has been bipartisan political support for the investor-owned
Virginia Dulles Greenway and for California's State Route 91 Express
Lane, the world's first all-electronic toll facility, which has
no cash collection plaza. Opened on December 27, it is the first
toll facility to be based on congestion relief pricing: $2.50
toll in rush hour, 25 cents off-peak.
<P>
The California state government is negotiating with private interests
for two additional major toll roads that are likely to be built
in southern California before the end of the decade. Similar projects
are being considered in Richmond, Virginia; the Seattle-Tacoma
area; and in Michigan. Government-built toll roads have opened
in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Florida, California and Texas during
the 1990s.
<P>
State turnpikes with revenues of $5 billion annually are ripe
for privatization if free enterprise-inclined state governments
opt for reform. And private toll roads are being built internationally
in Canada, Britain, Spain, France, Italy, Hungary, Czechoslovakia,
Thailand, Taiwan, China and Australia.
<P>
The rediscovery of the toll road may be largely a product of the
budget crunch, but toll roads should encourage policymakers to
recognize that transportation policy does not have to centered
in Washington. In fact, initial construction of what now constitutes
the Interstate Highway System was primarily a series of state
undertakings that began in earnest without major federal aid.
California and other western states relied on state gasoline taxes.
Other states financed highway construction through tolls imposed
by state highway departments or state-established turnpike or
tollroad commissions. They borrowed construction money from the
capital markets on the security of the future stream of revenues
that tolls would generate.
<P>
But tollways have been unpopular. Highway toll charges are visible
and irksome when motorists have to wait in line to pay. Consequently,
there is a ready constituency for `freeing' highways: This has
occurred on Connecticut I-95 and its parkways, I-30 between Dallas
and Fort Worth, Route 36 between Denver and Boulder, and I-95
from Richmond to Petersburg. Moreover, tolls' visibility put them
at a disadvantage to the invisibility of the gas tax, which is
simply added to the price of gasoline at the pump, unlike most
other consumer goods. Toll roads have thus been handicapped in
the battle for consumer opinion. The introduction in 1990 of electronic
tolling, however, has removed a major obstacle to their popular
acceptance.
<P>
<B>The Highway Lobby</B> 
<P>
But toll roads are also opposed by a formidable array of advocacy
organizations. Foremost among them are The American Automobile
Association, the American Highway Users Alliance, and the American
Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.
<P>
The American Automobile Association (AAA) has always adamantly
opposed toll roads and called for &quot;free&quot; public roads.
Founded in 1902, the famed AAA, along with the farmers' National
Grange, was instrumental in the passage of the Federal Highway
Acts of 1916 and 1921. This legislation established the policy
that public roads should be planned nationally by an independent
federal agency, the Bureau of Public Roads.
<P>
AAA is a huge non-profit: it has 38 million members, 113 state
and regional clubs, and 37,000 fulltime staff in the U.S. and
Canada. A nonprofit but fully taxable corporation without stockholders,
AAA, in effect, establishes its state and regional clubs as franchises
with which it has various confidential revenue-sharing arrangements.
AAA's 34 million U.S. members pay an average fee of $30. It claims
to be the largest publisher of travel material in the world. Further,
it generated $2 billion in 1994 travel agency sales, has 3.8 million
AAA/Visa and Mastercard holders, and contracts with over 13,000
local garages to provide emergency road services to members.
<P>
AAA's government affairs office in Washington, D.C. has a staff
of 12. Its headquarters staff of 1,000 is in Orlando, Florida,
ironically probably the most heavily turnpiked city in the world.
<P>
The Highway Users Federation is another influential lobby that
favors the maximum construction of untolled roads. HUF was established
by General Motors in 1932 on the not unreasonable assumption that
healthy GM auto sales required plenty of roads.
<P>
Renamed the American Highway Users Alliance at the end of 1995,
this 501(c)(6) trade organization is backed by the American Automobile
Manufacturers Association, the American Trucking Associations,
and the American Petroleum Institute. AHUA is directed by William
Fay, who previously headed the Product Liability Coordinating
Committee, a tort reform group. It has about 500 corporate and
invididual members, a $2 million budget, and a staff of 12 in
its Washington, D.C. headquarters.
<P>
The most influential highway lobby, however, is the American Association
of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), a 501(c)(3)
with a current annual budget of $14 million. AASHTO represents
all 50 state highway and transportation agencies and several regional
agencies that build federally-funded roads and transit systems.
Headed since 1980 by Francis Francois, a patent attorney and former
Maryland county politician, AASHTO has a Washington staff of fifty.
<P>
AASHTO's relations with federal roads agencies have been almost
incestuous. The federal government's Bureau of Public Roads (BPR)
was a full member of the organization for many years and BPR's
long-serving chief, Thomas H. MacDonald (1919-1953), was a fanatical
hater of tolls. These sentiments echo in the Federal Highway Administration,
BPR's successor agency, which, in its 1976 bicentennial history
of American highways, referred to the toll promoter as a &quot;highway
parasite&quot; seeking a &quot;stranglehold&quot; on travel and
commerce.
<P>
<B>The New Road Warriors</B> 
<P>
Before new and technologically-efficient toll roads become an
answer to rush-hour gridlock, one other political hurdle must
be overcome. The old highway interest groups are forming alliances
with public transit advocates. Since 1990, the major barrier to
new highways has been the Clean Air Act. It gives the EPA virtual
veto power over new highway construction. Under pressure, the
highway builders have begun to work with transit groups.
<P>
Symbolizing this change, highway lobby groups have added the &quot;T&quot;
for Transportation to their names: AASHO is now AASHTO. The contractors'
lobby, the American Road Builders Association (ARBA), is now ARTBA.
And the Institute of Traffic Engineers became the Institute of
Transportation Engineers.
<P>
As the highwaymen scramble to re-position themselves, mass transit
has placed its lobbying power in the American Public Transit Association
(APTA). Another 501 (c)(6) trade association, APTA's $12 million
budget comes from some 500 transit agencies around the country
and from the private companies that sell them equipment and services.
APTA's staff of 70 is housed in an office not far from Metro Center,
Washington D.C.'s busiest subway stop. It can claim considerable
credit for influencing the flow of federal transit appropriations,
its top priority.
<P>
APTA has financed a major grassroots campaign, Transit NOW, that
stages rallies and telephone and letter-writing campaigns to sway
members of Congress in transit-dependent districts. Linked to
organized commuter groups, APTA can mobilize the grassroots in
political contests. Its press relations are excellent: it offers
a regular fax service to correspondents and a well-produced weekly
newspaper.
<P>
<B>Progressive Transportation</B> 
<P>
The Surface Transportation Policy Project (STPP) is the latest
special interest entry in the struggle for public funds. Just
as advocates of &quot;progressive philanthropy&quot; want to replace
traditional charity workers with 
social activists, so also do a new breed of transportation policy
experts aim to replace fact-and-figures transportation technocrats.
STPP is a 501(c)(3) group of environmentalists, Naderites, urban
planners and public transit proponents that seeks to tighten enforcement
of the Clean Air Act and to increase transit's share of federal
highway funds. These funds, totalling an incredible $151 billion,
are currently authorized under the 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation
Efficiency Act (ISTEA, or, as it is called, &quot;Ice-tea.&quot;)
<P>
A coalition of over 100 groups without formal membership, STPP
has a $3 million annual budget which supports a staff of ten.
Its steering committee includes representatives of the National
Resources Defense Council, Friends of the Earth, National Wildlife
Federation, Citizen Action, American Public Transit Association,
AARP, the Bicycle Federation, and assorted energy conservation
groups, architects and preservationists.
<P>
STPP's well-argued publications reflect the convictions of policy
ideologues who are more committed to `taming' highways than to
building them. By contrast, the highway lobbies publish materials
that reflect what one researcher has called the tendency of the
highway business to be dominated by engineers from blue-collar,
small-town backgrounds without the education or experience to
fight ideological political warfare.
<P>
STPP's founder and director is Hank Dittmar, former chief lobbyist
for the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission.
Most of its funding comes from the Nathan Cummins Foundation,
the Energy Foundation, the Joyce Foundation, the James C. Penney
Foundation and the Surdna Foundation.
<P>
<B>The New Ideology of Transportation</B> 
<P>
By the late 1990s, highway agencies that once proudly extolled
the benefits of new road construction have been reduced to subsidiaries
of transportation departments dedicated to &quot;transportation
demand management,&quot; or TDM as it is known. TDM is an off-shoot
of environmentalist concepts such as &quot;demand side management&quot;
and &quot;integrated resource planning&quot; that first appeared
in energy policy. Under this philosophy electric utilities, for
instance, are supposed to invest in &quot;negawatts&quot; rather
than megawatts: they are encouraged to promote conservation measures
to <I>reduce</I> energy demand. These buzz words embody the policymaker's
conviction that a well-functioning economy should suppress demand
rather than expand supply. They represent a repudiation of consumer
sovereignty and free markets.
<P>
The TDM ideology of &quot;limits&quot; is apparent in government
transportation programs with titles like ECO (employee commute
options), ETR (employee trip reduction), HOV (high occupancy vehicles-only)
lanes, and carpool propaganda and subsidization. Transportation
departments now tout the special virtues of bicycling, telecommuting,
and riding transit. They insinuate that auto use, especially single
driver auto use, reflects greed, consumer ostentation and insensitivity
to civic virtue. The form of transportation you use is no longer
a private preference. It represents a social morality. The supposed
&quot;imbalance&quot; in the auto/highway system is blamed for
urban &quot;sprawl&quot; i.e. low-density detached housing and
shopping malls and for the decline of central city neighborhoods,
crime, pollution, even global warming.
<P>
Transportation has thus become another battleground in which those
with &quot;the vision of the anointed,&quot; in Thomas Sowell's
felicitous phrase, war with the benighted masses besotted with
cars.
<P>
Few areas of daily life affect people more than transportation.
And few areas are more in need of serious reform. The first step
is realizing that the solution will not be found in perpetuating
government's current monopoly in roads. Rather, it will be found
in new technology and in privatization efforts that are just now
showing signs of catching on in America. As always, this will
entail battling a host of entrenched forces, who, because of interest
and ideology, can be counted on to defend the status quo. 
<P>
<br>
<I>The author, Peter Samuel of Frederick Maryland, has written
about transportation issues for numerous publications. He recently
prepared a report on highway privatization for the Cato Institute.</I>

<h2>Campaign for Human Development Part II: The Chicago Story</h2>
By Scott Weinberg
<P>
<I>Editor's note: In <a href="/crc/trends/ot-0995.html">September</a>, we reported on the worsening problems
of the Campaign for Human Development, the U.S. Catholic bishops'
anti-poverty crusade, whose help for the poor is compromised by
its support for discredited welfare policies and the 60s era activists
who promote them. As last month's issue went to press, CHD supporters
were gathering in Chicago to celebrate the organization's 25th
anniversary. Scott Weinberg, co-author of our September report,
attended the conference and reports on what he saw.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<br>
On August 25-28, over 2,000 activists descended on the posh Hyatt
Regency in Chicago. They came to celebrate the 25th anniversary
of the Campaign for Human Development to meet old friends and
make new connections, in short, to tell their stories. Over the
course of the weekend the conference participants learned new
ways to raise money, discussed how to expand their constituent
bases, and familiarized themselves with the latest organizing
techniques. They heard from academics, reporters, prelates, and
professionals in the politics of protest. They networked, debated
future strategies, and discussed their vision of social justice.
<P>
The event was not unlike other gatherings of liberal activists
except for one thing. This conference was arranged by a program
run by America's Catholic bishops.
<P>
<B>Grassroots Leadership</B> 
<P>
In the atrium, clusters of participants reclined in marbled porticoes
before the opening reception in the Grand Ballroom. Here, I met
Naomi Swinton, who invited me to her fundraiser. Swinton is a
gay and lesbian rights activist for Grassroots Leadership, a CHD-funded
group from North Carolina.
<P>
CHD provided $25,000 to Grassroots Leadership in 1994. As we noted
last month, the North Carolina-based group promotes environmentalism,
abortion rights, homosexual rights, and sundry other liberal causes.
According to its own literature (distributed at the CHD conference),
Grassroots Leadership &quot;works closely with . . . all major
southern movements and organizations, including civil rights,
women, labor, lesbian and gay, environment, peace and religious
action.&quot;
<P>
Swinton is typical of many of the participants. She explains that,
though she has not had that much experience with Catholics, she
hopes CHD can transform what she sees as an autocratic Church.
&quot;I would like to see [CHD] to continue to work on the Catholic
Church . . . presenting a progressive Catholic voice in America.&quot;
<P>
Grassroots Leadership, Swinton explains, is working against &quot;the
right-wing, reactionary, Christian Right&quot; and especially
against Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC), who she considers &quot;.
. . one of the most racist politicians in the Congress.&quot;
<P>
Why should a program of the U.S. Catholic bishops, supported by
parishioners' donations to the collection plate, support Grassroots
Leadership? Indeed, even some recipients of CHD benefactions seemed
pleasantly surprised by CHD grantmaking. Duke Schempp, a pro-choice
Catholic and president of a CHD-funded organization in North Dakota,
remarked following Kahn's workshop, &quot;I hear a lot of people
talk in the hallways . . . `My God! I can't believe they're funding
that here!' And these are the constituents of the CHD!&quot; He
concluded, &quot;I hope CHD encourages groups to get out of the
church, because if people knew what social justice was, they wouldn't
be sticking money in the collection every year.&quot;
<P>
(Schempp noted that the chairman of his organization works at
an abortion clinic. &quot;It makes it a little tense when it comes
to doing something with the diocese,&quot; he said.)
<P>
<B>The Politics of Envy </B>
<P>
Several recurring themes punctuated the conference. The arguments
and rhetoric of class warfare were particularly in evidence, and
nowhere was the language of envy and resentment more articulate
than in Cornel West's keynote speech at Saturday's &quot;Interactive
Plenary Session.&quot;
<P>
West is a professor of religion and African-American studies at
Harvard University. The topic of his speech was &quot;A Current
Socio-Political-Economic Analysis.&quot; The following are excerpts:
<P>
&quot;. . . anytime you talk about poverty in America, you also
have to come to terms with the pernicious and vicious legacy of
White Supremacy . . . and you begin to hit up against issues of
patriarchy, insubordination, and wealth . . . We are living in
one of the most frightening and terrifying moments in the history
of the nation. . . .
<P>
&quot;And believe you me, there will never be enough police and
prisons to deal with the avalanche of despair . . . There's no
serious talk about the fact that one percent of the population
owns 48 percent of the financial wealth. That sounds oligarchic,
plutocratic . . . pigmentocratic . . . The ultimate logic of a
market economy is the gangsterization of culture . . . The marketplace
. . . is an extension of the laissez-white supremacy . . . Same
as those with homophobia, keeping trapped the humanity of gay
brothers and lesbian sisters.&quot;
<P>
West, an increasingly well-known public speaker, recently joined
other celebrities and Hollywood leftists like Ed Asner and Whoopi
Goldberg to rally support for convicted cop-killer Mumia Abu-Jamal.
In an open and shut case, Jamal was convicted and sentenced to
death for the 1981 murder of Philadelphia police officer Daniel
Faulkner, who was found with a bullet in his back and another
between his eyes.
<P>
Although it took the jury less than four hours to convict Jamal
of first degree murder, the case has oddly become a cause celebre
for extremists seeking to rekindle the passions of the 1960s.
They now claim that the &quot;mediagenic&quot; Jamal, a former
radio commentator and militant activist, was framed. West has
even compared him to Martin Luther King.
<P>
The third world rhetoric of haves and have-nots was not limited
to Cornel West. Bertha Lewis of Brooklyn ACORN, the radical community-action
group, echoed West's revolutionary rhetoric: &quot;You gotta continue
to organize! `Cuz I'm gonna tell ya the rich and those other folks
[in Congress] CHD can be the foundation for poor people to be
organized in this country, to overcome these walls and bring the
money down!&quot; Rudolph T. Juarez, president of the CHD-funded
Quad Cities Interfaith in Davenport, Iowa, concurred, &quot;Whoever
has the money has the power.&quot; &quot;Endemic to human society
[is that] the big guy has all the power and authority . . . so
what we try to do is spread it around a bit more,&quot; said Juarez.
<P>
<B>Sin and the Republican Contract</B> 
<P>
The absence of diversity was another hallmark of the conference.
Participants were overwhelmingly left-liberal. They shared an
implacable belief in the ability of government to cure society's
ills. And they were united in their enmity toward conservatives,
the Republican Congress and, especially, House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
<P>
Pablo Eisenberg, executive director of the Center for Community
Change, a sort of roundhouse for leftist activists, went furthest
in his attacks on conservatives. In an interview with me, Eisenberg
branded conservatives in Congress as &quot;anti-American, anti-people,
anti-democratic . . . anti-Christian and anti-faith; intolerant,
bigoted.&quot; To him, CHD is &quot;an attack on all the conservative
values the Christian coalition claims it has.&quot; Later, he
added the observation that the Pope is too conservative, and that
&quot;If there was a progressive Pope, everything in the CHD would
be fine.&quot;
<P>
Even discounting a speaker's flattery of his hosts, Eisenberg,
a veteran activist-organizer and Washington fixture, acknowledged
CHD's strategic importance: He observed that without CHD funds
&quot;more than half of the organizing in this country would not
be taking place.&quot;
<P>
At a reception on Friday, Ray Schomaker from the Communities United
for Action in Cincinnati commented that the Contract With America
only &quot;favors the rich and shuts out the poor. That's the
complete antithesis of what we're all about here.&quot; Sister
Marion Dillon, the CHD diocesan director for the Philadelphia
archdiocese, said: &quot;Most people here are against the Contract
for America because Newt Gingrich's contract puts a hold on all
that CHD is trying to accomplish.&quot; Chicago ACORN activist
Sammie Sim told me that Newt Gingrich wants to starve children.
<P>
Such fevered personal attacks were common. In another interview,
Kathleen Sherred, an activist from the CHD-funded Mon Valley Unemployed
Committee in Pennsylvania, charged that Senator Rick Santorum
(R-PA) &quot;isn't Catholic. He thinks that if you were born poor
it's your fault . . . Santorum is against the spirit of CHD. Anyone
but God can fall. Santorum thinks he is God and he will fall.&quot;
<P>
I met Pat O'Bryan, Catholic Social Action Director from Cleveland,
Ohio, on Saturday evening just before the Gala dinner. &quot;Republican
defense spending is up,&quot; said the affable and idealistic
O'Bryan, &quot;but they're balancing the budget at the expense
of social programs to the detriment of the poor.&quot; 
O'Bryan describes Newt Gingrich as &quot;a right-wing intellectual
and demagogue. I think he buys his stuff so well then couches
it in intellectual terms that it's almost a fundamentalist faith.
He's like a fighting dog. He knows just where to bite . . . After
Newt has destroyed the Democrats, it's up to people like us to
find a third way.&quot;
<P>
Returning from an ACORN rally, I came across Andres Sarabia, a
CHD diocesan director from Texas. Speaking with me outside the
hotel, he argued that &quot;CHD helps community organizing provide
the forum, the legitimacy, for anger.&quot; If guilt often goads
the conscience of the liberal upper-middle class philanthropist,
arguably anger motivates the activist. And Sarabia is angry at
conservatives: &quot;The Republicans are saying to young families,
`you don't have a job, that's your fault; you're uneducated, that's
your fault; you don't have a place to live, that's your fault.'
They put all the blame on young families, but society doesn't
take the blame for nothing. What they are saying is that you don't
matter. You're insignificant in our master plan, our contract
on America.&quot;
<P>
Society is at fault and must accept responsibility: this is a
hallmark of CHD thinking and explains the group's emphasis on
collective blame over individual responsibility. The view was
elaborated by Ernesto Cortez, head of the Southwest district of
the Industrial Areas Foundation, a major recipient of CHD money
and the organization founded in Chicago in 1940 by the late Saul
Alinsky, the father of community organizing. Speaking with fervor
and zeal during a Sunday panel discussion, Cortez, the organizer's
organizer, argued that Catholics will have to atone for the sins
of the Republicans: &quot;I'm reminded that all of us as Catholics
are going to have some explaining to do on Judgment Day . . .
when we look at the folks [in Congress] that we gotta explain.
Because unfortunately, our responsibility isn't just individual.&quot;
<P>
In coarse tones, the balding activist added, &quot;We're going
to have to explain as a people, as a community, as a Church, what
we did about these folks. Because Phil Gramm didn't get elected
by an act of God. Dick Armey didn't get appointed by the pontiff.
Tom DeLay didn't just happen. He didn't come out of the head of
Zeus . . . although he's a pretty dumb fellow. I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to say anything people would take offense at. But I didn't
think anyone would take offense at my referring to Tom DeLay as
cognitively challenged.&quot;
<P>
Those who vote for Republicans may not commit a sin, but clearly
it is a sin not to do everything possible to prevent them from
doing so.
<P>
<B>Radical Religion, Imperialism, and Sister Lucy</B> 
<P>
It is unlikely that those with non-traditional views of the Church
itself would feel anything but at ease at the conference. CHD
has often been criticized for giving free rein to advocates of
liberation theology. Participants at the conference were open
about their support for liberation theology and quick to criticize
the so-called institutional church.
<P>
Pat O'Bryan looks to the third world for the answer: &quot;We're
going to find our consciences, our sense, soul, and mind in the
third world . . . Europe is thrashing about; they've gone right-wing
too.&quot; &quot;The CHD in the U.S. and the whole world does
what liberation theology does in Central America. . . .&quot;
Louann Shea from Catholic Charities in Chicago, whom I met in
the hotel lobby, offered the opinion, &quot;My view on poverty
is that when the Church crumbles, and it will, all that's left
are individuals standing on their own two feet.&quot;
<P>
In many cases, CHD conference-goers were critical of what they
see as the autocratic nature of the Church. Often they questioned
fundamental matters of faith on issues such

as the ordination of women. Jan Valder, a former CHD national
committee member who served on the celebration's Educational Moment
Committee, sees CHD transforming &quot;both society and the Church.&quot;
She would like the Pope to be &quot;a little different on women's
issues. Women don't have an equal role in the Church. If you look
at the institution without talking about ordination but you could
talk about that, too.&quot; She is critical of the Church's &quot;overwhelming
male-centeredness.&quot;
<P>
Sister Marion Dillon opines that &quot;Women priests will come
after a married clergy, but not in John Paul II's lifetime.&quot;
She notes that a lot of the people at the celebration oppose the
Pope because he is considered too conservative.
<P>
In short, what the British call &quot;loony-leftism&quot; permeated
the conference. In the exhibit area, I came across an elderly
nun peddling &quot;Lucy's cards&quot;: greeting cards with themes
blending environmental mysticism with feminism: &quot;. . . see
woman whom I have ordained;&quot; &quot;earth mother . . . goddess
mother . . . Sophia spirit breath of the Holy Jesus Son of Mary;&quot;
&quot;praise our goddess in her universe.&quot; The cards are
the creation of Sister Lucy, a Dominican nun from Racine, Wisconsin.
<P>
The moderator at a session titled &quot;Catholic Social Teachings
101&quot; asked participants to provide examples of &quot;structural
sin.&quot; Said one participant, &quot;I was thinking in terms
of structural sin when `imperialism' was written [on the board].
I would say that structurally we are part of a system that exploits
third world countries . . . That's a part of our government. .
. .&quot;
<P>
Another participant offered: &quot;Imperialism is our support
of the Contras in Nicaragua. They [the Sandinistas] had the public
revolution. Our government wasn't happy with the result. We broke
international law by mining the harbors, by funding [the Contras]
when Congress agreed not to fund them . . . People like Ollie
North, and others, broke our laws.&quot;
<P>
<B>CHD and ACORN: Together Again</B> 
<P>
It wouldn't be a CHD event without a media stunt by the Association
of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN). As past editions
of <I>Organization Trends</I> have noted, ACORN is a radical pressure
group well-known for its disruptive antics. ACORN chapters across
the country have greatly benefited from generous funding from
CHD.
<P>
ACORN activists from across America took advantage of the CHD
conference to &quot;do a job&quot; on Chicago's Whole Foods Grocery
Store. Calling themselves the &quot;Red Brigade&quot; and wearing
t-shirts emblazoned with the slogan &quot;ACORN &amp; CHD,&quot;
the activists boarded six buses that departed from the Hyatt for
the protest. Most were older black women led by a handful of young
white activists.
<P>
Ted Thomas, ACORN's negotiator, explained the group's objectives:
&quot;We have a hiring hall. What we want to do is make an agreement
with them that they will hire a number of people . . . from our
hiring office. The next step is to see that they get the minimum
of $7.70 what we call a living wage . . . If we hear that our
workers aren't being treated fairly or squarely, we have to go
back and put more actions on them.&quot;
<P>
Just what is wrong with Whole Foods?
<P>
According to activist Marcia Ericksen of ACORN Minnesota, &quot;The
workers are young and they don't know how to organize . . . My
impression [about Whole Foods] is that they're posing as not selling
processed foods . . . Whole Foods is a new type of market based
on the co-op model of having organic food but it's supplied to
people on a larger scale mass market than the co-op model.&quot;
The protesters expressed concern that Whole Foods could put co-ops
out of business.
<P>
Apparently, ACORN regards Whole Foods as some sort of sinister
health foods conglomerate. According to another ACORN organizer,
&quot;Whole Foods attracts the same kind of audience as co-ops
. . . They were originally hippie entrepreneurs who sold out big
to corporate management . . . They have board members in the military
establishment, but I'm not positive about that. They use new age
ideas to market old capitalistic ideas.&quot;
<P>
As usual, the facts conflict with ACORN's claims. Activists unfurled
a banner inside the store which read &quot;We Can't Survive on
$4.25,&quot; and they demanded more ethnic representation in hiring.
However, I spoke with Paul, an employee, who reports that Whole
Foods employees, most of whom are members of minority groups,
start at $7.00 per hour. The store's managers are a black male
and a white woman. The chain's regional president is Mary Kay
Hagen. Paul says that Whole Foods offers great benefits. &quot;It's
a great job.&quot;
<P>
As ACORN workers chant, &quot;A-C-O-R-N, THE PEOPLE'S VOICE WILL
RISE AGAIN,&quot; Steve, another Whole Foods employee, comments:
&quot;The public chooses. That's what makes the country what it
is. The public chooses with their shopping dollars. If the public
did not like what we were selling and where we were, then we would
not be able to survive.&quot;
<P>
Steve's comments were clear and are accepted by most Americans.
It is unfortunate that CHD does not appear to understand or accept
them. Individual freedom, choice, competition and cooperation
are implicit in Steve's off-hand description of how Whole Food's
consumers, managers, and employees relate to one another. But
they seem alien to the ACORN protesters and to the CHD program
officers who distribute the funds raised from Catholic parishioners.
<P>
In his opening address, Chicago's Archbishop Joseph Cardinal Bernardin,
honorary chairman of the CHD 25th anniversary celebration, noted
that &quot;The CHD is the church's best-kept secret.&quot; Indeed
it is.

<h2>Campaign for Human Development: Worse Than Ever
</h2>
<I><B>Anti-Poverty Program Celebrates 25 Years. Conference Features
Marxist Professor and Pro-Abortion Speakers.</B></I>
<P>
<br>
Prepared by freelance reporter Scott Weinberg
and <I>OT</i> Editor <a href="/crc/about/people.html#Pambianco">Bob Pambianco</a>
<P>
<i>Editor's Note: This year marks the 25th anniversary of the Campaign
for Human Development, the 60s-era anti-poverty program of the
American Catholic Bishops. As this issue goes to press, activists
from across America are gathering in Chicago during the last weekend
in August to celebrate the occasion and to reflect on CHD's accomplishments.
For our part, we see little to celebrate. CHD remains a source
of funds for the radical left, supporting groups and causes that
promote class division and espouse beliefs antithetical to Catholic
social teaching. In this issue, we examine some of the notables
who will address the Chicago gathering, and also focus on CHD's
activities in the Southwest. Regrettably, the picture is a dismal
one. In a later issue, we will provide an in-depth report on just
what happened at the Chicago conference.</I>
<P>
<br>
Every year at Thanksgiving time, American Catholics are called
upon to contribute to the Campaign for Human Development, the
anti-poverty program of the American Catholic bishops. Informed
that CHD is an innovative &quot;self-help&quot; program offering
the poor a hand-up not a hand-out, the faithful make generous
contributions over $230 million to CHD since its inception. What
they are not told, and what the bureaucrats at CHD do not want
them to know, is that most of CHD's money goes to support liberal
activists who use it to teach people how to organize and agitate
for more government spending programs. Even worse, CHD-funded
activists are often openly disdainful of the teachings of the
Catholic Church, whose offerings they gladly accept. This year's
collection is scheduled for the weekend of November 18-19.
<P>
<B>CHD Sociology and Theology</B> 
<P>
Far from offering an innovative approach to poverty, the Campaign
for Human Development operates on the same assumptions as Lyndon
Johnson's War on Poverty. Rather than encourage individual striving
and responsibility, CHD focuses on the so-called root causes of
poverty. Rather than offer the poor the example of success and
guidance in achieving it, CHD explains why poverty is the system's
fault and teaches how to radicalize institutions. Rather than
champion faith to challenge society's spiritual emptiness, CHD's
good news is that organizing around &quot;issues&quot; builds
coalitions and creates political power.
<P>
CHD vociferously claims to be nonpartisan, but almost all of its
activities fall on the left often the far-left side of the ideological
spectrum. CHD-funded groups invariably favor public policies that
require state intervention and decisionmaking. And they build
support for their positions by resorting to the rhetoric of class
consciousness and the tactics of social conflict.
<P>
What is worse is that CHD has established a long track record
of funding groups whose activities many Catholics would find repugnant.
CHD grantmaking guidelines essentially allow it to finance any
organization whose <I>primary</I> focus is in accord with Catholic
social and moral teaching. However, other concerns may be directly
at odds with Church teaching. Thus, what should be CHD's goal
acts instead as a disclaimer, enabling CHD to avoid responsibility
for the positions of groups it funds.
<P>
CHD claims to be a witness to Catholic social justice. But Dr.
Francois Orsini, founder of the St. Antoninus Institute for Catholic
Business in Education, observes that CHD solutions preclude genuine
Christian social action. By concentrating on tried-and-failed
methods of victimization and blame, CHD undermines the individual's
capacity for spiritual, moral and social renewal. &quot;In the
long run,&quot; Orsini concludes, &quot;the CHD is a mockery of
Catholicism that hurts rather than helps the poor.&quot;
<P>
<B>Who's Celebrating CHD? </B>
<P>
The announced line-up of speakers at CHD's August 25-28 anniversary
conference in Chicago is a social register of its radical outlook.
Among the featured luminaries are a Marxist college professor,
pro-abortion and pro-gay rights activists, and a strident opponent
of school choice.
<P>
<B>Cornel West.</B> A Harvard philosophy professor and avowed
Christian-Marxist, West regards American democracy as a bridge
between Christian revelation and Marx's dialectical materialism.
The <I>New York Times</I> describes him as &quot;a progressive
socialist in the age of triumphant capitalism&quot; and notes
that he was introduced to Marxism through his involvement with
the Black Panthers, the sixties black-power group.
<P>
In his book <I>Prophecy Deliverance!</I>, West posited that the
fate of Western civilization is in the alliance between Afro-American
religious thought and progressive Marxism. The &quot;relative
absence of progressive Marxism in American society is exacerbated
by the reluctance of American Marxism as a whole to take seriously
indigenous American radicalism . . . A distinctive virtue of progressive
Marxism linked to prophetic Christianity is the ease with which
it can cooperate with non-Marxist progressive movements.&quot;
<P>
West is an &quot;honorary chair&quot; of the Democratic Socialists
of America (DSA), a political party-turned-nonprofit lobby that
shares his yearning for a new political Left. Founded by the late
Michael Harrington, DSA operates on the premise that &quot;our
economic system places too much power in the hands of too few
people&quot; and &quot;seeks nothing less than the freeing of
the human mind and spirit through the radical restructuring of
our economic, social, and political institutions.&quot;
<P>
<B>Dolores Huerta.</B> Like West, an &quot;honorary chair&quot;
of the DSA, Huerta is co-founder and vice president of Cesar Chavez's
United Farm Workers of America. A committed abortion-rights activist,
she was a featured speaker at the National Organization for Women's
pro-abortion rally in Washington in April. An avowed feminist,
she believes that &quot;Men are taught to dominate and have power
over people&quot; and that &quot;Women are a colonized group.&quot;
Proposals to end affirmative action and reform welfare are part
of a &quot;get-back-to-the-kitchen movement,&quot; she says.
<P>
Huerta's views on abortion are incompatible with the Catholic
view of moral life and her politics are the antithesis of the
pro-life cause. She advocates taxpayer-funded abortions and opposes
even modest efforts to restrict abortion.
<P>
In 1990, the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> reported that she was a
member of a commission set up by NOW to determine the feasibility
of establishing a third political party devoted to feminist issues,
in particular support for abortion on demand.
<P>
In 1990 Huerta was involved in an attempt to block President Bush's
motorcade, joining protestors demanding an end to United States
involvement in El Salvador and more money for AIDS. A <I>San Francisco
Chronicle</I> account reports that &quot;several American flags
were set fire&quot; and protesters unfurled a banner proclaiming
&quot;U.S. out of my Uterus.&quot;
<P>
<B>Bertha Lewis.</B> It is appropriate that the list of speakers
include Bertha Lewis of Brooklyn ACORN. The overtly radical ACORN
(Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now) has been
a long-time and major beneficiary of CHD munificence. In 1994,
CHD provided $436,000 to fourteen ACORN groups across the country.
<P>
Accomplished in pressuring banks to finance its housing programs,
ACORN is not so much an advocacy group as a strong-arm gang. Earlier
this year, it gained notoriety for disrupting a meeting featuring
House Speaker Newt Gingrich. In March, ACORN activists burst into
a meeting of the National Association of Counties just before
Gingrich was scheduled to speak, banging on lunch trays and shouting
&quot;Nuke Newt!&quot; Later, the group interrupted a House Committee
hearing <BR>
on low-income housing loans. Several ACORN leaders were arrested
and taken into custody by the Capitol Police.
<P>
The Clinton administration scrambled to deny association with
ACORN, cutting off funds to the Acorn Housing Corporation, which
had received a $1.1 million federal grant to support 42 AmeriCorps
national service volunteers. Acorn Housing Corp. unsuccessfully
argued that it was a completely separate nonprofit organization,
one which just happened to share headquarters with ACORN, and
just happened to be founded by ACORN.
<P>
<B>Winona LaDuke.</B> She is co-chair of the Indigenous Women's
Network (IWN), a Minnesota-based group that addresses the concerns
of American Indian women. Earlier this year, the group sponsored
a tour by a feminist rock-and-roll band, the Indigo Girls. Audience
members filled out protest cards and listened to nightly speeches
by LaDuke.
<P>
&quot;Our activism is definitely spiritual in nature,&quot; a
band member told the <I>San Diego Union-Tribune</I>, which noted
the Indigo Girls' support for &quot;. . . Greenpeace and assorted
abortion-rights, gun control and AIDS-relief organizations.&quot;
<P>
LaDuke is the founder of the CHD-funded ($50,000 in 1994) White
Earth Land Recovery Project (WELR). For failure to pay taxes,
the White Earth Indian tribe lost over 800,000 acres of land in
Minnesota, some of which was later acquired by the Catholic Church.
The Project is working to reacquire the land.
<P>
<B>William Greider.</B> A supporter of the methods of Saul Alinsky
and Ralph Nader, Greider is a middle-aged liberal journalist who
has found a home as political editor at <I>Rolling Stone</I>,
the magazine for middle-aged liberal fans of rock music. Greider
is an outspoken opponent of school choice programs. As assistant
managing editor of <I>The Washington Post</I>, Greider in 1981
blasted neoconservatives &quot;living proof that even intellectuals
can be dangerous&quot; for supporting school privatization efforts.
Tuition tax credits, long-supported by Catholic parents and educators,
were denounced by Greider as a racially-motivated sop to the rich
likely to wreck Washington, D.C.'s public schools, &quot;just
when they are getting their act together.&quot;
<P>
D.C. schools have never gotten their act together. The Bishops
are on record supporting the concept of school choice. But Greider
is in tune with the staff at CHD. Last year, Timothy Collins,
CHD's deputy executive director told <I>Organization Trends</I>
that CHD does not support programs promoting school choice because
it is not a &quot;poor people's&quot; issue. For his part, Greider
takes the teachers' union line that private schools deliberately
keep out the &quot;unwashed.&quot;
<P>
In <I>Who Will Tell the People: The Betrayal of American Democracy</I>,
clearly the title for a pundit's tome, Greider proclaimed, &quot;America
has become a nation where monied interests and elite organizations
dominate the discourse and the process whereby government makes
decisions.&quot; More colloquially, in a July 1995 <I>Rolling
Stone</I> debate with P.J. O'Rourke, Greider dismissed the argument
that only individuals, not government, create wealth as &quot;silly
and flatly wrong.&quot; State power was needed to &quot;confront
the destructive side effects of capitalism&quot; and the &quot;malefactors
of great wealth.&quot;
<P>
<B>Rep. Marcy Kaptur. </B>A Democratic Congresswoman from Ohio
and former CHD national advisory committee member, Kaptur's voting
record and political career embodies CHD's swing to the left.
According to <I>The Plain Dealer</I>, a Cleveland, Ohio newspaper,
Kaptur, once a rank and file pro-lifer, now believes that &quot;The
majority of my constituents feel that government funding should
not be used to support abortion, but they recognize that families
who choose it should have the legal right to do so. I am trying
to make sure the health [care] bill reflects that.&quot;
<P>
In 1993, the National Right to Life Committee gave Kaptur a 44
(out of 100) in its scorecard of abortion-related votes in Congress.
She has voted against parental notification and for funding of
the United Nations Population Fund.
<P>
<B>Pablo Eisenberg.</B> A veteran of the War on Poverty and the
Johnson administration's Office of Economic Opportunity, Eisenberg
is the chief theorist of the community organizing concept that
informs CHD operations. He is the executive director of the Center
for Community Change (CCC) in Washington, an organization dedicated
to redistributing wealth through higher taxes and increased social
spending. Funded by a raft of liberal philanthropies, the Ford
Foundation in particular, CCC functions as a hub and clearinghouse
for thousands of community-based organizations.
<P>
The Center has helped identify new funding sources for left-wing
activists and was instrumental in creating the National Committee
for Responsive Philanthropy, itself a past recipient of CHD funds.
In 1993, <I>Organization Trends</I> called attention to the fact
that the Committee issued a major report attacking the pro-life
movement.
<P>
<B>Si Kahn. </B>Part professional activist and part singer-songwriter,
Kahn's tunes, in the words of the <I>Chicago Tribune</I>, are
&quot;anthems of social justice.&quot; The conference itinerary
lists Kahn as one of the entertainers at the event, as well as
a workshop leader.
<P>
During a 1985 show, Kahn sang a song about Senator Jesse Helms
getting pregnant and begging for the abortion he outlawed.
<P>
Kahn heads a North Carolina group called Grassroots Leadership
which he founded fifteen years ago. In 1994, CHD contributed $25,000
to Grassroots Leadership, a group whose mission is &quot;to promote
racial causes, women's freedom of choice, gay and lesbian rights,
and environmental issues,&quot; according to <I>The Plain Dealer</I>.
<P>
Kahn says, &quot;My work is explicitly political,&quot; a remark
that exemplifies what is wrong with CHD.
<P>
<B>Radical Grace: Industrial Areas Foundation and Albuquerque
Interfaith </B>
<P>
The network of interlocking CHD grant recipients provides further
evidence of how CHD operates and of the radical nature and ill-effects
of its work. 
<P>
A major recipient of CHD funds is the Industrial Areas Foundation.
CHD has provided millions of dollars $5 million between 1991 and
1993 alone from Catholics of good will to IAF groups across the
country. IAF was founded by the late Saul Alinsky whose organizing
methods serve as a model for CHD. A founding father of social
activism, Alinsky wrote <I>Rules for Radicals</I>, whose credo
inspires and teaches: &quot;To hell with charity; the only thing
you'll get is what you're strong enough to get.&quot;
<P>
In October of 1994, a group called Albuquerque Interfaith (AI)
received a CHD grant of $50,000 &quot;to help that group become
a broad-based community organization.&quot; Albuquerque Interfaith
works with the Industrial Areas Foundation to develop methods
of church-based organizing in order to recruit new members. So-called
interfaith alliances enable church groups to transform themselves
into political action centers to mobilize and agitate for the
progressive cause of the day. The head of the Southwest district
of the Industrial Areas Foundation is Ernesto Cortez, one of Saul
Alinsky's chief disciples.
<P>
A founding organization of the Albuquerque Interfaith network
is the Albuquerque-based Center for Action and Contemplation (CAC).
Its role, according to the Center's founder Rev. Richard Rohr,
is &quot;to question the bourgeois, middle-class world view,&quot;
&quot;to challenge the middle class and the White,&quot; and &quot;the
middle-class attitudes in America that are oppressing us.&quot;
The CAC is committed to &quot;collaborating with other organizations
endorsing a similar vision and philosophy.&quot;
<P>
The character of that vision and philosophy can be gauged in CAC's
newsletter <I>Radical Grace</I>, which blends Saul Alinsky's social-activist
polemics with liberation theology. According to <I>Radical Grace</I>:
&quot;Our times cry out for renewed political vision . . . We
challenge any political litmus test that distorts the independent
moral conscience that faith can bring into politics . . . We are
deeply concerned about the subversion of prophetic religion .
. . when the gospel message is turned upside down to bring more
comfort to those on top of society than those at the bottom.
<P>
<I>Radical Grace</I> asserts that &quot;The almost total identification
of the Religious Right and the new Republican majority in Washington
is a dangerous liaison of religion with political power.&quot;
Yet mixing politics with religion is exactly what <I>Radical Grace</I>
and CHD practice.
<P>
The newsletter renounces dogma and tradition, promotes radical
feminism, and announces &quot;Reinventing the Masculine&quot;
and &quot;Reconstructing Sexuality&quot; seminars. Nestled among
notices common to any parish bulletin (breakfast at a homeless
shelter; celebrating the feast of St. Anthony) are events that
deal with &quot;rediscovering and claiming the feminine soul&quot;
and &quot;Reconstructing Business Relationships and Corporate
America.&quot;
<P>
<I>Radical Grace</I> is openly contemptuous of Church teaching
on the role of women in the Church. Christina Spahn writes, &quot;I
do not look to the Vatican for assurance of my place in the Church
today.&quot; She complains that efforts to &quot;remind the Vatican
that women <I>could</I> be named as Cardinals . . . have been
vastly ignored.&quot; The &quot;institutional church,&quot; she
says, &quot;is flawed by sin, fear, and the comfort of the familiar.&quot;
<P>
Another article carps about the &quot;repression of women in the
Church.&quot; &quot;We have been denied what many of us believe
to be God-given privileges,&quot; says the author.
<P>
<B>Political Activism and Abortion</B> 
<P>
<I>Radical Grace</I> politicizes the sacred by rewriting the Apostles
Creed, referring to God as the mother and father of nonviolence,
and Jesus Christ as a &quot;victim of the death penalty.&quot;
Its &quot;all inclusive&quot; communion of saints numbers Gandhi,
Martin Luther King Jr., Thomas Merton, Dorothy Day, and &quot;.
. . the whole of humanity in the great dance of life.&quot;
<P>
A CAC volunteer, Sister Mary O'Keefe, confirmed by phone that
she supports choice in abortion, and dissents 
from Rome on most moral issues. O'Keefe says she is praying for
the Pope's conversion. O'Keefe also confirmed that her views are
largely shared by most of the CAC staff.
<P>
CAC's new president is Richard Heim, a former secretary of the
New Mexico Department of Human Services who was instrumental in
introducing Medicaid-funded abortions to the state. Heim, a Catholic,
repeats the Planned Parenthood line that if &quot;the state undertakes
funding of medical care of the poor, which includes funding for
childbirth, the state cannot also deny funding for abortion,&quot;
according to <I>The Albuquerque Tribune</I>. 
<P>
Heim also serves as &quot;core leader&quot; at the Aquinas Newman
Center in Albuquerque, which works with Albuquerque Interfaith
seeking &quot;supporters in large numbers to demonstrate broad-based
support for corrective action by professional and elected leaders.&quot;
<P>
Members of local church congregations are questioning why their
communities have such close ties to IAF. As a consequence, a number
of churches have withdrawn their affiliation with Interfaith movements
because of that relationship.
<P>
Most notable is the withdrawal of El Divino Redentor Church in
McAllen, New Mexico. Petitioners recount IAF's tactics: &quot;Although
joining in this movement was authorized by committee, it is not
favored by the membership in general,&quot; the petition from
the Methodist congregation stated. The congregation reasoned that
the &quot;objectives of this organization [Valley Interfaith]
are of political pressure and this is contrary to the purpose
of this church;&quot; and it concluded that if &quot;things continue
as they are, our congregation will be destroyed.&quot; The church
called for a service of reconciliation to &quot;renounce membership
in Valley Interfaith.&quot;
<P>
A parishioner at Albuquerque's St. Charles Borromeo Catholic Church,
Mrs. Joan Higgs, underscores what is troubling Catholics about
the Campign for Human Development. Higgs recalls the original
CHD collections over twenty years ago: &quot;I believe everyone
used to think the CHD was the Church's [standard] collection for
the poor.
<P>
&quot;It sounded good and so we naturally made the effort to contribute.
Now, as we object to that kind of political action in our church,
my family no longer contributes.&quot;
<P>
Higgs remembers meeting Interfaith activist, ex-priest Tim McCluskey.
She recalls a man quite simply unable to accept &quot;no&quot;
for an answer. His appeals to have &quot;our parish accept an
AI alliance amounted to endless talk, never a prayer, and endless
`discussion.' She concludes, &quot;I believe there is something
wrong with politics being an essential part of our congregation's
affiliation, and so we no longer contribute to the CHD collection.&quot;
<P>
<B>What is Wrong With the CHD?</B> 
<P>
CHD contends that its work is impelled by Scripture, modern Catholic
social teaching, and the &quot;pervasive presence of poverty in
the United States.&quot; Yet the evidence suggests otherwise.
<P>
In fact, Catholic scholars and clerics argue that the CHD abuses
&quot;the pervasive presence of poverty in America&quot; to advance
a liberal political and social agenda. A Midwest diocesan director
for CHD, who asked to remain anonymous, regards the lack of clear
articulation about the Campaign's principles as a danger which
lends itself to abuses. A priest, the CHD director said he doesn't
go out of his way to promote the collection: &quot;We've included
the CHD collection with two others on the same day,&quot; he remarked.
<P>
Commenting on the overall functioning of the CHD, the director
commented that CHD is &quot;in the hands of a few well-intentioned
people who don't do their homework about the projects they fund
nor seem to care to.&quot;
<P>
&quot;It is sad how most Catholics think that CHD money goes to
church projects, when in fact it does not,&quot; he concludes.
<P>
Once again, we call on the America's Catholic bishops to initiate
a desperately-needed overhaul of the Campaign for Human Development.
The problems with CHD are legion. Given the deep-rooted and institutional
nature of the problems, as well as the Campaign's flawed premises,
we seriously doubt whether mere reform is possible. Nevertheless,
we urge the bishops to rein in this program. The bishops themselves
must exercise active oversight, not rubberstamp decisions by CHD
professional staff. At a minimum, they should recognize an obligation
to be honest with parishioners about the aims and activities of
CHD.
<P>
We look forward to the day when there will be no need to report
on the Campaign for Human Development. And we are confidant that
this day will arrive because, as Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis
once said, the glare of scrutiny is &quot;the best of disinfectants.&quot;
<P>
Meanwhile, we strongly urge parishioners to withhold their contributions.

<h2>The National Trust for Historic Preservation<BR>
</h2>
<br>
<a href="/crc/about/people.html#Pambianco">Robert V. Pambianco</a>, Editor
<P>
<I>Editor's note: The National Trust for Historic Preservation,
a taxpayer-funded nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting
national historic sites, offers a prime example of how opponents
of economic development use the political process to achieve their
ends. Thoroughly elitist in its disdain for popular interests,
the Trust carries a worthwhile goal to extremes: it is hostile
to property rights, doesn't mind trampling on freedom of religion,
and keeps in step with the latest dictates of political correctness.
</I>
<P>
<br>
The National Trust for Historic Preservation was chartered by
the U.S. Congress in 1949 to &quot;protect buildings, sites, and
objects significant in American history and culture.&quot; Over
the years, it has encouraged Americans to better appreciate the
significance and beauty of many places in American history. It
has acquired and manages eighteen historic &quot;house museums,&quot;
including the homes of President James Madison, President Woodrow
Wilson, and Naval hero Captain Stephen Decatur, as well as three
Virginia plantation mansions.
<P>
The Trust has capitalized on the interests of a new generation
of Americans who enjoy travel, antiques, home re-decorating, and
the &quot;finer things.&quot; Its high-toned bimonthly magazine
features people restoring old houses and groups renovating picturesque
local properties. It is filled with advertisements for expensive
vacation spots and has an extensive real estate section. The Trust
sponsors tours to exotic places around the globe Istanbul, Venice,
Carthage, Cape Town, Victoria Falls, Imperial Asia often aboard
cruise ship, yacht, clipper ship, or the Orient Express.
<P>
In recent years, the Trust's mission has moved beyond the preservation
of noteworthy sites. The meaning of historic preservation has
been transformed as the Trust has broken new ground in public
policy, adopting controversial positions on legal and constitutional
issues and using historic preservation as a vehicle to promote
an anti-growth agenda. Perhaps fearful that it will be tagged
as a defender of old-money illusions of bygone days or as a commercial
promoter of yuppie lifestyles, the Trust now dedicates itself
not only to protecting historic places but also &quot;historic
environments,&quot; the &quot;livability of our communities,&quot;
and &quot;diversity.&quot;
<P>
The Trust has a budget of $33 million and total assets of $68
million. Its president is Richard Moe, former chief of staff to
Walter Mondale. A 501(c)(3) organization, it receives one-fifth
of its budget from the federal government through a grant from
the National Park Service.
<P>
The $7 million grant is part of an annual $41 million appropriation
for the Historic Preservation Fund, $33 million of which goes
to State Historic Preservation Offices.
<P>
<B>Constitutional Concerns: the Fifth Amendment</B> 
<P>
The Trust's activities touch on two contentious constitutional
issues. The first relates to the Fifth Amendment to the Bill of
Rights, which states that the government may not seize property
for public purposes without just compensation. With that Amendment
in mind and as part of the Contract with America, property rights
proponents in Congress have proposed so-called &quot;takings&quot;
legislation, which requires federal agencies to compensate property
owners whose land has been devalued by government regulatory mandates.
(The Private Property Protection Act of 1995 has been passed in
the House of Representatives; similar legislation is awaiting
action in the Senate.)
<P>
Even though the legislation would not limit government's authority
to declare a property to be a historical landmark, the National
Trust has joined with the environmental movement and a raft of
other liberal constituencies in opposing takings legislation.
<P>
The Trust argues that takings bills will have an &quot;adverse
impact on efforts to preserve and protect our important and irreplaceable
historic and cultural resources.&quot; George Abney, a legislative
assistant at the Trust, says that &quot;To minimize compensation
costs, agencies ultimately could choose to ignore regulations.
Federal, state, and local governments could lose their ability
to protect public health, safety, and welfare not to mention historic
resources.&quot; In addition, the Trust contends that the legislation
threatens clean water safeguards and the federal wetlands permitting
process, which the Trust says &quot;are often critical elements
in the fight against suburban sprawl.&quot;
<P>
In the courts the Trust has also sided with opponents of property
rights. In <I>Dolan v. City of Tigard</I>, an Oregon case, the
U.S. Supreme Court last year ruled, in a significant setback for
land-use controllers, that the City violated the Fifth Amendment's
takings clause in requiring a property owner to turn over a portion
of her property for a bike path as a condition of receiving a
development permit. The Court held that city officials could not
justify commandeering 10 percent of her lot. The Trust filed an
<I>amicus</I> brief in support of the city.
<P>
<B>The First Amendment</B> 
<P>
Attempts to restrict property rights can also raise First Amendment
concerns especially when preservationists set their sights on
local churches. Classifying a church as a historical landmark
raises more than the takings issue; it raises the fundamental
issue of religious freedom enshrined in the First Amendment.
<P>
The Trust and the preservation movement have gone to battle against
churches in a number of cases. Increasingly, they seek to restrict
freedom of religion with historic preservation ordinances that
prohibit the faithful from altering their houses of worship. The
preservationists seem to mistake the purpose of a church. Like
those who attend church for chamber music concerts, preservationists
would protect churches for their aesthetic value or historic significance.
<P>
First Covenant Church in Seattle fought a legal battle with preservationists
in the early 1990s. &quot;The fact is the church isn't a building,&quot;
said Richard Sundholm, First Covenant's chairman, &quot;it is
a congregation.&quot; &quot;The church, as we see it, has a mission,&quot;
he told the <I>Chicago Tribune</I>. &quot;If the mission changes,
and we need to do something different, we are incredibly hampered
because we are a landmark.&quot; The National Trust rejected this
argument and supported city efforts to have the church declared
a landmark. In 1992, the Washington Supreme Court held that Seattle's
actions were unconstitutional.
<P>
Other churches have been less fortunate. St. Bartholomew's Episcopal
Church in Manhattan is perhaps the best known instance of a church
which fought to protect its mission from preservationist encroachment.
The church wanted to tear down its community center and replace
it with an office tower, hoping to use the revenue from the tower
to finance its social service programs for the needy. St. Bartholomew's
argued that by severely limiting its ability to raise money through
development of the property the landmark law had impaired the
church's ability to carry on its ministerial and charitable activities.
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York and the New York Board
of Rabbis filed briefs in support of the church. The National
Trust sided with the city's landmarks commission which won its
case in the federal appeals court in New York.
<P>
The Trust even has the audacity to cite the First Amendment against
those who attempt to exempt churches from landmark controls. In
a 1990 lawsuit, the Trust and the Landmarks Preservation Council
of Illinois charged that an amendment to Chicago's landmark ordinance
violated the First Amendment's establishment clause. The measure
provided that a church could not be declared a landmark without
the consent of its owner, and it was used by the Archdiocese of
Chicago to block landmark designation for St. Mary of the Angels
Catholic Church. The preservationists argued that the amended
ordinance conferred an unconstitutional benefit on religion.
<P>
Similarly, in 1994 the Trust opposed a bill introduced in the
California legislature by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown which
would bar local governments from designating churches as historic
landmarks. The measure had wide support in both houses of the
legislature and was supported by the San Francisco archdioceses.
<P>
James Bovard, author of <I>Lost Rights: The Destruction of American
Liberty</I>, has pointedly observed of landmark laws that, by
forbidding changes in religious architecture, &quot;these ordinances
in effect dictate that people may pray only in government-approved
spaces.&quot;
<P>
The Religious Freedom Act, signed by President Clinton in November
1993, was passed in response to a Supreme Court decision which
was considered by many too restrictive on the practice of religion.
When it was first introduced in Congress the text of the bill
provided that any burden on religious freedom had to be justified
by a &quot;compelling&quot; government interest. But the National
Trust successfully pushed for a change in the legislative language
stating that only a &quot;substantial burden&quot; on religious
freedom requires a compelling government interest. In non-legal
language, this would appear to mean that the state can impinge
on religious freedom as long as the impingement is not substantial.
<P>
It is ironic that the preservationists, in seeking to uphold history,
appear ignorant of a crucial part of early American history. That
is, in their zeal to preserve history (actually symbols of history)
they are willing to trample on the principle of freedom of worship,
which was a driving force behind the settlement of the American
colonies and the founding of the Republic. In the name of history,
preservationists seek to tell churches what they can and cannot
do.
<P>
Writing in <I>National Review</I>, Bovard quips that &quot;If
the historic-preservation movement had been as strong in the tenth
century as it is now, the magnificent Gothic cathedrals of the
Middle Ages might never have been built. The preservationists
would have been outraged at the demolition of eighth century stone-block
churches . . . and would probably have run to the nearest king
for an injunction.&quot;
<P>
<B>Battleground: The Trust versus Disney</B> 
<P>
All this reveals something else about the preservationist cause:
it defends elite privileges. As in the St. Bart's case, preservationists
often fight political and legal battles against local churches,
neighborhood groups, and social service providers. Bovard recounted
a 1993 attempt by the District of Columbia to designate hundreds
of buildings in the Logan Circle neighborhood as historic landmarks.
The effort led the <I>Washington Post</I> to comment that &quot;The
debate over the historic designation has become a fight between
a group of mostly white, affluent residents . . . and a disparate
cast of social service providers and black parishioners.&quot;
To Rev. Beecher Hicks, pastor of Metropolitan Baptist Church,
the supporters of the historic district designation &quot;. .
. have filed this application to prevent such unhistoric activity
as feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, and caring for children
proliferating in our neighborhood.&quot;
<P>
Philosophers and historians have recorded how social and political
elites use the powers of the state to help themselves at others'
expense. What was true in the past applies as well to the contemporary
politics of education, regulation, or affirmative action. And
it is especially apparent in the imposition of public restrictions
on private land use, as in the successful campaign to keep the
Walt Disney Company out of Northern Virginia.
<P>
The National Trust was a leader in the fight to prevent Disney
from building its history theme park in Virginia's Prince William
County. The battle pitted Hollywood activists, academics, and
Washington groups against the Governor of Virginia, the local
elected officials, and the people of Prince William County who
stood to gain from the park's construction.
<P>
In its assault on the Disney project, the Trust argued, in Richard
Moe's words, that the project &quot;would spell disaster for the
countryside.&quot; In an open letter to Disney Chairman Michael
D. Eisner, Moe and Trust Chairman Henry Jordan insisted that the
park would &quot;stand as a superscaled specimen&quot; of urban
sprawl. Historian David McCullough, author of the best-seller
biography of Harry Truman and one of the Trust's point men, called
it a &quot;development blitzkrieg.&quot;
<P>
McCullough, a member of the Trust board, typified its outlook.
In the Trust's bimonthly newspaper, <I>Historic Preservation News</I>,
he warned that development of the Disney project &quot;will swamp
the battlefield; it will all but blot it out . . . It will surround
it with congestion, traffic, parking lots, gas stations, T-shirt
shops, souvenir stores, fast food places, motels, hotels, offices.
Any spell that one feels at the Manassas battlefield as is without
the visual intrusion, not to say the noise, that will come with
this massive development that spell will be gone. It won't be
the same . . . It will be hard to be alone there. It will be impossible
to stand and just listen to the silence.&quot;
<P>
McCullough was prepared to deprive the people of Virginia of jobs
and the benefits of economic growth and deny millions of Washington-area
visitors the theme park's family-oriented entertainment and, yes,
instruction in American history because he wanted to be &quot;alone&quot;
at Manassas, without masses of visitors disturbing the &quot;spell.&quot;
<P>
Of course, the campaign for and against the Disney project had
many ironies, among them the Disney Company's intensive lobbying
to secure state funding for roads and improvements to its proposed
private development. But that the Trust, a group dedicated to
America's past, fought to halt construction of a park focusing
on American history was the greatest irony of all. McCullough
compared Richard Moe's efforts against Disney to General George
C. Marshall's leadership. But Marshall was charged with running
the U.S. Army in World War II and later reconstructing Europe,
not returning it to a state of nature. Virginia Governor George
Allen's quip was more apt: &quot;History is not just for historians.
And it is not just for smug, self-appointed arbiters of culture
and Hollywood movie stars. It is for all our citizens or it should
be.&quot;
<P>
Mindful of their vulnerability to the charge of elitism, the Trust
was careful to argue that the issue was the location of the project,
not Disney's capacity to interpret American history. McCullough
did once refer to the project as &quot;McHistory,&quot; but this
was a mistake he didn't repeat, according to <I>Washingtonian</I>
magazine.
<P>
Perhaps the project would have been &quot;McHistory.&quot; But
not everyone with three kids and a camper can afford to learn
history National Trust-style. &quot;Travel with fewer than 95
passengers aboard the splendid <I>Regina Renaissance</I>,&quot;
says the notice for the Trust's &quot;Red Sea Passage&quot; tour
to Egypt and Jordan.
<P>
<B>Wal-Mart: Public Enemy</B> 
<P>
Partly to refute allegations that it is indifferent to consumer
preferences and to the economic consequences of market forces,
the Trust promotes the economic benefits of historic preservation,
i.e. property values will rise, investment capital will be attracted
and businesses created by different kinds of preservation projects.
Left unsaid is the consequence that some preserved places will
become so costly that they will be commercially inaccessible to
those with modest means.
<P>
Certainly the Trust's recent campaign against Wal-Mart stores
suggests a hostility to consumer preferences. The Trust, headquartered
in the former home of Andrew Mellon on Washington's stately Embassy
Row, rallies opponents of the merchandise discount chain. Wal-Mart
has become the bane of anti-growth groups, labor unions and environmentalists.
Preservation elites believe Wal-Mart is a supreme symptom and
creator of the so-called &quot;sprawl&quot; they loathe. Sprawl
has become the &quot;major issue galvanizing the preservation
movement today,&quot; says the Trust's 1994 annual report.
<P>
In a recent issue of <I>Historic Preservation News</I>, Jonathan
Walters posits that &quot;sprawl-spawning megastores&quot; like
Wal-Mart have become &quot;public enemy number one&quot; in the
battle for the &quot;soul of small-town America.&quot; While Wal-Mart
is the biggest offender, preservationists have also set their
sights on K-Mart, Home Depot, Builder's Square, and price clubs
like Price/Costco and Sam's. The May/June issue of <I>Historic
Preservation News</I> noted approvingly that the Vermont Environmental
Board voted to deny Wal-Mart a permit to build on a field outside
the town of St. Albans.
<P>
Preservationists prefer places where people &quot;. . . can walk
from one destination to another.&quot; The Trust says it does
not oppose Wal-Mart per se, but prefers them to locate in &quot;smaller,
more sensitively designed stores in downtowns. . .&quot; Of course,
that is antithetical to the whole idea behind Wal-Mart: an easily
accessible big store built on cheap land and selling almost everything
at low prices. Wal-Marts and similar stores may not be as quaint
as Georgetown shops but they usually offer consumers more for
less.
<P>
The Trust is coordinating anti-superstore activity and serves
as a national clearinghouse of information for a growing network
of &quot;sprawlbusters.&quot; For $12 members can purchase <I>How
Superstore Sprawl Can Harm Communities (and What Citizens Can
Do About It),</I> a Trust guide for those who want to fight megastores.
<P>
<B>A New History?</B> 
<P>
The Trust's hostility toward Wal-Mart reveals how far it has strayed
from its original mission. The anti-Wal-Mart crusade is less about
preserving history than it is part of a general campaign against
suburban development. In this campaign, historic preservation
functions more as an argument than an objective.
<P>
As the <I>Chicago Tribune</I> noted as far back as 1991, &quot;America's
premier preservationist group has changed its ideas of what is
history and how to preserve it.&quot; When it was chartered by
Congress, the Trust concentrated on buildings and places associated
with great persons and events in early American history. In other
words, what it preserved had to be historical, not merely old.
<P>
Judging by stories in its newspaper, the Trust today seems concerned
with much that is of negligible historical significance and often
not very old:
<UL>
<LI>the Joan of Arc Plaza in New Orleans (erected in 1971), which
includes a 19th century statue of Joan of Arc and two French cannons;
<LI>a vintage McDonald's restaurant in Downey, California;
<LI>the Fair Park's Texas Centennial Building in Dallas built
in 1936;
<LI>a 1940 addition to a Georgia department store built in 1924;
<LI>a 1925 Honolulu bank;
<LI>Detroit's Tiger Stadium.
</UL>

<P>
The Trust newspaper also reports on efforts to save the world's
largest katsup bottle erected in 1949 in Collinsville, Illinois.
And in 1993, the group placed the entire state of Vermont on its
list of &quot;America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places.&quot;
<P>
<B>Joining the Advocacy Chorus</B> 
<P>
The Trust's transformation was apparent from the program of its
1994 annual National Preservation Conference, whose theme was
&quot;Preservation, Economics, &amp; Community Rebirth.&quot;
<P>
One conference session on &quot;Redefining Historic Preservation:
Toward a New Preservation Manifesto&quot; asked the questions:
&quot;Has the field passed its image by? [and] Is it time for
a new definition?&quot; This &quot;advanced&quot; session explored
the idea of &quot;Getting beyond history and aesthetics to a new
paradigm of `human wholeness.'
<P>
The new paradigm consists of the &quot;five Rs&quot; of historic
preservation:
<UL>
<LI>restoring historic buildings, neighborhoods and human lives;
<LI>reweaving the built environment;
<LI>rebuilding authentic community;
<LI>reconstructing the local economy;
<LI>renewing human connections.
</UL>

<P>
The Trust's sympathy with &quot;diversity,&quot; the latest buzzword
in political correctness, was manifest in sessions on &quot;Making
Preservation Happen in Geographically, Politically, and Culturally
Diverse Communities&quot; and in a reception sponsored by the
African-American Landmarks Committee of the Historic Landmarks
Foundation of Indiana, &quot;celebrating cultural diversity in
the preservation movement.&quot;
<P>
Besides workshops and seminars, the event included tour activities.
Some were unavoidably associated with historic preservation, like
a visit to Boston's North End. But there was also an &quot;Eco
Tour&quot; of the Boston Park Plaza hotel enabling participants
to see an &quot;environmentally sound&quot; hotel that integrates
&quot;environmental action into all daily decision making.&quot;
<P>
The Trust had come a long way from preserving the homes of founding
fathers and military heroes.
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B> 
<P>
In view of the well-documented historical illiteracy of Americans
it is certainly worthwhile to protect the physical evidence of
our nation's past. But history is more than its remains. Age alone
and architectural significance give less value to Monticello than
its association with Thomas Jefferson. If preservation policies
violate the principles and ideals of American history including
property rights, the free exercise of religion, and entrepreneurship
then they are too high a price to pay. Preservation cannot be
used by privileged groups to deny others their rights or the benefits
of progress.
<P>
Preservationists must ask themselves whether their pursuit of
the past does violence to the lessons of American history. Congress
must ask whether continued taxpayer support for the National Trust
for Historic Preservation is justified.<P>

<p><blockquote><i>"...if they want to proclaim a truth or propagate some feeling by the encouragement of a great example, they form an association. In every case, at the head of any new undertaking, where in France you would find the government or in England some territorial magnate, in the United States you are sure to find an association. I have come across several types of association in America of which, I confess, I had not previously the slightest conception, and I have often admired the extreme skill they show in proposing a common object for the exertions of very many and in inducing them voluntarily to pursue it."

Alexis de Tocqueville, <br>
<i>Democracy in America</i>
<p>
Greyhound rescue associations are in the finest tradition of American voluntarism. Thanks primarily to their efforts, tens of thousands of racedogs who would have been euthanized once their racing days had ended  now are adopted into loving families.  Not only are ex-racers family companions, they are also used therapeutically to lift the spirits of the sick and elderly in hospitals and nursing homes. 
The spirit that Tocqueville admired in American civil society takes many forms. <i>Philanthropy, Culture & Society</i> is committed to bringing you these stories.

Lucy Salsman is a small grey-haired woman with a warm smile and a New Hampshire accent that is not often heard in central Texas.  The retired nurse answers the door of her two-story suburban house north of Austin in a T-shirt that reads "Adopt a 45 m.p.h. couch potato" and sports a picture of a greyhound asleep on a couch.  At first glance, there's nothing to set Salsman's house apart from her neighbors', unless it's the sign on her gate with a picture of a running greyhound and the words, "I can reach the gate in two seconds.  Can you?" 
<p>Inside, Joshua, a large (waist-high), brindle (sort of tiger-striped) greyhound, who raced in Oklahoma under the name "Get 'em Home Alone," greets me at the door with a desultory sniff.  He's a sleek dog, with bony haunches and a slight limp that comes from some kind of degenerative disease in his hip.  Not finding me particularly interesting, Joshua ambles back to his blanket laid out behind a couch in front of a window.  In the middle of the room is a large pet carrierthe kind used on airplanes.  A dozing brown greyhound wearing a white T-shirt rests inside.  Lucy has had "Nameless" for less than an hour, just time to bathe him and put him in the crate to rest after a long day of travel.  He had been found wandering alongside I-35 near Waco, an hour and a half north of Austin. Because the dog had ear tattoos that marked him as a racing greyhound, a breeder kept him for a few days until the dog could be brought to Austin and placed with Lucy. She provides foster care to retired greyhounds through an organization called Greyhound Pets of America/Austin (GPA/A). 
<p>The Austin chapter, like hundreds of groups across the country, seeks to find adoptive homes for retired racing greyhounds. With the help of cooperating racetracks, breeders and trainers, GPA and other groups have saved thousands of dogsand perhaps the greyhound industry itselffrom almost certain death. 
<p>Greyhounds are beautiful dogs with an ancient pedigree.  Fans of the breed brag that they are pictured in art dating back to ancient Egypt.  During the middle ages, only noblemen could own them.  Though greyhounds were originally used for hunting rabbits and other small game, the dog's speed clocked as fast as 45 mphmade them a natural for racing in England and Ireland.  
<p>In the United States, the dogs have always been working dogs. First used to rid Midwestern farms of pests like jack rabbits, they were eventually turned into professional athletes.  Since 1906, the National Greyhound Association (NGA) has kept a registry of racing greyhounds.  There are about 4,000 owners and breeders who are members of NGA, and only dogs registered by that organization, or similar registries in England, Ireland or Australia, can race in the United States. 
<p>Because dog racing is a $4-billion dollar gambling industry, the dogs have to be closely regulated.  According to the NGA, it is the sixth largest spectator sport in America, attracting 27 million fans to 55 tracks in 18 states.  Within ten days of birth, breeders have to send a description of each puppy, including sex and color, to the NGA in Abilene, Kansas.  At three months, the dogs are "marked up" and tattooed.  During this procedure, each greyhound is examined thoroughly and every distinct marking is sketched on a drawing, right down to its toenail color and spots.  Each dog also is tattooed in both ears.  One ear contains the kennel registration number, and the other the dog's birth month, year, and litter number.  The only number unique to a greyhound is the litter number, which tells in what order the dogs from a particular litter were tattooed. Every greyhound must be marked up and tattooed before he can be registered and raced at a track. Every time a dog races, track officials check his litter number, age, and markings to make sure that the right dog is racing. 
<p>During the 1980s, the greyhound industry grew as state officials, eager to find alternative sources of revenue, looked to various kinds of gambling. In 1994, the industry contributed $226 million in taxes to state and local governments, up from about $30 million in 1974. In addition, each track employs from 500 to 600 people.  But by the 1990s, the bloom was off the racing rose. Competition from other sports, lotteries, and even cable TV, cut into dog racing attendance.  Some smaller tracks and poorly financed breeders went out of business.  
<p>Another threat first appeared in 1984 when the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) began to target greyhound racing.  "We were just unprepared.  We had no way of dealing with it," said Tim Horan, managing editor of Greyhound Review.  "We didn't even have a pamphlet to give out on greyhound welfare." 
<p>The Humane Society claimed that huge numbers of dogs were put to death each yearanywhere from 30,000 to 80,000. The greyhound industry had no reply because it had not kept statistics.  Stories with names like "Race of Death" and "For Blood and Money," appeared in magazines and on TV. Well-publicized scandals concerning criminal breeders leaving malnourished racers to die did not help. It didn't matter that the NGA had, in the most publicized cases, been the whistleblower that called the authorities.  The racing industry suffered as animal rights groups called for the sport's elimination. 
<p>Although the NGA employs an inspector who conducts about 700 inspections of greyhound farms and kennels a year and has the power to ban for life those breeders who are found mistreating their dogsa penalty levied four times in 1994critics like Susan Netboy of the Greyhound Protection League of Palo Alto, California aren't satisfied. "Humane Societies should be working to make greyhound racing illegal," she has said.  "It doesn't matter what kind of legislation you pass, you can't enforce it." 
<p>The industry has taken a two-pronged approach to its public relations: get out accurate information to reporters and government officials, and actively promote greyhound adoption.  In the mid-1980s, small greyhound adoption programs run by animal welfare groups began to emerge, first in Florida and then around the rest of the country. Some breeders made their own agreements with greyhound adoption groups, and some tracks sponsored their own programs. In 1989, for instance, when Wichita Greyhound Park opened in Wichita, Kansas, it initiated an adoption program fully funded by the track.  Any individual who races dogs at that track must sign a contract that the dogs will enter the adoption program when they are through racing, unless they go back to the farm for breeding or race at another track.  
<p>In 1992, such individual efforts were given a major boost by the American Greyhound Council (AGC), a nonprofit entity founded in 1987 by greyhound trainers, owners, and racetracks; it gave a $100,000 grant to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) for a greyhound adoption fund. The donation kicked off a splashy campaign that raised the profile of greyhound adoption.  Its  slogan was, "We're athletes, we're beautiful, we're elegant, and we're yours." The industry continues to support adoption programs financially: it gives $40,000 annually to the ASPCA and also funds a toll-free adoption hotline (see page 6), manned by Greyhound Pets of America, that puts potential families in touch with the greyhound adoption group closest to them. The hotline fielded 42,000 calls in just its second year of operation.  The grant to the ASPCA also gave the greyhound industry and at least some animal welfare groups a chance to play on the same team. As Tim Horan of Greyhound Review puts it: "In the long run the number one goal is to adopt out these greyhounds."

<h3>A Dog's Life</h3>
Because greyhounds have a unique upbringing, adopting one is not like adopting any other dog from the local animal shelter.  Bobby Hibbs has been involved with dog racing in one way or another since the early 1960s.  His father owns  Y Knot greyhound farm just east of Austin, and he and his wife Jeanette own WildCat farm a couple miles away.    When Bobby was a boy he hated the dogs, mostly because they were a lot of work.  He had to help feed them and turn them out before he could go to school or participate in sports.  For nine years he installed elevators for a living, but when his dad asked him if he was interested in coming back to the farm, Bobby said yes.
<p>
<blockquote><b><i><big>The Humane Society claimed that huge numbers of dogs were put to death each yearanywhere from 30,000 to 80,000.  The greyhound industry had no reply because it had not kept statistics.</big></i></b></blockquote>
<p>The road to Wildcat Farm is lined with orange, blue, and yellow wildflowers. At a sharp bend in the road, past the road scraper smoothing out a new layer of yellow road fill, lies the Hibbs' whelping farm.  Here they breed puppies and care for them until they are three months old, when they are moved to the other farm. When I pull into the drive, a yard dog, who has the run of the property, barks angrily until Jeanette puts him in a run.  He seems insulted to be penned up like the greyhoundsand I begin to see the difference between a dog and a greyhound.  Despite the commotion, the greyhounds are silent.  They are not given to the inelegant task of barking.
<p>Right now the Hibbs' have just one litter of eight-month-olds and another litter of puppies that are about six weeks old at the whelping farm.  By greyhound standards the litter is small, only eight dogs, where 12 or 13 is common.  At mid-morning all the dogs are napping, sprawled out contentedly in holes that they have dug in the soft sandy soil.  At this age, the puppies look much like any other puppy.  Jeanette says they won't develop the classic greyhound look, with long legs and snouts, until they are two to three months old. The sandy runs are connected to a well-ventilated indoor pen by a spring door, so the puppies are free to go in and out. 
<p>Though the dogs do not go into training until they are 12 months old, they are given a carefully controlled diet, meant to prepare them for the rigors of racing, from the time they are weaned at about six weeks. Young dogs get fed once a day in the morning with a milky snack at night.  At two months, they move from a mixture of baby cereal and canned dog food to a diet made up of raw meat and dry dog food.  Each dog gets 3 to 3-1/2 pounds of food in the morning, plus a mixture made of milk, puppy chow, and left-over food in the evenings. 
<p>At three months the dogs are moved from the whelping farm over to the Y Knot farm.  There are now about 60 dogs outside and another 16 dogs inside the Y Knot farm.  Outside, the dogs have been fed and are frisky; the weather may have something to do with it.  Thick clouds hang low, threatening rain, and the brisk gusting wind takes the edge off the heat.  As Bobby and Jeanette walk along the runs,  the dogs climb up on the white iron fences eager to have their necks scratched and their backs patted.  Bobby calls some of them by nickname, and tells me about some of their peculiarities.  All  dogs outside are under a year old.  During the first year little is required of them.  Mostly the dogs runand sleep.  They chase after leaves skidding along the ground.  They get into impromptu races with the dogs in the runs next door.   They chase birds and can tear up any animal dumb enough to get into their runs.  
<p>"I've seen stray cats come in there and be destroyed," Jeanette says.  "We had a catMy husband warned my daughter, 'Amanda, I'm telling you. . . .'  'No, Daddy, it won't climb over that fence. . . .'  We had Sonny [the cat] here.  Sonny would walk the fence.  Sonny would go in with the puppies, the little puppies.  And he would be fine.  But one day he climbed in here with dogs about this size (eight months old).  When we got him out he didn't look like a cat anymore. He survived but we had to give him away.  Amanda never asked for a cat again."
<p>But at a year the dogs' lives change.  The dogs, nearly full size at that point, move  into a small air conditioned building furnished with a double deck row of cage-like crates about 2-1/2 feet wide, 3 feet tall, and 3-1/2 feet deep.  Crates like these are home to the racing greyhound until it retires.  When we enter the kennel, it is about 11:00 A.M., and  the dogs are resting.  They sprawl in their crates, some sleeping on their backs on the two layers of carpet that line the floors.  One has pushed his carpet aside so he can feel the cool concrete on his belly. In the background country music plays, and Jeanette says the radio stays on 24 hours a day both at the farm and in the kennel at the track. 
<p>Once the dogs are in training, their lives are subject to a rigid routine. "We turn them out four times a day to get exercise, go to the bathroom, get a drink of water."  The dogs get so accustomed to the routine "they have a time clock inside them that they know to the minute when it is time to turn out," Bobby Hibbs says.  Every turn out is supposed to last 45 minutes, but it is sometimes hard to get the dogs to cooperate.  "Honestly, you put a dog in the kennel, they don't ever want to be outside.  They love the house.  The only time they want to be out is when they run.  Especially in the heatin 10 minutes they're ready to go back in." Male and female dogs are turned out into separate pens, and all the dogs wear muzzles for protection.  Bobby explains that the dogs in training have been taught to go after the sound of a squawking object.  If a dog were to start squealing or whimpering, all the other dogs might turn on it.   
<p>The dogs have to learn several skills before they can go to the track.  They have to learn to be lead by a collar and by a lead. Outside, Bobby Hibbs demonstrates how resistant even a collar-trained dog can be.  The dog, weighing close to 80 pounds, plants both hind legs in the hard packed dirt, moving only grudgingly as Bobby tugs on the collar.  Though running comes naturally, the dogs also have to learn to chase after a lure.  Since it is illegal to use jack rabbits, trainers use a contraption called a Jack-a-Lure made of a mop and noisy squawker.  The dogs first learn to chase the noise, then learn to chase it in a circle, then train on a short track, and finally learn to start from a box.  It is at that point that they are ready to go to the track.  "We call them puppies until they go to the track," Bobby Hibbs says.  "Then they become racers."
<p>So what is a racer?  It is a dog that runs twice a week at speeds over 40 mph around an oval track ranging in length from 5/16 to 9/16 of a mile.  When it isn't racing, it is sleeping.  "They run around a few times and they get to rest for two days.  They're treated like royalty at the track.  Once they get that run in, the time in between, they actually live a lot better than a lot of people do," says Jeanette Hibbs.  Every track employs a veterinarian who examines each dog before every race to make sure it is healthy and fit to run.
<p>If a dog runs well in grade D races, it can move up to C.  And if it does well in C, it'll move up to B and then A, where there is a chance to make some real money for the owner and trainer.  The best dogs run in stake races, with purses of over $100,000.  The biggest purse ever was $130,153 offered in a stake race at the Woodlands in Kansas City, Kansas in 1995.
<p>When a dog's speed begins to fall off by a second or two, it drops from the high grade races to the lower until it is no longer able to compete professionally. That's when the dog gets turned over to a group like GPA/A.  Other dogs that are injured or are no longer able to pass their racing physicals also become eligible for adoption. Most dogs' racing careers last from one to five years.
<p>Turning a racer into a pet isn't always easy. The myths that people believe about greyhoundsthat they're vicious (because they wear muzzles when racing) or high-strungaren't true. But the dogs do have their peculiarities.  Some of them, for  instance, can't be trusted around small animals.  For them the instinct to chase is too strong, and they would never be at home with small dogs or cats.  That's why many groups place the dogs into foster care first, so they can figure out what kind of family would best suit a particular dog.

<h3>Racers Turned Pets</h3>
Liz Sheehan and her husband Kenneth have been greyhound owners for three years.  The young couple live in far northwest Austin, in one of the last subdivisions before the houses end and the prairie begins.  When it comes to the subject of their two greyhounds, Samson, an 80-pound red brindle male, and Hannah, a 55-pound "blue" (actually grey) female, they are passionate.   Liz speaks of the dogs as though they were her children, calling them the "greatest members of our family," and saying "I'm proud of them." 
<p>Although pride seems to be an odd word to use in describing two dogs who loll around the house a good part of the day, Liz talks openly about the changes she's seen them undergo. "Hannah had a wall in front of her. . . .  She didn't like people coming up to her too much.  She was a little afraid.  Anytime you came  too close to her, she would get real scared.  She was real shy in the beginning, but as you can see, she's come out of her shell."  Liz laughs as she adds this last sentence because both Samson and Hannah are aggressively investigating me and my 11-year-old son who is taking pictures.
<blockquote><i><b><big> Despite the commotion, the greyhounds are silent.  They are not given to the inelegant task of barking.  
</big></b></i></blockquote>
<p>"I think probably the best way to describe the transition they make is to say that they come to you as a greyhound,  turn into a dog, and then  into a pet," Liz says.  "These are not the same dogs I got when I first adopted them."  When I ask what that means, Kenneth interjects:  "All they know is a routine.  All of a sudden they don't have a routine anymore, so there is a lot of nervous anxiety.  They don't know what is going on." Samson, the first dog they adopted "did a lot of pacinghe did a lot of investigating.  He had to learn to trust us," Liz says.  After a while "they become more playful. . . .  They start trusting you more. . . ."
<p>
<blockquote><b><i><big>"There's nothing as thrilling...as actually meeting the breeder somewhere and taking the dogs off the trailer.  There was something about it that I had to kind of hold back my tears."
</big></i></b></blockquote>
<p>Training the big dogs to go to the bathroom outside is probably the easiest task since they are already accustomed to keeping their crates clean.  The Sheehans leave their dogs inside without incident for eight or nine hours at a time while they are at work. But some of the other features of daily life in a house can cause trouble.  "Samson had to be introduced to everything in the house.  TVs were a big thing for him. Most of the greyhounds have not seen anything, they've never been in a home.  Linoleumhe used to be afraid of walking on linoleum floors because at one point in time he kind of lost his grip.  Kenneth used to have to carry him . . . with his paws in the air like a little baby."
<p>Racing greyhounds spend most of their time with other dogs.  While they are talked to and handled by their trainers, they don't get the kind of individual attention a house pet would get.  When they retire, they often become the center of their family's pet universe.  So accustomed has Samson become to attention, that he will actually cry when Liz or Kenneth stop petting him.  Greyhounds also can become lonely if they are the only canines in a family.  When bored, the dogs can get into mischief.    The Sheehans have had to "Samson-proof" the house because he likes to chew thingsthe television remote control, a cordless phone, books, and paper.   That's why they adopted Hannah, who like "Nameless" had been abandoned at the side of the road in Waco.  Like "Nameless" her tattoos are illegible, so it is impossible to find out where she came from. 
<p>Although the Sheehans are greyhound owners, they actually volunteered for GPA/A before they adopted Samson.  "I was just fascinated with the dogs and I was fascinated with the idea behind the dogs," Liz said.   "I felt it was a good organizationthat the concept was very good in terms of finding homes for dogs.  I don't know, there was just something about it that kind of tugged at my heartstrings.  I could make a small difference, even if it was placing a few dogs or taking a few dogs myself.  I could make a difference. That's probably what other people feel as well. That's all that matters to me in the organizationplacing the dogs in good homes."
<p>The Sheehans don't have regular contact with the breeders or trainers; that's someone else's job in the organization.  But Liz remembers the first time she accompanied a group to pick up the dogs.  "There's nothing as thrilling . . . as actually meeting the breeder somewhere and taking the dogs off the trailer.  There was something about it that I had to kind of hold back my tears because I looked into their eyes and I saw how afraid they looked and how scared they looked because everything they had known had been taken away from them.  They were so used to their kennels and so used to where they were at, and then when I saw them coming off the truck, it was really a neat feeling knowing that we could make a difference with these dogs and find them great homes." 
<p>And what does GPA/A think about the breeders and trainers they work with? "We've built a relationship with them and it's based on respect and trust.  A lot of them have a really big interest in where their dogs are going, and they've worked with us and know we are going to give the dogs real good homes,"  Liz said. 
<p>GPA/A has placed 500 dogs since 1990 when it was founded.  Last year it placed 81. The organization is partially funded by a $100 adoption fee, which covers the cost of spaying or neutering the dogs, updating their vaccinations, cleaning their teeth, and giving them any other medical attention they need.  One of the chief activities of the organization is spreading the virtues of greyhounds as pets.
<p>Lucy Salsman is one of the dogs' most enthusiastic boosters.    On the day Chuck Hoover, GPA/A's president, brought "Nameless" to her, he also had another recently retired racer that he was delivering to another foster home.  Lucy describes her: "She had a little tiny face, and she was kissing everybodyshe was kissing him and kissing me and kissing Chuck.  She was a real sweetheart." Lucy's speech is peppered with words like "precious" and "sweet" when she talks about her dogs.  One of them was named Daisy.  "Daisy would carry a teddy bear everywhere," Lucy said.  "I'd say to her, 'Daisy, go get your baby, go get your baby and carry it.'  And she'd start in the living room and she'd come around the dining room, and around and around she'd go with that teddy bear." Terry, a white and brindle greyhound, prompts Lucy to say with a laugh:  "We should have just called her Terror, but she was precious."  
<p>It was love for greyhounds in particular and the desire to help them that brought Lucy into fostering.  "I'm really happy I got into fostering because I really love these dogs.  They're great.  I just love to do it so much.  I feel like I'm helping to take care of them. They're just so gentle and so nice, and when they get to be part of the family, they're just great."

<h3>Man's Best Friend and Therapist</h3>
Though most greyhound owners brag about the breed's intelligence, the dogs are not suited for every task.  Since they don't bark and are very gentle and submissive, they do not make good watchdogs.  These qualities have, however, prompted  interest in whether greyhounds could make good therapy dogs, ones that work with emotionally and physically disabled people.   Daisy, the dog with the teddy bear, now spends every day in a nursing home where her new owner works.  She visits with the patients until she's had enough, and then goes back to the office where she can be alone. 
<p>The Wesley Rehabilitation Hospital in Wichita, Kansas has two greyhounds that regularly work there.  Meagin is a certified assistance animal.  She has gone through rigorous training and testing so that she has become the arms, so to speak, for her master who is disabled and unable to carry more than five pounds. In addition to that work, she and another younger greyhound, Flo Jo, serve as therapy dogs in the rehabilitation hospital.  According to Linda Mansfield, Director of Clinical Services, Meagin and Flo Jo help stimulate brain-injured patients and motivate those who are beginning a painful course of therapy.  She says sometimes a patient will talk to a dog more readily than to a therapist.  "When people are just starting to recover, they relate better to the dogs,"  Mansfield said.  In her opinion, the dogs are actually performing tasks in the hospital that people could not accomplish.  At this point, the Wesley Rehabilitation Hospital is the only rehab hospital she knows of that uses greyhounds as therapy dogs.  But Mansfield has received inquiries from across the country.  She thinks the dogs' docile nature, especially among older patients, ideally suits them to the task.
<p>Wherever greyhounds go, they get noticed.  In Austin, Ralf and Camille Lukner adopted two retired racers because "we like to rollerblade.  There aren't many dogs that can go that fast."  Since greyhounds are sprinters, though, they don't always make the best running companions, and it turned out that only one of the Lukner's dogs likes to run distances.  Whenever they go skating with the dogs, they attract a lot of attention from other skaters and runners.  People may be cautious because of the dog's sizea male can weigh up to 80 pounds, and a female, 60 pounds, but they all want to know what kind of dog it is.
<p>Lucy Salsman and her husband Frances received similar attention when they traveled with greyhound Joshua to New Hampshire.  At many of the motels, those walking smaller dogs would want to keep away from Joshua, but they also were curious about him.  Many had never seen a greyhound before and others wanted to know how they could adopt.
<p>It is a lot easier to adopt a greyhound now than it used to be.  More and more tracks are running their own programs.  Shoreline Star racetrack in Bridgeport, Connecticut opened its own track-funded program last November, placed its first dog in December, 1995 and by May, 1996 had placed 60 dogs directly and given 12 to 14 others to various adoption groups.  The American Greyhound Council has a web page on the internet, and there are web pages devoted to many other greyhound adoption groups.  By calling the American Greyhound Council's toll-free number, even people in states without racing can get in touch with adoption programs. 
<p>Greyhound adoption has also successfully reduced the number of dogs euthanized, according to industry statistics.  In 1992, 49,000 greyhounds were born, 9,000 were adopted, and 23,000 were euthanized.  In 1993, 43,000 greyhounds were born, 13,000 adopted, and 16,000 euthanized. In 1994, 42,000 were born, 14,000 adopted, and 15,000 euthanized.  Last year, 16,000 were adopted and 12,000 were euthanized.  The trend over the past four years has been for breeders to raise fewer dogs and adopt out more. 
<p>
<blockquote><i><b><big> Meagin and Flo Jo help stimulate brain-injured patients and motivate those who are beginning a painful course of therapy.  She says sometimes a patient will talk to a dog more readily than to a therapist.
</big></b></i></blockquote>
<p>Has the greyhound industry been able to convert its enemies into friends? The Humane Society of the United States still wants to shut the industry down.  Campaign 2000 is an effort to ban racing in every state.  So far, it has been successful in getting greyhound activity, including AKC coursing events, banned in some states where there are no racetracks and no organized opposition. Jacque Schultz, administrator of the Greyhound Adoption Fund for the ASPCA, would also like to shut the industry down, even though her organization benefits from its generosity.  "If I could make greyhound racing shut down tomorrow, I would," she said. But Tim Horan points out, the worst thing for the dogs would be to shut down 52 racetracks.  "Immediately, you'd have [approximately] 150,000 dogsthere would be mass graves.  There aren't enough people to adopt them all." 
<p>The dog racing industry and its critics have agreed upon greyhound adoption, but for somewhat different reasons.  The industry promotes it because it is good for business and the "right thing to do."  Some animal rights advocates support it because they believe they are rescuing animals from an inhumane lifestyle.  Though critics might want ultimately to shut the tracks down, for now the two sides can agree:  Greyhound adoption works and supporting it has been good for the industry, good for the dogs, and good for families that love the dogs.

<b><i>What Health Crisis?</i>

<p>Jessica was helping her mother hang clothes in the muggy August heat, doing her best to reach the line strung between a hulking pine tree and the old baby-blue house. The Jacksons lived there nearly rent-free, a godsend for the family since father Charles was a seminary student at Jackson, Mississippi's Reformed Theological Seminary. As a home-schooler Jessica pitched in to help around the house as much as possible, but now she needed some help of her own. The clothesline was barely out of reach of her 10-year-old arms. She canvassed the back yard and spied a small plastic play slide, a perfect makeshift stool, she thought. But just after  positioning herself  under the line, the toy slid out from under Jessica's feet. She fell awkwardly on her elbow, sending a sharp pain through her whole arm.
<p>"We heard this shrill scream that we thought was a dog," recalls Jessica's mother, Connie, 36. "Then we looked outside and saw that it was Jessica."
<p>The Jacksons were frantic. 
<p>They put ice on their child's arm. But time and cold compresses did not lessen the pain or inflammation. Finally, they decided to take Jessica to the nearby Baptist Medical Center. The drive was a tense one. Besides worrying for their daughter's welfare, another thought  ran through both Connie and Charles's minds, one not too far from many parents during such times as this: Will our insurance pay?
<p>

<blockquote><big><i>Joe Maxwell is national editor of World magazine. He lives in Madison, Mississippi, with his wife and three boys.  </i></big></blockquote>
<p>
<p>These days, more and more people share a similar storyworrying not only for the welfare of an injured or sick family member, but for the willingness of their health insurer to honor its contract and cover the claim. Moreover, many families today still don't even have medical insurance, making the ride to the hospital even more unnerving. 
<p>More than 40 million Americans lack health insurance, according to 1993 census figures; many of these have jobs that do not offer health coverage; 12 million children like Jessica are not covered, and many don't qualify for Medicaid due to their parents' salary level.
<p>The problem is often twofold: First, there is the growing cost of treatment: In 1972 the per-capita medical expenditure for the average American was $387; that figure jumped to $3,294 by 1993; by the turn of the century, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimates that number will be at $5,712. Health expenditures nationwide jumped from 7.7 percent of the GNP in 1972 to 13.9 percent in 1993 with projections of 16.4 percent, or $1.6 trillion, by the end of the decade.
<p>A second problem is the lack of portability of health insurance coverage, the vast majority of which is provided to Americans not on an individual basis, but through an employer's plan. Congress has been debating new bills to alleviate skyrocketing premiums and lack of portability. A bill passed 100 to 0 in the Senate and sponsored by Senators Kassebaum and Kennedy seeks to address the problem by creating new federal standards and programs. Yet it is highly questionable whether the plan is desirable: the Senate bill will add to the federal bureaucracy, and it  threatens to force the existing insurance industry to raise premiums to offset the costs of covering those who would have been previously rejected as bad risks.
<p>But there is an exciting option, one that predates the modern health insurance industry but which promises to expand dramatically in the years ahead. These are the growing number of Christian cost-sharing groups in which thousands of people join together to meet not only financial, but also spiritual and emotional burdens.

<p>The digital clock reads 3:45 a.m. and the alarm rings in Joel  Smith's bedroom. He and his wife live a comfortable life in a spacious, modern log-cabin home situated on a forested hill by a fish-stocked lake in north Mississippi. 53-year-old Joel managed a massive manufactured home plant in Lexington, Mississippi for years before moving into the insurance business as a state representative for John Hancock Life Insurance in the early 1980s. For more than a decade now, he has sold life insuranceand health insuranceto scores of Mississippians who trust him for more than just his good business sense. They rely on Joel because he is a licensed minister in the Church of God in Cleveland, Tennessee and the lay-pastor of a rural church of 300 that meets in an attractive prefab log cabin building just down the road from Smith's home.
<p>Each morning, as a ceiling fan whizzes overhead in the dark, the Smiths nudge each other out of bed and onto their knees. On the nightstand next to their king-size bed sits a Bible and Joel's reading glasses. Next to that is a magazine article titled, "The Precious Blood of Jesus," and a digital clock/phone radio.
<p>Their morning routine includes a call to 1-800-PSALM 33 to get a recording of the most urgent requests from their fellow cost-sharing members. The couple is soon deep into prayer for people they've never met but with whom they share a common bond and commitment. The Smiths are spending an early Friday morning praying for the members of their Christian health care group who have suffered sickness or injury requiring them to file claims. The members of the Melbourne Florida-based Christian Care Medi-Share Program to which the Smiths belong conduct a 24-hour prayer chain, seven days a week for those participants facing needs. More importantly, people involved in the program also write each month to other group members with  needs.
<p>"The whole thing to me is based on life-style," says Joel, as he  sits with his legs crossed in the foyer of his church, a Bible on one side of the table in front of him, a calendar listing his insurance sales calls on the other. "It's incumbent on every member to be responsible and honest."
<p>Responsibility and honesty, says Joel, are too often lacking in how individuals treat their conventional health insurance plans today. By contrast, the Smith's Christian Care Medi-Share program emphasizes conscientious self-monitoring. Moreover, it offers members 100 percent coverage for less each month than most conventional group insurancea little less than  $200 per family.
<p>Over the last half-decade, several Christian cost-sharing groups resembling the Christian Care Medi-Share group have sprung up. They include: Samaritan Ministries in Greenfield, Indiana; the Christian Brotherhood Newsletter in Barberton, Ohio; All Saints in Tyler, Texas; and Helping Hands in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. 
<p>While specifics vary from group to group, these Christian cost-sharing groups all share a basic philosophy summarized  in Galatians 6:2: "Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ." Without exception, these are groups of Christians banded together  to care for one another.
<p>"In our nation's past, our forefathers were quite familiar with bearing one another's burdens," states a brochure published by one cost-sharing group, Samaritan Ministries. "Today, our mentality is far from that of our ancestors. We still have the mandate to bear one another's burdens, but we hardly know what that means anymore. If our barn burns down or an emergency medical problem arises, the insurance company takes care of it and our friends, relatives and neighbors have little participation in restoring us to our former state. We don't need each other in the way we used to. We're not knocking insurance companieswe're merely saying there is a better way for Christians who desire to minister to the body of Christ while  providing for their own medical needs and being thrifty with their money."
<p>The Smiths' membership in the Florida-based Christian Care Medi-Share Program resembles other Christian care groups in its operation:
<ul>
<li>Potential members are screened to validate a sincere Christian commitment; some groups accomplish this by requiring membership in a local church and attendance at least three out of every four Sundays; others simply interview an applicant's pastor to verify the person's faith in Christ.
<li>Once accepted, a member enjoys coverage usually equal to or exceeding that offered by most conventional employer-provided plans. 
<li>The Christian Care Medi-Share plan is as follows:  After a $250 deductible, 100 percent coverage is provided up to $1 million at a monthly cost of $85 per member, $150 for two persons, and $195 per family of three or more. Eight-five percent of a monthly family membership fee of $195 goes to pay the medical bills of another member that month, 6 percent is used for processing needs/claims, and 9 percent is used for administrative costs and disease prevention education. 
<li>Every Christian care ministry stipulates that membership is contingent upon living a healthy life-style. This means not smoking, not using illegal drugs, and not engaging in sex outside of marriage. Several groups, including the largestChristian Brotherhood Newsletterprohibit any drinking, while others including the Christian Care Medi-Share Program permit it in moderation. 
<p>These ministries point to widely published statistics indicating that up to 80 percent of all diseases result from the consequences of life-style choices. The American Medical Association estimates that up to 40 percent of all hospital patients are treated for problems resulting from alcoholism; the U.S. Department of Heath and Human Services in 1993 reported that $188 billion is spent each year on health care resulting from unhealthy life-styles leading to high rates of cancer, accidents, AIDS and heart disease. 
<p>Such figures account for many of the hefty increases in conventional health insurance premiums in recent years. Proponents of Christian cost-sharing ministries say they shouldn't have to support the destructive life-styles of others with their premium dollars. 
<p>Says John Reinhold, president of the Christian Care Medi-Share (CCMS): "Our members believe in sharing and caring, but they do not wish to subsidize those . . . who choose to live in a way which inevitably leads to a premature breakdown in mind and body, i.e. using tobacco, abusing chemicals and toxic substances, taking drugs, gluttony."
<p>Christian cost-sharing groups encourage self-regulation by their members.  Christian care groups rely on individual members to screen their medical bills for excess and mistaken charges, a practice often indirectly discouraged by conventional health insurance plansgovernment or privatewhere participants take the attitude of "getting back from the system everything they have paid in over the years."
<p>When a member incurs a needwhich conventional insurance would call a claimhe reports it to his cost-sharing group's national office. Some, like the Christian Brotherhood Newsletter, "publish" the needs of their members in a monthly newsletter, assigning each member a specific person to pray for and to receive his monthly support check. Each member then mails a monthly membership fee directly to the member whose need they've been assigned, along with a card or letter of encouragement.  Other groups including CCMS let members send their monthly dues to the main office, which then redistributes the resources to those particular members with needs. Members receive a note about the specific person and need to whom their monthly dues are applied, and they are encouraged to write and pray for their recovery.

<p>
Dear Miss/Mrs. Gillespie,
<p>My name is Abby Van Ness. I am 10 years old. I will be 11 on June 24th. My family is supporting you this month. I hope that you recover soon from the automobile accident. It must be very painful and I don't think I would like it if I were in the situation that you are in now. I am praying for you and the Lord is watching over you. Now, I'll tell you a little bit more about myself. My father is the pastor of First Presbyterian Church in Lexington, Mississippi. My mother is an Ocupational (sic) Therapist. She works at

Heritage Manor in Greenwood, Mississippi. She works NORMALLY (emphasis is original) two days a week. But that's about to change. I have two sisters and one baby brother. His name is Peter. (Besides his nicknames, middle name, and last name.) My oldest younger sister is named Kate. (Her full name is Mollie Kate Van Ness.) My other sister's name is Sarah. (HER full name is Sarah Rose Van Ness.) Peter is only one so he's not old enough to have any hobbies. Kate loves to sing. She is 7 years old. Sarah is 4 years old and is at an acting silly age. My hobbies are: Reading, Swimming, and acting. I think that one of them later might be: Running Track. I can run half a mile in about four minutes and 37 seconds! I'm going to run a race against my aunt. She's very athletic. She says an eight minute mile is good. Well, hope you enjoyed reading this letter!

<p>No conventional health insurance provider could offer this kind of personal service. Abby's mother, Jody, smiles as she discusses her belief in the Christian cost-sharing concept; she is conservative-to-the-core, and she likes playing an active role in her health coverage, both spiritual and financially. An occupational therapist in the Mississippi Delta, Jody says she regularly sees how medical groups routinely overcharge insurance companies for their services. "I am overpaid, by far," she says.
<p>By contrast, Jody's cost-sharing group asks her to be wise in how she files needs/claims, and to scrutinize her medical bills for errors or overcharges. The fact that she and other members of her Christian cost-sharing group have an active claim in the financial interest of their organization is a strong incentive for each member to work to keep costs down. "I see the waste when health coverage is done with other people's money," she says, sitting outside her Lexington, Mississippi, house, watching one of her girls climb an old magnolia tree. A mongrel squirrel dog named Charlie rests nearby in the cool dirt. "I believe that I know enough to spend enough to take care of my children wisely."
<p>In this sense, health insurance has always boiled down to this philosophical questionwho can best care for prioritizing an individual's health needsthe individual, or an impersonal company or government agency? 
<p>
<a name="care"></a>
<h3>Taking Care of One Another</h3>
<p>Some form of health insurance has been in existence for centuries. The ancient Chinese were thought to pay their local doctor during times of health so that he would care for them during times of sickness. Ancient Greeks had benevolent societies in which members pooled resources for medical care; Rome adopted the practice. Early Christian records indicate church members cared for each other physically and financially, as well as spiritually. And in medieval Europe, members of trade guilds foreshadowed employer group insurance, caring for each others' needs during times of sickness. 
<p>Health insurance in its modern form, however, is a relatively new phenomenon, developing long after American companies were offering marine, fire, and life insurance to customers. 
<p>Modern insurance in the United States began when individuals "wrote their names under" an agreementthus the term, "underwriter"promising to pay a certain sum if a ship met with disaster on the ocean. In exchange, they gained an interest in the potential profits the ship's cargo might bring. A mariner would get numerous underwriters to help absorb risks, which soon became actuarially calculable. 
<p>With time and growing expertise in the mathematics of calculating risk and statistical odds, groups of people organized to insure not only the risks of marine travel, but also risk of the destruction of businesses and neighborhoods by fire. The Friendly Society for the Mutual Insuring of Houses Against Fire was created by a royal charter in 1735 in Charleston, South Carolina. Benjamin Franklin founded the Philadelphia Contributorship for the Insurance of Houses from Loss by Fire, in 1752. And by 1759, the Presbyterian Synod of Philadelphia banded together to form the country's first life insurance corporation, which still exists today as the Presbyterian Ministers' Fund. 
<p>When it came to health and accident insurance, however, there was little movement for decades. In the days of primitive medical knowledge and skill, people remained well-served by neighborly care and generosity; hospitalization and the rampant rise in costs of medicine and services were a thing of the future. The first medical insurancea sickness policyappears to have been offered by the Massachusetts Health Insurance Company in 1847 in Boston. The policy covered treatment of that day's major infirmities. The first accident policy was apparently offered by the Travelers Insurance Company to James Bolter.  For $5000 it insured his walk home from the post office. Bolter's monthly premium? Two cents. Fraternal Benefit Societies became the first real purveyors of group health coverage: the Ancient Order of United Workmen, founded in 1868,  is generally credited with being the nation's first fraternal insurance company. Other groups followed, including the Sons of Norway in 1895, the Aid Association for Lutherans in 1899, and the Catholic Knights of Columbus Insurance Society.
<p>By the advent of this century, nearly 50 companies sold accident policies, since accidents were actuarially predictable. Sickness, on the other hand, was notstatistics were still sketchyand companies steered clear of offering sickness policies. With the onset of the Great Depression, however, hospitals and doctors found themselves treating hundreds of patients who had lost their capacity to pay for health services. The medical community responded by creating the nonprofit Blue Cross, offered by hospitals, and Blue Shield, offered by physicians. The first such group is traceable to a schoolteachers' organization in Dallas that worked with Baylor University to arrange for monthly prepayments for future hospital and physician care. 
<p>Private, for-profit insurance companies took note. Until then, they offered only life, fire, and marine insurance, along with crop and other casualty policies. But with the growing progress in statistical calculation, and the budding success of group health plans like Blue Cross/Blue Shield, commercial companies began seeing the profit to be made in insuring health as well. Moreover, with the advent of the two world wars, big employers began to offer what is now considered commonplace: group policies for their employees.
<p>Such group plans allowed for maximum purchasing and insuring power at the minimum cost. Companies offered group policies in part because skilled labor was scarce in war times and competition for good workers was high; offering group coverage was a means to recruit the best workers. Group plans also offered a nice tax deduction at a time when American corporations were facing ever-growing tax burdens. Moreover, the Supreme Court ruled just after WW II that health insurance was a legitimate bargaining chip in labor-management negotiations.

<h3>A New Way of Thinking</h3>
Whether private or public, for-profit or not-for-profit, group health insurance was becoming a fixture in the United States. And it didn't take long for Americans to develop a whole new attitude toward caring for their health needs. They dropped their long-held reliance on neighbors, church, and the kindness of local doctors in favor of coverage by impersonal insurance plans. By 1940, the nonprofit Blue Cross/Blue Shield in America estimated that it had 4 million clients, compared to 1.2 million using commercial health insurance services. But by 1951, the situation was reversed, and the commercial companies surpassed the nonprofit Blue Cross/Blue Shield groups in number. As of 1950, 77 million people had some form of hospitalization coverage.
<p>Since WW II, commercial health insurance, along with the government's own insurance plansMedicaid and Medicarehave grown rapidly and adapted to the needs of the market. Hospitalization plans expanded first: by 1970, about 70 percent of all private expenses for hospital care and more than 40 percent of all doctors' expenses were covered by voluntary insurance. Soon, "major medical" policies were created by commercial companies to insure individuals for a maximum amount of coverage minus a preset deductible. 
<p>Another trend has developed: some companies are now self-insuring, offering their own employees coverage instead of purchasing it from an outside company. Often companies who self-insure cite actuarial figures for their employee base showing less health risk than the average American. These companies therefore conclude they shouldn't have to pay higher rates to subsidize the unhealthy life-styles of an insurer's other clients. That, they say, is just good business. Only a half-century ago health insurance plans were considered a luxury. Now they are touted by some as a fundamental "right."

<h3>Alternative Life-styles</h3>
John Reinhold enjoyed a long, successful career as a businessman and charity fund-raiser before founding the Christian Care Medi-Share in 1992. He and well-known Christian financial counselor and author Larry Burkett headed up the Great Commission Foundation for Campus Crusade for Christ that sought to raise $1 billion for the organization. With time, Reinhold began contributing his talents to the Christian Brotherhood Newsletter, recruiting new members in the Florida area. Then he and a group of Christians launched their own cost-sharing group, the Christian Care Medi-Share group, styled along the same lines as CBN but with some minor adjustments.
<p>Ironically one day a CCMS ministry executive approached Reinhold. "[He] informed me that my weight made me ineligible for our ministry of sharing," recalls Reinhold. "You see, we have thousands of members who share each other's medical bills, and there are certain restrictions voted by the members so that we are in compliance with biblical life-styles. So here I was, one of the key players who formalized the sharing program, exempted from the ministry sharing."
<p>
<blockquote><b><i><big>Most of the Christian cost-sharing groups encourage healthy living, but don't cram it down members' throats. </big></i></b></blockquote>
<p>Since then Reinhold has taken stock of his own nutritional needs. He's lost more than 70 pounds, enabling him to go off of prescription drugs and relieving his problems with arthritis and his heart condition. Today, Reinhold, along with several medically trained CCMS members, writes a column in the quarterly Christian Care Medi-Share's newsletter on improving members' nutrition and living healthier life-styles.  Helping One Another offers health quizzes and reviews books on the effects of over-eating and using caffeine.
<p>Most of the Christian cost-sharing groups encourage healthy living, but don't cram it down members' throats. Says Reinhold, "There are some basic things that we can do to make positive changes in our lives to better serve our Lord as well as assist in holding our monthly costs in line."
<p>Reinhold points to figures showing that those living and eating according to biblical ideals live longer and better. For instance,  Reinhold asserts, Seventh-Day Adventists live an average of seven to nine years longer than other evangelicals, due mostly to observing nutrition tips from the Old Testament forbidding eating pork. Fifty percent or more of Adventists are lacto-vegetarians, as well. Life-style, life-style, life-style forms the heart of Christian cost-sharing ministries' success and attraction.
<p>Several years ago, Christian journalist and author Ken Walker began lamenting the fact that his dollars were going to support the unbiblical life-styles of others. When his wife left her job to work in a ministry, the couple was left without health insurance, so Walker began investigating available major medical plans. One insurer's representative casually lamented that her insurance company would not subsidize her birth control pills, "but they will pay for my abortion."
<p>"Those words cut into me like a knife," recalls Walker. "I realized this company wasn't unique; most health insurance plans follow these and other ill-advised policies. I didn't want to participate and, no matter how indirectly, subsidize such practices."
<p>After contact with Larry Burkett's staff,  Walker looked into the Christian Brotherhood Newsletter. He was pleased with what he found. The group did not offer coverage for abortion or unwed pregnancies. Moreover, the Walkers liked the fact that their monthly checks were sent directly to another member who had a "published" need, putting the Walkers directly in contact every month with another Brotherhood member both financially and in prayer. 
<p>This philosophy of mutual care and concern is based in Christian teaching as old as the institutional church itself. And while Reinhold and several other groups have modified the idea first set forth by the Illinois-based Christian Brotherhood Newsletter, CBN remains the largest cost-sharing group, with 80,000 members. CBN founder Bruce Hawthorne started his program after experiencing the concept of Christian care in his own life. Hawthorne's 16-year-old daughter died in a car wreck, then three medical emergencies involved his other children, and finally Hawthorne's wife and another daughter died accidentally the next year. Hawthorne, who at the time worked at the Barberton, Ohio Rescue Mission, was left with $54,000 in hospital bills, and could only seek the aid of local believers. He mailed a request for material help to each of the 13,000 people listed on the rescue mission's mailing list. Forty-five days later, he'd accumulated enough money to offset his bills. 
<p>"When I should have been at the very bottom emotionally, I was experiencing spiritual and emotional elation," he said in an October 1995 article in Sound Mind Investing. "I realized that there was a need for [this] if for no other reason, for the support that one needs while going through a tragedy."

<h3>In Good Hands</h3>
The most important question for insurance consumers is this: Will the policy pay? That's what ran through Charles and Connie Jackson's minds as they drove their little girl, Jessica, to the hospital to repair her broken elbow. When they arrived at the emergency room, an attendant asked Charles to provide some health history on Jessica. Charles sat  nervously waiting as the clerk requested proof of his health coverage.  He pulled out his wallet and handed the clerk an attractive plastic card provided by his cost-sharing ministryThe Christian Care Medi-Share Association.
<p>"It just looks like any other insurance care," Charles recalls. "They just took it and Xeroxed it."
<p>Charles thought for a moment that he might offer an explanation concerning the group's novel approach, but decided against it. He realized the clerk showed no signs of skepticism. She was processing his claim like any other. "She didn't ask, so I didn't offer," says Charles.
<p>Charles' cost-sharing ministry boasts that, "to-date, no member has ever been refused treatment by any medical entity." In some instances, members have routed questions from their medical provider to the group's home office via a toll-free number. In every case the medical provider's concern was addressed: Will this coverage pay? Numerous state insurance regulators have challenged the concept of Christian cost-sharing ministries, but without success. Eight states have actually passed laws exempting cost-sharing groups from insurance regulation. In Florida, such groups are regulated under charitable solicitation laws.
<p>Jessica Jackson's  parents paid the first $250 of her medical bill as a deductible, and then the Christian Care Medi-Share group picked up about another $700 in expenses. The couple says they are now convinced not only of the biblical-basis for cost-sharing but of its practicality as well
<p>There is one other benefit. For every thousand families who join the Jackson's group, Christian Care Medi-Share, at least $2 million of their after-tax income is kept out of the current "health-care machine," notes CCMS membership chairman Robert Dixon.  He adds, "Those who join are grateful that behind us is a multi-million dollar 'safety-net' and beneath us are the everlasting arms."

<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Orphanage!  The word connotes bleakness;  Charles Dickens' British
vision has become our own, with some Faulkneresque grotesque added
in. Here Dr. Olasky argues that the conventional history of American
orphanages is a tale of sound and fury directed against the helpless,
with the absence of close government oversight leading to unmitigated
child abuse.  The real story, however, is richer; it shows how
good orphanages combatted both material and spiritual poverty
among children who would otherwise have been the truly wretched
of the earth. According to Olasky our bias toward accentuating
the negative in the history of orphanages has often led us to
eliminate the positive.</i>
<P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;The first orphanage in what is now the United States opened
in 1729 in New Orleans.  The second, the Bethesda Orphan House,
emerged in Georgia a dozen years later through the ardent fund-raising
of famed evangelist George Whitefield.  Such early efforts were
rare; not until the nineteenth century did homes specifically
devoted to orphaned or abandoned children become common in a land
where families were big and extra water for an orphan was often
thrown into the soup.     In the colonial era small children without
parents were taken in by relatives or cared for informally by
neighbors; older children were indentured to a master who would
teach them a trade. Apprenticeship bore no stigma since it was
common to send a child at 13 or so into another person's home
for training or education; all who had hands capable of work were
expected to use them at an early age.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;   The growth of towns and the disruption that the Revolutionary
War created  led to a more structured approach toward orphans
by the end of the century.  The British seizure of Charleston,
S.C., in 1780 destroyed not only buildings but families so that
when the tide of independence after Yorktown washed out the occupying
forces some orphans remained. The Charleston city council appointed
commissioners to gather up parentless children and lodge them
in private homes, with the government paying for room and board.
 &nbsp;&nbsp; A few years later the commissioners appealed to the public for
contributions to build an orphanage, and-according to a mid-nineteenth-century
 account-&quot;all classes of citizens vied with each other in
the grateful work of contributions in money, labor, material and
services.&quot;    The Charleston orphanage was completed in 1794
and occupied by 115 children. 
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; By 1800 there were five or seven orphanages in the United States;
sources vary as to the exact number.   Local governments promoted
the efforts by urging citizens to contribute to them, with members
of legislatures sometimes offering part of their salaries.  Typically,
a &quot;society of citizens&quot; would take the initiative; in
New York City, the New York Orphan Asylum Society in 1806 rented
a two-story frame house in Greenwich Village, hired a &quot;pious
and respectable man and his wife&quot; as superintendent and matron,
and mandated that &quot;The orphans shall be educated, fed and
clothed at the expense of the Society and at the Asylum.  They
must have religious instruction, moral example, and habits of
industry inculcated on their minds.&quot;  The &quot;Asylum&quot;-in
those days the word meant merely a place of security-opened with
twelve orphans in 1806, and soon expanded into a facility housing
200 orphans.
<P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Orphanages during those years shortly after passage of the first
amendment were religiously motivated; concerns about separation
of church and state voiced privately by Thomas Jefferson were
not in public evidence.  The Charleston city council in 1801 proposed
a contributions drive to erect a building for religious services
on orphanage land, with provision that the building &quot;be open
to the clergy of all denominations.&quot;  
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; After a few years the New York Orphan Asylum Society received
a state subsidy for its care of orphans, but the emphasis on religious
instruction remained.  Americans understood in the nineteenth
century that government was not to establish any particular denomination
as a state church, but that government should not try to banish
God. 
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The number of orphanages grew throughout the first half of the
nineteenth century largely in connection with an outpouring of
evangelical benevolence, with women often in the forefront.  Petersburg,
Virginia females petitioned the legislature in 1812 for authorization
to set up an orphan asylum, for they were &quot;deeply impressed
with the forlorn and helpless situation of poor orphan female
children... and wish to snatch [them] from ignorance and ruin.&quot;

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Every epidemic, such as the cholera disaster of 1832, created
orphans and new orphanage efforts; by 1850 there were between
71 and 77.  Individual and church contributions paid most of the
cost, but it was not unusual to have municipalities pay up to
a third, and for expenses to be held down through some work by
the orphans themselves; boys learned manual skills while making
repairs and girls under the instruction of a sewing teacher often
made clothes for all the residents. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  By mid-century orphanages often were impressive buildings; the
orphan house in Charleston, after undergoing remodeling and enlargement
from 1853 to 1855, contained a spacious five stories.  The first
floor contained three dining rooms, three play rooms, and ten
other rooms, including a kitchen, pantry, and laundry room.  The
second story included classrooms, parlor and reception rooms,
and other rooms for sewing and office space.  Three upper stories
were largely bedroom space, with steam heat throughout.  Architects
reported that the building contained 2,355,000 bricks, 222 doors,
298 windows, and 39,000 feet of piping. 
<P>
<a name="net"><B>A Massive Network</B></a>
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The Civil War greatly expanded demand for orphanages, and the
supply skyrocketed to over 600 by 1880.  Character as well as
quantity changed however; early in the century a &quot;half-orphan&quot;
was supposed to live with a surviving parent, but in the late
1800s children of destitute single parents increasingly found
their way to orphanages.  The Protestant monopoly also disappeared
as Catholic and Jewish child care institutions proliferated. 
The New York Catholic Protectory, established in 1862, became
the largest children's institution in the United States.  Jewish
organizations dated from shortly before the war-both the Jewish
Foster Home of Philadelphia and the Association for the Relief
of Jewish Widows and Orphans on New Orleans were founded in 1855.
But deaths and massive immigration led to a huge network of institutions
that reached its peak between 1880 and 1920.  Most orphanages
were segregated by race, with institutions such as the Colored
Orphan Asylum in New York City becoming prominent. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The most comprehensive report about orphanages during this period
grew out of investigations by William P. Letchworth, commissioner
of the New York State Board of Charities in 1875.  Letchworth
visited some 130 institutions for children and came away with
positive impressions concerning nutritious food, safe living conditions,
and factors such as &quot;a high standard of personal cleanliness.&quot;
  Letchworth also emphasized religious and moral training, which
he thought a matter for the public interest because good citizenship
arose only when a child learned his &quot;obligations to the Deity&quot;
and was &quot;taught the importance of living an upright life.&quot;
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Letchworth's 470 pages of detailed notes on his site visits
to the institutions throughout the state are valuable not only
for his physical descriptions but for his reporting  of how orphanage
managers saw their work. He quoted Mrs. Helen Mercy Woods,  the
 very trustworthy matron of the Onondaga County Orphan Asylum
in Syracuse, as explaining (contrary to our current stereotypes),
&quot;I do not believe in shutting children up, frightening them
or making them go without their meals.... I try to impress upon
them, especially upon the boys, that it is not what people do
for them that is going to avail, but what they do for themselves.
&nbsp;&nbsp; I endeavor to convince the boys that they can be any thing they
please if they will only try for it.  I do not see why they should
not fill positions of respectability as well as others.&quot;

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Orphanage directors during the second half of the nineteenth
century saw their mission as not merely furnishing basic material
needs but creating model American citizens-particularly when they
dealt with children of immigrants.  They tried to instill virtues
such as thrift, self-reliance, and sobriety, and to create a capacity
for hard work; they believed in busy daily routines and strict
discipline. 
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The morning schedule at the Philadelphia Orphan Asylum featured
children rising at daybreak, attending a chapel service thirty
minutes later, and then marching quietly-two by two and holding
hands-to large dining halls with long tables.  There they were
segregated by sex, and anyone wishing an extra helping had to
raise his hand.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Similar schedules were followed throughout the land.  Mrs. F.B.
Tufts, matron of the Utica (New York) Orphan Asylum, was proud
of the routine her charges had in 1875: &quot;The children rise
at six o'clock, dress and wash, after which prayers are said in
the sitting room.  After breakfast the older children go to their
work.  The boys clear off the table, sweep the dining room, and
the girls make their own beds with the assistance of the superintendent.
 All assemble in the school at nine o'clock and remain there until
twelve, with the exception of an intermission of fifteen minutes.
Dinner is served at twelve, after which there is recreation until
half-past one, when they enter the schoolroom again and remain
till half-past four. After school they have recreation till five
o'clock.  Supper is served at five.  In winter they have supper
very soon after school.  The little girls set the tables and assist
in light branches of housework.  After supper the children play
till bedtime.  In winter the younger children go to bed about
seven, but the older ones are permitted to stay up a little later.
 Prayers are said before retiring.  Sometimes the children sing;
sometimes they repeat psalms.  The exercise is varied.&quot;
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Observers at the time generally considered such disciplined
activity to be benign, but critics of orphanages over the years
have muttered about regimentation and mean-spirited harshness.
 &nbsp;&nbsp; From 1850 on records show an increase in questioning whether
orphanage life was best for children in distress.
<P>
<a name="homes"><B>City Kids, Country Homes</B></a>
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Constructive questioning underlay the efforts of Charles Brace,
a writer and missionary who felt called to gain firsthand knowledge
of how the orphaned or abandoned lived.  Settling in New York
City at mid-century, Brace visited &quot;centres of crime and
misery,&quot; and was then able to describe how &quot;the street-boys
were trained by older pickpockets and burglars for their nefarious
callings,&quot; and how &quot;little girls who flitted about with
baskets and wrapped in old shawls became familiar with vice before
they were out of childhood.&quot;   Brace soon set up six homes
for orphans and abandoned children that provided not only shelter
but classes in reading and industrial arts, along with Bible lessons.
&nbsp;&nbsp; The largest of the lodging houses served about 90,000 children
from 1854 through 1872.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Brace emphasized rules that would &quot;discourage pauperism&quot;
and show the rewards of honest work.  Instead of handing out clothes
upon request, Brace preferred to &quot;give the garments as rewards
for good conduct, punctuality, and industry.&quot;   Once they
came to know the children, housekeepers who saw cases of  dire
need could relieve them with less likelihood of deception and
without harm to the character-building process.  The best way
to turn often-troubled children into good citizens, he knew, was
to give them the security of adoption by a family. But there were
not enough willing families in New York City, and Brace agonized
over questions like, &quot;How were places to be found?... And
when the children were placed, how were their interests to be
watched over, and acts of oppression or hard dealing prevented
or punished?&quot;  
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Brace hit upon the idea of allowing adults who took in children
to do good and do well at the same time.  He decided to try sending
children (aged seven to seventeen) to farmers' homes where-in
return for room, board, education, and personal attention-the
children would work part-time. Brace began by sending out to fellow
evangelicals a circular that proposed the economic arrangement
but also stressed the theological reasons for personal involvement:
&quot;Something must be done to meet the increasing crime and
poverty among the destitute children of New York.  As Christian
men, we cannot look upon this great multitude of unhappy, deserted,
and degraded boys and girls without feeling our responsibility
to God for them.... We bear in mind that One died for them, even
as for the children of the rich and happy.&quot;
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Response was enormous; as Brace wrote, &quot;Hundreds of applications
poured in at once from the farmers and mechanics all through the
Union.&quot;  Brace and his associates then relied on  volunteer
committees in towns in upstate New York and throughout the Midwest-a
committee usually included the mayor, a minister, a newspaper
editor, a banker, and a storekeeper-to  each assume responsibility
for the placing of several dozen New York City boys in local families.
When a committee contacted Brace and told him it had publicized
the need through newspaper articles and preaching, and made plans
for temporary housing and feeding of the children, Brace would
send a carload of children on what became known as an &quot;orphan
train.&quot;    
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  When the children arrived, the committee attempted to make sure,
in Brace's words, that the children would &quot;find themselves
in comfortable and kind homes, with all the boundless advantages
and opportunities of the Western farmer's life about them.&quot;
That sounds too good to be true, but it generally was true for
over 91,000 children placed by Brace between 1853 and 1893. This
was for several reasons.  First, in small towns and in rural areas,
committee members had personal knowledge of applicants, and perversities
were hard to keep secret. Second, as Brace wrote, the process
of placing the children &quot;is carried on so publicly ... that
any case of positive abuse would at once be known and corrected
by the community itself.&quot;  Third, an agent visited newly-placed
children within a few months and checked for either pampering
or overwork-both of which were seen as pernicious.  In a culture
that preached compassion and practiced neighborly surveillance,
it appears that cases of neglect or abuse were rare.  
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Brace's New York Children's Aid Society did prosecute two cases
of child abuse and occasionally removed children, generally when
parents reneged on their agreement to provide education.   Records
show occasional cases of farmers working children too long, and
of a few even evicting children when the demands of the harvest
were past.  Some children were placed several times before a good
match was made. But the typical result, even critics of the program
admitted, was portrayed in one report of an inspection tour: &quot;Wherever
we went we found the children sitting at the same table with the
families, going to the school with the children, and every way
treated as well as any other children.  Some whom we had seen
once in the most extreme misery, we beheld sitting, clothed and
clean ... and gaining a good name for themselves in their village.&quot;

<P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;One reason for success probably was the willingness of Brace
and others to use economic incentives.  Since extra hands were
so useful on farms, some observers worried that the &quot;farmer,
while he appeared to be influenced by high motives, might be thinking
too much of the economic gains he would secure through the children
placed in his home.&quot;
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Brace, however, argued that taking in a child from the slums
was often an emotionally-draining activity that should not be
economically-draining as well.  In an agricultural economy, Brace
suggested, child placement could be win-win for both child and
farmer.  His message was clear:  How much better to get orphans
into fresh air and a fresh life than to keep them cooped up in
an institution! 
<P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Journalistic support, for which Brace worked hard, helped to
spread that message.  &quot;I made it a point,&quot; he wrote,
&quot;to keep our movements, and the evils we sought to cure,
continually before the public in the columns of the daily journals.
Articles describing the habits and trials of the poor; editorials
urging the community to work in these directions [made the public]
thoroughly imbued with our ideas and a sense of the evils which
we sought to reform.&quot;
<P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Brace's Children's Aid Society was flattered by widespread imitation
of its methods.  The New York Foundling Hospital began sending
some young children to the New England and mid-Atlantic states.
 The Chicago Orphan Asylum sent its charges to downstate farms,
where farmers agreed to clothe and feed the children, treat them
kindly, and provide religious instruction. 
<P>
<a name="late"><B>The Late-nineteenth Century Mainstream</B></a>
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The number of children in orphanages continued to grow during
the late nineteenth century, moving from 74,000 in 1880 to close
to 90,000 in 1900 and 110,000 in 1910.  The word &quot;orphanage&quot;
itself became a misnomer, as children of parents who were still
living but had problems with finances or alcohol found the institutions
safer and better than life at home.  Backers of orphanages near
the turn of the century still looked around and saw good work.
 Charleston Mayor George S. Bryan wrote  upon the 100th anniversary
of his local orphan house, in 1891, that &quot;I have lived long,
and have witnessed many anniversaries in Charleston, but none
ever gave me such unalloyed and absolute satisfaction.&quot; 
Bryan praised &quot;the discipline which has molded this matchless
institution, and which has harmonized all its details, and combined
them into a perfect and symmetrical whole.&quot; 
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Praise for orphanages did not come only from politicians; journalists
and the children themselves noted the close relationships between
resident children and the superintendents who developed a long-term
bond with their charges.  Some 1960s-style historians sniffing
for oppression have scorned reports and records that show positive
interactions of most children and most supervisors, but Nurith
Zmora, in her excellent recently-published history of Baltimore
orphanages, provides specific detail of compassion at work.  One
orphanage principal, she notes, &quot;was everywhere, watching
carefully every detail of the girls' education, discussing their
future vocations with them, and encouraging them to excel.  She
knew when to be soft and kind and when to be tough and strict.&quot;
 &nbsp;&nbsp;Another superintendent &quot;knew each child's tendency, talents,
and weaknesses and was there to encourage and develop the talents
or correct the mistakes.&quot; 
<P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Some late19th- and early 20th-century orphanages did provide
fodder for stereotypes, but many others displayed patterns of
discipline combined with love.  When a pastor from Vicksburg journeyed
to the Palmer Home for Children in Columbus, Mississippi  to drop
off four children, he ended up staying two days. He wrote to the
superintendent: &quot;I have never seen a healthier or happier
looking lot of children.... What pleased me most was the family
atmosphere of it.... I noticed that the children ran over to your
house whenever they felt like it with the same confidence that
any little child runs to its father's house.&quot;   Some orphanages
battled not criticism but also the patterns of segregation that
dominated American society.  When Father Edward J. Flanigan opened
his Boy's Home in Omaha, which soon became the famed Boy's Town,
he made it officially color-blind, and stuck to his policy of
integration even when townspeople protested the &quot;mingling
of races.&quot;
<P>
 
<P>
<a name="critic"><B>Early Critics</B></a>
<P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, even though the quality of care was evident to observers,
reporting of orphanages started to turn negative in tone.  Much
of the criticism had an ideological tinge, portraying  what had
seemed to be a virtuous solution to children's needs as materially
satisfactory but psychologically inhumane.  In 1893, two years
after the Charleston celebration, Chicago orator Jenkin Lloyd
Jones praised with faint damn the eleven homes for children within
the windy city: &quot;It is not that these massive buildings with
their 'modern improvements,' well-heated and well-ventilated,
and in the main well managed, are not much better than something
worse.&quot;  He noted that orphanages had trained many children
in &quot;habits of usefulness, making of them self-reliant and
self-supporting men and women.&quot; 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  But that was not enough, according to Jones.  &quot;I believe
there is a more excellent way,&quot; he exulted.  &quot;I know
not which to pity the more, the boy who knows not where his tomorrow's
dinner is to come from, or that other boy, dressed in uniform,
at least when he goes to meeting, who is scrubbed by rule, fed
from a printed bill of fare, who always knows on what days bean
or potato soup is to be expected; who knows which are pie and
which are pudding days; the boy who is marched to the table, marched
to his playground, marched to his bed....&quot;  Jones made it
clear that he pitied the child in that &quot;unnatural classification&quot;
known as an orphanage, because he was being forced to abandon
his old, free nature and take on a new style of thinking and living.

<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The positive example of what Charles Brace and others had accomplished,
along with the negative reputation orphanages were beginning to
have, combined to push orphanages down a slippery slope of early-1900s
social unpopularity.  Two White House Conferences on the Care
of Dependent Children in 1909 and 1919, bent in an anti-orphanage
direction: single mothers were to receive financial aid so children
could stay at home, and orphans or those completely abandoned
should be placed in foster care.  The 1919 conference specified
that, &quot;The carefully selected foster home is for the normal
child the best substitute for the natural home.&quot;   Orphanages
were places where matrons suppressed that &quot;old, free nature&quot;
of children. Washington-centric social workers tended to overlook
the ways in which orphanages were functioning as a good alternative
for many children who would otherwise have led miserable lives.
  
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; On the eve of World War I large cities sported an amazing variety:
Baltimore had 28, including twelve Catholic, two Jewish, seven
declared Protestant, and seven labeled private but organized and
run by Protestant philanthropists.  (There were also race and
ethnic divides: six were for blacks, three for Germans, two for
the Irish, and one for Russian Jews)   As Nurith Zmora notes,
some of today's historians would call the typical Baltimore orphanage
&quot;a jail-like institution; they would assume that it was depressing
in appearance  and oppressive in its overreliance on harsh discipline,
rigid routine, and lack of respect for the individual.&quot; And
yet, orphans themselves, interviewed later, tended to attribute
their &quot;success in life to the upper-middle-class education
and culture provided by the charitable institution....&quot; 
 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  The number of children in orphanages peaked in the 1920s, with
the census bureau recording 143,000 residents in 1923.  Most were
small, with one-fourth holding fewer than 30 children and 65 percent
housing fewer than 80.  But anti-institutionalism was flourishing
in the roaring twenties-one founder of a family care agency, Dr.
Henry Dwight Chapin, argued in 1926 that the United States was
an &quot;institution-ridden country.&quot;  Orphanages of all
sizes were tarred with that brush.  Furthermore, as more children
of living parents who were troubled or temporarily impoverished
entered orphanages, the children frequently became short-timers
and one of the pro-orphanage arguments-the stability that they
could bring to the lives of confused children-became less salient.

<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The Brace concept of emphasizing homes rather than institutions
for orphans triumphed finally in the 1930s, but with a twist.
 As early as the 1880s and 1890s, a few agencies, convinced ideologically
that labor was not good for children, had begun paying foster
parents for boarding children so that the children would not have
to work.   By the 1930s, however, there was little choice in the
matter; industrialization and urbanization had so transformed
the American landscape that open-armed farm families were no longer
available in abundance.  
<P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;  Brace had done wonderful work in his time, and most of the
charitable procedures he fought for in the nineteenth century
were still usable in the twentieth, but this one was not.  When
families that housed children would no longer be financially recompensed
they now had to look to government for their monthly bread, and
that government was heading toward bloated bureaucracy. 
<P>
<a name="over"><B>Oversimplifications Have Consequences</B></a>
<P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Other problems with the new conventional wisdom soon emerged:
 Institutions were bad, homes were good. But most of the children
who needed help had a surviving parent or parents who had not
freed children for adoption, so the homes they would find would
be temporary, and children yanked from home to home were in less
stable conditions than the orphanages had provided.  Homes were
good, but non-farm parents would have to be paid to provide temporary
shelter, and such responsibility in the New Deal era was of course
governmental, so states started to pay for foster care.  Government
bureaucrats who supervised foster placement developed an empire-building
economic incentive to keep children in foster care rather than
place them in permanent adoptive homes.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Even in the 1920s there were wrenching scenes at the Hebrew
Orphan Asylum in Baltimore as children were selected for foster
families; many not wanting to leave behind orphanage friends and
siblings, but having to go.   By the late 1940s it was clear that
foster care was not a panacea; Michael Sharlitt, who grew up in
an orphanage and later ran one, noted at that time the problem
of children becoming disoriented as they went through a succession
of foster homes.  Nevertheless, federal funding emerged for urban
area foster care in 1951; the increase in available dollars, along
with an epidemic of journalistic articles about child abuse during
the 1960s, led to a dramatic increase in foster care.   Orphanages
were largely forgotten in the popular press until Newt Gingrich
brought up the subject late in 1994, and gave journalists an opportunity
to clank the chains of Christmas past.

<h2>The Ronald McDonald House</h2>
<b><I>The House That Love Built</I></b><BR>
<p>
<B><FONT SIZE=2><a href="#name">By Gwen Vereen Purtill & Patrick D. Purtill, Jr</a></FONT></B>
<P>
  Debbie Wargos voice was cheerful and warm and she got straight to the point.  I was calling three minutes after my husband and I were to have arrived to interview her at the Ronald McDonald House.<p>
  Gwen! I was just taking your name in vain. Are we going to have to reschedule?
  We had come down with an ugly flu last night, I explained, and didnt think we ought to share it with the kids.<p>
  Yes, she agreed, wed have to ask you not to come in under the circumstances. So many of the children here have suppressed immune systems. We agreed to have a preliminary talk by phone and visit 
the House when we were well.<p>
  Debbie is the executive director of the Ronald McDonald House, a 22-bedroom facility in northeast Washington, D.C. Since 1980, it has provided a home away from home to families of children being treated for life-threatening illness in any of the areas hospitals. A family can stay indefinitely as long as their child is under active treatment. This hospitality extends to children who are receiving outpatient care such as chemotherapy or radiation.  The House serves families that live at least an hour away from the hospital where the child is being treated, or that face other circumstances that making it impossible for them to get back and forth. <p>
  The House itself is a large and inviting 1920s style structure, comprised of a main house and pavilion situated on a two-acre plot that allows for a large playground in back. On the ground floor of the main house are generous gathering rooms, the dining room and kitchen. The pavilion bridge houses a 
meditation/consultation room and a small library; on the ground floor of the pavilion is a television/playroom.<p>
  During its fifteen years of operation, the D.C. House has served nearly eight thousand families. The sixteenth of the now more than 160 Ronald McDonald Houses worldwide, the D.C. House is owned and operated by Ronald McDonald House Charities of Greater Washington D.C., a nonprofit organization. 
Roughly 50 percent of those served by the DC House are children from military families being treated at Walter Reed Hospital in Washington.
<p>
<h3>Missys Story</h3>
<p>
  Missy Terry is from such a family. Missy and two of her three brothers and sisters were born in Korea to a military couple. Missys mother, Tara, left the service when  she and her husband Mark were sent to separate duty stations. In January 1995, Mark was posted to Korea for a second time and they decided that 
Tara and the children would move to Illinois to be near Taras family.
  In early March 1995, Tara took four-year-old Missy to see her doctor because she had what looked like a mild cold and had started waking up at night complaining of headaches. Unable to find anything wrong, 
the doctor sent her home. But a few days later, Missys lymph nodes began to swell and her face was noticeably puffy. Tara took her to the emergency room and doctors warned that Missy might not survive the night. Mark was on a plane home from Korea the next morning.<p>
  The diagnosis was Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in which the bone-marrow and other blood-forming organs produce increased numbers of white blood cells. Missys white cell count was 1.2 million, with 92 percent leukemic cells. Three times Missy went through a process that removed the blood from her body 
and cleaned it. After all this, Missys white cell count came down to 350,000seven times what is considered high risk and roughly thirty-five times what is considered normal. Missys ability to fight off infection often is so low that everyday matters like using a drinking glass after her sisters or brother become seriously dangerous.<p>
  Nearly every day for three months, Missy and her family made the 110-mile drive to the hospital in St. Louis where she was being treated. It was a constant drain, remembers Tara. She now wonders why no one at the hospital suggested they stay at the Ronald McDonald House in St. Louis.<p>
   Each time the family adjusted to the demands of a regimen of treatment, it seemed that they were buffeted by something new. At first there was only the shock, but then Missy somehow lived through the initial phase of treatment. Then, Mark and Tara were told that Missy would have to have a broviac (an in-
dwelling catheter) implanted in her chest; it seemed like the end of the world. Next began the day-to day business of contending with chemotherapy, while watching their little girl lose her hair. <p>
  At first, Missy was as frightened as they were. She wasnt feeling all that sick, but suddenly teams of doctors were descending on her. Now, Tara says, Missy is not afraid of anything. She knows how to take care of the broviac, and when a nurse is careless, she tells her what she is doing wrong. At home, she does 
the heparin push in her own tube and always remembers her pills. Tara describes Missy as bright, energetic and an attention seeker. It is easy for onlookers to forget, but kids will be kids. Tara and Mark still have to 
discipline her occasionally, but it is hard. Missy is not allowed to misbehave. But now, says Tara, she and Mark evaluate the situation more generously before deciding that it really is important that Missy is told no.<p>
  In late June of 1995, the family was transferred to Ft. Belvoir, south of Washington, D.C., and Missy became a patient at Walter Reed, one of the armys three major hospitals. The move exacted a terrible emotional toll on the family. It was horrible, Tara says, We knew no one. <p>
  The family went directly to the hospital when they arrived in Washington because Missy had an infection. She stayed there for twenty-three days. The family had no place to live. The first night in town they paid $85 for a hotel room that Tara describes as unpleasant. Taking matters into their own hands they asked a hospital social worker to place them in a Ronald McDonald House. He made the referral, and they stayed there for three weeks until Missy was released.<p>
  During those three weeks, the family stayed in the downstairs bone marrow apartment of the D.C. Ronald McDonald House. The Terrys consider themselves private people, and did not especially relish the idea of staying in a group environment. But the staff helped them to get over their discomfort. At the House there was always someone to talk to who was concerned about their needs. Even now as Tara gets more involved with support organizations, she says that only at the Ronald McDonald House is everyone consistently supportive. <p>
  Tara was especially impressed that the House takes it in stride when residents fail to appreciate what is being done for them. They ask nothing but that you clean up after yourself. Some people do not even do that. They really seem to understand the stress level better even than hospital staff.<p>
 One day, in particular, the Terrys were exhausted and tense. A woman in the kitchen spoke sharply to Missy, who was out of the hospital on a pass. Mark came downstairs and blew his top. Later he went to Barbara Silverman, the Resident Manager, to apologize for making a scene.  Barbara was unruffled; she understood his stress.<p>
  During that time, Missy was in treatment at the hospital for 72 hour periods. But occasionally the hospital would let her leave on a pass for eight hours. Back at the House she could be with her parents and see her brothers and sisters who were at the House all the time.<p>
  Tara thinks her family has been very proactive in doing research and looking into Missys options. But she says the Ronald McDonald House was their only source of support during that period. Without it there would have been more crises. Because you are in the hospital so much, you see a lot. It really gets depressing. But at least we had a place to go. At the Ronald McDonald House, we could see a friendly face, talk to people, and vent our frustration.<p>
  While the family was emotionally needy, they saw many families at the House who were in much worse financial shape. The staff of the Ronald McDonald House gave one family Christmas presents and food vouchers. Tara especially felt for the overseas families that were separated because usually only one parent 
could accompany the child to the U.S.<p>
  After Missys initial stay at the Ronald McDonald House, the family moved to Ft. Belvoir in Northern Virginia, forty-seven miles on the other side of Washington from Missys hospital. If her other children were not in school, they would still be staying at the House. Tara says it is the first place she will look to if Missy should relapse or if Mark is transferred. <p>
  Missy is on a high dose chemotherapy regimen, and has lost her hair. People often mistake her for a little boy, says Tara. One day in the park, kids made fun of her hair, so now she wears a baseball cap all the time. But despite having tubes in her chest, she is very active; she runs and plays. You get to a point in all 
this of feeling sorry for yourself. But she is so strong, so happy, and so outgoingshe keeps us going. She has lost so muchher dance classes and pre-school. She has done very wellbetter than we have.<p>
  Missy currently is in a two-year maintenance phase of her treatment by experimental chemotherapy. They do most of the maintenance at home, including the chemo, which is administered through her leg. She only has to go into the hospital about three days every month. Doctors say Missy has about a 30% 
chance of making it through the maintenance regimen without a relapse. The family had a scare near the end of January when Missys white blood cell count dropped suddenly. If there is a relapse, the initial thirty-day induction stage of intensive treatment in the hospital starts again. It is also likely that doctors 
would prescribe a risky bone marrow transplant, which they have not done yet because none of Missys brothers or sisters are a match.  In either case, the family plans to spend their nights at the Ronald McDonald House while Missy sleeps. <p>
  If all goes well, there will be a final five-year phase of treatment. But it will be at least another seven years before Missy is out of the woods. Meanwhile, Tara now tells other families about the House because she thinks that it can help them through the crisis. When you need them, she says, it really makes the 
difference between whether the situation is bearable or unbearable.<p>
  Tara still feels isolated here. The couple made a few friends at the Ronald McDonald House. But they are finding that it is hard to start new friendships  because they are so emotionally needy and often exhausted. As a result Tara has started working with support groups. At least  everyone there is in the same boat. The House is sponsoring an Easter egg hunt in April, and Tara intends to take the children. Even if you are not staying at the House anymore, they are always open to you if you need it, she says.<p>
<h3>Full House</h3>
  <p>
The week before we visited the D.C. Ronald McDonald House, only five of its twenty-two rooms were occupied. But by the time we arrived on a Monday afternoon, Barbara, the resident manager, was juggling families and rooms. It is impossible to tell from day to day what the need will be. During busy times like 
these, the House has its medical priorities. The original mission of the Ronald McDonald Houses gave cancer and leukemia patients the highest priority as well as any child in an intensive care unit. The level of priority works its way down from there. Debbie tells us that they would never turn away a high priority 
family. If necessary, they will look for a hotel in the area willing to donate a room while the House is full. <p>
  When space is available, grandparents and other relatives may stay at the House. Like immediate family members, they are asked to make the customary $10 per night donation. However, reservations for extended family members are handled on a day-to-day basis.<p>
  Families must be referred by the hospital that is treating the child. Usually a hospital social worker or sometimes a doctor or nurse makes the referral. No walk-ins are accepted at Ronald McDonald Houses. There are few problems because the social workers assess whether the family is looking for a hotel or 
needs a temporary home. Occasionally a family cannot fit into the group setting, but  very rarely is anyone asked to leave. When  family members check in, they go through an orientation during which are asked to agree to, and sign, a handbook specifying  the House rules. Occasionally, a family will decide not to stay, 
but that doesnt happen very often.<p>
   Most families stay for two or more weeks. They live in a group setting and are responsible for doing their own laundry and cooking.  A cheerful plaque that hangs on an interior wall as you enter the kitchen sums up the philosophy and organization of the entire operation: This is a self-cleaning kitchen. Please clean up after yourself. Opposite,  numbered cupboards store the food purchased by families.  A common pantry is provided although the families buy most of their own food. Barbara coordinates emergency provisions for the pantry from local vendors, clubs, organizations, and individuals.<p>
  Most people welcome the opportunity to engage in the normal activities of daily lifecooking their own meals, doing laundry, cleaning up common areas. They want to feel they are doing something useful for their family and others at a time when they may feel helpless in the face of a childs illness.<p>

<h3>A Surrogate Community</h3>
<p>
  There are plenty of restaurants and hotels in the Washington area, but most families simply cannot afford to eat out every night and stay in hotels for a prolonged periodespecially if they already face large medical bills. Hotels leave families isolated at a time when they most need emotional support.  Kate Shafer, a social worker at Childrens Hospital, says the  House provides an opportunity for normal interaction for couples and extended family. They  can sleep restfully  knowing they are five minutes away from their sick child. And the child can sleep soundly knowing mom and dad are minutes away. 
According to Shafer, parents away from home and family find a naturally supportive community of 
people who are uniquely sensitive to their needs.<p>
  Staff believe that this temporary community, while ones own is out of reach, is one of the most important 
services the house provides. Families can sit down together over breakfast and informally compare notes 
on what to expect as treatment progresses. Newer patients can ask those who know the ropes about hospital 
services and staff, or they can find out how to deal with practical problems that arise as they try to take care 
of a child who is in transition from the hospital.<p>
  Like most places that cater to children, Ronald McDonald Houses go all out for holidays. Groups bring in 
Christmas presents or Valentines Day treats. Some will bring little favors or bake cookies. At Halloween a 
group always comes to decorate the stairwell, and the kids go trick-or-treating at Catholic University a few 
blocks away. When we visited, the House was celebrating a mothers birthday.  Barbara provided  a cake, 
and small presents were waiting to be opened. In preparation for Valentines Day, a table in the hall held 
dozens of favors, prepared by volunteers, awaiting the return of the families that evening.<p>
  Giving the House a homey feel is crucial to its mission. Much of that feeling is achieved by the staff and 
volunteers who keep the atmosphere informal. But while hospital staff often try to keep things informal  no 
one has ever left a hospital thinking it had a homey feeling. In this House children are allowed to play. It 
is a place where kids can just be themselvesa place where they feel comfortable enough to allow their 
thinning hair to show. Even structurally, the House encourages community. Rooms dont form an insular 
world the way they do in hotels. There is only one central kitchen. The bathrooms are shared. Telephones 
and televisions are in common areas so families are more or less forced to go out, just as they would at 
home.<p>
  Because of this, the supportive bonds formed at the House often grow into lifetime friendships. Early in 
its history, the House had a number of children with extremely serious cancers, and many of them did not 
make it. Some of those families still keep in touch, and even get together for holidays.<p>
  A very ill teenage girl has been at the D.C. House with her father for several months. Her mother died 
several years ago. When she first came to the House, she told Barbara that all of her friends had dropped 
her because they were unable to understand what she was going through. She has since become attached  to 
the staff and to some of the mothers and children staying at the House, and they to her.<p>
  We are her friends, says Barbara. If you asked her whether she would like to be here or at home, at this 
stage she probably would say here. She was in the hospital, but when it looked as if she was certain to get 
better, she asked if she could stay here during her physical therapy. Shes more comfortable hereexcept 
for Max, her dog. She misses Max.
<p>
<h3>Day by Day</h3>
<p>
  While Debbie Wargo goes out into the community looking for financial and other help, Barbara works 
with the families and the volunteers. Her job is to keep everything functioning and everyone living as one 
big happy family. Says Barbara, she raises all the money and I get to spend it.  Barbara tries to have 
volunteers on hand from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. each day to do everything from answering the telephones 
to checking in guests, checking rooms, attending to light maintenance, doing mailings, and baking cookies. 
Some 50 volunteers come in to help as often as twice a week or as little as  twice a month. Most  family 
activities take place in the evenings or first thing in the morning. But often healthy brothers and sisters are 
in the House during the day. When there is a healthy sibling under age sixteen, there is usually a parent at 
the House also.<p>
  The House rules are mostly just common sense. Children must be supervised by an adult. Quiet time is 10 
p.m. to 7 a.m. Because there is no maid service, families have to pick up after themselves and their children 
in the common areas as well as in their private rooms. And of course, they must make sure that their 
children are courteous to others. No smoking is permitted inside, and no alcohol may be drunk anywhere 
on the premises. Food and drinks are allowed in the dining room and kitchen only, unless a child is 
bedridden. <p>
  Because the House, its staff, and the families seem so cheerful, reminders of the purpose of Ronald 
McDonald House can be slightly jarring. Reading through the House rules is reminder enough. Hand 
washing is taken very seriously here, as is proper disposal of diapers, syringes, and blood specimens. 
House managers must be notified if anyone in the House is exposed to contagious disease; chicken pox can 
be fatal to children with weakened immune systems. <p>
  One of the most remarkable things about Barbara and Debbie is their approach to illness and death
particularly  the deaths of children. Certainly there is grief, which is as much a part of death as death is a 
part of life. But they are both passionate and practical about what they do. They have no soapbox, and there 
is no melodrama as they talk to us about the often terrible suffering of the families and children they serve. <p>

<h3>Practical Services</h3>
<p>
  This practical but caring approach manifests itself in several other services the House provides. For 
instance, a former playroom was converted into a classroom in 1992. Because patients, as well as their 
healthy brothers and sisters, often had no way of keeping up with their schoolwork, Fiorella Carmelino, the 
tutorial coordinator, has recruited and trained about sixteen volunteer tutors. They assist  patients at the 
House, their sisters and brothers, children who are confined to the hospital, and indeed any child at 
Childrens Hospital who requests help. Tutors spend two to three hours per week working with students on 
a one-to-one basis, usually meeting with two or three students per session.<p>
  As the nations capital, Washington offers children educational opportunities that can compensate for 
what they are missing in their schools at home. Volunteers from local colleges and retiree organizations 
serve as tutors and  chaperones on field trips. Outings are organized to such places as the Smithsonians Air 
and Space Museum, the National Gallery, the Lincoln Memorial, the White House, the Capitol, and the 
National Zoo.<p>
  The House also provides for many  families that dont have transportation, especially those who are flown 
in from overseas.  Shuttle vans run four times a day  to any hospital where a child is treated, and to grocery 
stores and to a shopping mall on the weekend. Even those who do bring a car may find  the prospect of 
driving in a large, unfamiliar city daunting.<p>
  And to keep families in touch with friends and relatives, MCI and AT&T have donated special phones  
for brief long-distance calls every day. Regular phone service is also available, and three pay phones are on 
the premises. The House even provides pagers to parents whose children are in intensive care so that the 
hospital can reach them no matter where they are day or night.<p>

<h3>The House That Love Built</h3>
<p>
  The first Ronald McDonald House was the product of a quixotic partnership of an NFL franchise, a 
pediatric oncologist, and local McDonalds franchise owners (see sidebarpage 4). The concept grew out 
of a conversation between Fred Hill, a tight end for the Philadelphia Eagles, and Dr. Audrey Evans, one of 
the doctors treating Hills three-year-old daughter Kim for leukemia. The first house opened near 
Philadelphia Childrens Hospital in 1974.<p>
  Debbie describes their relationship with McDonalds as wonderfulboth in terms of manpower and on a 
volunteer level. If the House needs a van it may ask local franchise owners to  raise the money. 
McDonalds suppliers also help the Ronald McDonald House. The D.C. House, for instance, receives free 
dairy products from the Shenandoah Pride Dairy.<p>
  None of the Ronald McDonald Houses could exist solely on what McDonalds does for them. This is 
especially true for the larger Houses. The D.C. House, for instance, depends on the community for the 
overwhelming majority of its annual operating budget. It fluctuates yearly, but is now at just over 
$700,000.  McDonalds restaurant counter boxes are projected to account for just over 17% of the 1996 
budget.<p>
  Debbie, who has been executive director for seven years, is responsible for public relations, management 
and fund-raising. Her very active, forty member Board, composed of parents of children with cancer, 
doctors, social workers, McDonalds representatives, and community leaders, assists with management, 
finance, fund-raising and special events. Each board member must serve on at least one committee.<p>
  The House had no executive director from the time the House opened in 1980 until Debbie came on in 
1989.  The sole staff person, a resident manager, lived on the premises and the Board filled in as needed. 
Debbie now directs four full-time and four part-time staff members.<p>
  While the D.C. House participates in the Combined Federal Campaign, it does not receive any 
government money. In fact, its fund-raising relies almost exclusively on local projects designed to serve a 
dual purpose, raise the always-needed funds, and increase community awareness of the facility. Special 
events raise a  large portion of their budget. While always happy to accept money, the House also 
welcomes gifts in kind. Right now Debbie is looking for a van and a new plain paper fax machine.<p>
  If the Ronald McDonald House has an event planned Debbie tries to get it on the radio or in the 
newspaper. Often she will put out a call for volunteers to  adopt  parts of the garden, bake cookies, or rake 
the yard. She constantly reminds the community that the House depends upon volunteers every day from 
9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.  This high profile approach helps to insure that the community knows that there is a 
Ronald McDonald House in the area that needs volunteers and money.<p>
  Recalling the role of the Philadelphia Eagles, the largest annual fund-raising event involves the 
Washington Redskins football team. The event, Rally Round the Redskins, was begun in the Houses  
first year of operation. It features a live and silent auction, dinner, and an autograph and photo session 
which the House holds with the Redskins each fall. The entire teamcoaches and playersis invited to 
greet anyone who might be interested in meeting  the players and supporting the House. <p>
  Each year there also is an annual golf tournament and four or five smaller events. These included wine 
tastings, raffles, and a dinner cruise. This March the House held its first annual Ultimate Hunt for the 
Good Egg. Eighty celebrity-decorated Easter Eggs, creations by the likes of by Elton John, Corretta Scott 
King, General Norman Schwartzkopf, President Ford and Bob and Elizabeth Dole were auctioned off. The 
event, cosponsored with Neiman Marcus, culminated in the presentation of the first annual Good Egg 
Award to Donna and Gilbert Giordano, keystone supporters of the House.
<h3>Giving Back</h3>
<p>
  The D.C. Ronald McDonald House asks that families who can afford it pay a $10 fee per daynicely 
splitting the difference between the high ($25) and low ($5) established by the Ronald McDonald House 
International Advisory Board. It is certainly not for the revenue, says Debbie. This may be a matter of 
opinion, but I believe the old saying that when people get something for nothing they sometimes dont 
value it, or they almost forget that it costs something for them to stay here. At least this small stipend helps 
families feel that they belong and that they are making a contribution or giving back.  Debbie and Barbara 
estimate that the fee is  waived for at least half of the families. <p>
  But the House, they are quick to remind us, runs on two things: one is money, the other is volunteer 
power. So they also ask all families to volunteer in the House. As with the fee, help is asked on an as 
youre able basis. Some families have many hours to volunteer, others dont. This often depends on how 
sick their child is and how much time theyre spending at the hospital. But most families are quite willing  
to do things for the common areas like take out the trash and change light bulbs.<p>
  Helping out also depends on how each individual deals with stress. Some people need to keep busy, 
others internalize their energy and become contemplative. One  father who was here during  the 
extraordinary blizzards in 1996 kept the walk clear. It was his way to relieve stress and help out. Barbara 
remembers another father whose child was not going to live. He mowed the lawn to relieve stress. The 
childs mother had to be at the hospital; he had to leave. He had to mow the lawn. Thats how he dealt with 
it. For many guests, being able to pull a weed in the garden not only makes them feel more at home, it is a 
necessary pressure valve.<p>
  Currently Debbie and board members are busy supervising the building of another Ronald McDonald 
House on the grounds of Fairfax Hospital in Virginia. It will be an eight bedroom facility to better serve 
hospitals in the Northern Virginia area. Having received the go-ahead, they have selected the design of the 
House and have found builders. They have a lease in hand, and if all goes well the groundbreaking will be 
in August or September.<p> 
  Meanwhile, they also are expanding the House in northeast D.C. The Board of Zoning has approved a 
manufactured three-bedroom housing unit to house three additional bone marrow transplant families, 
whose children need an even greater levels of isolation because of  their weakened immune systems.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
  As rising medical costs threaten families whose children require treatment over a long period, clearly the 
Ronald McDonald House provides a helpful safety net. Parents may miss work and have trouble meeting 
uninsured  costs.  But at the Ronald McDonald House they at least will have food and shelter for little or no 
cost.<p>
  Yet the House serves an even more important function. At a time when a familys emotional stability is at 
risk and when financial and personal tensions may be high, Ronald McDonald House keeps the family 
together. Painful decisions about who has to stay behind are avoided because the House keeps parents close 
to their hospitalized child. It relieves the necessity of long and frequent drives to the hospital when a child 
is in pain or queasy from treatment. And it allows family members to remain charitable to one another 
under the weight of stress and exhaustion. When families are spending day after day with a loved one at the 
hospital, it is hard to overestimate the healing power of a warm shower, a comfortable bed, and a meal that 
didnt come from the hospital cafeteria.
<p>
<h3>The First Ronald McDonald House</h3><p>
  When Fred Hill, tight end for the Philadelphia Eagles, asked Dr. Audrey Evans, head of the pediatric 
oncology unit at Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia, how he could help the families she was working with, 
neither expected her answer to that question to grow into a household name. <p>
  What Dr. Evans wanted was a house that could serve as a temporary residence for the families of children  
treated at her hospital. She caught Hill at his most receptive. Ever since his daughter Kim had been 
diagnosed with leukemia, Hill and his wife had camped out on hospital chairs and benches, eating food 
from vending machines, and doing all they could to keep Kim from seeing their fear, exhaustion, and 
frustration.<p>
  All around them, other parents were doing exactly the same thing. Many of the families had traveled great 
distances to bring their children to the hospital, but the high cost of hotel rooms was more than they could 
afford. Hill was convinced that Dr. Evans idea for a home-away-from-home for families of seriously ill 
children was exactly what was needed. <p>
  Hill rallied his teammates. Through the Philadelphia Eagles general manager, Jim Murray, the whole 
team offered its support. While Dr. Evans looked for real estate around the hospital, Murray called on his 
friends at McDonalds, who were planning a St. Patricks Day Shamrock Shake promotion. On requesting 
a portion of the proceeds, Murray was told by the local McDonalds that the project could have them all.<p>
  The Shamrock Shake promotion raised some $35,000, almost enough to cover the $40,000 purchase price 
of a four-story, seven-bedroom house that Dr. Evans found near the hospital. The interior required 
extensive renovation to convert it from a student rooming house into a temporary home for kids and their 
families. With help from a local developer whose own daughter had been diagnosed with leukemia, the 
house was gutted, rebuilt, furnished, and opened in October of 1974. <p>
  When it came time to name the house, they decided on the Ronald McDonald House in gratitude to the 
local franchise owners who had helped so generously, and because it was hoped that it would be 
comforting for a hospitalized child to know that his parents would be staying at Ronalds House.<p>
  Within a year, word had spread and Eagles General Manager Jim Murray went to Chicago to help 
Childrens Memorial Hospital and several area residents establish a Ronald McDonald House there. Again, 
a milkshake promotion supported by local McDonalds and their customers provided the fundraising 
centerpiece. The second Ronald McDonald House opened in Chicago in April of 1977. <p>
  By 1979, 10 more Ronald McDonald Houses had opened. In the next five years, local communities 
founded 60 more Houses; then 53 more in the following five years. Today, there are 164 Ronald 
McDonald Houses in 13 countries. <p>
  <b>Kim Hill, the little girl whose illness started it all, is now a mother in California. And Jim Murray, the 
Eagles general manager who helped found the first and many subsequent Ronald McDonald Houses, now 
serves as president of the Ronald McDonald House International Advisory Board.</b>

Rediscovering Heroes, Remembering Dreams<p></h2>
<b><I>A Challenge to Change Lives</I></b><BR>
<p>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>By Marvin Olasky</FONT></B>
<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;My goal today is to help each of you think more clearly
about the welfare problem so that you become an agent of change.
Our emphasis should be on change that moves people out of poverty.
We should not be agents of spare change, the distribution of which
merely enables people to stay in poverty. Many citizens today
are agents of spare change.  They hand out quarters or dollars
at street corners with good intentions and support more federal
welfare spending.  Those intentions are often reflected in church
bulletin announcements about the homeless.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are a few of those announcements that have been
brought to my attention: First: &quot;Thursday night... Dinner
for the homeless.  Meditation to follow.&quot; Here's another:
&quot;At the evening service tonight, the sermon topic will be
'Seeing Hell close-up...Come early to meet homeless visitors.&quot;
One more: &quot;Don't let homelessness kill you...let the church
help.&quot; 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;These are honest mistakes, but they show why we must
go beyond sentimentality and learn how to fight poverty the right
way, the biblical way, the way that was practiced in America until
recent decades.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A large part of our current problem arises from the
twisting of Scripture.  If a supporter of the contemporary welfare
state were to rewrite the parable of the prodigal son, he might
write something like this: &quot;One young man set off for a distant
country and there squandered his wealth in wild living.  After
he had spent everything, he was in need and took a job feeding
pigs. The job was miserable, and the man visualized an alternative:
'I will go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned.'
He was about to return  home, but an official from  Beds for
the Homeless saw him and convinced him to spend the night.  The
shelter offered free food, housing, clothing, and medicine, and
did not require any work in return.  The prodigal son stayed on
and became used to panhandling in the morning, drinking fortified
wine and smoking some joints in the afternoon, and watching movies
at the shelter in the evening.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Meanwhile, the father sat on his porch in the
late afternoon, hoping to see the prodigal son trudging home.
Day after day the father yearned for the opportunity to hug him
and prepare a feast, but the son never came.&quot; 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That's the tale of the prodigal panhandler, and I
could give you other brand new revised version stories. One of
my favorites is, &quot;Jesus Food Stamps the 5000.&quot;  The
Bible is where we learn how to provide effective compassion for
prodigals.  That God created each of us in His own image, and
that He provided for us a way to be delivered from our inclination
to deface his image, underlies everything I say here.<BR>

<P>
<H3>Forgotten Heroes</H3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are the two propositions I would like to put
before you:  First, the reason why government welfare programs
must be transformed is not that they are too expensive.  The real
problem is that they are too stingy about doing what is truly
important: treating people as human beings made in God's image,
not as animals to be fed, caged, and occasionally petted.  Second,
private programs can do a better job if they  are challenging,
personal, and spiritual-most often, when they are religiously
based.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of you have gained experience working with the
poor and I want to hear what you have learned. But I'm speaking
to you after having spent a year in the bowels of the Library
of Congress searching through old records.  I'm here today to
testify to the work of many people forgotten by the standard history
books-men like Charles Brace.  Over a 40-year period Brace built
lodging houses in New York City that provided shelter to several
hundred thousand abandoned children.   He placed 91,000 of them
in adoptive homes.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Women like Helen Mercy Woods.  From 1881 to 1903 she
ran a shelter in Chicago for pregnant and unmarried women.  Month
after month she gave personal attention to each newcomer and rejoiced
as their babies were born. She helped some of her charges to get
married, others to place their children for adoption, others to
get jobs.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm here to testify about now-forgotten heroes like
Annie Richardson Kennedy.  She ran a home for unwed moms in New
York City between 1900 and 1920.  Her goal was to first bring
the girls in touch with their Savior, and then build character.
She provided love and opportunity for thousands, and then disappeared
into the fog of history. When I visited the site of her shelter
several years ago, it was occupied by the consulate of Yemen.
The guard didn't understand much English, and I was not making
his day when I asked him if anyone knew what had happened to a
home for mothers and babies that was there 70 years before. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife doesn't mind when I fall in love with women
like Helen Mercy Woods and Annie Richardson Kennedy, because they've
all been dead for a long time. The textbooks are silent, but I'm
here to testify about the contributions they made.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You might think that the work of an historian is boring,
but it's exciting detective work to blow dust off old reports
in the Library of Congress and learn about people who changed
so many lives for the better.  It may be an acquired taste to
sit in the Chicago Historical Society and read the diaries of
self-sacrificing people hour after hour, until the librarian there
turns off the lights and kicks you out, but it's exciting to uncover
what secular liberal historians ignore. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The big story that they missed is this:  During the
19th century, before the federal government ever got involved,
a war on poverty much more successful than our own was waged
by tens of thousands of local, private charitable agencies and
religious groups around the country. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It was successful in this way: poverty fighters a
century ago did not abolish poverty, but they witnessed movement
out of poverty by millions of people. Successful in this way:
There were springs of fresh water flowing among the poor, not
just blocks of ice sitting in a perpetual winter of multigenerational
welfare dependency.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Successful also in this way: The optimism prevalent
then contrasts sharply with the demoralization among the poor
and the cynicism among the better-off that is so common now. I'm
here to testify that there was a great cloud of witnesses to effective
poverty-fighting, and that they succeeded in large ways by knowing
and doing small but vital things. They knew that the literal meaning
of compassion is not just writing a check, but having personal
involvement with the needy, suffering with them, not just giving
money to them. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They knew that welfare doesn't mean passing a bill,
but helping a person to fare well. They knew that the Constitution
talks about providing for the common defense but promoting the
general welfare-and there's a big difference between renting a
hall for a convention, and manning every booth yourself. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They knew that people should be challenged. When an
able-bodied man came to a homeless shelter, he often was asked
to chop wood for two hours or to whitewash a building.  In that
way he could provide part of his own support and also help those
unable to chop. They knew, and they showed everyone through those
work tests, that even the most run-down person is not just a taker;
he can also be a giver. They knew that everyone is made in God's
image and is capable of helping. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And they knew what to avoid: in fact, they warned
us.  Some of their warnings were amazingly prophetic. Mary Richmond
of the Baltimore Charity Organizing Society said in 1897, &quot;Relief
given without reference to friends and neighbors is accompanied
by moral loss.  Poor neighborhoods are doomed to grow poorer whenever
the natural ties of neighborliness are weakened by well-meant
but unintelligent interference.&quot;  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The New Orleans Charity Organization Society in 1899
wisely noted, &quot;Intelligent giving and intelligent withholding
are alike true charity.&quot; Giving money to a poor person by
itself is morally neutral, because the action can hurt if not
done wisely.   New York charity leader Josephine Lowell said,
&quot;The problem before those who would be charitable, is not
how to deal with a given number of the poor; it is how to help
those who are poor, without adding to their numbers and constantly
increasing the evils they seek to cure.&quot; 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Poverty-fighters a century ago trained volunteers
to leave behind &quot;a conventional attitude toward the poor,
seeing them through the comfortable haze of our own intentions.&quot;
They said, &quot;If drink has made a man poor, money will feed
not him, but his drunkenness.&quot;  They did not use euphemisms.
They said it is  important to &quot;reform those mild, well-meaning,
tenderhearted, sweet-voiced criminals who insist upon indulging
in indiscriminate charity.&quot; They said that government payouts
come &quot;from what is regarded as a practically inexhaustible
source, and people who once receive it are likely to regard it
as a right, as a permanent pension, implying no obligation on
their part.&quot; They were prophetic!<BR>

<P>
<H3>Dream Killers</H3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;They were prophetic, but the historical knowledge
of many Americans today is pathetic.  Let me be blunt:  We don't
know much about history.  We've forgotten America's past successes
in poverty-fighting. The result has been not just the waste of
billions of dollars each year, but the death of  part of the American
dream.   
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time it was considered hardheaded to talk about
dollars and corny to speak about dreams.  The debate in Washington
was always liberals wanting to spend more and conservatives wanting
to spend less, but no one questioning what welfare does to dreams.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;History, though, is made by dreams followed by action.
America was begun by people who resolved to fight for a country
in which both liberty and virtue could flourish.  But now, welfare
kills dreams. It kills the helping dream of many Americans.  
Most of you and millions of other people would like to be generous
when a panhandler asks for spare change.  But if you know that
most homeless recipients will use any available funds for drugs
or alcohol and will put off real change by getting high, you are
likely to end up walking by and avoiding eye contact. A subtle
hardening occurs.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Welfare also kills the dreams of social workers. 
Their common lament is, &quot;All we have time to do is move paper.&quot;
Listen to this sad statement from a social worker who graduated
from college several years ago, lasted on the job for a year,
and then resigned: &quot;I had a calling; it was that simple.
I wanted to help.&quot;  A lot of people are frustrated, worn
down, burnt out. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Welfare also kills the dreams of poor individuals
who gradually become used to dependency.  Some among the poor
are willing to put off immediate gratification and  sacrifice
leisure time in order to remain independent, but they are called
chumps rather than champs. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Welfare kills the dreams of children who grow up without
fathers.  Coach a little league team some time and you'll quickly
see who's in that fix.  Fatherless children alternately cling
and are standoffish in a way that kids with functioning dads do
not. It breaks your heart.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Welfare kills.  Spend some time with AFDC moms or
with homeless men.  You'll see how sad they are.  You'll see the
essential problem, and I'll stress it again:  Governmental welfare
programs should be fought not because they are too expensive,
but because they are inevitably too stingy in what is truly important:
treating people as human beings made in God's image, not as animals.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we despair?  No. I'm hear to testify that the
reams of the past can thrive in the future if we recover the
lessons of the past and use them to plan for the future. I am
finding good news as I get around the country now: We are recovering
the lost tools of charitable success.  We are  seeing a new great
cloud of witnesses.  We are living in an era with many heroes
or, I should say, ordinary people who become heroic as they show,
through hard suffering with, that the American dream of compassion
is not dead. <BR>

<P>
<H3>Modern Heroes</H3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish you could come with me and visit Bob Cote in
Denver.  He's a tall, white, ex- boxer who spent a year on the
streets as an alcoholic in the early '80s and then pulled together
a few of his fellow winos and junkies to start a program that
has become known as Step 13.  Bob welcomed me to his four-story
building and showed me how  people from off the streets can, step
by step, come back to life.  They can get jobs of increasing responsibility.
They can get rooms within that building that gradually reflect
greater independence, until a person is ready to go out on his
own.  They can go through a tough, time-intensive process.  Cote
has lived it himself and he's there to help others. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish you could come with me and visit Hannah Hawkins,
who lives  in Anacostia, the poorest part of Washington.  She's
short, black, and retired, and she voluntarily runs an after-school
program which has several dozen children doing their homework
and receiving the love they often don't get at home. Sometimes
they run around like lost sheep, but she knows each of her lambs
by name. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish you could come with me and visit Freddie Garcia
in San Antonio.  He's a softhearted but hardheaded Hispanic ex-addict.
He formed Victory Outreach 25 years ago in San Antonio to help
substance abusers.  Groups based on his teaching have now spread
throughout Texas and California and even to Peru.  I've sat in
his home and watched the way he patiently counsels and teaches
those whom everyone else has abandoned. I've been blessed to see
and come to know some of these people, and I'm here to testify
that they have succeeded and others can too.   The heroes of past
and present have a common understanding that could be summarized
as CPS.<BR>

<P>
<H3>Challenging, Personal, and Spiritual</H3>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What's CPS? Compassion needs to be Challenging, Personal,
and Spiritual.  I hope it will become as well known as CPR.  
CPR can bring back to life a dying person; CPS can bring back
to life a dying American dream. &nbsp;&nbsp;People successfully
practiced CPS a century ago, and they are successfully doing it
right now.  There is compassion that is challenging, personal,
and spiritual at Clean and Sober Streets in Washington.  Leaders
there get people off drugs and alcohol by caring for them but
also imposing tough rules-one strike you're out-and sticking to
them. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There is compassion that is challenging, personal,
and spiritual at Teen Challenge sites in Texas and around the
country, where alcoholism is treated as a symptom, not the fundamental
problem.  Leaders there know that the basic problem is that people
have holes in their souls, holes that only God can fill.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There is compassion that is challenging, personal,
and spiritual at the Right Alternative center in Milwaukee. People
sometimes say that AFDC mothers will be stuck on the government
rolls for a life time, but at Right Alternative AFDC moms pledge
not to swear, not to shack up, not to do drugs.  Leaders there
challenge them to stick to their pledges, and when they do their
lives change:  They do get married.  They do get jobs. What works?
Challenging help... Personal help... Spiritual help. It worked
in the past.  It works now.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence of changed lives is accumulating. I'm
not saying it's easy.  I've personally seen successes over the
years. I've seen lives of pregnant unmarried women turned around.
I've seen abandoned children happily adopted.  I've also seen
failures:  Recently I was working with a homeless ex-con, and
I thought he was making good progress, but he slipped back into
irresponsibility.  He's currently in a jail facility near Fort
Worth, but he'll have another chance in several months.<BR>

<P>
<H3>Answering Five Criticisms</H3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't want anyone to go into poverty-fighting without
understanding the difficulties.  In fact, let me give you my responses
to five  criticisms of the generally optimistic message I'm offering
tonight. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;First-that history didn't happen.  Some say that when
I talk about the outpouring of charities in the past, I'm romanticizing.
That's easy to refute: It did happen. Read my footnotes.  The
times I describe were not the good old days.  They were bad in
many ways, but people refused to sit back and take it easy.  They
fought,  and they won. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the history happened but it is irrelevant
to our more complex society today.  That could be true-but when
you see what our predecessors did, you naturally ask yourself,
why not today?  I could go point by point through the comparison
of then and now and show the parallels.  But I'll just say here:
Overall, they had problems.  We have problems.  They dealt with
theirs.  We whine about ours. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A third criticism comes from members of the religious
left: They say the Bible requires government to transfer to the
poor whatever resources it can grab hold of because Jesus said
that &quot;Whatever you did to the least of these my brethren,
you did it to me.&quot;  I take that verse very seriously.  But
before we blindly use it to justify the welfare state, we need
to ask, who are the least of these in America?  What kind of help
is real help?  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, children threatened with death before birth
by abortion are among the least of these.   Women abandoned by
their husbands, and children who grow up without fathers, also
have it very rough.   But what about able-bodied homeless men?
Does irresponsibility qualify a person for the ranks of the least
of these?  And how does enabling mothers and fathers to desert
each other help children?  How does the fostering of fatalistic
attitudes help children?
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A fourth criticism goes like this:  Today,  money
to help the poor won't be forthcoming unless people are taxed
and Washington spends.  But we need to keep two thoughts in mind.
First, much welfare money today is wasted and worse than wasted,
since it actually does harm.   Second, we do need  a system of
tax credits by which taxpayers could send less to the government
and more to private and church charitable organizations that provide
assistance to the poor.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the place to get into a full-scale discussion
of tax credits, but the idea fits with the distinction I made
earlier between providing and promoting.  We're in our current
mess because the government has attempted to provide welfare rather
than promote civic action.  Tax credits such as those proposed
by  Senator Dan Coats (R-Indiana) and others would promote community-based
poverty-fighting charities by allowing taxpayers to send money
directly to those organizations and take the money off their taxes.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For each dollar taxpayers chose to allocate in this
way, their tax burden would be reduced by that amount-$500 or
$1000 in some plans, more in others.  The  amount of money allocated
to government welfare programs would also decrease, dollar for
dollar, as the private, taxpayer-chosen programs grew.  Tax credits
are a great mechanism for taking money off the top, from the governmental
superstructure, and sticking it back on the bottom, in private
and religious charities, where it can do the most good. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, I don't want to fall into the trap of thinking
that a particular piece of legislation is the solution. Tax credits
will work, but they are still just a mechanism, and they will
rust like other mechanisms unless hearts keep them lubricated.
 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings me to the fifth criticism of my testimony
to you: Some pundits say that most Americans just won't help others
anymore.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, people, ordinary people, are helping others
all over the country: Why can't more? I cannot prove that they
will. As long as government welfare remains, it leads potential
helpers to sit back, since they are paying for someone else to
do it.  We face a Catch-22: We won't have the alternatives until
we need them, but we won't get them as long as government programs
remain in place.  How do we break out of the trap?<BR>

<P>
<H3>Dreams Remembered</H3>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people say that there's a public policy answer
here-and tax credits are a partial answer.  But the more time
I spend in Washington, the more I'm reminded of  the recommendation
from a junior high school science class: &quot;For a nosebleed,
put the nose much lower than the body until the heart stops.&quot;

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way to break through now is to go above and
beyond the call of economic logic-to remember dreams, and to be
moved by God to volunteer to bring them to life.  We need to knock
out the welfare establishment, but we will only be able to do
that if people around the country are able to demonstrate that
the alternatives do work.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to take large leaps, but change starts with
a single step-a single step that each person in this room, whether
you're a college student or whether you've been out in the community
for decades, can take, starting now. Taking that first step will
require an act of will and courage and faith on the part of each
individual.  For many of you with good but hectic jobs, it is
easier to send a check than to suffer with others-but it's that
personal involvement which is desperately needed. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not very comfortable talking about myself, but
my colleagues have told me that I need to tell people that I've
taken some steps before I ask them to take one themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;I'll
quickly mention a few of the learning opportunities that God has
put in front of me. At various times my wife and I have been able
to give a room in our home to needy individuals, including a homeless
woman and a pregnant teenager. We've been able to tutor and to
coach kids in baseball, and to mentor many younger men and women.
We've been blessed with three children born to us, and we've been
able to adopt a fourth.  I recommend both methods of family expansion.
We should be doing more.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's a confession: I'm not a particularly hospitable
individual.  I'd rather spend time in libraries than on the streets.
And as I've been traveling so much this past year, I've fallen
into the trap that I tell others to avoid:  Maybe helping in little
ways here and there, but not following through consistently enough
with one poor individual. 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But my failings lead me to think that if once in a
while, I can do something that's a little decent, why can't people
of much finer qualities do the same, or even more? I know very
well, from personal experience,  that many things, including some
good intentions, get in the way of personal involvement with others.
But I'll ask each of you the same question I ask myself:  Can't
we do something?  And why can't we do more? 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you try to picture in your mind's eye one poor
person whom you have directly helped during the past year, do
you see anyone? If you do, good-and can you do more?  If you can't
picture anyone, here's the hard question: Will you take a first
step? Will you tutor a child for one hour a week? Will you be
a big brother, a big sister, or a little league coach? Will you
volunteer at an organization in this metropolitan area that offers
true compassion-challenging, personal, and spiritual? Will you
provide biblical counsel to a young, unmarried pregnant woman?
If you are able to do this, will you give her a room in your
home? If you're able to, will you adopt a child? 
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes the first step is hard.  But we are surrounded
by hundreds of thousands of people now, and millions over the
past two centuries, who have taken first steps, and many more.
Like you, I have moments of pessimism, but overall I am optimistic:
I am seeing a growing understanding around this country of what
effective compassion is.  First comes thought, then action: I
am hopeful that we will soon see an enormous outpouring of effective
voluntarism. It's as if we have been in a desert, and suddenly
the Red Sea is parted before us and we're beginning to walk through.
I've often wondered how astounded the Israelites must have been
as they walked through.  They must have been amazed-but there
were probably a few who kept muttering, &quot;It's all an optical
illusion.&quot; We're beginning to cross the Red Sea now.  
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I spent time last year in south central Los Angeles
and on the upper east side of Manhattan.  I talked with people
over lunches in dingy cafeterias and at a few fancy dinners. 
I can say, based on that experience,  that across America people
of many faiths, income levels, and races, are refusing to give
up on the dream of effective compassion. More people are capturing
the understanding  that the major flaw of the modern welfare state
is not that it is extravagant, but that it is too stingy.  It
gives the needy bread and tells them to be content with that alone.
More people are recapturing the optimism that a look at history
can provide.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;More people are saying, in the words of the Bible
that are inscribed on the famous bell in Philadelphia, &quot;Proclaim
liberty throughout  the land, and to all the inhabitants thereof.&quot;
Let's not settle for the new slavery of welfare.  Let's be agents
of change who proclaim liberty to all the inhabitants this nation.
With God's grace and your help, we can.<BR>

<h2>A Century of Service: Palmer Home for Children</h2>
By Joe Maxwell
<P>
Easter 1907 had just passed and summer was at hand. The lawn surrounding
Palmer Orphanage's two large brick buildings was a carpet of green,
&quot;so inviting to the little ones,&quot; wrote Florence Foster
Frierson, the orphanage's head matron and the wife of Palmer superintendent
William V. Frierson.
<P>
Mrs. Frierson was a devout Presbyterian who loved watching a summer
rainstorm, seeing new growth break through the Mississippi soil,
or hearing children recite their catechism from beginning to end
for the very first time.
<P>
On this April day, she rode to the local train station with a
cheerful heart. But in seconds, it was broken. Mrs. Frierson heard
a baby cry and ran to the arriving train: there the frail form
of a dying woman trembled as she descended the train steps. Two
&quot;older tots&quot; stayed close by her; a man accompanied
them, carrying a crying infant. &quot;My heart leaped into my
throat, and for a moment I seemed ready to yield to a flood of
tears,&quot; Mrs. Frierson recalled.
<P>
A Christian mother, ill with cancer, was bringing her children
to the Palmer Orphanage. &quot;These three little girls, although
badly spoiled having had a sick mother so long are promising children,&quot;
reported Mrs. Frierson. As the mother bid her offspring good-bye,
Mrs. Frierson could only watch and pray. Then the woman turned
to Mrs. Frierson and, with tears streaming down her face, made
this last request: &quot;Teach my children to meet me in heaven.&quot;
<P>
Palmer Home for Children in Columbus, Mississippi has a glorious,
gut-wrenching, and godly history filled with countless true stories
of God's awesome and sometimes awful movements among his people,
of men and women committed to his service, and of children always
the children who have formed the heart and soul of Palmer Home.
<P>
More than one hundred years after its founding in 1895, many incidentals
about Palmer Home have changed. But, remarkably, despite the flux
of American and church history, its essence remains intact.
<P>
Today, Palmer Home mends the scars of and models evangelical Christian
values to some seventy-five boys and girls from broken or needy
homes. As pundits and policymakers debate the &quot;issue&quot;
of childcare and consider the &quot;options,&quot; Palmer Home
offers the reality of a century's experience in long-term residential
group childcare.
<P>
Orphanages established by Christian communities were popular refuges
for children in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
(There were as many as 1,000 in America in 1919.) But they fell
from favor, and foster care programs regulated by secular governments
took their place. By the 1960s and 70s, the vast majority of orphanages
had closed, and their children were placed in foster care, a system
which often handled them as players in a game of musical chairs.
Remarkably, Palmer Home for Children survived.
<P>
Three distinct periods characterize the existence of Palmer Home.
In some measure, they reflect larger historical developments in
the nation and in attitudes toward child welfare. Palmer was founded
in the post-Civil War South, a traumatic period of economic poverty
and racial segregation, but deep religious faith. Its growth under
superintendent John Frierson, responded to the rise of Progressivism,
the Great Depression, and two world wars. Palmer's current character
was forged in the post-war years as a New South overcame racial
divisions and social isolation. Despite government's burgeoning
role in the work of child welfare, which has threatened to undermine
local initiatives and religious authority, Palmer Home has retained
its independence as a faith-based charity supported by voluntary
gifts and bequests.
<P>
Here is its story.
<P>
<B>Palmer's Founding: A Charity in the Post-Civil War South</B>

<P>
Palmer Orphanage, now Palmer Home for Children, was founded by
William States Jacobs, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church
of Columbus, Mississippi, a small town in the northeastern part
of the state. The son of the founder of South Carolina's Thornwell
Orphanage, he challenged his congregation to start its own orphanage
which he named after Benjamin Morgan Palmer, a leading Southern
Presbyterian churchman.
<P>
Palmer received its charter on April 29, 1895. Fifteen acres of
land were purchased and by 1898 a two-story building was erected
at a cost of $3,000. Records show that every congregation in town,
including the Jewish synagogue, helped in the construction, as
did a &quot;committee of outsiders,&quot; interested citizens
not involved in church affairs. By 1904, 45 boys and girls were
living separately in the two buildings. Palmer Orphanage was debt-free.
<P>
A year later, Civil War veteran William Frierson became Palmer
Orphanage's third superintendent. Frierson had fought in the Battle
of Gettysburg where he was wounded and captured by Union forces.
An ordained preacher advanced in years when he arrived at Palmer,
Frierson was a tough and principled Southern Calvinist. With his
wife Florence, he established the moral tone and the philosophical
backbone of Palmer Orphanage.
<P>
In their newsletter, <I>The Charity Ledger</I>, William Frierson
laid down the priorities of the orphanage: &quot;First, the material
interests of the home must be looked after. . . . Second, the
spiritual interests of our children must not be neglected. The
head and the heart both need cultivation. . . . Besides the regular
morning and evening devotional exercises, our children attend
Sunday school and preaching at the Presbyterian church where their
advantages are first class.&quot;
<P>
For the next 70 years Palmer's children would sing in the Columbus
First Presbyterian Church choir. They would attend its Sunday
services and comprise much of its youth group. Their social life
would center on church activities.
<P>
The children were clearly the delight of the Friersons and the
matrons who assisted them. The orphanage soon took on the feel
of a family. One pastor from Vicksburg dropped off four children
and stayed for two days. He would write: &quot;I have never seen
a healthier or happier looking lot of children. . . . What pleased
me most was the family-like atmosphere of it and the absence of
that machinelike government that may be seen in so many institutions.
I noticed that the children ran over to your house whenever they
felt like it with the same confidence that any little child runs
to its father's house.&quot;
<P>
Early records show that the matrons made Palmer a home. Miss Pressly,
the little boys' matron, took her boys for walks to the Tombigbee
River. Other matrons took girls and boys on picnics in the woods,
gathering flowers and berries, and singing songs. Both child and
adult at Palmer Orphanage enjoyed the country. Life was simple,
and it was governed by the seasons and the weather more than we
can imagine.
<P>
One day Florence Frierson watched as Miss Pressly said good-bye
to two young boys. She was to begin her one month's summer leave.
(Imagine 70 children, three caretakers, and no air-conditioning!)
Miss Pressly walked to the front gate, kissed the two boys good-bye,
and turned away. One child, William, called out, &quot;Miss Pressly!&quot;
and ran to kiss her yet again.
<P>
Donors were faithful to Palmer Orphanage in those early days,
and improvements were made to the campus. By 1909, there were
67 children. Palmer had almost two girls for every boy in 1911.
These ratios varied, but they reflected the greater mobility of
older boys who could leave and move into the world to find manual
work. In 1912, expenditures overtook receipts by $1,212 and the
trustees became concerned as the orphanage began to run a constant
debt. By 1915, with the Kaiser on the march and cotton at five
cents a pound, one report noted the campus was &quot;beginning
to suffer from want of repairs.&quot;
<P>
The elderly Friersons' letters to supporters were filled with
gentle but urgent pleas for monetary as well as prayer support.
As if to deny the effects of time and the scarcity of resources,
Florence observed in one: &quot;In talking with one of our faithful
workers yesterday, we agreed that we would look no longer at circumstances,
and would put discouragement behind us, while we labor on for
these little ones.&quot;
<P>
John Frierson, the son of William and Florence, could tell that
his parents needed him and that it was time to return to them.
A successful lawyer and teacher in Port Gibson, a town in southwestern
Mississippi near the Mississippi River, he bid his friends good-bye
and joined his parents at Palmer in 1910.
<P>
A 1912 note from John Frierson to supporters suggests the orphanage's
plight: &quot;From a human standpoint the outlook is cloudy. The
close of the fiscal year for . . . 1911 found us several hundred
dollars in debt, due to the falling off of receipts during the
summer months, our increased expenses for necessary improvements,
failure of [a] well, confinement in [the] hospital of [a] child
for months, and other things. . . . Unless our friends come up
more generously to our help, the balance will be against us before
the end of March. . . . Friends, the work is yours. We are your
servants.&quot;
<P>
<B>The John Frierson Years: A Standard-Bearer for Troubled Times</B>

<P>
Pete Robinson didn't mind the mile walk to school over hilly roads
that often were dusty or muddy. For decades, he and other Palmer
children did a lot of walking. But on this day Pete, a sparkplug
of a teenager, was making a different trek, one that surely caused
his bones to quiver more than any nail-driving tackle he endured
quarterbacking Columbus' high school football team.
<P>
Pete made his way downtown to the law offices of John Frierson
near the First Presbyterian Church, where the Palmer children
regularly attended. Before he knew it, he was being greeted by
a secretary. &quot;Have a seat and let me go get Mr. John,&quot;
she said. Before he could get comfortable, Mr. John beckoned.
<P>
By this time, around the 1930s, &quot;Mr. John&quot; had grown
to be a thin, tall man with a wrinkled face, drooping jowls, and
a slightly pointed head, all of which was covered by his magnificent,
perfectly combed, gray hair. The bachelor-lawyer and full-time
surrogate father of hundreds was a portrait of Presbyterian distinction.
<P>
He removed his glasses and took time to talk a bit with Pete about
his transgression. Mr. John was calm and gentle. He cared about
each child. But Pete had broken the rules, and he knew full well
the consequences.
<P>
Mr. John took off his belt and applied it to Pete's backside.
The high-school quarterback, who was recently inducted into the
National Wrestling Hall of Fame, never doubted he warranted the
licks and felt he profited from them. It often hurt much more
just to disappoint Mr. John. Pete and other boys would say routinely
for years to come: &quot;I never got a whippin' I didn't deserve.&quot;
<P>
Frierson also understood, however, that children deserved support
and encouragement, even when they acted impulsively. Once, in
December of 1935, a girl left Palmer and married a boy without
telling Mr. John, who was concerned when he heard of the girl's
choice in mates. Nonetheless, he wrote her a letter that said
this, in part:
<P>
&quot;<I>Of course we were all surprised and shocked to hear of
your marriage and I regret the manner in which it occurred. It
is the first time that we have had a run away marriage. It was
altogether unnecessary on this occasion. I have always dealt openly
and frankly with all you children. You were old enough to marry
and make up your own mind and if you had told me that you were
going to marry and had made up your mind to marry I would have
gone with you to stand by you on such an occasion. I want you
to know of my love and affection and continued interest for your
happiness.</I>
<P>
<I>&quot;I sincerely hope that you will think seriously and put
into practice all the principles of righteousness and faith and
trust that we have endeavored to instill through all these years.
You will need them now, more than ever, and if you and [your husband]
determine upon the course of life that the Bible maps out you
can succeed and get along, live useful lives and be happy.</I>
<P>
<I>&quot;I am enclosing to you a check for $10 with love and good

<P>
<I>John Frierson&quot;</I> 
<P>
Experiencing a consistent and caring discipline, many children
came to realize that they had stumbled upon a prize living out
in that cow pasture-turned-orphanage: a lanky, loving man who
was there for them in good times and bad. John Frierson, in this
sense, was the standard at Palmer Home for Children against whom
all others would be measured. He was the benchmark of consistency,
selflessness, and caring.
<P>
Frierson was Mississippi's representative to the White House Conference
on Child Health and Protection called by President Hoover and
held in Washington, D.C. in 1930. By this time, a new class of
&quot;professional&quot; and &quot;progressive&quot; social workers
was calling for federal aid and action to develop comprehensive
codes governing the supervision and support of children who had
no homes. They argued that traditional, church-run efforts were
sentimental and sloppy. And they were hostile to orphanages. Men
like Charles Loring Brace, founder of the New York Children's
Aid Society, attacked orphanages for what he considered their
&quot;institutionalization&quot; of children. He and others campaigned
for what has become the modern system of foster-care placement.
The novelist Theodore Dreiser, the editor of <I>The Delineator</I>
women's magazine from 1907-1909, urged systematic government involvement
in childcare and published case histories of children offered
for adoption.
<P>
Frierson's correspondence makes clear that he didn't like it.
Frierson's words concerning the growing role of government in
caring for children seem almost prophetic today. &quot;I became
convinced and am still convinced that the adoption plan is wrong
for an orphanage. . . . There is no assurance of any religious
influence,&quot; he wrote. Government rule-making, he felt, practically
guaranteed that there would be no serious regard for religion
in the character formation and moral upbringing of children.
<P>
John Frierson was more than just a local lawyer with some ideas
about church and government. He was a scholar of Latin and the
classics, a reciter of good poetry, and a principled civic leader
who matched wits with the notorious Mississippi governor Theodore
Bilbo, who once called Frierson a &quot;pious, church-fed hypocrite&quot;
after Frierson dealt him a minor political defeat.
<P>
In one unfortunate respect, Frierson was a man of his time and
place, accepting racial segregation as a fact of life. But unlike
Bilbo's determined efforts to inflame racial hatreds, Frierson's
strong Christian convictions however tainted by cultural dictates prompted
him to treat all men and women with respect. Palmer's charter
establishing a home for &quot;white orphans or children of reputable
character, one of whom is dead&quot; was changed to admit black
children in the early 1970s. Palmer's present administration is
committed to serving children of all racial backgrounds, and three
black children currently live at the home.
<P>
Palmer's children surely knew little of the South's tortuous path
toward racial justice. Instead, each morning they saw Mr. John
walk up and down their ranks as they stood for inspection before
school outside the Lindamood building, named for a local donor.
And in the evening, they could hear the operas that he played
on his record player. The girls would entertain their boyfriends
in Mr. John's parlor as he read in a chair nearby. And anyone
was welcome to borrow books from his personal collection.
<P>
The campus was increasing in size and scope. By 1929, Mr. John
reported that the Palmer Orphanage comprised 110 acres, four brick
buildings, one brick laundry, a brick dairy, two good barns, a
smokehouse, and &quot;a splendid herd of Jersey cows.&quot; &quot;The
properties are worth $80,000,&quot; he stated, while the yearly
deficit had grown to $7,888.90.
<P>
In 1931, Palmer Orphanage was in the same shape structurally.
But the financial ruin of the Great Depression was hitting more
than New York stockbrokers. Mr. John found more and more destitute
children knocking on his door, and the care for a typical child
cost $20 a month. He told a church synod meeting in 1931: &quot;We
have not increased our capacity for children and do not intend
to, but it [is] impossible for us to deny children who need these
benefits when we have a place to put them.&quot;
<P>
<B>The Rhythm of Life at Palmer Home</B> 
<P>
A day in the life of Palmer Home remained pretty much the same
for decades. The rooster crowed before sunrise, waking the sleepy
girls in the Lindamood building and the boys in two nearby buildings.
By five o'clock or shortly thereafter, several older boys were
walking through the muggy darkness to the back barn, where they
milked a herd of dairy cowswhich they often named after the girls.
In the days before refrigeration the boys would fill large milk
pails and place them in a three foot-deep cement trough filled
with cold artesian water.
<P>
Meanwhile, teams of older girls worked in rotation on monthly
assignments, rising early to make biscuits and toast. There was
hired help, too. As Mr. John recalled in his memoirs:
<P>
&quot;A negro woman was the cook, with the help of the older girls
to bring in the food to the table and to wash the dishes after
meals. A negro man for the garden and lot, and three older boys
to milk the cows. There were coal fires in grates, the coal had
to be carried up stairs to the rooms, and the ashes brought down.
The lighting was by oil lamps and the wicks were trimmed daily
and the chimneys cleaned.&quot;
<P>
At six o'clock a bell would ring. The girls would break their
huddle by the floor heater where they were memorizing their daily
Scripture or catechism, and then everyone would converge on the
dining hall. Girls wearing pants or curlers were sent back upstairs
to change. Miss Clara Swoope, Miss Zina Witherspoon, or another
of the matrons would hear children recite their &quot;memory work&quot;
for the day. After recitation, the children could enter the dining
hall, sit down, and wait.
<P>
Ring! Mr. John struck his bell and called for silence, then a
blessing was offered and the eating began. &quot;Watch the milk
this morning,&quot; one boy might whisper, &quot;the cows have
been eating the bitter weed!&quot; After breakfast, Mr. John read
a Scripture for the day from his Bible. Then everyone sang a song
and were adjourned for school. Before departure, they reassembled
in front of Lindamood, where Mr. John reviewed their appearance.
<P>
Then off to school. In its first decade, Palmer established its
own two-room schoolhouseone room for the boys, the other for the
girls. But by Mr. John's time, all Palmer children were attending
local public schools, and stories abound of friendships made with
children from town. Palmer children were invited to local family
homes and participated in all school activities.
<P>
After school, a few boys stayed for sports practice, but most
children returned home and did chores: girls shucking corn or
shelling beans around the house; the boys in the gardens or among
the livestock. On Saturdays, for years, the girls scrubbed the
stove, piece by piece, and cleaned chickens for Sunday dinner.
<P>
At six o'clock in the evening another bell rang, and the children
reassembled for supper, after which Mr. John read to them from
whatever book he might be consuming, perhaps <I>The Black Rose</I>
or <I>Pilgrim's Progress</I>.
<P>
All agreed that it was wonderful listening to Mr. John read: &quot;He
had a good, solid presentation voice,&quot; recalled Pete Robinson,
who came to Palmer at six years of age in 1926 after his father
was killed working in a lumberyard.
<P>
Often the sound of Mr. John's firm voice was all a child needed
for motivation. Billy Wray, who attended Palmer from 1930 until
1943, recalls the day the boys chose to swim at the river instead
of work on the farm. That evening Mr. John announced, &quot;Well,
I drove around Bolin's Bend this afternoon and I noticed more
grass than corn down there.&quot; Mr. John's voice made its point.
&quot;The next day we were down there getting the grass out of
the corn,&quot; recalled Wray in an interview.
<P>
Nights were spent at study hall, or in sitting and talking and
watching younger children play jacks on the sidewalk. Often Mr.
John would have children over to help them with their studies.
&quot;We would go over at night for him to help us with our homework,&quot;
recalled Evelyn McPhail, now a co-chairman of the Republican National
Committee who works with RNC chairman Haley Barbour. McPhail grew
up at Palmer in the 1940s and 50s. &quot;We'd be waiting our turn;
you'd sit on a little stool at his feet, and he would take the
book and sit there and help you with your Latin lessons.&quot;
<P>
Mr. John doled out the discipline according to the sex of the
offender. While boys might feel the sting of a curtain sash, girls
were rarely physically punished. They were made to sit with Mr.
John at his house and listen to classical music! One thing was
clear: mutual love and respect always prevailed. Perhaps no event
better illustrates this than one of the sadder moments in Palmer's
life: it was 1935, and Matron Clara Swoope was dying. Mr. John
recounted it this way:
<P>
&quot;I came home from Jackson one Friday night in 1935. After
breakfast Miss Clara followed me to my house and said, `Mr. John,
I went to see Dr. Lehmberg while you were gone and he told me
I was going to be sick. I want you and him to talk and tell me
what I must do.'&quot;
<P>
Mr. John and the doctor agreed that, in her late stage of cancer,
she should forgo treatment. He offered her a room at his house,
but the other matrons decided to set up Miss Clara in her own
room at the head of the stairs. Some days passed, and Miss Clara's
condition worsened. A local pastor came to visit and pray with
her. &quot;I think my sins have been forgiven,&quot; she told
him. &quot;Your sins, Miss Clara? You've got no sins,&quot; he
replied.
<P>
Mr. John, knowing that she was &quot;passing from earth to heaven,&quot;
prayed for Miss Clara, reading John 14:1-4. Then he and the children
sang &quot;When the Gates Swing Outward.&quot;
<P>
Early Saturday morning, November 23, 1935, Clara Swoope died and
was buried the same day. &quot;She knew and loved a child,&quot;
Mr. John said. &quot;It was not a detached interest, nor was there
any coddling familiarity, but an inspiring expectation of the
best to come. . . . Miss Clara was the finest expression of cultured
Christian womanhood: modest, retiring, self-effacing, the very
best kind of guide to youth. Her memory will be sacred, and a
benediction for years to come. She was indeed a servant of God
to the end of her days. She was so wise and so good and we are
thankful for her.&quot;
<P>
Palmer youth were taught to live useful lives. Fifteen Palmer
men served their country in World War I, and 54 in World War II.
When the Mississippi River flooded to record levels in 1927, two
Palmer girls who were working at Greenville, Mississippi called
Mr. John to let him know the levee had busted. &quot;Don't you
think we should get out of here?&quot; one asked. &quot;Well,
honey, do they need you?&quot; he queried. When she said yes,
he told them to stay where they were and sent some Palmer boys
to help out, too.
<P>
Mr. John never stopped loving his children. He was strong for
them to the end. Yet time finally caught up with Mr. John, and
it threatened to catch up with Palmer.
<P>
The money never seemed to be there. By 1945, the oldest boy at
the orphanage was a mere 14, and Mr. John was forced to supervise
the milking. In his 1947 superintendent's report to the Mississippi
synod, Frierson stated plaintively: &quot;For the improvements
that are desirable and necessary, I hardly know how to relate
it.&quot;
<P>
Finally, in 1950, Mr. John Frierson retired from Palmer Orphanage.
Perhaps he foresaw the hard times and struggles that were to come.
On December 7, 1957, Mr. John died at the age of 81, seven years
to the day that he retired. In his forty years at Palmer, John
Frierson had served some 600 to 800 children.
<P>
One day in 1959, the attorneys sent Palmer an official letter
accompanied by a check for $6,657.02 payable to the orphanage
from the estate of Mr. John F. Frierson. After paying for his
burial expenses, Mr. John had designated that whatever funds were
left be given to Palmer. During four decades of service, Mr. John
had taken no salary, sustaining himself on his lawyer's income.
<P>
One Calvinistic account of John Frierson's father, William, had
observed that his life was &quot;fraught with usefulness.&quot;
It added that his son &quot;John . . . [is] now filling places
of usefulness and honor.&quot; As his good Calvinist father before
him, and his beloved matron Miss Clara, Mr. John had led a useful
lifedown to his last dollar.
<P>
<B>Palmer's New Era: Change and Continuity</B> 
<P>
When Mr. John moved out of Palmer's life, &quot;Papa Joe&quot;
Davis moved in. God once again proved sovereign for Palmer Home.
<P>
Photos abound of Papa Joe playing with the children. One shows
him on his knees near Christmastime, giving a youth a ride on
his back. It was said that if you would collect the pecans, Papa
Joe would bake you a fruitcake.
<P>
Davis endeared himself to the children. Howard Kelly, a Palmer
resident from 1953 to 1962, recalled the children's initial impression:
&quot;He was a big man. I expect he weighed over 230 pounds. He
probably stood 6-2, 6-3; he had a size 52 belt. As a child saw
him, he was even bigger. He got your attention!&quot;
<P>
Papa Joe tried to maintain the Frierson legacy. But society was
changing all around Palmer. Children began growing their hair
long and rebelling against their parents. The music they listened
to was decidedly different from Mr. John's operatic arias. Davis
needed to negotiate these changes with care.
<P>
For instance, Mr. John had centered the children's lives on what
happened at Palmer Home. He had allowed young men to visit Palmer
girls only in his parlor and in his presence. Davis let the girls
go out on dates. Palmer's young women were encouraged to participate
in the activities of the larger society.
<P>
Papa Joe also addressed the need for more housing at Palmer. But
instead of constructing dormitories, he built cottage-style homes.
This shift in building type actually represented a shift in the
idea of what an orphanage can be. It became less a village and
more a gathering of family-sized homes. This important shift reflected
new ideas in the best way to care for children. Today Palmer houses
its children in seven cottage homes staffed by seven sets of houseparents.
<P>
The new construction took money. Like those before him, Davis
knew that he had to make the orphanage's resources stretch as
far as they could. &quot;I never really had to ask for the money
to build those cottages,&quot; recalled Davis. &quot;I just made
known to the churches what our plans were to care for these children,
and the money came in.&quot; A Palmer trustee once said, &quot;Joe
Davis will take 50 cents and get a dollar's worth for it.&quot;
Davis was helped by the South's post-war prosperity and by his
abilities as a fundraiser and money-manager.
<P>
Palmer continued its tradition of self-sustaining frugality. For
instance, when an old building was scheduled for demolition, the
bricks were cleaned and stacked so that they might be used to
construct the new cottages. The farm program continued, also,
raising beef cattle and hogs to provide meat for the children
and staff. But the home also embraced the modern economy, using
its resources to create more wealth for its children's benefit.
Palmer planted ten of its acres with pine trees that were intended
for sale to a paper mill.
<P>
Davis saw Palmer through the upheaval of the sixties and seventies.
&quot;I never really noticed any effect on our children at Palmer
Home. We just kept doing what we had always done: Give them the
most love and most opportunities we could,&quot; he said.
<P>
Nonetheless, Palmer has seen more changes as the years went by.
Palmer was made responsible to an independent Board of Directors
in 1979, ending official presbyterian governance of on-site administration.
Trained counselors, administrators and nurses have been added
to the staff of houseparents, increasing their expertise in dealing
with troubled children. And the process of admitting children
has been refined. Referrals come from churches, distressed parents
who voluntarily yield their children, the courts and social agencies.
<P>
Still, Palmer continues to specialize in providing homes for children
with promise. Each Palmer child has suffered indignities. One
hundred percent of the current residents come from broken families:
75 percent out of drug or alcohol abuse; about 15 percent out
of physical abuse; and upwards of 50 percent suffer from neglect.
Palmer makes a special effort to hold together siblings who might
otherwise be split up in modern foster care. Currently, Palmer
has ten sets of two siblings, four sets of three siblings, five
sets of four siblings, one set of five siblings and another of
seven. &quot;Virtually all our kids come from a family that is
below the poverty line,&quot; says Dr. Rob Crankshaw, Palmer's
director of counseling services. &quot;We find that a lot of the
parents came from good middle or upper middle class families.
But because of drug abuse or related situations, they just can't
hold jobs, get into all kinds of trouble, and they plunge into
poverty.&quot;
<P>
Since Davis's retirement in the late 1970s, four other men have
led the Palmer Home for Children. Their's has been the responsibility
of defining and carrying out the mission of a privately-funded
Christian orphanage. This is not easy in a secular society whose
institutions are heavily funded and regulated by government. Moreover,
as House Speaker Newt Gingrich discovered, many Americans have
very unfavorable stereotypical images of orphanages.
<P>
Today, Ed Waldron is executive director of Palmer Home for Children,
a post he held as the institution celebrated its 1995 centennial.
A Ph.D. in higher education administration with years of experience
in childcare, Waldron presides over a $1.8 million budget and
a staff of 20 who provide the care for some 75 boys and girls.
Palmer Home is preparing to improve and expand its programs as
it enters its second century of service.
<P>
Yet despite all that is new, the essentials remain. Palmer is
still covered with the sounds and sights of children, and with
the sounds and sights of adults watching over them.
<P>
Some of the current caretakers have the exuberant heart of a Florence
Frierson. Others have the strong countenance of a William or John
Frierson, capable of stopping a child cold in his mischief, or
repairing a broken spirit with one firm, kind glance. And the
many successors to Miss Clara Swoope remain on campus, housemothers
who quietly make everything all right.
<P>
A walk around Palmer's campus today would bring joy to Mr. John's
eyes. &quot;They are bright and interesting and as carefree and
happy as if they owned a bank or, perhaps, more so. Why shouldn't
they be? They have lots of fresh air and water, and a sufficiency
of food and clothes, and good friends and jolly playmates.&quot;
John Frierson wrote those words in 1912. Today, Palmer Home for
Children ensures that they still ring true.

<h2>MacArthur's Genius Awards</h2>
<b><I>The Oscars of the Multicultural Elite</I></b><BR>
By <a href="/crc/about/people.html#Wooster">Martin Morse Wooster</a>
<BR><BR>

<blockquote>
<P><i>&quot;At the risk of revisionism or of blasphemy, I also 
suggest that the merits of the star system and of elitism, which is a 
star system extended to a highly refined group, be recalled.  
The onerous dangers of the star system have been exposed: 
the confusion of star and movement, of elite and group; the 
selection of the `star' through the media or through current 
governors, not through the movement; the feeding of the egos of 
the few while the many suffer malnutrition.&quot;</I>
<P>
<P><a href="pcs-196a.html">Catharine R. Stimpson</a>, 
<br>Director,
<br>MacArthur Fellows Program (1974) 
</blockquote>
<P>It happens every summer.  Sometime during the dog days 
of June or July, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur 
Foundation announces the <a href="pcs-196b.html">winners</a> of the annual MacArthur 
Fellows Program, the so-called &quot;genius grants.&quot;  Around 20 
people, some famous, many obscure, are awarded unrestricted 
five-year grants of between $150,000 and $350,000  which they 
can use for any purpose they desire.
<P>
The MacArthur Fellows Program is a relatively small part 
of the giant MacArthur Foundation's activities.  In 1994, 
the foundation awarded $130 million in grants, of which $6 
million was allotted to the fellows program and an additional 
$500,000 on an allied trust.  Between 1989 and 1994, the 
MacArthur Foundation approved $736 million in grants, of which 
$48 million, or seven percent, was allotted to the fellows program. 
 Nearly every other division of the foundation has a 
larger budget, and some of MacArthur's divisions, such as the 
programs to promote world peace and the health program, 
have budgets twice as large as the MacArthur Fellows program.
<P>But despite its low budget, the Fellows program 
probably generates most of the publicity about the MacArthur 
Foundation, and explains why MacArthur is one of the few 
recognized &quot;brand names&quot; in the foundation world.  There are two 
reasons for this.  First, as <I>The New Republic's 
</I>Robert Wright once noted, the  MacArthurs are one of the few awards 
individuals can obtain.  Most of the time, most of the money in 
the philanthropic world goes to other non-profits, and 
individuals can't get money unless they affiliate themselves with an 
organization.  But since MacArthurs go to people and not to 
groups, everyone in America can daydream about getting one.  Had 
the MacArthur Foundation decided to award the same amount 
of money to 20 or 25 organizations each year instead of 
to individuals, the MacArthur Fellows program would have 
remained obscure.
<P>Second, the process of awarding MacArthurs 
eliminates most of the grantsmanship and paperwork
 associated with philanthropy.  Though the MacArthur Fellows routinely go 
to people who support causes to which John D. MacArthur 
would be opposed, the program certainly follows John D. 
MacArthur's philosophy of charity.  MacArthur, a hard-headed 
skinflint, routinely rejected anyone who came to him asking for 
money; the MacArthur Fellows similarly turn down all people 
who apply for grants, even if (as has apparently happened more 
than once) you go to MacArthur Foundation headquarters at 
South Dearborn Street in Chicago and claim that God came to you 
in a vision and demanded you receive a MacArthur fellowship. 
 The MacArthur Fellows program is one of the few activities 
of American philanthropy where you don't have to worry 
about pleasing a program officer to get a grant.
<P>
Moreover,  the people who get MacArthur fellowships 
can do whatever they want with the money. This ensures that 
the MacArthur Foundation seal of approval frequently goes 
to eccentric and radical endeavors.  According to former 
MacArthur fellows program director Kenneth Hope, if a MacArthur 
Fellow wanted &quot;to start a revolution in Afghanistan, here's 
the MacArthur Foundation with its face hanging out saying 
there was something special about that individual.&quot;
 (<a href="/crc/pcs/pcs-196b.html">Past Winners</a>)
<P>&quot;Old John D. MacArthur would perhaps be horrified 
by some of the labor organizers and activists who have gotten 
his money,&quot; essayist Richard Rodriguez noted in a 1994  article 
in the<I> Los Angeles Times</I>.  &quot;Yet, there remains about 
the MacArthur prizes a faith that is deeply Protestant, 
individualistic and capitalistic.  Give the artist big money and you 
will create big art.&quot;  Or, as son J. Roderick &quot;Rod&quot; 
MacArthur announced in a 1979 interview in 
<I>Forbes</I>, &quot;Like the Renaissance princes, we'll fund Michelangelo.&quot;
<P>
It's certainly true that many of the MacArthur recipients 
have been distinguished Americans,  For example,  two of the 
recent Nobel Laureates in Literature, Joseph Brodsky and 
Derek Walcott, had been MacArthur Fellows before they won 
the Nobel Prize.  And occasionally, there is a non-leftist 
recipient of the MacArthur Fellowship, such as philosopher 
Leszek Kolakowski, essayist Stanley Crouch,  or Robert Woodson 
of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise.
<P>
Far too often, however,  recipients of MacArthur 
Fellowships are  members of the hard left.  In a recent essay in 
<I>U.S. News and World Report</I>, John Leo noted that the 1995 
MacArthur Fellows included a feminist musicologist who argued  
that classical music largely consisted of &quot;aggressive pelvic 
pounding&quot; and a historian who argued that the history of the 
American West was the story of greedy, power-mad white males 
oppressing everyone else.  &quot;The truth is that the MacArthur 
awards, launched in 1981 to reward high achievement and high 
promise, are not what they once were,&quot; Leo wrote.  The 
science awards still seem to be given out fairly, but other 
selections pretty much have much more to do with politics than 
with achievement or potential.  A lot of the award winners are 
either ideologues...or low-luster laborers in the traditional 
vineyards of the left.&quot;
<P>
The idea of the MacArthur Fellowships originated 
with William Kirby, John D.  MacArthur's lawyer and a member 
of the MacArthur Foundation board until his death in 1990. 
 According to the <I>Chronicle of Higher 
Education</I>, sometime in the 1970s Kirby read an article by cardiologist George 
Burch calling for foundations to be more adventurous in 
their grantmaking.  Kirby passed the article on to Rod 
MacArthur, who found the idea of making scholars self-sufficient 
appealing.  Within a few weeks after John D. MacArthur's death 
in 1978,  Rod MacArthur had perfected the idea of the 
MacArthur Fellowships and had recommended that they be the 
primary purpose of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur 
Foundation.
<P>
Kenneth Hope,  a Rod MacArthur aide who 
subsequently directed the MacArthur Fellows program between 1982 
and 1992, described Rod MacArthur to  the<I> New York 
Times Magazine</I>: &quot;MacArthur was the kind of guy who 
harangued total strangers in restaurants about PCB levels in 
whitefish.&quot; MacArthur's fanaticism ensured that he would promote 
the MacArthur Fellows Program even though some of his 
advisers apparently warned him that unrestricted grants to 
individuals were not a good idea.  According to a 1979 article in 
<I>Science</I>, Murray Gell-Mann, the eminent physicist who 
subsequently became a member of th
e MacArthur Foundation  board,  reportedly told MacArthur that &quot;if he had received a windfall as 
a young scientist, he might have gone into real estate 
speculation.&quot;
<P>
It took two more years for the foundation to define the 
size and scope of the MacArthur Fellowships. This was an  
unsettled time in MacArthur Foundation history.  Between 1978 
and 1983, Rod MacArthur launched a barrage of lawsuits 
against the Foundation, charging that the foundation board was 
mismanaging the sale of Bankers Life, the giant insurance 
company created by John D. MacArthur and willed to the 
foundation upon the founder's death.  Because of the Tax Reform 
Act of 1969, the  foundation had to sell at least 80 percent of 
Bankers Life stock, because under the Tax Reform Act, a foundation 
can not own more than 20 percent of a company's stock.
<P>It's clear that part of the reason Rod MacArthur was 
hostile to the Foundation board was ideological, since Rod  was 
very liberal and the members of the board opposing him, such 
as radio commentator Paul Harvey and former Treasury 
Secretary William Simon, were conservatives.  &quot;We're mostly a bunch  
of Midwestern businessmen devoted to free enterprise and 
opposed to government controls,&quot; one board member told 
<I>The American Spectator'</I>s Joshua Muravchik in 1992. Paul 
Harvey added that he was appointed to the MacArthur 
Foundation board because John D. MacArthur &quot;knew we mostly feel 
the same way about things that he did.&quot;
<P>
But because of Rod MacArthur's lawsuits, the 
Foundation board was expanded to include liberals who did not know 
John D. personally.  By 1981, the conservatives had quit, 
ensuring that the MacArthur Foundation would be as liberal as 
Rod MacArthur.  But the younger MacArthur continued to sue 
the board until very shortly before his death in 1984.
<P>
According to John Corbally, the MacArthur 
Foundation's first president,  &quot;for a while the board was devoting only 
about one-quarter of its meeting time to program activities and the 
rest to the litigation.&quot; 
<P>&quot;I recall counting more than 30 lawyers at one board 
meetingthere was literally not a seat available,&quot; added 
MacArthur Foundation executive vice-president James M. Furman in 
a 1987 interview in the <I>Chronicle of Higher 
Education</I>.
<P>
It's unclear how all this turmoil affected the 
MacArthur Fellows program.  Kenneth Hope  told the 
<I>Washington Post i</I>n 1992 that the tension at the time was so great that he lost 
15 pounds during the first year of planning the program, due in 
part to endless late-night sessions and countless arguments.
<P>But it's certainly probable that had Rod MacArthur 
not launched his war against the MacArthur Foundation board, 
the MacArthur Fellows program might be far larger.  According 
to Hope, the MacArthur Foundation did resist two of 
MacArthur's ideas, awarding lifetime fellowships and tying the list 
of recipients to a list of world problems the foundation wanted 
to solve.  &quot;When we started this,&quot; Hope said, &quot;the first thing 
Rod asked me to do was to come up with a list of the 
world's problems.  His idea was that we would approach the 
individual through the problems.&quot;   (The 
MacArthur Foundation did award a few lifetime fellowships, but stopped this practice 
after Rod MacArthur's death.) 
<P>
<br>
<B>On the Lookout for Genius</B>
<P>
By 1981, the internal conflicts over the fellows program having been solved, 
the MacArthur Foundation picked 100 talent scouts to find prospective fellows.  
Since 1981, the names of these scouts have been kept secret, but the first list was leaked 
to <I>New York Times Magazine</I> writer Anne Matthews.  A few of the nominators, 
such as Woodrow Wilson Center director James Billington and philosopher Allan Bloom, were 
conservatives, but nearly all of the others were well-known liberals, 
including English professor Houston Baker, Jr., Carnegie 
Foundation president Ernest Boyer, <I>The New Republic 
</I>columnist Robert Brustein, author Frances FitzGerald, Independent Sector 
chairman John Gardner, literary critic Alfred Kazin, National 
Public Radio chairman Frank Mankiewicz, author Toni 
Morrison, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission chair 
Eleanor Holmes Norton, producer Joseph Papp, director Arthur 
Penn, cartoonist Garry Trudeau, and literary critic Helen Vendler. 
 Since then, prominent liberals known to have served 
as judges include historian John Hope Franklin, Children's 
Defense Fund president Marian Wright Edelman, former 
M.I.T. president Jerome Weisner, scientist Jonas Salk, physicist 
Murray Gell-Mann, and Center for Community Change director 
Pablo Eisenberg.
<P>This collection of the great and the good might very well 
tend to give prizes to  people very much like themselves.  When 
the first MacArthur Fellows were announced  in 1981, their 
harshest critic was <I>The New Republic'</I>s Michael Kinsley who 
noted that many of the recipients were winners of Pulitzer Prizes, 
or were tenured professors at Harvard, or, in the case of author 
and poet Robert Penn Warren, had been winning prizes for 
over fifty years before getting a MacArthur.  &quot;Given one or two 
of the names,&quot; Kinsley wrote, many people could come up 
with half a dozen others without knowing what the list was for.  
It could be this year's honorary degree recipients at Princeton, 
or a Presidential Commission on the Future of Values, or 
the celebrity endorsers for a particularly tony Scotch 
advertising campaign.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Not one of the first MacArthur fellows is 
suffering from lack of recognition for his or her talents,&quot; Kinsley added.  &quot;What's more, not 
one really faces financial obstacles in exercising 
his or her creativity.  They are already doing 
whatever it is the MacArthur Foundation admires them 
for doing; many are already doing quite well at it, and presumably they will keep on doing it, unless this windfall encourages them to stop."
<P>
Moreover, Kinsley argued, the MacArthur Fellows 
program contradicted the &quot;rugged individualism&quot; inherent in the life 
of John D. MacArthur, a heroic entrepreneur who began his 
career penniless and died a billionaire, never receiving a grant 
from anyone.  &quot;The basic theory of meritocracy is that in a 
free society the meritocratic virtuesimagination, daring, 
hard workwill produce their own reward, and in John 
D. MacArthur's case, for better or worse, they did.&quot;
<P>
The MacArthur Fellows program, Kinsley concluded, &quot;is 
not merely silly, but snooty; an exercise in invidious distinction 
for its own sake.&quot;
<P>
Despite Kinsley's trenchant criticisms, the MacArthur 
Fellows program has changed remarkably little between 1981 
and today.  Only one internal critique of the program has appeared. 
 According to a 1989 article in the <I>Chronicle of Higher 
Education</I>, when Adele Smith Simmons became president of 
the MacArthur Foundation in 1988, a review was undertaken of 
the Fellows program to see how it could be improved.  
One criticism was that no business leader had ever received 
a MacArthur fellowship.  &quot;We're competing with other 
mechanisms that reward people, and prominent among them has 
been the marketplace,&quot; Kenneth Hope responded.  &quot;There's 
little case for giving it to a millionaire.&quot;  No businessperson has 
won a fellowship since this review was made.
<P>In 1985, a MacArthur Fellowship was given to a man 
who was once denied a grant by John D. MacArthur.  According 
to author Denise Shekerjian, at an unspecified time (probably 
in the 1970s) Patrick Noonan, later to be president of the 
Nature Conservancy and the Conservation Fund, went to the 
Palm Beach, Fla. coffee shop where John D. MacArthur spent 
his days drinking coffee and making deals. &quot;You know, 
Mr. MacArthur, sir...saving the park 
lands...important wetlands...national heritage...ecology,&quot; Noonan 
expounded. &quot;Young man,&quot; MacArthur retorted, &quot;I've never given 
away anything in my life, and I'm not about to start now.&quot; He 
ordered Noonan to pay for his coffee and left.  Nonetheless, 
Noonan became a MacArthur Fellow in 1985, and the land he 
hoped MacArthur would donate became the John D. MacArthur 
State Park in 1989.
<P>By the early 1990s, the MacArthur Fellowship program 
had ceased to be a philanthropic novelty.  The New York Times</I>, which placed the yearly announcement of the 
MacArthur Fellows on its front page, pushed the announcement farther 
and farther back in the paper; by 1994, the announcement 
barely made the third section of the <I>Times</I>.  And when Kenneth 
Hope decided to quit as director of the program, the reason he 
gave was that the job had become routine.  &quot;I still love the 
program a great deal, but I wasn't getting the sort of inspiration I 
had before,&quot; Hope said.
<P>Nor was it clear what sort of inspiration the 
MacArthur Fellowships have provided.  In 1983, MacArthur 
Foundation president John Corbally announced that the foundation 
was 
conducting an internal review of the program to see what 
the fellows produced with their grants.  That review was 
apparently not made public, nor has any other systematic review known 
to have been undertaken since that time.
<P>
<P><B>Character, Productivity and Benefits</B>
<P>There is, however, a fair amount of anecdotal evidence about the 
uses fellows make of their MacArthur grants.  About five percent of 
the fellows, according to Matthews,  are unable to handle the stress the 
fellowships create, and suffer from writer's block or other  stress-related illnesses.
<P>&quot;If you are a good person to begin with,&quot; former MacArthur 
Fellows selection committee chairman William J. McGill told Matthews, 
&quot;a MacArthur makes you saintly and helps your work.  If you 
have flaws, the absolute freedom of the award quickly 
magnifies them.  If you have some deep personal weakness, some 
mean stress, a MacArthur will assuredly tear you apart.&quot; 
<P>The evidence suggests that the MacArthur Fellowship 
is most useful when it is given to younger scholars at the start 
of their careers.  When African-American essayist Henry 
Louis Gates Jr. received a MacArthur Fellowship in 1981, he was 
an untenured junior member of the Yale faculty.  During 
his fellowship, he wrote six books and became an important writer. 
 &quot;At a time when I was struggling to become a literary critic, 
(the MacArthur) gave me the self-confidence to be bold and 
experimental,&quot; Gates told the <I>Chronicle of Higher 
Education</I>.  Gates added that he used the MacArthur money to make several 
trips to Africa as well as to much of the United States.  &quot;I can't 
stress how important that was in my work.&quot;
<P>Tina Rosenberg, a free-lance writer, was inexplicably 
awarded a MacArthur award in 1987 at age 27. The prize helped her 
win a book contract to write about Latin America.  &quot;If not 
for MacArthur, I wouldn't have written the first book,&quot; she told 
the <I>Chicago Tribune</I>.
<P>
But for every success story, there is usually a tale of how 
the MacArthur blocked or even retarded a career.  Robert S. 
Root-Bernstein's  1981 MacArthur prize prevented him from 
getting a job.  At the time Root-Bernstein won the award, he had 
just received a doctorate from Princeton in biochemistry and 
was looking for a full-time position. The Salk Institute cut off 
his postdoctoral fellowship.  Former professors, envious of 
Root-Bernstein's prize, gave him the cold shoulder.  He ended 
up doing volunteer work at the Veterans Administration 
Medical Center in Los Angeles.  Not until Root-Bernstein's 
MacArthur fellowship had nearly expired did he finally find a job 
teaching introductory  biology at Michigan State.  &quot;I got dumped 
back into the same narrow-minded system I was liberated from,&quot; 
he told the <I>Los Angeles Times</I>.
<P>
The stories of Gates, Rosenberg, and Root-Bernstein, 
however, are not typical because they were young and 
untenured when they won their MacArthur Fellowships.  It's far 
more typical for a MacArthur to be awarded to an older, 
tenured professor, usually at an Ivy League school.   By 1987, 
for example, five MacArthur Fellowsphysicist David 
Gross, physicist Joseph H. Taylor, historian Robert Darnton, 
physicist Edward Witten, and astrophysicist James Gunnall lived 
on Hartley Avenue in Princeton, New Jersey, and all taught 
at Princeton University.
<P>
As<I> Los Angeles Times</I> reporter Elizabeth Venant 
observes, the MacArthur Fellowship &quot;has not redirected the work or 
lives of most winners with full-time university jobs.&quot;  Many  
professors used their MacArthur awards to fund an IRA, or for 
the college education of their children, or as a down payment on 
a house.  Douglas Osheroff, a Bell Laboratories physicist, 
told the <I>New York Times</I> that he primarily used the $184,000 
he received to &quot;buy computers and make some home 
improvements.  It's nice to have money in the bank.  It gives you a 
certain freedom.&quot;
<P>
It's unclear that the MacArthur Fellowship has much 
influence on the older, heavily-credentialed recipients who tend 
to receive the award.  One-third of MacArthur recipients are 
over age 50, and when Roy Hoopes interviewed some of   them 
for <I>Modern Maturity</I>, he found that the major effect of 
the MacArthurs was to act as a credential that generated 
more income from lecture fees and other assignments.  Some of 
the people Hoopes interviewed regretted that they did not 
receive the award when they were younger and hungrier.  
&quot;Twenty-five years ago,&quot; literary critic Irving Howe said, &quot;the grant 
would have been three times more helpfulwhen you are 
younger and trying to get established.&quot;
<P>
It is also unclear how much the MacArthur Fellowships 
help artists though   it seems to have helped writers, who work alone. 
 Novelist and film director John Sayles, for example, used 
the first year of his fellowship to write screenplays for such 
popular films as <I>Clan of the Cave Bear</I>.  Sayles then used the 
income from these screenplays to finance films. 
<P>
But many of the MacArthur grants to artists have gone 
to people who have created theatre or dance companies,  and 
the recipients have used their grants to aid the ventures they 
have created.  For example, documentary film maker 
Frederick Wiseman used his MacArthur fellowship to prepare 
short scenes from potential future projects, which he then showed 
to other possible grantmakers.  For artists who have to meet 
a payroll, the evidence suggests that the MacArthur most 
resembles more conventional grants, save that the tedium 
of proposal writing is eliminated.
<P>
When J. Roderick MacArthur was dying of cancer in 
1984, he suggested that it would take a decade for the effects of 
the MacArthur Fellowships to be made clear.  Now that the time 
has passed, it's clear that the MacArthurs have had much 
less impact than most observers predicted in 1981.  Some 
younger scholars have used the MacArthur award to buy time to 
produce substantial works.  Many older scholars have been aided by 
the MacArthurs to a more comfortable retirement.  But despite 
the efforts of over a thousand anonymous talent scouts, 
the MacArthur Foundation has failed to find anyone as talented 
as Michelangelo.
<P>
The primary effect of the MacArthur Fellowships has 
been, as Michael Kinsley predicted, to act as a credential.  If 
someone received a MacArthur Fellowship, the unsaid logic goes, 
they<I> must</I> be important, or why would they receive the prize? 
<P>
<br><B>A Multicultural Trophy</B>
<P>
But even this argument is coming under question.  
The appointment of Catharine Stimpson as MacArthur 
Fellows director in January 1994 has ensured that the program 
has become a captive of  the multicultural left.   The 
MacArthur Foundation was always among the most liberal of the 
big foundations; as early as 1990, <I>The New 
Republic'</I>s Robert Wright observed that &quot;it is true that the MacArthur 
Foundation, the most commonly cited example of woolly-minded 
`60s-era liberalism, does indeed deserve this distinction.&quot;  But 
although MacArthur Fellows have tended to be liberals, the 1995 
recipients (the first completely under Stimpson's control) are 
even more left-wing. They include the editor of a left-wing 
news service, a lawyer who spent his career fighting the 
death penalty, and  a feminist filmmaker.
<P>The 1995 recipients, <I>New Criterion</I> editor
 Hilton Kramer told  the <I>Chronicle of 
Philanthropy</I>, were &quot;the straight politically correct, multicultural ticket,&quot; adding that director 
Stimpson had &quot;completed the total destruction of the MacArthur 
fellowship program, in regard to any kind of intellectual or 
artistic distinction.&quot;
<P>If the MacArthur Fellows continue to reward obscure 
leftists, it's likely that the lustre of the prizes will dim.  How can 
the MacArthur Foundation claim that all &quot;geniuses&quot; in America 
are women or minorities?  &quot;The MacArthur Foundation is free 
to finance political activists and gender ideologues who believe 
in symphonic rape,&quot; observes <I>U.S. 
News'</I>s John Leo.  &quot;but let's have no more prattle about `geniuses.'&quot;
<P>The MacArthur Fellowships are also losing their 
distinction because many of the recipients are, 
well,<I> silly,</I> a point best demonstrated by Jack Hitt in the November 1995 
<I>Esquire</I>.
<P><I></I>Every other year the MacArthur Foundation holds a 
convention in Chicago for MacArthur Fellows.  Though the meeting is closed to the 
press, the enterprising Hitt snuck in.  What did he find? Seminars such as &quot;Would 
Tyrannosaurus Rex  Eat a Lawyer?&quot; and  
&quot;What Shells Teach Us About Evolution and Economics,&quot; and informal debates 
among the fellows as to whether or not crack dealers could be turned into 
stockbrokers. Hitt's response to the convention is simplehe laughed.  For laughter, 
Hitt wrote, &quot;is almost as close to a sin as 
you can get these days.&quot;
<P>But Hitt's response is the right way to approach the 
MacArthur Fellows program.  At their heart, they are a 
philanthropic enterprise that borders on farce.  The story of the 
MacArthur fellows is not tragic or heroic, but comic; it is the story of 
an unclothed  emperor of the charitable world.  For the 
MacArthur Foundation has yet to answer one fundamental question 
about the fellows programwhy should anyone take it seriously?

<h2>Thinking about Welfare Replacement
</h2>
<br>
By <a href="/crc/about/people.html#Olasky">Marvin Olasky</a>
<P>
For too long the welfare debate has been the same old same old.
Liberals have emphasized distribution of bread and assumed the
poor could live on that alone. Conservatives have complained about
the mold on the bread and pointed out the waylaying of funds by
&quot;welfare queens&quot; and the empire-building of &quot;poverty
pimps.&quot;
<P>
Now, however, there is beginning to be talk not about reforming
the welfare systemwhich often means scraping off a bit of moldbut
about replacing it with a revolutionary centrist system based
in private and religious charity. Such a system was effective
in the 19th century and will be even more effective in the 21st,
with the decentralization that new technology makes possible,
if we make the right changes in personal goals and public policy.
<P>
Why is welfare replacement necessary? Because in America we now
face not just concern about poor individuals falling between the
cracks, but the crunch of sidewalks disintegrating. An explosive
growth in the number of children born out of wedlocknext year,
one of every three of our fellow citizens will begin life hindered
by the absence of a father is one indication of rapid decline.
<P>
Why is welfare replacement morally right? Because when we look
at the present system we are dealing with not just the dispersal
of dollars but the destruction of lives. When William Tecumseh
Sherman's army marched through Georgia in 1864, about 25,000 blacks
followed his infantry columns, until Sherman and his soldiers
decided to rid themselves of the followers by hurrying across
an unfordable stream and then taking up the pontoon bridge, leaving
the ex-slaves stranded on the opposite bank. Many tried to swim
across but died in the icy water. Similarly today, many of the
stranded poor will soon be abandoned by a country that has seen
welfare failure and is lapsing into a skeptical and even cynical
&quot;compassion syndrome&quot;unless we find a way to renew the
American dream of compassion.
<P>
Why is welfare replacement politically possible? Because there
is broad understanding that the system hurts the very people it
was designed to help, and that the trillions of dollars spent
in the name of compassion over the past three decades have largely
been wasted. Conservatives who want an opportunity to recover
past wisdom and apply it to future practice should thank liberals
for providing a wrecked ship. And liberals should support welfare
replacement because, given the mood of the country, the alternative
to replacement is not an expanded welfare state, but an extinct
one.
<P>
Why is welfare replacement practical? First, because nonprofit
organizations based on traditional poverty-fighting principles
are displaying much greater effectiveness than their governmental
counterparts; groups such as Voice of Hope in Dallas, CityTeam
in San Jose, the Right Alternative Family Service Center in Milwaukee,
and Clean and Sober Streets in Washington, D.C., are all having
success where governmental programs have failed, and at a fraction
of the cost. Second, because new means to get more resources to
those groups with an alternative welfare vision are now under
development. For example, not long ago a tax credit for citizens
who would joyfully support a neighborhood charity, but hate the
idea hurling more dollars down the federal HHS drain, was a gleam
in the mind's eyes of a few; now, such a proposal is gathering
steam.
<P>
<B>The Death of Hope</B> 
<P>
The destruction of life through the current welfare system is
not often so dramatic as that which occurred in 1864, but the
death of hope is evident every day. During the past three decades
we've seen lives destroyed and dreams die among poor individuals
who have gradually become used to dependency. Those who stressed
independence used to be called the &quot;worthy poor&quot;; now,
anyone who will not work is worthy, and mass pauperism is accepted.
Now, those who are willing to put off immediate gratification
and sacrifice leisure time in order to remain independent, are
called chumps rather than champs. We've also seen dreams die among
some social workers who had been in the forefront of change. Their
common lament is, &quot;All we have time to do is move paper.&quot;
Those who really care do not last long, and one who resigned cried
out, &quot;I had a calling; it was that simple. I wanted to help.&quot;
Some social workers take satisfaction in meeting demands, but
others, who wanted to change lives, become despondent in their
role of enabling destructive behavior.
<P>
We've seen dreams die as &quot;compassion fatigue&quot; deepens.
Personal involvement is down, cynicism is up. Many Americans would
like to be generous at the subway entrance or the street corner,
but they know that most homeless recipients will use any available
funds for drugs or alcohol. We end up walking by, avoiding eye
contactand a subtle hardening occurs once more. Many Americans
who would like to contribute more of their money and time are
weighed down by tax burdens. We end up just saying `no' to involvement,
and a sapping of citizenship occurs once more.
<P>
We've seen dreams die among children who never know their fathers.
At the end of a very enjoyable movie from the 1980s, <I>The Princess
Bride</I>, a character named Inigo Montoya has been chasing for
over twenty years a six-fingered man who killed his father. Finally
he has the six-fingered man at swordpoint, and says in words he
has long rehearsed, &quot;My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed
my father. Prepare to die.&quot; The vile murderer begins to plead
for mercy. Inigo Montoya, says, &quot;Offer me money.&quot; The
six-fingered man says, &quot;Yes.&quot; Montoya says, &quot;Power,
too, promise me that.&quot; &quot;All I have and more.&quot; &quot;Offer
me everything I ask for.&quot; &quot;Anything you want,&quot;
the six-fingered man says. Inigo Montoya then runs him through
with the sword, saying, &quot;I want my father back, you son of
a bitch.&quot; A six-fingered government's programs have contributed
to the removal of fathers, and nothing else can replace them.
<P>
Some would say that the death of dreams is inevitable. Big business...
big government... big charity. Wake up and smell the cyanide.
Mass civilization requires impersonal welfare. Yes, we lose the
personal touch, but there is no alternative if resources are to
be efficiently and equitably dispersed. That's the pessimistic
positionbut the success of small, community-based groups shows
that it is not inevitable for the American dream of compassion
to die.
<P>
<B>The Realism of Welfare Replacement</B> 
<P>
Past performanceunder circumstances as materially difficult as
those of todayalso suggests that the dream can live. Today we
have lots of theories about fighting poverty, but it is not necessary
to be moving in the theoretical plane. The testimony of successful
anti-poverty programs a century ago and today is that those embodying
personal involvement and challenge, both material and spiritual,
can change lives even under hard circumstances.
<P>
For instance, our predecessors who helped others to move out of
poverty, and then turned their attention to the next group of
immigrants and impoverished, did not have it easybut they persevered.
Theirs were not the good old days. Work days were long and affluence
was rare, and homes on the average were much smaller than ours.
There were severe drug and alcohol problems and many more early
deaths from disease. We are more spread out now, but our travel
time is not any greater. Overall, most of the problems paralleled
our own; the big differences are the increases in illegitimacy
and divorce. Most of the opportunities and reasons to help also
were similar; a big difference in this regard is that our tax
burden is much larger, and many Americans justifiably feel that
they are paying for others to take care of problems.
<P>
Community-based poverty-fighters today also have it hardand the
task is perhaps harder because, in theory, we have improved our
poverty-fighting techniques The bottom rungs of the ladder are
no longer so low: we've removed the bottom rungs, leaving many
people stuck on the ground. Over the past three decades we have
fought a war on poverty that has also struck down three other
enemies of the left: we've waged a war against shame, a war against
family, and a war against God. And yet, when we take away shame,
we take away deterrent; when we take away family, we take away
the soil in which compassion best grows; when we kick out religion,
we also remove the greatest incentive to help and be helped. <I>Newsweek</I>
recently had a cover story about the need to bring back shame;
maybe we are learning.
<P>
Some on the left say that, without welfare, poor folks are forced
into &quot;demeaning&quot; jobs. But in the weekly news magazine
I edit, <I>World</I>, we recently had the shamelessness to put
on the cover a photo of a 65-year-old man who has had a shoeshine
shop in south central Los Angeles for many years, and is revered
in the community. Teenagers come to him for counsel, and some
use his wisdom on the way to gaining positions of trust and authority.
(One person we quoted, who was full of praise for the &quot;demeaned&quot;
shoeshiner, is now a police chief nearby.) Sure, we can pride
ourselves in removing the bottom rungs of the ladder, but then
many people are stuck on the ground. We need to reemphasize the
fact that it is not demeaning, but noble, to work hard to support
a family.
<P>
There's a lot we can learn in this regard from a wonderful Western
produced in 1961, <I>The Magnificent Seven</I>. It tells of how
seven Texas gunfighters come to the defense of a village that
previously had succumbed to a bandit gang; its best scene comes
toward the end, when a gunfighter played by Charles Bronson is
surrounded by a circle of admiring children. &quot;We are ashamed
to live here,&quot; one boy says. &quot;Our fathers are cowards.&quot;
The gunfighter replies, &quot;You think I am brave because I carry
a gun, but your fathers are much braver because they carry responsibility
for you, your brothers, your sisters, and your mothers, and this
responsibility is like a big rock that weighs a ton. It bends
and twists them until finally it buries them under the ground.
And there's nobody that says they have to do this. They do it
because they love you and because they want to..... I have never
had this kind of courage, running a farm, working like a mule
every day with no guarantee what will ever come of it. This is
bravery. It's why I never even started anything like that. It's
why I never will.&quot;
<P>
Some supporters of big government snarl about &quot;turning back
the clock&quot; to smaller-scale approaches, but it is not bad
to turn back the clock to that type of bravery. Besides, we truly
turn back the clock when we stick with the centralization developed
in the 1930s and the 1960s. We will be turning back the clock
in the 21st century if we repeat the mistakes of 20th century
centralization. We need to make the vision of the 19th century
relevant to the 21st by updating strategies and devising new projects
and tactics. That is already happening even in Washington, D.C.,
in nonprofits such as Martha's Table, which uses computers and
love in after-school programs; the Gospel Mission, which uses
insights of modern psychology within a biblical framework; and
Clean and Sober Streets, where up-to-date information about drug
effects is put into use within a system that provides an old-fashioned
choice: Shape up or ship out.
<P>
<B>A Positive View of People</B> 
<P>
Furthermore, if we fall into the pessimistic view that people
are problems, we are also turning back the clock, this time to
the 1970s when Zero Population Growth was hot. Population paranoia
should have been laid to rest by the experience during the 1980s
and 1990s of city-states like Hong Kong and Singapore, crowded
and without natural resources, yet rapidly ascending in economic
potency. Recent Asian experience shows once again that every mouth
comes with a brain and a pair of hands, and that each brain and
pair of hands, when trained, can perform wonders. Poor people
are assets to be liberated rather than problems to be subsidized:
They are resources, not victims.
<P>
If we focus not on weaknesses but on the strengths and competitive
advantages of inner cities, including location, then we can put
legs on a vision that at its core is simple: We need compassion
that is personal, spiritual, and challenging. We often hear today
that the problems of poverty are incredibly difficult. That is
only partially true: The problems themselves are solvable; summoning
the will to solve them is what often seems beyond us. The easy
way out is to look to government programs, slightly modified.
But there is no need to settle for so little: Those who have faith
and determination throughout the country are showing the opportunities
for effective compassion.
<P>
Members of Rosedale Park Baptist Church in Detroit's inner city,
for example, know what needs to be done. Pastor Hamon Cross, Jr.,
tells those who have been sucked into dependency, &quot;I gotta
hurt ya before I can help ya.&quot; The church offers free counseling
services, but clients must pledge to study specific scriptures
bearing on their problems, to discuss them in counseling sessions,
and to hear and take notes on a good sermon each week. The goal
is transformation, not just training.
<P>
Homeless women helped at St. Martin de Porres House of Hope in
Chicago learn what they have to do. &quot;Dysfunctionality, and
an often total lack of understanding of personal responsibility
and discipline&quot;that is the main cause of homelessness, according
to Sister Connie Driscoll, who founded and heads the 100-bed shelter
that is operated without any government funds. The women who come
to her, she notes, &quot;almost always have the money to pay their
rent, but they often do not. They spend the money on something
else, and they don't pay the rent on time, month after month,
until the landlord evicts them.&quot; Those women need not a Day
Timer but something that will flip the hourglass of their existence
before all the sand runs out.
<P>
Even <I>The New York Times</I> occasionally stumbles across the
core of the problem, noting last October 22 that three-fourths
of welfare recipients who leave the rolls later return, often
lamenting &quot;what they called their bad attitudes or insufficient
drive.&quot;
<P>
<B>The Crucial Importance of Attitude</B> 
<P>
Attitude: the technically-best training program in the world will
not work for manyprobably mostpeople on unless their minds are
reconfigured. One problem with the low-level maintenance that
welfare provides is that necessity is the mother of personal change,
and AFDC or SSI payments remove that necessity. Steve Gilkenson,
program administrator at the McAuley Mission in New York City,
and a man who has been through tough times himself, suggests that
&quot;The problem today is nobody's able to hit bottom, they just
bounce around the bottom, and every couple of months someone picks
them up.&quot; With decreased welfare payments, he suggests, &quot;our
chapel would be fuller and our audience would be soberer.&quot;
<P>
Some people say that welfare replacementemphasizing shelters like
the McAuley Mission or its counterparts in many cities, rather
than soulless government barracks; emphasizing abstinence-based
programs like Best Friends or True Love Waits rather than governmental
sex education; emphasizing tough anti-addiction programs as CityTeam
in San Jose does, rather than the numerous soft government variantsis
unrealistic. But the truth is, any program that emphasizes material
end results without first examining beliefs, values, and the attitudes
that arise out of those basics, is one that may look good in a
bureaucratic notebook, but is out of touch with fundamental needs.
<P>
Welfare replacement will come, slowly, but the administrators
and social workers whose livelihoods depend on the current system
will fight and kick all the way. They won't come right out and
oppose effective private programs, but they willin response to
public demandpromote programs that on the surface taste great,
but which over time will prove to be far less filling than what
private groups offer. The professionals will put lots of equations
on the reform blackboard, and tell the rest of us that only they
know what the higher math means. To respond well, we will need
to borrow a response from Mrs. Einstein when a reporter asked
her whether she understood the theory of relativity. &quot;No,&quot;
she responded, &quot;but Albert does, and I trust Albert.&quot;
We'll need to develop our own Alberts, not by trusting those whose
livelihood depends on welfare state payments, but those who practice
true compassion on mean streets.
<P>
<B>A Different Kind of Expertise</B> 
<P>
In California, for example, we'll want to skip the <I>Los Angeles
Times</I> but spend time at a gospel-proclaiming inner city church,
such as St. Stephen's Church of God in Christ. There, in southeast
San Diego, the fellow playing the bongos on stage may have been
a drug addict a year ago, and the man in a suit in the next pew
a recently-released convictbut a spiritual transformation has
swept both of them, and hundreds others, into a new life. As one
church leader, businessman Richard Smith, Jr., points out, the
church's goal is to deal with not just poverty, which is a relatively
easy material problem, but impoverishmentlong-term hopelessness,
humiliation and degradation, a culture unto itself. It takes more
than money to redeem the lives of those who have become spiritually
destitute.&quot;
<P>
In Colorado, a visit to Step 13, a rehabilitation program for
substance abusers, will throw more light on alternatives to the
SSI program than will an academic conference. Rough-hewn Bob Cote,
a former substance abuser who runs Step 13, now labels SSI &quot;Some
Sort of Insanity&quot; or &quot;suicide on the installment plan,&quot;
because of the alcoholics with standing accounts at liquor stores
who benefit from the government's tender mercies. (He is equally
sarcastic about popular estimates of the extent of homelessness,
based on reports from local shelter providers of how many people
they have housed, &quot;Drift from D.C. to California, be counted
as 1,942 people.&quot;) Cote, not a religious man, still emphasizes
that any program to be effective must produce an internal change,
not just an external change in job-pursuit manners which will
be temporary at best. The social work pros and profs, he insists,
just don't get it: &quot;50 masters degrees vs. 3000 street people,
who's gonna win?&quot;
<P>
In Georgia, rather than listening to those who believe in magic flick
the wand, provide new housing, and the problem of poverty goes
poof!we will need to hear explanations such as the one coming
from Summerhill Neighborhood head Douglas Dean: &quot;We're not
just talking about changing people's physical environment. We're
talking about spiritual change, changing people's hearts. A lot
of people have come here with quick fixes that have failed and
left people discouraged.... Churches can break through that discouragement
by telling the truth and showing people how to rebuild family
life.&quot;
<P>
In Michigan, to get a more accurate portrait than that offered
by liberal social workers, we will have to check in with Mary
Jackson, a cheerfully maternal, middle-aged black woman who eleven
years ago deliberately moved into the Smith Homes, a rough inner
city project, in order to help youngsters there. She runs a weekly
Bible club program for about three dozen children and is frank
about the problems of &quot;lazy&quot; project residents who have
been on welfare for years and have a &quot;deeply embedded&quot;
entitlement mentality: &quot;They just want to stay in their own
little worlds..... They think somebody owes them something.&quot;
Ms. Jackson was especially irritated when welfare mothers whose
children attended a week-long summer camp refused to pay the $50
fee: &quot;It's not like they don't have any money. They can afford
to get their hair and nails done and wear leather coats that working
people can't afford.&quot; Michigan welfare reform will succeed
only when the moms Ms. Jackson sees begin treasuring their children
above their nails.
<P>
In Missouri as in other states, there will be much wailing about
&quot;what will happen to the children&quot; if significant welfare
reform kicks in. To find out, we won't want to ask Children's
Defense Fund publicists but we will need to listen to Jerry Hayes,
who heads the Sunshine Mission in St. Louis and has set up an
MBA programmind, body, and attitudeor kids likely to fall prey
to the street culture of irresponsibility. Hayes personally understands
the difference between that culture and an opportunity culture:
As a child he lived part of the time in a government housing project
with his mother, and part of the time with a great aunt who made
it a priority to quiz him each day on Bible verses and teach him
the value of hard work and thrift. He understands that the cultures
cannot readily be merged; they have antithetical values, and a
person needs more than a government training program to move from
one to another.
<P>
In New York, there is great concern about what will happen to
&quot;the homeless,&quot; but paying much attention to the official
reports will teach us little. Instead, we'll want to talk with
Gilbert Gilliam, who combines the beefy look of an ex-football
player, the withered look of an ex-addict, and the quick smile
of someone whose life has changed: Gilliam, 38, is a shelter security
guard at the McAuley Mission and the person who has the greatest
opportunity to make or break the program. (Like secretaries in
many offices and sergeants in the army, security people truly
run shelters.) Gilliam, if he were in charge of an anti-drug program,
says he &quot;wouldn't hire nobody who hadn't gone through the
downfall. It doesn't take much when you're detoxing to fall under
bad influences, so the best thing is to be that person's contact`just
me for breakfast and dinner.' And if you don't know drugs yourself,
you don't know what it's like and people can fool youto be successful
here, you gotta have that gut feeling that enables you to tell
someone, `I know when you're bull-jiving me.'&quot;
<P>
What we've been getting from liberal theoreticians for years are
reams of bull-jiving but those who are matadors in the bullring
have a different perspective. In Oregon, Don Michel, executive
director of the Union Gospel Mission, doesn't equate welfare change
with mean-spiritedness, because he has watched people trading
food stamps for drugs. Michel now tells reporters about his changed
attitude: &quot;I thought just handing out food and clothes without
question was a very compassionate thing to do. But what I think
now is when you give things out without accountability, you're
participating in that person's harm.&quot; He sees that services
are available for those who want to change, but most will not
change unless they are forced to: &quot;It's never been true that
there is an absence of service.... there is an absence of motivation.&quot;
Michel wants to push hard: &quot;What sounds coldhearted to people
not exposed to this population is just reality.&quot;
<P>
<B>Drowning one-third of a nation</B> 
<P>
What Michel calls the &quot;absence of motivation&quot; is the
critical hole in much naive talk about homeless people restoring
some order to their lives, or people on welfare going to work.
Necessity is the mother of change, and our removal of urgent necessity
from the lives of many poor people has also taken away the impetus
to productive behavior. Realistic welfare replacement and coddling
cannot coexist.
<P>
We will need to insist that realism means taking into account
more than material conditions. The War on Poverty defined realism
as emphasizing dollars and cents rather than children's need for
a two-parent family, but the 1960s idea that a woman's place is
in her own apartment, with a husband optional, contributed to
a single-parent pathology that has ravaged the black community;
that pathology is now becoming general, with about one out of
four white babies born to single women, and the percentage apparently
rising each year. Our economics-only, supposed realism has damaged
two generations, and indexes of leading cultural indicators suggest
that the damage will be visited to the third and fourth generations.
<P>
Franklin Roosevelt in 1933 described one-third of the nation;
sunk into material poverty; Americans are a far more affluent
people now than sixty or so years ago, but the dire news is that
almost one-third of Americans are deprived in more severe ways
that they ever were. Now, nearly one-third of children are essentially
fatherless at birth, and nearly one-third of high school seniors
read at the &quot;below basic&quot; level, which means that essentially
they cannot function as readers.
<P>
We tend to focus on dropouts, but every year schools dump 750,000
more semi-literates into the workforce, and it's no surprise that
they have trouble achieving good wages at work. It goes against
the feminist impulses of recent years to concentrate particularly
on the need for men to be equipped to find good jobs, but men
need to be breadwinners if women are to have the choice to stay
home with their children. It is vital that fathers (whose sustained
presence is desperately needed if families are to be stable, teenaged
boys disciplined, and crime reduced) not to be relegated to the
low-rent realms of the playboy philosophy, hopping from bed to
bed.
<P>
Reducing illegitimacy and reemphasizing fatherhood are two key
steps to rebuilding marriage and family. The extent of our cultural
loss is conveyed in an anecdote offered by Anne Gordon; she is
the wife of &quot;Coach&quot; Wayne Gordon who twenty years ago
came from Iowa to the North Lawndale area of Chicago, set up a
weight-lifting machine in a local storefront, and conducted Bible
studies there between the grunts and groans of high school guys
who might otherwise have spent their time in gang-banging. Wayne
and Ann Gordon have since been instrumental in establishing of
the Lawndale Christian Center, which includes a gym, a full-service
medical clinic that provides health care to over 4,000 individuals
each month, a development corporation that buys and rehabs abandoned
buildings, and a computer-crammed learning center that provides
after-school tutoring. But along with all the improvements, Mrs.
Gordon recalls the visit of a woman who &quot;came to our house
one night at dinner time. She knocked on the door and we were
all sitting around the dinner table eating and she said, `Do you
all do this every night?'.... It seemed to her like a big event,
whereas to us it was just part of family life and very normal.&quot;
All of the improvements in North Lawndale will avail little unless
the tender mercies of a family dinner become normal activities.
<P>
The question of the hour concerning welfare replacement, and one
for the rest of this century, is how to make the normal an everyday
occurrence rather than an exhibit for an anthropological museum.
Welfare replacement is more than changing the welfare system;
it will only be possible if the educational system, the teen sexuality
culture, and the adoption system also change. In all of these
areas, the same old same old must live no more, if those who have
been enslaved in government welfare and school systems are to
have a new start.
<P>
<B>A Time for Optimism</B> 
<P>
Can the country make that start? Some may think it impossible
for a nation that has gone far into the jungle to hack its way
out. And yet, there is some historical precedent. England at the
time of the American Revolution was a morally sick society, but
the efforts of William Wilberforce and others helped to give it
a much improved nineteenth century.
<P>
In the United States, the 1840s and 1850s were decades of spiritism
and free lustNew Age theology and sexuality. The Civil War expansion
of government power introduced welfare practices that were previously
frowned upon. In 1873 one of every ten persons in Brooklyn (then
an independent city) took weekly rations from public storehouses.
Other cities were not far behind in their offerings.
<P>
Critics of such programs did not give up, however. They proved
that governmental provision &quot;does more hurt than good, and
makes more paupers than it relieves.&quot; They wrote not only
about funds wasted through promiscuous distribution to alcoholics
and addicts, but about &quot;compassion&quot; properly understoodsuffering
with and challenging those in distress. By the late 19th century
their efforts were proving successful. Reformers in large cities
were able to abolish indiscriminate relief, and able-bodied men
returned to the marketplace; an abundance of warm-hearted but
hard-headed charities dealt with special cases. Combining vision
and realism, our predecessors produced solutions that were not
panaceas, but did delay for decades an epidemic of illegitimacy,
and saved from misery thousands of children.
<P>
Today, after thirty years of social excess, the epidemic is upon
us. Liberal scholars complain of the &quot;feminization of poverty,&quot;
since female-headed households are the main locus of poverty,
but they do not acknowledge the triple-A causative factors: a
decline in adoption, an increase in adultery, and an AFDC system
that emphasizes the pseudo-independence of deeply dependent young
women. Americans concerned about poverty a century ago not only
saw cause and effect more clearly but came up with programs that
worked then and can work now, even in the face of a more extensive
social breakdown. We have far greater wealth now than Americans
did a century ago; do we have the will?

<h2>Bringing Daddy Home: <I>The Fatherhood Movement</i></h2>
<br>
By Patrick and Gwen Purtill 
<P>
For thirty years social analysts have attempted to persuade Americans
against common sense, and increasingly against common experience,
that family disruption does not seriously harm children. That
effort is rapidly losing ground. There is a large and growing
body of empirical evidence showing that widespread fatherlessness
is wreaking physical, emotional and spiritual havoc on children.
<P>
During these years, advocates of &quot;alternative families&quot;
justified family breakup by arguing that traditional families
were a widespread source of real pathology. The argument simply
does not hold water. For example, traditional families are less
prone to domestic violence than stepfamilies, single-parent families,
or co-habitating couples. The argument against the traditional
family has been dominated by the false comparison of fictional
models to real families. Traditional families are condemned as
&quot;dysfunctional&quot; when they fail to live up to the <I>beau
ideal</I> styled by a popular therapist. But the true comparison
is between the traditional family and its real world counterparts:
single-parent families, stepfamilies, and co-habitating couples.
Judged by that standard, the married, biological family emerges
as the best environment for children.
<P>
Certainly many traditional families have problems, which range
in gravity from everyday mutual annoyance to serious physical
abuse. And of course, there are examples of wonderful stepfamilies
and even single-parent families. But an adequate understanding
of the issue demands that we know the rule before we begin to
take account of the exceptions. And if we are serious about doing
what is best for our children, we will promote the institutions
that are likeliest to secure their happiness and well-being.
<P>
In virtually every case, &quot;family disruption&quot; or &quot;alternative
families&quot; means growing up without a father. Children deprived
of their fathers find it harder to develop normally into happy
adults. Young boys first learn how to treat women by watching
their fathers. Likewise, young girls learn what is, and what is
not, acceptable treatment by men. Children who grow up without
their fathers are much less likely to enjoy successful marriages
themselves later in life. Additionally, they tend to suffer a
variety of problems, including &quot;higher than average levels
of youth suicide, low intellectual and educational performance,
and higher than average rates of mental illness, violence and
drug use.&quot;1
<P>
Moreover, the family is the means by which children learn to interact
with others. Through the mutual bonds of affection and responsibility
in the family, children learn to extend their sense of affection
and duty to members of the larger community. &quot;Authority,
stability, and a life of relationships within the family constitute
the foundations for freedom, security, and fraternity within society,&quot;
says the catechism of the Catholic church. &quot;The family is
the community in which, from childhood, one can learn moral values,
begin to honor God, and make good use of freedom. Family life
is an initiation into life in society.&quot;2
<P>
Perhaps the most alarming consequence of father absence is that,
according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
&quot;children from disrupted families are at a much higher risk
for physical or sexual abuse.&quot;3 But, as many researchers
now point out, the three social problems most on the minds of
Americanseducation, poverty, and crimeall find a common taproot
in father absence.
<P>
Numerous studies show that children who live with both biological
parents have a great advantage. They tend to perform better in
class and on standardized tests. And they have fewer problems
with their peers. According to one study, for example, children
living apart from their biological fathers are 40 percent more
likely to repeat a grade in school and 70 percent more likely
to be expelled.5 Children from disrupted families also are less
likely to graduate from high school or to attend college than
are their peers from intact families.
<P>
Changes in family structure have had an even more dramatic impact
on poverty. Since 1970 the number of American children living
in poverty has been rising steadily. Nearly three quarters of
the children living in single-parent families will spend part
of their childhoods in poverty, an experience shared by just 20
percent of children in two-parent families.6 Moreover, for children
living only with their mothers, poverty is not necessarily a short
term drop in an otherwise reasonably comfortable childhood. For
22 percent of these children, it lasts for a period of seven years
or longer.7
<P>
The last 35 years have seen violent crime in America increase
more than 500 percent. According to the U.S. Department of Justice,
juveniles make up &quot;the fastest growing segment of the criminal
population in the United States.&quot; According to the <I>Journal
of Research in Crime and Delinquency</I>, &quot;the best predictor
of violent crime in a neighborhood is the proportion of households
without fathers.&quot;8 Nationally, more than 70 percent of all
juveniles in state reform institutions come from fatherless homes.9
Moreover, most violent criminals are males who grew up without
fathers, including 60 percent of rapists10 and 72 percent of adolescent
murderers.11
<P>
Indeed, there is growing bipartisan agreement that father absence
is not merely one among many factors indicating risk for criminality.
Rather, it is the single most important factor. In a paper published
by the Progressive Policy Institute, Elaine Kamarck and William
Galston assert, &quot;The relationship [between family structure
and crime] is so strong that controlling for family configuration
erases the relationship between race and crime and between low
income and crime. This conclusion shows up time and again in the
literature.&quot;12
<P>
<B>Illegitimacy: The Norm in America's Inner Cities</B> 
<P>
Each year in America nearly one million children are born to unmarried
women. That is one child out of every three, a 400 percent increase
since 1960 when only 5 percent of all births were to unmarried
women.13 Many single mothers never marry or remarry. Even those
who eventually marry usually spend about six years as a single-parent.
For black women, it usually is much longer.14 Between working
and the responsibilities of rearing a child alone, these women
have little time to devote to romance. Despite tabloid stories
featuring the births of love children to fabulously wealthy Hollywood
superstars, the overwhelming majority of unwed mothers are poor
women with a high school education at best.
<P>
In the inner city, where single-parent families are the norm,
education is elusive, poverty sprawls across generations, and
crime is omnipresent. According to social scientist Charles Murray,
the black illegitimacy rate in inner citiescurrently at over 80
percent has created a &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; culture with
&quot;the values of unsocialized male adolescents made norms physical
violence, immediate gratification and predatory sex.&quot;15
<P>
The disintegration of urban black families has created living
conditions previously unimaginable in the United States. In some
communities, the ideal of responsible fatherhood is reduced to
a teenaged boy buying diapers for the mother of his children.
The question is no longer whether current welfare policies are
bad for America's poorest families, but how to control the damage
they already have dome.
<P>
<B>Institute For Responsible Fatherhood</B> 
<P>
AFDC created an economic incentive for widespread illegitimacy.
But The Institute for Responsible Fatherhood and Family Revitalization
is working to reverse this one family and one father at a time.
Reuniting fathers with their families is the most promising solution
to the misery and turmoil in the inner city and the Institute
is working at the front lines of that battle. According to its
founder and president, Charles A. Ballard, apart from looking
to a father for a child support check, much of our society &quot;looks
right through him.&quot;
<P>
Charles Ballard does not need statistics to know what can happen
to a boy growing up without a father. He is one of the statistics.
Ballard describes himself as an angry young man who dropped out
of school, fathered a child with a woman he had no intention of
marrying, and, finally, landed in prison. But in prison, of all
places, the familiar pattern broke. He became a Christian and
committed himself to becoming a real father to the son he then
hardly knew.
<P>
Upon release from prison, Ballard took jobs wherever he found
them. Finally he persuaded his son's mother, who had since married,
to let him adopt their child. &quot;There were times,&quot; he
says, &quot;when I had no idea what to do. Many times, my only
refuge was the knowledge that for all my faults as a father, I
was better than nothing.&quot;16 It took six years of hard work,
but he went to college and got his degree. Since 1982 Ballard
has worked with men in the Hough neighborhood in the heart of
Cleveland, teaching them to be good fathers to their children.
In the neighborhood around his center, two out of three children
are born out of wedlock.
<P>
What Ballard's Institute does there is far from standard issue
social work. &quot;If we believe that every individual has the
potential to control his life, then we must treat each person
with respect,&quot;17 he insists. Among other things, that means
not doing for anyone what he can do for himself. The Institute
does not spoon-feed a father through the bureaucracy or schedule
classes for him. A man who is going to be a good father to his
children needs to develop the initiative and confidence to take
responsibility for himself and his family. By the time a man leaves
the program, he already has accomplished formidable goals by himself.
<P>
Ballard believes that if you really listen, you will discover
that these young fathers already want to take care of their children,
and they even have some idea of how to turn their lives around.
But they need guidance and moral support. More than anything else,
however, they need role models. Consequently, Ballard has trained
what he calls Outreach Specialists who work from a mentor/protege
model of nontraditional, intensive, one-on-one guidance. They
ask a father for a commitment to four goals:
<UL>
<LI>Legally acknowledge paternity of his children.
<LI>Decrease at-risk behavior.
<LI>Stay in school, or return for a GED.
<LI>Obtain a job and begin to contribute to the care of his children.
</UL>

<P>
Separate group sessions for fathers and mothers are held weekly,
and combined group sessions for both parents are held monthly.
But the outreach specialists spend the majority of their time
working in the homes of their proteges. Meetings are held there
to deal with problems at the source. During the early phase of
the program, it is not uncommon for the outreach specialist to
see the father three times per week. Outreach specialists are
available to their proteges by pager 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week. Mentors discuss long term (5-to-10 year) goals with these
fathers, then work backwards to develop specific 90 day plans.
<P>
One of the primary functions of the outreach specialist is to
serve as a role model to his proteges. Each must adopt what Ballard
calls a &quot;risk-free life-style.&quot; Those who challenge
young fathers to walk the straight and narrow must live according
to the same rulesfree of &quot;tobacco, alcohol, other drugs,
abusive behavior, sex outside of marriage, obesity or other high
risk behaviors.&quot;
<P>
At the outset, the father and mother often are not on friendly
terms. Therefore, the outreach specialist always contacts the
children's mother and anyone else, such as a grandparent, who
is deeply involved in rearing the children. Even if a father does
not seek custody of his children, one of the program's central
goals is to develop a respectful, cooperative relationship between
mother and father. A fringe benefit of Ballard's method is that,
after learning to work together for the good of their children,
many parents in the program eventually marry. But at minimum,
children will see their parents treating one another with respect.
<P>
With funding from the Ford Foundation, The Institute for Responsible
Fatherhood and Family Revitalization is embarking upon a tremendous
expansion this year. Ballard is working to replicate his Cleveland
operation in Nashville, Yonkers, San Diego, Milwaukee, and the
District of Columbia. Each of these cities has shown an interest
in the program as well as a base of support within the community.
Mr. Ballard and his family currently are relocating to Washington,
D.C. to manage all of these programs from a central office. It
is difficult to predict how well the Institute will succeed at
maintaining the integrity of Ballard's intensive one-on-one approach
and at requiring hard virtues of outreach specialists in distant
cities.
<P>
<B>Divorce: Life Without Father Hits the Middle Class</B> 
<P>
But escalating rates of illegitimacy tell only half of the story.
There is more than one way to grow up without a father. An estimated
one million children each year go through the divorce or separation
of their parents. Although the rate has fallen somewhat since
its peak in the early 1980s, the last three decades have seen
the divorce rate in America triple.
<P>
Divorce has a profound impact on child well-being. Children of
divorce, along with their mothers, almost always suffer economically.
Fathers typically see their financial position improve somewhat
after divorce. But even if child support arrangements were perfectly
equitable, women and children would still suffer economically
from a family breakup. The crucial fact is that very few men have
the financial wherewithal to support two households, particularly
if they later remarry and father more children. In the overwhelming
majority of cases, single mothers will always have to work full
time while struggling to care for their children alone.
<P>
More surprising, however, is the extent and duration of emotional
damage suffered by these children. Only in cases involving physical
violence do children show signs of relief over family breakupeven
when the parents' relationship was an unhappy one.18 The California
Children of Divorce Study has documented elevated levels of depression,
underachievement, and difficulty maintaining stable love relationships
into adulthood.
<P>
<B>Mary and the Legacy of Divorce</B> 
<P>
This weekend Mary is helping her stepmother with a birthday party
for her nine-year-old stepsister. Mary, a white, 28-year-old woman,
lives in a Washington, D.C. surrounded by close friends. She holds
a master's degree from a private university. She is passionate
about her faith and her social work. And she has a tendency to
take in strays.
<P>
She sees her father and stepmother regularly, but having a relationship
of any kind with her father came with difficulty. Her younger
brother Mark remains bitter. They both were too young to remember
their parents' divorce. But they remember what came afterward:
isolation, poverty, humiliation, even physical danger. They knew
that everyone else in their family was middle class and upper middle
class but they were poor.
<P>
After the divorce, Mary and Mark moved to the West Coast with
their mother, Linda, to be closer to her family. They moved into
a townhouse after a short stay with Mary's godparents. A neighbor
took care of the kids during the day while Linda finished Montessori
training. Even with Papa, Linda's father, paying rent, &quot;we
ate peanut butter and jelly every day,&quot; remembers Mary. &quot;But
at least there we knew people. We had friends.&quot;
<P>
Because Linda desperately needed a better paying job, the threesome
moved when an offer came from a small town in the southwest. That
is when things really fell apart. They had no money, no friends,
and the local Methodist church made it clear that they were not
welcome. Linda was shocked. After all, she hadn't wanted the divorce.
She had been abandoned with two small children.
<P>
Destitute in a town far from anyone they knew, Linda worked two
jobs, and sometimes three, to make ends meet. During that time,
both Mary and her little brother were abused by strangers. There
was simply no one to protect them.
<P>
For all this, Mary and Mark can still be considered fortunate.
They lived in a relatively stable single-parent home. There was
no revolving door ushering new members into their &quot;family,&quot;
and old ones out. Nevertheless, they moved every year until Mary
was seven. Like most divorced mothers, Linda was constantly forced
to move for better jobs or cheaper housing. New friendships that
might have grown into a valuable support system for Linda and
the children were continually severed. &quot;Dad was not in the
picture at all then,&quot; says Mary. He had remarried and moved
East. They met him for the first time at the instigation of their
new stepmother, Joan, when Mary was seven. After that, they went
to visit on an annual vacation. &quot;Joan really tried hard.
But it was always stiff and awkward.&quot;
<P>
Then Linda got a job in a large city nearby. Because she would
be teaching in a public school, she would be drawing a larger
paycheck. Both Linda and the children were happy to be leaving
after two years. It had seemed an eternity. As they moved into
their new apartment, things looked up for the first time. But
soon, the school board realized that Linda had not completed a
course in state history. She kept her jobbut lost half her salary.
Their car was repossessed. And again they were forced to move,
this time into a smaller apartment shared with someone who delivered
newspapers with Linda in the early morning. &quot;Nothing had
prepared Mom to be poor, and she didn't know how to do it,&quot;
Mary says. &quot;On payday she would go out and spend all of the
money on food. By the third week of the month, the food would
run out and there was just nothing to be done about it.&quot;
<P>
Finally Linda completed the state history course and her full
salary was reinstated. Most importantly, they found a church that
wanted and welcomed them. It was a large, affluent Methodist church.
From that day on, they were never truly hungry again. Groceries
arrived when they were needed. No name, no notejust food. Anyone
could see that they were poor. But now someone was paying enough
attention to know when they were desperate.
<P>
The youth ministers took Mary and Mark under their wings. They
frequently called the children at home and they discretely provided
money to include them in youth activities. Likewise, the adults
of the church went out of their way to give time and attention
to the kids and to Linda. According to Mary, &quot;Mom needed
men to talk to. Mark was growing up, and she just didn't know
what to do with him.&quot; He had never known adult men and it
was beginning to show. There were constant school and discipline
problems.
<P>
Despite Linda's efforts, and the church's support, both kids were
falling in with bad crowds. When Mary finished junior high, she
asked to go to a private school. &quot;I didn't like what my friends
were doing, but they were my friends. I needed to break away.&quot;
So Mary worked during the summer and with Linda's help saved enough
money to attend a Catholic girls school. Mary suspects that her
grandparents helped. Still, the high tuition returned the family
to hardship. So Mary wrote her father, who came through. &quot;He
was always more willing to help with me than with Mark.&quot;
<P>
Mary and Mark were fortunate in several ways. Unlike most children
in a single-parent household, Mary and Mark both attended good
schools and completed college, even if they were not eating well.
And both have managed to avoid the most disturbing social ill
traceable to father absence: crime. But Mary is the first to admit:
&quot;I don't trust men. I can't do it.&quot; Last year, she left
a job she liked in part because she was unable to communicate
with her male boss. &quot;I should have stood up for myself. And
I know I wasn't playing the role he wanted me to play in the firm.
But I just couldn't confront him.&quot;
<P>
Mark has not begun to recover. Mary says, &quot;He simply cannot
form friendships with normal men. And he dates mean, manipulative
girls who completely envelop him. If they don't mistreat him,
he leaves. He is in his mid-twenties now. I don't know what will
happen to him.&quot; Moreover, neither Mark nor his father have
attempted to form a relationship. Since graduating from college
Mark has drifted aimlessly. Although he is not lazy, he works
only sporadically. Unable to form stable relationships, he treats
even his job as just another transitory experience.
<P>
Mary and Mark exemplify the catch-22 of divorce. Mark clearly
needed his father, and perhaps he would have benefited from a
stepfather in the house. But children, especially girls, often
find themselves in an adversarial relationship with their stepfathers,
competing for the time and affection of their mothers. As Barbara
Dafoe Whitehead reports, &quot;In general the evidence suggests
that remarriage neither reproduces nor restores the intact family
structure.... Indeed, children living with stepparents appear
to be even more disadvantaged than children living in a stable
single-parent family.&quot;19 Too often, the additional time and
income available to adults who remarry is not invested in the
children.
<P>
<B>National Fatherhood Initiative</B> 
<P>
The National Fatherhood Initiative (NFI) hopes to take a comprehensive
look at the issue of fatherlessness. As Mary's experience indicates,
the problems of growing up fatherless are not limited to urban,
black neighborhoods. They are not even limited to the poverty
most divorced women and their children suffer. There are unforeseeable
consequences for children who know that their father chose not
to live with their mother even though it meant he would not live
with them. The drama, scope, and gravity of fatherlessness in
the inner city make it a social problem of greater urgency. But
surely we should not expect poor minorities to live by standards
set, but not lived, by policymakers in the suburbs.
<P>
As Commissioner on Children, Youth and Families in the Bush Administration,
Dr. Wade F. Horn began speaking in 1991 on the importance of fathers
and of the two-parent family for child development. At first he
says, &quot;People would stand up and leave the room.&quot; They
aren't leaving anymore. Last year, Don Eberly, president of the
newly-formed National Fatherhood Initiative (NFI), asked Dr. Horn
to serve as the group's director. Conceived as a research and
education organization, NFI recently began to accept individual
memberships. &quot;We were constantly getting phone calls from
men who had seen us speak or read an article. They wanted to know
how to join, and we just got tired of telling them they couldn't.&quot;
<P>
The message that played so badly four years ago but is drawing
crowds today is a simple one. According to Dr. Horn, &quot;The
two-parent family is not just different, which is what everyone
used to say. The two parent family is better. Even if everyone
can't have that, we need the ideal. I never make this a moral
argument. There is plenty of empirical evidence.&quot; NFI has
worked to see that the evidence is given a public hearing.
<P>
&quot;We have to get rid of the myth of the superfluous father,&quot;
says Horn. &quot;A man's worth as a father is independent of his
economic status. Fathers should not be judged by the size of their
wallets. And we should not be trying to make men into assistant
mothers. Fathers play a unique and irreplaceable role in the lives
of their children.&quot;
<P>
The masculine role in nurturing children is not widely appreciated
because it does not fit into the modern definition of paternal
love. Fathers and mothers relate differently to their children.
Fathers tend to encourage their children to strive for excellence.
They push their children to be successful. And they are quick
to offer guidance and support. Because fathers demand the best
from their children, they are pivotal in character formation.
<P>
Fathers also tend to spend more time playing with their children.
Because their play is more physical than mothers', from team sports
to horseplay around the house, it becomes an important factor
in teaching children when and how to take risks. According to
NFI literature, &quot;This is a perfect example of how fathers
and mothers together form a terrific parenting team. Father encourages
risk taking. Mother encourages caution. Together, they give the
child a perfect message: try new things; use judgement; if you
get hurt or fail, we are here to comfort you.&quot;
<P>
According to Horn, it is very important that Americans realize
that &quot;men are very unlikely to be committed and responsible
fathers in the long term outside of marriage.&quot; If a child's
parents are not married, even men who try hard to be good fathers
tend to disappear from their children's lives after the first
two-and-a-half-years. But children need the love and support of
their fathers for more than just a couple of years. Moreover,
fathers who develop visiting relationships with their children
cannot replace full-time parents.
<P>
Early in his career as a clinical psychologist, Horn observed
that it was not unusual for child psychologists to believe that
they were more important to the children they treated than parents.
&quot;I remember thinking that I must have been absent on the
day they handed out the magic wands. There was no way that I,
with all of my expertise, could do for a child in a couple of
hours a week what the commitment of the parents could do. In my
experience, most parents were genuinely trying to do what was
best for their children.&quot;
<P>
&quot;The experts tend to get very caught up in the minutia of
what parents must do with their children at six months, eight
months, two years. And they predict terrible consequences if their
plan isn't followed to the letter. Actually, in nearly every case,
fathers just need a few general principles. They can work out
the application for themselves.&quot;
<P>
The three principles Dr. Horn tries to convey to fathers can be
summed up as time, commitment and responsibility. Love covers
a multitude of sins. And Dr. Horn believes that if fathers are
true to these three principles, everything else can be worked
out.
<P>
<B>Time</B>: For the last two decades, experts have said that
parents could get away with spending very little time with their
children, as long as it was &quot;quality time.&quot; Dr. Horn
says, &quot;This was a wonderful salve for parental guilt, but
a lousy way to rear children.&quot; Fathers should spend plenty
of time with their children. What families do together is less
important than their spending time together.
<P>
<B>Commitment</B>: A man must be committed to his marriage; and
he must keep his commitments to his children. Commitment shows
up in little ways every day. If you tell your child that you are
going to do something, stick to that commitment. More than anything,
you show commitment by spending time with your children. Fathers
should be willing to work as hard at their families as they do
at their careers.
<P>
<B>Responsibility</B>: A father's primary responsibilities include
insuring that his children are well fed, safely housed, and clothed.
In addition, he should teach them good manners and self-discipline.
How these matters are handled is best determined by each couple
according to its circumstances. But a father should not blame
someone else if his children are unsupervised, ill-mannered, or
not eating properly.
<P>
NFI works to persuade Americans that Washington policy formulas
cannot solve the problems their own families and communities face.
NFI President Don Eberly is quick to point out that government
policies alone, however worthy, will not rebuild America's families.
Consequently, the National Fatherhood Initiative focuses primarily
on challenging, from the ground up, the idea that fathers are
dispensable.
<P>
In October of 1994, the Initiative convened the first National
Summit on Fatherhood, which is planned as a bi-annual event. The
Summit, held in Dallas, Texas, featured board members David Blankenhorn,
actor James Earl Jones, Dr. Louis Sullivan, former U.S. Secretary
of Health and Human Services, and congressman and former pro football
star Steve Largent. Vice President Al Gore delivered one of the
keynote addresses. After the success of the Summit, NFI launched
the National Fatherhood Tour, featuring NFI board chairman David
Blankenhorn. The goal of these tours is to promote grassroots
efforts dedicated to fostering fatherhood in local communities.
<P>
Most recently, NFI has been accepted as a client of the Ad Council
and hopes to air its first public service announcements in early
1996. This year NFI published <I>Father Facts</I>, a monograph
by Dr. Horn which compiles the most compelling data on fatherhood
in a usable format.
<P>
NFI's actions at the community level will be complemented by its
most ambitious goal. Although still on the drawing board, NFI
hopes to work in five pilot cities bringing local leaders together
to create a &quot;father friendly community.&quot; Two cities
have already asked for NFI's help.
<P>
Community leaders will be asked to sign a statement supporting
the importance of fathers, and back up their commitment with three
to five specific actions supporting fatherhood in their communities.
The owner of a local radio station, for example, might commit
to airing public service announcements. A business leader might
commit to respecting an employee's family responsibilities and
to encourage other community businessmen to do likewise. The goal
is to have community members encourage one another to meet family
responsibilities and to dispel the &quot;myth of the superfluous
father.&quot;
<P>
<B>Vive La Difference</B> 
<P>
For 2,500 years, the Western philosophical tradition has spoken
on gender with one voice: women and men share in all that is essential
to human nature. Differences, in this respect, are less significant
than similarities. Nevertheless, those differences are immutable
and important for it is the differences between women and men
that form the basis of the family. Rail against them, we may.
Diminish their importance, we certainly have tried; but eliminate
them, we cannot. Even the most savage, totalitarian, Marxist regimes
were reluctantly forced to concede to human nature on this issue.
Through brutal repression families could be distorted, but they
could not be eliminated.
<P>
Failing to respect the differences and complimentary nature of
the sexes breaks down the bonds of affection in the family. The
competitive rather than cooperative spirit it sows has resulted
in widespread mistrust within an institution designed, among other
reasons, to promote the happiness of its members.
<P>
Those who see marriage as merely a contractual agreement between
consenting adults tend to view with suspicion its restrictions
upon individual liberty. Even some who wish to defend the family
as necessary find themselves in the awkward position of arguing
that while a stable society needs stable families, and stable
families need fathers, men may be happier outside of the family.
<P>
However, the evidence suggests that the bachelor's life is anything
but carefree. As George Gilder writes, &quot;In general, compared
to others in the population, the single man is poor and neurotic...
disposed to criminality, drugs, and violence. He is irresponsible
about his debts, alcoholic, accident prone, and susceptible to
disease.&quot;20 These qualities tend to slough off quickly upon
marriage, only to reappear after the loss of a wife through death
or divorce.
<P>
In short, while men may be quite capable of taking care of themselves,
they tend to do so only when they have families who need them.
Single men have almost twice the mortality rates as married men.21
<P>
At the outset of the sexual revolution, progressive pundits liked
to say that the institution of marriage, having outlived its usefulness,
was dying a natural death. But the facts of life have not changed.
Married men still earn some 70 percent more than singles <I>of
either sex</I>.22 And, far from being a liberating experience,
single motherhood is the surest route to poverty. In fact, 94
percent of the AFDC (welfare) caseload is single-parent families.23
Economically and socially, marriage subsidizes a life support
system for &quot;alternative families&quot; because they have
proven too weak to survive on their own.
<P>
Nevertheless, a handful of radical feminists argue that bringing
men home will only make matters worse for some women and children.
This undoubtedly is true but deceptive. It is like banning penicillin
because some people experience a serious allergic reaction to
it. It makes the perfect the enemy of the good. Unfortunately,
it also is an indication of how divorced some elements of the
feminist movement are from the actual experience of the large
majority of Americans. Finally, it demonstrates the ability of
a small, but well-organized coalition to perpetuate a distorted
view of family life through its influence within the academic
community.
<P>
Responsible fatherhood may not be easy. But it is natural. No
twelve-step legislative program is necessary for its recovery.
The government needs only to cease penalizing and discouraging
traditional families. Our cultural institutions, with the help
of human nature, can do the rest.
<P>
Half of anything is a lot. Half of all marriages end in divorce.
Half of all divorces involve children. Half of America's children
are growing up with only half of their parents.24 Half of the
children who do not live with their fathers have never even darkened
his doorway. It is increasingly clear that children who grow up
without their fathers don't stand half a chance.
<HR>

<P>
<h3>PROMISE KEEPERS</h3> 
<P>
Another group with a message for men is Promise Keepers, and it
has been packing football stadiums all across the country. In
May more than 50,000 men paid $55 each to attend a conference
at RFK stadium in Washington, D.C. Judging by the crowd, Promise
Keepers appeals to men of all races, professions, income levels,
and political inclinations. The message they come to hear is that
a &quot;real man&quot; worships God, loves and respects his wife,
and supports his children. Eight more conferences are scheduled
through October 1995, and five of them are already sold out. All
are in major sports arenas capable of holding large crowds.
<P>
Only the National Organization for Women could possibly feel threatened
by a group of men as wholesome and diverse as the one gathered
at RFK. But, right on cue, NOW vice president Rosemary Dempsey
told the <I>Washington Post</I> that Promise Keepers was promoting
&quot;a not-very-well-cloaked misogynistic message.&quot;
<P>
Former University of Colorado football coach Bill McCartney founded
Promise Keepers in 1990. In the past year, its staff and budget
have grown more than five-fold. McCartney's goal is to reconnect
men with religion and a moral life by persuading them that men
can and should be masculine even as they worship God. Although
the organization requires no dues and is not membership-driven,
its program asks men to make seven promises: to honor Jesus Christ;
to have close male friends; to practice spiritual, moral, and
sexual purity; to be faithful to wife and children; to support
the church; to defy racial and denominational barriers; and to
go out and encourage the world to do the same.

The social and political war over 
		school choice has many battle
		fields, but none may be as important as the struggle now occurring in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which pits low-income and minority parents against the Milwaukee Teacher's Union, the National Education Association and the ACLU.  The conflict, described by author Daniel McGroarty in a new book, Break These Chains: The Battle for School Choice (Prima, 1996), is now headed to the U.S. Supreme Court after the Wisconsin Supreme Court deadlocked 3-3 this spring on the issue of the program's constitutionality.  The outcome of the case of Jackson v. Benson  "will determine the future of the nation's most promising educational reform," says Institute for Justice attorney Clint Bolick, who represents the 1,500 parents and students participating in the program and who is pushing to expand it to 15,000 students.
	As part of a campaign to kill the voucher program in the cradle, a Milwaukee group called "Rethinking Schools" has published a 32-page pamphlet titled "False Choices: Why School Vouchers Threaten Our Children's Future," and it is working with the Milwaukee teachers union and the National Education Association to see that it is widely distributed.  McGroarty writes that the pamphlet's objective "is to taint the very idea of vouchers by portraying it as inherently racist."  In an introductory essay, Robert Lowe, editor of the eponymous newspaper put out by the group, charges that "the first school choice program provided white students in Virginia public funds in order to attend private academies in order to avoid attending public schools with blacks."  A cartoon in the Rethinking Schools newspaper, distributed free to teachers, shows black and white students drinking from separate water fountains. By poisoning a debate over educational policy with the red herring of racism, opponents of school choice think they can kill the program.
<p>
	Fortunately Rethinking Schools and its allies have formidable opponents whose advocacy of school choice in Milwaukee cannot be vanquished by whispers of racism.  One is former school superintendent Howard Fuller, who pronounced the public schools in his city "a failing system."  Fuller told Foundation Watch "I support low income vouchers.  People with money already have choice.  People like Bill and Hillary Clinton have choice.  Vouchers empower poor people, and I support the expansion of vouchers to sectarian and religious schools."  Fuller resigned as superintendent after a bruising battle with the teachers union over vouchers.  An African-American who holds a doctoral degree in Education (and who is married to the former Detroit Superintendent of Schools),  Fuller is currently a professor of education at Marquette University.
	Another choice advocate is Polly Williams, the African-American Democratic state representative from inner-city Milwaukee who broke with her party's leadership to push the choice program through the Wisconsin legislature.  A passionate believer in doing whatever it takes to secure opportunity for those she represents, Williams told McGroarty,  "The way I saw it, the system is preparing our children for slavery. Look at the situation: Drop out by tenth grade, get into the street life _ when you should be walking across that stage getting a diploma, you're standing in front of a judge wearing chains."
	Williams' statement is a sharp retort to the white liberals who provide the funding for Rethinking Schools, a group who make convenient use of Rethinking Schools' race-baiting to mask their own interests in maintaining the school system as a municipal power base and source of job security. For, contrary to the claims of Rethinking Schools, in the 1990's the push for school choice has come from advocates like Fuller and Williams and from black parents whose children are trapped in collapsing urban school systems.  School choice has become a weapon against the very forces of the white liberal power elite, forces which have impoverished the inner city and racially segregated its schools despite decades of political promises, court orders, and school busing.
	More rigid ideologues than pragmatic educators, the editors of Rethinking Schools are unmoved by the facts of the matter.  They allege that schools of choice will unfairly siphon the "cream" of Milwaukee students, the best and brightest, from the public schools, making them 'islands of excellence for the already privileged.'  In fact, Milwaukee's choice program is limited to families at or below 175 percent of the poverty line and the privileged have left the system.  But Rethinking Schools would rather kill the chance for low-income children to acquire a superior education in order to maintain control over a system that gives all children an equally inferior one.

<a name="flow"></a>
<h3>THE EDUCATION MONEY FLOW: <br>
JOYCE'S TIDAL SHIFTS</h3>
<p>
Rethinking Schools' anti-school 
		choice tracts have been published 
		with financial support from the New World Foundation of New York City and the Joyce Foundation of Chicago.  In describing their motivation, James Miller, president of the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, says that "Rethinking Schools is the new socialism.  It has just been repackaged.  They are very, very left of center, and to a large degree they are just apologists for the status quo in education."  
	With assets of some $21 million, the New World Foundation  has never shrunk from the notoriety which its support for far-left causes has provoked.  When the New World Foundation was chaired by Hillary Clinton (before she became First Lady) it funded such groups as the pro-Sandinista Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador (CISPES) Education Fund, the conspiracy-minded Christic Insitute, SANE/FREEZE, and the National Lawyers Guild.  So its support for Rethinking Schools is not surprising.
  	Rethinking Schools' other patron is, however, far richer and, appropriately has been far more circumspect.  Chicago's Joyce Foundation was founded in 1948 by Beatrice Joyce Kean, whose family-owned timber business yielded profits which were invested and managed with the guidance of the family's law firm, Lord, Bissell and Brook. When she died in 1972, ninety percent of her fortune went to the Joyce Foundation. Today, the Joyce Foundation is among the top fifty private grantmaking foundations in the United States, with assets listed at $587,899,563 as of December 31, 1995.  Last year the foundation awarded some $21 million in grants in eight program areas.  
	Joyce's education division awarded the largest sum _ $7,157,740 _ to forty-three grantees.  It may be presumed that Rethinking Schools grant application was reviewed by one or more of the division's program officers. Warren Chapman was formerly an official of the Illinois State Board of Education and the Illinois Department of Corrections.  He holds a doctorate in education.  Ellen Alberding, an MBA who doubles as an investment officer for the foundation, was a scheduler on Senator Adlai Stevenson III's Democratic gubernatorial campaign and worked in development for the Express-Ways Children's Museum.  Her husband was counsel to Mayor Richard Daley.  Peter Mich, who also holds a doctorate in education, previously worked for the Boys and Girls Clubs where he specialized in computer technology.
	Last year, the Joyce Foundation gave $100,000 to Marquette University's Institute for the Transformation of Learning to support a book project to be developed jointly by Rethinking Schools editor Robert Lowe and choice supporter Howard Fuller.  Fuller told Foundation Watch  that the Joyce grant was specifically "not for support of school choice." Fuller, who has also received support from Milwaukee's pro-school choice Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation for other projects supportive of vouchers, says Joyce wanted him to conduct a project in cooperation with Lowe "looking at the social relationship of teachers to kids."  Fuller said he worked with Rethinking Schools because they do "professional development for teachers, work for more teachers in the school system, and look at developing a rigorous curriculum.  I'm not going to say I'm not going to work with you on these things because you oppose school choice." 
	Meanwhile, Joyce's education division awarded Rethinking Schools more than three times as much money to fight Fuller on the school choice issue.  In 1995, the decade-old organization _ whose principal activity is publication and distribution of a quarterly tabloid newspaper and associated propaganda pamphlets _ received a grant of $348,380 "to publish and disseminate two booklets on school vouchers, school choice, and the issue of school equity; and to publish a series of articles about school-to-work, educational standards, assessment, and school accountability (3 years)."  
	The Joyce Foundation-subsidized articles were published in the organization's Rethinking Schools  tabloid.  Like the anti-voucher booklet, they were full of venom.  The Spring, 1996 issue, looking more like a 1960's-era copy of The Daily Worker or The Militant than an educational publication, featured articles with sloganeering headlines -- "Stop the 'English-Only' Nonsense" and "'Stand for Children' June 1 in Washington" -- alongside advertisements for pamphlets with titles like "Rethinking Columbus," which promised to "critique traditional versions of the conquest and its legacy." 
	Particularly noteworthy is Rethinking Schools  "Special Report"  by editor Barbara Miner entitled "Splits On The Right."  A credit line reads: "This package on the right wing was made possible through a grant from the Joyce Foundation." Accompanied by unflattering pictures of Pat Robertson, Ralph Reed, Lamar Alexander, William Bennett, and Phyllis Schlafly, among others, the report described the political forces that it sees arrayed against Rethinking Schools in the fight over school choice. Miner reports that Robertson has been charged with advocating "an authoritarian theocracy" and adds parenthetically, "The paramilitary right is generally considered a distinct phenomenon, although it maintains strong links to some groups within the religious right."  She suggests that other conservatives _ significantly nameless, because to name anyone at all would reveal how baseless  her charges are _ demonstrate a "willingness to espouse blatantly white supremacist and anti-Semitic views."  Repeatedly, Miner makes assertions of the "bigotry, white supremacy, homophobia, and theocratic authoritarianism of the religious right."    
	Miner's feature asserts that the Christian right wants "education based on rote obedience and memorization, and prefers to provide children ready-made answers instead of encouraging them to think for themselves."  The issue carries a number of sidebars.  One, headlined "Bradley helps bankroll movement," attacks parental rights groups.  It blames "Republican guru"  William Kristol and Bradley Foundation president Michael Joyce for "building a movement for parents' rights as a way to counter the women's and gay movements and to rally people against the 'nanny state.'"  Also included is a three-page spread in tiny type listing "Economic Conservatives and Religous/Far Right Organizations" (including  Capital Research Center, publisher of Foundation Watch), "Progressive Groups Monitoring the Right Wing," and "Conservative Publications," a list which includes The New Republic.
	Other indicators of the publication's skewed view of reality include a "Multicultural Resources" listing which features such items as "Mother Jones, One Woman's Fight for Labor," "Sexual Harrassment Institute," "Teasing and Bullying Workshops," "Viva La Causa!" and "Overcoming Homophobia in the Elementary Classroom."  A crude cartoon called "Something For Nothing" shows a member of Congress  calling for repeal of the Emancipation Proclamation and asking, "Without slavery, how can we compete with China?"
	Howard Fuller is charitable when asked about the Joyce Foundation's support for Rethinking Schools.  He says, "Sometimes both sides get out there.  I like [Joyce Foundation president] Debby Leff. I have great respect for [education program officer] Warren Chapman and what he's trying to do to make change for kids."  The opinion of the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute's Miller is more candid: "Rethinking Schools is way out there on the fringes," Miller told Foundation Watch, "and I'm sure that the Joyce Foundation people are aware of that."
	But when asked about the publications she funded with Joyce Foundation money, Foundation president Deborah Leff pleads ignorance.  "I don't know everything that group did," she told Foundation Watch when asked about the special section smearing conservatives.  "We did not fund Rethinking Schools to publish photos of Ralph Reed and Phyllis Schlafly.  We funded them on the choice issue." 
	Yet managing editor Barbara Miner told Foundation Watch that Joyce was probably aware of her group's activities, and suggested calling the Joyce Foundation to inquire. Her organization distributes 40,000 free copies of Rethinking Schools quarterly in the Milwaukee area and that "pretty much our only function is one of publishing."  She added that "Joyce has never dictated to us what to say.  But as with any grant proposal, we mentioned that there were several articles about several big issues in the education reform movement which were currently of concern."
	When asked, if Joyce did not know or approve of it, why Rethinking Schools gave the Joyce Foundation printed credit for its support of the  feature articles bad-mouthing conservatives and the Bradley Foundation,  Leff responded, "I apologize for not being familiar with the publication.  Grantees are going to put forward different perspectives, and just because a grantee takes on a position, there is no one position that's right.  That's wrong.  God help us if we have such a narrow debate so that there's only one way to go. We identify smart people, differing people."
	Some find Leff's explanations difficult to swallow. "That's a crock," says Miller.  "Did she know that Rethinking Schools were the major people who drove out [former Milwaukee superintendent of schools] Howard Fuller?  They are connected to a bunch of people who call themselves the New Party and Progressive Milwaukee, and all basically have the same address. There was a major election in Milwaukee right before Fuller resigned. The teachers union was heavily involved and the reformers lost.  Rethinking Schools was very much involved in that kind of stuff. They are totally opposed to school choice." 
	Miller's own think-tank, the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, received Joyce funding for work on the school choice issue before Leff became president in 1992.  But Miller subsequently spoke with Joyce staff members who told him, off the record, that "no one like us would get funded with them again, not while Debbie Leff was there."
	Leff, says Miller, is rather unlike her predecessor, Craig Kennedy.  "Kennedy was different, in that he was interested in new ideas.  It didn't matter who you were, it was what you were interested in doing," he explained.  "I think she's interested in new ideas if they're politically correct.  But if you're not politically correct, you're not going to get funded.  Everybody who seems to get money from them in Milwaukee is way left-of-center, and the dividing issue in getting money in Milwaukee is: Are your opposed to private school choice?"
	Dr. Chester Finn, director of the Educational Excellence Network and a former Department of Education assistant secretary for educational research, agrees with Miller.  "I have had no direct knowledge of the Joyce Foundation since she took over," he told Foundation Watch.  "I knew it quite well under Kennedy.  It was one of the most interesting and open-minded foundations.  It gave me some support to study school reform in Chicago.  It was characterized by inquisitiveness, receptivity to standards and heterodox thought. I would never have thought of it as a fellow-traveller of the education establishment when Craig was running it.  I even talked to the board sometimes."
	Finn says the atmosphere changed when Kennedy left the foundation to work for Chicago businessman Richard J. Dennis.  "Craig left and this woman from the world of television arrived. I never met her.  A lot of people I know just rolled their eyes.  It was no longer an interesting, unconventional, or open-minded place under her leadership.  A kind of window closed, a shade came down.  There was no further communication.  All gone."
	Leff retorts sharply to complaints from past recipients like Miller and Finn, "If you haven't applied for funds, you can't get them."  Paula Wolff, a Joyce board member since 1989 and currently president of Governors State University in University Park, Illinois, adds that shifts in foundation priorities are normal over time, and that no one should expect the same grantees to be funded when new administrations take over foundations. "There certainly have been some new initiatives, rewriting of the guidelines, but foundations are changing all the time," she told Foundation Watch.

<h3>CHARLES U. DALY:  STILL<br>
A POWER BEHIND THE THRONE</h3>
<p>
School choice is but one example 
			of the debate over shifting fund
			ing policies at the Joyce Foundation since Deborah Leff departed New York City and ABC News for the foundation presidency in Chicago (salary $180,000). Yet one prominent member of the Joyce board disagrees with the perception that there has been a real change in priorities.  
	Charles U. Daly is a veteran of "Camelot."  A personal friend of members of the Kennedy family and keeper of its secrets as director of the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston and, currently, director of the Kennedy Library Foundation, Daly is a former president of the Joyce Foundation.
	He served on the search committee which chose Leff from a shortlist of eight finalists, "all of whom were women," he told Foundation Watch proudly. "It was time for a change from the white Anglo men," he added (Daly is Irish and maintains a farm in Ireland). A practicing Catholic, he notes with some pride that even under Leff,  "you won't find Joyce funding abortion."
	Daly held the presidency of the Joyce Foundation from 1978-86 after serving as vice-president for government and community affairs at Harvard University (1971-76) and vice-president of the University of Chicago for public affairs and development (1964-71). He is a smart politician of the old school, bluff, gruff, and tough. He salts his conversation liberally with profanity and is at once charming and intimidating. Daly makes it impossible to doubt his assertion that his gamble of putting 80% of the assets of the foundation into the stock market allowed it to grow from $160 million in 1986 to over $500 million today. He also claims credit for convincing Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, former chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, to change the tax laws in a way which permitted foundations to expand rather than expend their portfolios.
	An active Democrat, and traditional Kennedy liberal, Daly is a staunch champion of Leff ( who made a personal contribution of $1,000 to the Democratic National Committee in 1992 ) and believes she is supporting precisely the kinds of social concerns which  excited him when he headed Joyce.  Trained as a journalist (he has a masters degree from Columbia Journalism School) the Dublin-born Daly was a White House staffer in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. He has edited three publications: Media and the Cities, The Quality of Inequality, and Urban Violence.  
	A self-professed risk-taker and high-stakes gambler,  he likens selecting Joyce grantees to his Korean War service as a Marine: "A lieutenant said, `I know damn well not enough of you are doing well, because not enough of you are getting killed.'" Leff should wear criticism like a purple heart, Daly thinks -- it means she's doing her job at Joyce. "Kennedy did a better job than I did," Daly told Foundation Watch, "and Leff is doing a better job than either of us did.  I think it is a place that is not afraid to be on the cutting edge.  I welcome that sort of continuing change."
	Leff is precisely the type of  president Daly had in mind, one who would shake things up. "The last thing we wanted was some busted-out university president who wanted to put on a tweed coat and enjoy life," he added.  "I think independent foundations ought to be independent.  Let's not all get in the same club.  I get so frustrated on all this  'lets get together and fund things...' In other areas of society, you'd call the antitrust lawyers in."
	Daly says Leff must be allowed to decide her own priorities.  "You hire the chief executive and let that person do the job.  The problem is you get used to the same people telling you you're terrific.  So you're funding Checker Finn and everyone tells you you're doing great work."  Daly says he approves of  the new directions Leff is charting.  He seems happy that Leff is annoying people.  "I see any kind of lock-step stuff as a problem area," he told Foundation Watch.  "There should be true free enterprise in foundations."
	Yet Daly's own testimony gives evidence that Leff is taking the foundation away from where Daly might have led it. Daly said he liked to fund both sides of a debate, and like that his successor, Craig Kennedy, funded the Heritage Foundation, "so you could talk to them." When pressed, he admits that during his tenure he was not personally against school vouchers.  "We put money into St. Ignatius," he recalled. "I asked Professor John Hope Franklin, `Have we screwed up the public school system by supporting private education?'  And he said, `Anything you can do to help a child get an education is worth it.'  There is some balance."  However, Daly was skeptical of the Bradley Foundation's program of grants of scholarship money to the poor children of Milwaukee, arguing, "For a foundation to piss away its assets on scholarships is not the best thing to do."  Daly did confess that he had himself attended Columbia Journalism School on a $600 scholarship (Leff was on scholarship at Princeton).
	However, Daly's faith that Leff shares his commitment to independent thinking and debate may be misplaced. She told The Chicago Tribune in 1993: "Would I fund a dissenting point of view just to have a dissenting point of view? No. It may not be valuable toward reaching [a program's] goal, especially considering the foundation has very limited funds."
<p>
<a name="greens"></a>
<h3>FUNDING THE GREENS</h3>
<p>
True to Daly's account, Leff has 
			maintained some longstanding 
			Joyce programs.  The foundation has a tradition of support for environmentalism, and it is a major supporter of efforts to clean up the Great Lakes.  Last year the foundation made sixty-one grants totalling $6,154,413 to environmental projects, making this area its second largest program expenditure.  
	One foundation insider told Foundation Watch that Joyce's environmental grants traditionally mix support for "wacky" political advocacy groups with more praiseworthy mainstream efforts.  And Jonathan Adler, director of environmental studies at the Competitive Enterprise Institute and author of Environmentalism at the Crossroads (Capital Research Center, 1996) observes that the foundation "is one of the few philanthropies that has made grants to Greenpeace."  A $20,000 award was made to the radical environmental group in 1993 for "Eco-Clean," a "green" drycleaning method which does not use solvents.  
	In 1995, Joyce gave $750,000 to San Francisco's Tides Foundation for environmental projects; $225,000 to Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, a Washington, D.C. consumer advocacy group whose founder, Ellen Haas, now oversees food labelling, food stamps and the school lunch program as President Clinton's appointee in the Department of Agriculture; and $50,000 to the United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice "to identify and develop strategies for implementing President Clinton's Executive Order on Environmental Justice."
	A $100,000 grant went to the Union of Concerned Scientists Biotechnology Policy Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Adler told Foundation Watch, "They've been heavily involved in biotechnology _ in stopping it.  Why does anyone ever want to stop progress?"  But Leff strongly defends biotechnology's critics, arguing "If you start introducing genes into crops, there is a risk that the crops will become pesticide resistant over time.  You don't know what the long-term ramifications of what that gene-splicing will be.  Is it going to be for better or worse?"
	Adler observes that Leff's attitude would block most scientific research because her demands can never be satisfied.  No one can ever fully anticipate the consequences of a new technology before it is implemented.  "I think some of their funding of that area reflects a skeptical view of the value of technology. They gave some money to the Rockford Institute once, the Chronicles people, for anti-progress environmental stuff.  It was an effort by Jeremy Rifkin-types to woo paleo-conservatives."
	Leff disagrees: "We're not against biotechnology.  We are just looking at industrial tradeoffs.  We are working with industry people.  We are concerned about the midwestern United States.  We are deeply concerned about the vitality of the region."  A $200,000 grant to the Environmental Defense Fund "to encourage the use of market incentives to reduce air pollution" offers some evidence that Leff is right to deny that the Joyce Foundation is reflexively anti-business.
	Kara Kellaher Mikulich and Margaret O'Dell are the program officers for Joyce's environmental grantmaking.  O'Dell, at Joyce since 1989, previously worked in the University of Chicago's department of Foundation Relations. Mikulich, who arrived in 1996, is a Stanford law school graduate, was finance director for Senator Edward Kennedy's 1988 campaign, and worked for Congressman Rick Boucher (D-VA), prior to stints with private law firms and a job as staff attorney at the Legal Assistance Foundation of Chicago.

<a name="funding"></a>
<h3>FUNDING EMPLOYMENT</h3>
<p>
Employment is a third area of Joyce 
		Foundation concern.  About two-
		thirds the size of the environment program, the division last year spent $4,477,373, under the supervision of Mikulich and Unmi Song, an M.B.A. who was formerly a vice-president of Bankers Trust Company.  A political edge is evident here as well, with grants of $100,000 to the National Women's Law Center in Washington, D.C.; $100,000 to the Women's Legal Defense Fund; and $60,000 to the 9 to 5 Working Women Education Fund.  Carin Clauss, brought on the Joyce Board of Directors by Leff,  and U.S. Solicitor of Labor in the Carter administration, served on the litigation committee of the ACLU Women's Rights Project, and knew Leff from her political activities [see box on page 8]. Other large grants went to more mainstream projects such as $100,000 to MIT "to investigate policy and investment strategies for the metalworking industry in the Midwest region to increase its international competitiveness while expanding job opportunities."  The foundation is also a major funder of sometimes controversial  "school-to-work" programs.
<p>
<a name="gun"></a>
<h3>"GUN VIOLENCE"?  SQUASH IT!</h3>
<p>
Grants in the area of "gun vio
		lence" are the most evident sign 
		of Leff's impact on the Joyce Foundation.  Under her personal supervision _ Leff is listed as program officer in the Foundation's annual report _ Joyce gave $1,170,392 to ten projects last year.  Among them were the Handgun Epidemic Lowering Plan in Chicago, which got $140,000 for "a national coalition of groups committed to a public-health approach," $42,500 to Johns Hopkins University's Center for Gun Policy and Research "to develop and promote an advertising code for firearms," and $200,000 to the Violence Policy Center in Washington, DC. (For more about gun-control groups see "Gun Control: Is theTide Turning?" by Austin Fulk, Organization Trends, June 1996.)
	Leff says she first became aware of the issue when she worked at ABC News and "looked at the number of gun deaths in Bangladesh compared to the number of gun deaths in Harlem.  To hear that men in Harlem lived less long than men in Bangladesh was shocking."  Perhaps because of the Kennedy assassinations, Daly is also a strong proponent of initiatives to deal with crimes committed with guns.  
	Leff argues that since "nobody wants 40,000 Americans to die of gun violence," the solution is obvious: "Let's take it out of the political debate and make it a consensus."  To achieve consensus on an issue that turns on the interpretation of the second amendment to Constitution, Leff resorts to the popular appeal of therapy and the authority of medicine rather than law.  
	She went to Jay Winsten, a biology Ph.D. on the faculty of the Harvard School of Public Health's Center for Health Communication, whose specialty is public relations campaigns -- most famously for the "Designated Driver." Leff gave Winsten  $50,000 in 1993 "to develop strategies to get the public to think of gun violence as a public health problem." That same year Joyce gave the Harvard School of Public Health $93,500 to conduct a Harris poll to determine "how the connection between guns and health can be made."
	In an April, 1996 Weekly Standard article called "Handgun Control, M.D." Tucker Carlson described the logic underlying Leff's approach: "Framed in medical terms, gun-related mayhem begins to look like one of society's most easily solved problems _ nothing at all like the complex affliction that has stymied the best efforts of police, judges, and criminologists for better than a century. If violence is a disease, the cure is simple: Get rid of the guns." 
	But as Carlson points out, "guns aren't pathogens; not biologically, not even metaphorically. Genuine pathogens, as any doctor knows, cause disease when introduced into a pathogen-free environment. Considering that there are more than 200 million privately owned firearms in the United States, only a miniscule fraction of which are ever used in acts of violence, guns don't qualify under this definition." Carlson argues there is no shooting epidemic, since the incidence has remained fairly steady in recent years and even declined in some localities. The medical metaphor won't work. 
	No matter. The facts of criminal justice won't stand in the way of  Leff's goal: "changing social norms." What gun owners saw as a second amendment right was instead a medical problem and the reason Leff turned to   Winsten, who developed Harvard's "Squash it" campaign at Leff's instigation.
	Winsten  works with gang members and "gangsta rappers" to get his public relations message across. He asks recording artists to include a "Squash it" lyric, and has developed his own gang-like hand signal. The Harvard professor arranges for public service announcements on television by "gangsta rap" stars. His goal is not to eliminate violent songs, but to add to them the option of walking away from confrontation. Unlike Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-CT), former drug czarWilliam Bennett or National Political Congress of Black Women president C. Delores Tucker, Winsten likes and approves of "gangsta rap."
	He argues, "Gangsta Rap is going to continue to have violent images in it. I don't believe it caused what's happening on the streets. It's a reflection of it." Instead, Winsten maintains his goal is to provide listeners with a choice _ to fight or to walk away. He explains, "If there's a point where someone makes a business decision to walk away, offering two options, you can choose to fight or not to fight, I'm more than willing to settle for a mixed message."
	Winsten (who told Foundation Watch he did not believe the Beatles were promoting LSD use in "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds" when he heard the song as a youth) has great faith that urban youth can learn nonviolent conflict resolution through "gangsta rap." One Winsten script for a P.S.A., by Vinnie of  "Naughty By Nature", illustrates Harvard's "Squash it" approach: 
	No argument is worth winning especially if it means you could lose your life. You can keep your self-respect without getting into a bunch of senseless violence. When you're involved in an argument that looks like it's going to get ugly, show that you're the strong one. Just walk away. Yo, it may not be easy at first but you can handle it. You're strong. And walking away from confrontation is the thing you'll have to learn for self-preservation. So, you, avoid the drama. Squash it (hand signal).
 	There can be no better illustration than these lyrics of what Jeffrey R. Snyder has called the "Nation of Cowards" approach to crime. Writing in the Fall, 1993 issue of The Public Interest, Snyder notes, "The media and law enforcement establishment continually advise us that, when confronted with the threat of lethal violence, we should not resist, but simply give the attacker what he wants...How can one who believes that the essence of his dignity lies in his self-determination passively accept the forcible deprivation of that self-determination?"
	Yet that is precisely what Winsten wants. And incredibly, the member of Harvard's public health faculty does not advocate that inner-city youth report crimes to the police. It is a strange position for a professional working in the field of public health, dependent as it is on epidemiological reporting data.  Yet Winsten told Foundation Watch, " When you walk up to the cop, do you think anything is going to happen?  It's like a parking violation to write up the theft of a gold chain. The criminal justice system has zero credibility with these kids." 
	Winsten's decriminalization approach -- and the concomitant medicalization of urban crime -- transfers police authority to kids who belong to criminal gangs and the singers who glorify them.. "They see that one arrest after another they are back out on the street, and [law enforcement] has major problems with credibility in the inner-city," he said. "Gangsta rappers" have credibility with street hoodlums the police lack.

<h3>STATEHOUSE SELLOUT: <br>
JOYCE MONEY FOR POLITICS</h3>
<p>
One other major Joyce Founda
			tion priority is a special Project 
			on Money and Politics directed by Lawrence N. Hansen, formerly a professor at George Washington University who headed the "Democracy Agenda Project."  Hansen was once vice-president of the failed Roosevelt Center for American Policy Studies, which was well-endowed by Richard Dennis, and whose board included  Henry Cisneros, Alan Sagner (a Clinton appointee to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting), and Peter C. Goldmark, Jr., president of the Rockefeller Foundation (see Foundation Watch v.I, n.4, May, 1996,  "The Rockefeller Foundation: The Big Money Behind Multiculturalism"). He also had been administrative assistant to Senator Adlai Stevenson III (D-IL) and Vice-President Walter Mondale. Hansen made thirteen grants totalling $1,082,190 to this project in 1995.
	Joyce grants in this category include a $30,000 grant to the leftist magazine Mother Jones for articles on the 1996 campaign finances of the 1994 freshman class in Congress; $200,000 to the Center for Responsive Politics to track campaign contributions; $80,000 to National Public Radio to cover campaign finance issues; $75,000 to the Radio Television News Directors Association for seminars on campaign finance; and $30,000 to the Tides Foundation to monitor radio coverage of money and politics. 
	The Center for Public Integrity in Washington, D.C. is on retainer with ABC News, Leff's former employer. It is headed by Charles Lewis, like Leff a former television producer (for Nightline and 60 Minutes). Last year it received $109, 912 from Joyce for a project which resulted in a special series The Indianopolis Star: "Statehouse Sellout: How Special Interests Hijacked the Legislature."   Of course, the story paid scant attention to the interests of foundations, or the power of their money (for example, Joyce grants approved by Daly during his presidency stopped the World's Fair from coming to Chicago). The Star's front page photo caption read "Money Talks," the lead read:
	Something was missing from the Indiana General Assembly last year. Oh, the lawmakers were there, all right. The lobbyists were out in force. And so was big money. Nowhere in sight? Democracy.
	Such apocalyptic and hysterical language is echoed in Leff's "President's Letter" in the Joyce Foundation's 1995 Annual Report. Featuring the quotation from the Star, Leff's prose reads as if it had been ripped from the 1960's manifesto of a  New Left Radical:
	The date: 1996. 
	The place: Governments across America. 
	The crimes: Theft of the American people's confidence in the institutions that govern them. 
	Assault on the belief they have a voice and that those they elect will listen to them. 
	Leff concludes her letter with an impassioned call to arms:
	In the past, Americans have rallied when democracy is in danger.  It is time we do so again.
	Before it is too late, Charles Daly and the board of the Joyce Foundation should take another look at the direction their Foundation is heading. The warning signs are clear for those who wish to see them.

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>

	There are several errors of fact in your recent essay on the Rockefeller Foundation, but there is one in particular that I would like to correct. In describing John Frohnmayer's visit to Artists's Space in 1989 and the confrontation he faced on that occasion, you report that I was present.  I was not there. I realize that you are quoting John when you write this; he and I have spoken, and he confirms he has written and reported this as fact. But he mis-remembers (it happens to us all), and I simply want to set the record straight.
	John and I met many times, and sometimes we disagreed, but not in that place and not in that way.

<p>
	John Frohnmayer was provided with a copy of Albera Arthurs' letter and has not retracted his statements. However Susan Wyatt, who organized the event, has a plausible explanation for the misunderstanding. She told Foundation Watch, "She was not there. He made an error. She was invited, there was a list of names that was released to the press before the meeting, but she did not come."
<p>
	In regards to the Bruce Nauman works referred to in the "article" you did about the American Center in Paris: You are blatantly misrepresenting the artist's work. Her's what you wrote, and what remains on your web page as of my writing this:
<p>
  Fred Henry was no stranger to the gross and disgusting. His Bohen Foundation had been a sponsor of a Bruce Nauman exhibit that was shown at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and at the Smithsonian's Hirshhorn Museum. It featured neon signs flicking "F--- and Die," "S--- and Die," and depicted excited male sexual organs and a merry-go-round of slaughtered animals.
<p>
	The work which included the words Americans use but can't seem to hear or type is "100 Live and Die." In this piece, columns of 2 1/2" neon letters spell out 100 different verb phrases, including "F--- AND DIE" as well as "BREATHE AND DIE." Each verb is presented twice. Once with the words "AND LIVE" and once with the words "AND DIE." The words "f---" and "s---" are the only two out of the seven one can't say on network television which are included in this work. This work occupies a wall space of approximately 12' x 16', and the sequence of the illumination of the 100 word patterns happens over a period of about ten minutes, as I remember it.<p>
	The "depicted excited male sexual organs" your editor refers to are probably part of another neon piece where, in a two image sequence, a cartoon sillhouette of a clown doesn't have an erection and then has an erection.<p>
	The most hysterical dis-informational reference is to "a merry-go-round of slaughtered animals." These works are either straight aluminum or bronze castings of taxidermy forms, or groupings of the styrofoam forms themselves. Hint: These are the forms that taxidermists use to fill the skin of the animals hunters shoot.<p>
	Your inability to convey even the tiniest evidence that you have a clue as to what is going on culturally makes me distrust you even more than the image of the "Capitol" on top of the word "Capital."<p>
	Your veil is thin.<p>

For Joyce Foundation President Deborah Leff, Sisterhood has been Powerful
<p>
	Deborah Leff has long been a political activist. The fourty-four year old, five-foot two, never-married brunette is a protege of Michael Pertschuk, head of the Federal Trade Commission in the Carter Administration (she listed him as a reference when she applied for the Joyce job). Pertschuck says Leff was in his inner circle because "she was both a lawyer and a journalist." Pertschuk now heads the Advocacy Institute, which provides "strategic planning" to "those who advocate social and economic justice." From 1980 to 1981, she was director of the FTC's office of public affairs. She had helped design and implement Ralph Nader's consumer complaint study in 1974 while working at the Center for Responsive Law. Among her FTC projects was a ban on advertising to children (dropped when Ronald Reagan won in 1980).  Joyce gave Pertschuk's group $150,000 over two years shortly after Leff became president. <p>
	Leff's other cause has been the feminist movement. She entered Princeton on scholarship in 1969 at the recommendation of a family friend, the first year the University accepted women.  There she displayed a knack for cultivating powerful protectors. Leff was on University committees with then-president William Bowen, now president of the Mellon Foundation (see Foundation Watch vol.1, no.2,  "How they took the Stars and Stripes off the American Center in Paris"). Chosen University Scholar and Mademoiselle college guest editor, Leff rapidly became drawn into the feminist movement, joining the National Women's Political Caucus _ despite opposition from her mother (a National Institutes of Health researcher). "To her, women's movement people were a bunch of bra-burners," Leff told an interviewer. "She had made it on her own...and she just didn't see a need for it." <p>
	At the National Women's Political Committee, Leff came under the protection of Liz Carpenter, Lady Bird Johnson's confidant.Within a year, she was NWPC political director and receiving course credit for her activity.  Her  senior thesis was study of  media and the women's movement  She was "stunned" when she interviewed Walter Cronkite and he referred to feminist "nuts in the movement." Leff did not inform him she was politicial director for the NWPC. She did not obtain permission to sell her interviews. And she failed to find a publisher for her thesis, chapters of which remain sealed to this day.<p>
	 After Princeton, Leff went to work for Nader (a Princeton alum) and then studied law at the University of Chicago. There, Leff joined the "women's caucus" which filed a sex discrimination complaint against the school.  Her attempted transfer to Yale Law School failed when she was rejected. Leff graduated in 1977, went to work for the Carter administration, and the university later settled the case. <p>
	Leff joined Nightline as a field producer in 1983 on the recommendation of a feminst already at ABC News. She joined the "ABC News women's advisory board" with Carole Simpson to protest sex discrimination at the network.  Leff was promoted to senior producer on Nightline, World News Tonight, and 20/20 but never got  the job she wanted: executive producer for  Peter Jennings.<p>
	Through American Council of Learnerd Societies president Stanley Katz (whom she had known at the University of Chicago Law School), Leff contacted Adele Simmons, president of the MacArthur Foundation (and dean of students when she attended Princeton).  Simmons passed her name on to Jan Piercy,  a MacArthur consultant  and First Lady Hillary Clinton's Wellesley roomate, who then recommended Leff to Joyce.<p>

<p>
Kathleen Teltsch, who covered the philanthropy beat for The New York Times from 1979 to 1994, was 
interviewed upon her retirement by a writer for Foundation News and Commentary, a publication of the 
Council on Foundations.  She told the following story about her initiation into the world of nonprofit 
organizations. <p>
	Herb West, then president of the New York Community Trust, welcomed Teltsch's new 
assignment and took her to lunch, giving Teltsch what she considered "practical, much-needed advice."  
The advice was also in the form of a story.  It concerned the experienced foundation hand who greeted a 
young executive to his first foundation job by telling him, "Welcome to the field: you'll never eat a bad 
meal or hear an honest word." <p>
	Such is the reputation of philanthropy as understood by a correspondent of the most prestigious 
American daily newspaper.  And perhaps no organization better embodies the "field" than the Council on 
Foundations, the premier organization in American philanthropy.  Headquartered in Washington, DC, the 
Council serves over 1500 grantmaking foundations in the U.S. and abroad, helping them learn from one 
another and representing their interests to Congress and the agencies of government.  The grantmakers who 
are members of the Council hold an estimated $100 billion in assets. <p>
	Last month, the Council held its annual convention in Atlanta.  It was called "Philanthropy, 
Democracy, Participation: Work in Progress" and it met from April 22nd through April 24th at the Atlanta 
Marriott Marquis hotel.  The Marriott, a John Portman-designed 1671-room behemoth whose pod-like 
glass-enclosed express elevators speed guests through a 50-story indoor atrium, is home to the city's largest 
hotel ballroom (28,826 square feet).  And it was filled to the rafters when former President Jimmy Carter 
graced the convention's opening ceremonies, speaking to what Atlanta Constitution writer Dan Hulbert 
called "deep pockets." <p>
	No shrinking violent, Carter took the opportunity to openly pitch programs, including the troubled 
"Atlanta Project" supported, Carter mentioned, by Coca-Cola, United Parcel Service, Mariott Hotels, and 
Delta Airlines, among others. Carter also plugged the more successful, religiously-inspired Habitat for 
Humanity, and the Task Force on Disease Eradication, which with help from Precision Fabrics in 
Roanoake, Virginia  has indeed helped successfully eliminate guinea worm disease. He also put in a word 
for "Erasing the Stigma of Mental Illness," a favorite cause of former First Lady Rosalyn Carter.<p>
	Carter concluded, "I hope in the next few days you will consider a few of the things I've said and 
how we, together, can go on to greater things." It was an effective fundraising speech, and received 
tumultous applause. <p>
<P>
<a name="bread"></a>
<CENTER><H3>BREAD AND CIRCUSES</H3></CENTER>
Foundation Watch was there, too, and found Teltsch's characterization of philanthropic discourse - and diet - to be entirely 
accurate.  The convention's opening ceremonies were organized by the Host Committee for the 1996 
Olympics. The food, described by Constitution writer Hulbert as "a buffet wonderland," was indeed 
plentiful and delicious.  It was organized around the theme, "A Taste of the South."  [See box on page four..]  Foundation executives were greeted by Chinese Lion Dancers and the Hotlanta Dixieland Jazz 
Band as they mingled at the bar exchanging business cards.  Once seated at dinner, they were entertained 
by a program meant for "an influential cadre of out-of-towners" and intended to "create future funding 
opportunities for Atlanta arts groups," according to the Constitution.<p>
	The evening's entertainment was predictably multicultural and politically correct.  Its deficiencies 
in taste would foreshadow the Council's vision of philanthropy, one which would unfold during the 
subsequent days' conference sessions.
<p>        Instead of high culture, Council guests were subjected to high modernism:  the Atlanta Ballet 
performed "Read My Hips," an apparent allusion to President Bush's ill-fated promise to the electorate.  
The number featured dancers clad in black leotards engaged in what appeared to be Greco-Roman 
wrestling choreographed to a techno-pop beat. 
<p>         Mercifully, the duo of Cephas and Wiggins, Piedmont blues musicians, followed for a musical 
interlude.  They did a creditable job getting the notably rythmically-challenged crowd in a festive mood.  
Unfortunately, they were followed by some dreadful local theatre groups, including the "Cotton Patch 
Gospel" which made fun of Baptists.    
<p>        A most remarkable number was then performed by South Africa's Soweto Street Beat Dance 
Company.  "Upiyane" featured male dancers in African masks and loincloths leaping to drum beats.  After 
the techno-pop of the predominantly white Atlanta Ballet, the number provoked uneasy memories of the 
Jim Crow South among some in the audience, recollecting the delight white audiences once took in 
displays of black athleticism and imagined primitivism.  That the sterotypical number was imported from 
the country to which former Council on Foundations president James Joseph had been posted as American 
Ambassador made its selection seem ironic for the capital of the "New South."
<p>        Indeed, had the program organizers not possessed impeccable liberal credentials, the race-
consciousness of the evening's entertainment might have incited more than grumbles and muttering.
<P>
<a name="racial"></a>
<CENTER><H3>THE RACIAL POLITICS OF PHILANTHROPY</H3></CENTER>
What followed over the next several days in Atlanta had a similar tone and texture.  The lectures, panel 
discussions and symposia sponsored by the Council on Foundations seemed bent on purifying the work of 
philanthropy through ever more refined racial filters.  Modern philanthropy is troubled by appearances and 
anxious to ward off misunderstandings that it does much to create.  Hence, no act of generosity is so simple 
that it may not appear to be racially patronizing.  No call for assistance so heartfelt that it may not strike 
some as arrogant.<p>
	For instance, a panel discussion "exploring issues of democracy and civil life and the elements of 
effective civic participation" followed President Carter's speech. [For more on this topic, see Foundation 
Watch vol.I, no.1, "PBS's National Issues Convention."]  This was chaired by Roger Wilkins, who keeps 
the flame of the Great Society lit from a professorial sinecure at George Mason University.  The panel 
discussants were Elaine Jones, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund; Raul Yzaguirre, president of 
the National Council of La Raza; Patsy Mink, a Democratic member of the House of Representatives from 
Hawaii; William Kristol, editor of  The Weekly Standard; Leslie Lenkowsky, president of the Hudson 
Institute; and gaiashkibos, a "Consultant and Technical Advisor to Tribal Governments" who is a "Member 
of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of the Lake Superior Chippewa Indians" from Couderay, Wisconsin and 
who begged the audience not to think of Indians as rich because many tribes are entitled to many billions 
of dollars in legalized gambling revenues.
<p>        Wilkins' introduction of the panelists began with pointed remarks linking "white males" to 
conservative politics.  Of course, there are Black, Hispanic and Asian conservatives just as there are white 
male liberals.  But Wilkins was content to indulge in stereotyping, and then allowed other panelists to make 
casually disparaging remarks about the political proclivities of white males. 
<p>        The racial routine was played out in other panels at the Council on Foundations convention.  
White males were selected to represent the voice of conservatism.  They included Father Richard John 
Neuhaus, founder of the journal First Things and John Von Kannon, a vice president and treasurer of The 
Heritage Foundation. The message was clear: white male conservatives were the ruling class, reminders of 
the realm of privilege that foundations were mobilized to fight.  As such they might occasionally be on 
display, but they were excluded from the real political work of the convention. 
<p>        Nuts-and-bolts issues such as voter registration, dealing with the media, and responding to the 
"Istook Amendment," the proposal by Rep. Ernest Istook (R-OK) to prohibit advocacy by federal grantees, 
were handled in more action-oriented sessions.  Members of OMB Watch, the Advocacy Institute, the 
Center for Public Integrity and other liberal advocacy groups used these sessions to organize their forces 
and plan strategies.  This was particularly true for the pre-conference sessions of the so-called "affinity 
groups."  [See box on the California Civil Rights Initiative on page 6]. 
<p>        If the conference program had featured Dinesh D'Souza, Christina Sommers or Thomas Sowell it 
might have ignited real fireworks.  But the conference organizers preferred a dialogue of the deaf.  When 
Hudson's Leslie Lenkowsky told Mark Rosenman of the radical Union Institute that private grantmakers 
should compensate for spending cuts in federal programs, the audience responded with silence.  However, 
Rosenman's defense of the status quo was praised and his remarks were echoed by many in the audience, 
which included Rockefeller Foundation president Peter Goldmark.  [See Foundation Watch vol.1, no.5. 
"The Rockefeller Foundation: The Big Money Behind Multiculturalism" for more.]

<CENTER><H3>NOT TRUE BELIEVERS, JUST BUREAUCRATS</H3></CENTER>
Reflecting on his convention experience, WeeklyStandardeditor William Kristol told Foundation Watch,  
"It was in a certain way a comedy of philanthropic correctness. I was confirmed in my sense that liberalism 
was exhausted, that they're not true believers - they're just bureaucrats."
<p>        "This is good news and bad news," he added.  "They don't have much of an answer when you ask: 
'Why don't you judge by results?'  But the institutional momentum is hard to penetrate."
<p>        Heritage's John Von Kannon was struck by the way the members of the Council on Foundation's 
mispronounced the name Istook.  "They called him "Ish-took."  They pronounced the name like a Nazi war 
criminal."  However, Von Kannon says he was pleased to speak to the convention.  "I went up to 
[moderator] Judy Woodruff and said, "I want to thank you for not attaching an ideological label to The 
Heritage Foundation."  I even met a man who came up to me afterwards, saying he was delighted to find 
another conservative there."
<p>        The stultifying and politically correct nature of the Council on Foundations has been often noted.   
Dr. Marvin Olasky, author of The Tragedy of American Compassion, has published two scathing analyses 
of the Council on Foundations for Capital Research Center.  A 1985 monograph in Capital's Studies in 
Philanthropy series concluded that "Council leaders over the years have been consistently liberal, and the 
programs they have informally advanced have been consistent with that ideology."  Referring to the 
Council's fear of isolated and un-networked philanthropy by eccentric millionaires, Olasky observed, 
"There are worse things than Lone Ranger foundations - one is a nonprofit octopus." 
<p>        Eight years later Olasky revisited the Council in Philanthropically Correct: The Story of the 
Council on Foundations, the fourteenth monograph in the Capital series. Attending the national conference, 
which was held in Chicago, Olasky interviewed a number of Council members and officials.  His 
conclusion became even more bleak:  "The Council on Foundations' utopian search for perfect systems 
derives from hatred of man as he is.  And this is not philanthropy at all."
<p>        And in 1995 The New Republic sent writer David Samuels to cover the Council on Foundations 
annual convention in San Francisco.  His lengthy article, The Failure of American Foundations: 
Philanthropical Correctness, recalled Olasky's descriptions.  Said Samuels, "To wander the halls of the 
council-sponsored conference in San Francisco is to see the cartoon pages of William Bennett and Dinesh 
D'Souza brought spectacularly to life...A startling shift in foundation funding has occurred, away from 
research and toward the support of advocacy groups and the kinds of social service programs best 
accomplished by government and private charity."  In other words, the Council on Foundations was a Pied 
Piper leading philanthropists away from philanthropy.

Samuels' essay was indicative of the new critical attitude that the press and Congress were taking toward 
philanthropy. It was one of a number of developments which had a measurable effect on the Council on 
Foundations. 
<p>        The article had appeared just as Congress began debating the "Istook Amendment," the proposal 
to insure that government grants to nonprofit organizations did not end up indirectly subsidizing political 
activities.  That amendment, opposed by the Council on Foundations, when combined with The New 
Republic piece, and scandals surrounding the United Way and New Era Foundation,  had far-reaching 
consequences.
<p>        Veteran Council president James Joseph, a Yale-educated minister in the United Church of Christ, 
resigned in 1995 after fourteen years in office to take a Clinton appointment as ambassador to South 
Africa.  He was followed in retirement this year by Council board chair Marjorie Craig Benton, the wife of 
Benton Foundation president Charles Benton and a trustee of the leftist Bernard Van Leer Foundation of 
the Netherlands.  The Van Leer Foundation  has funded Israeli organizers of "Peace Now" demonstrations 
(as well as Israeli peace advocates who urge Jews to "forget" the Holocaust).
<p>
Those replacing Joseph and Benton seem to be politically better connected and more savvy about 
what a Republican Congress and a "triangulating" President will expect from the nonprofit sector.  Yet 
despite their mainstream credentials and careful acknowledgement of a new political climate, Skip Rhodes 
and Dorothy Ridings continue to articulate a liberal vision of philanthropy's purpose.
<p>
The incoming chairman of the Council on Foundations board was born and raised in Berkeley, 
California. Rhodes is a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley.  He joined Chevron in 1959 and 
has served in a number of positions, including marketing, antitrust litigation, business planning, 
government affairs, and public affairs.  Since 1986 he has been manager of Chevron's $45 million annual 
corporate contributions program.  (It is rated 4.88 out of a possible 8 - a "gentleman's C" - by Austin Fulk 
in the most recent edition of Capital's annual directory, Patterns of Corporate Philanthropy.) 
<p>         Rhodes told Foundation Watch that Chevron maintains an affirmative action program, a smoke-
free workplace, a recycling program, and actively participates in the Ms. Foundation's annual "Take Your 
Daughter To Work Day."  He added that the company was "considering" adding a "Take Your Son To 
Work Day" but had not considered a co-educational experience.
<p>        Rhodes argues that his chairmanship of the Council on Foundations "shows the inclusiveness plus 
the plurality of the membership."  He was on the board of directors only three years before being elected to 
the chairmanship this year. Rhodes took the job "because it was an opportunity to help the sector and to 
help my company."  Mixing with many foundation officials enables Rhodes to "network" and to "learn 
how others do it."  He says the activity of "sharing best practices" is a "win-win situation."  It will "expand 
my education."  
<p>        Rhodes told Foundation Watch that he hopes to rebut the anti-corporate feeling of some 
foundation officers, and he expressed pleasure that President Carter in his address had praised American 
business for its philanthropy.  Carter had applauded DuPont, which provided special filters at no cost to 
eliminate water-borne parasites such as the guinea worm in the Third World. The Chevron executive noted 
that as the first corporate officer in a decade to head the Council, he represented a minority group - 
corporate America - which accounted for only ten or twelve percent of its membership. He said he is 
grateful for the opportunity, but did not know if fears of Congressional action and the controversy over 
politically correct philanthropy were a factor in his selection.

<CENTER><H3>RIDINGS TO THE RESCUE</H3></CENTER>
Replacing James Joseph as president on February 5th was Dorothy S. Ridings, the editor of  Knight-
Ridder's Bradenton [FL] Herald.  Born in Charleston, West Virginia in 1939, Ridings is married to a 
businessman, Donald J. Ridings, and is the mother of two.  She earned journalism degrees from 
Northwestern's Medill School of Journalism and the University of North Carolina.  Ridings has been 
affiliated either as a board member or consultant with four major foundations - the Ford, Benton, Mary 
Reynolds Babcock, and John S. and James L. Knight Foundations.  
<p>        Most importantly, Ridings was president of the League of Women Voters and chair of its 
501(c)(3) Education Fund from 1982-86.  Proclaiming itself nonpartisan, especially when it seeks sole 
sponsorship of the presidential debates, the League spends about $5 million annually promoting liberal 
positions on policy issues under the guise of good government.  Described in 1992 as "just another liberal 
special interest group" by The Wall Street Journal, the League has opposed term limits and school choice, 
and supported gun control and regulatory mandates.  In 1994 it joined former House Speaker Thomas 
Foley in a legal challenge to a term limits measure that was approved by Washington state voters.  The 
action was a factor in Foley's defeat.
<p>        Ridings has promised to make the Council more open and accountable.  Her conference keynote 
address urged grantmakers to be more forthright about their activities and more accessible to the press.  
Why has she made this her goal?
<p>        "The perception was that organized philanthropy was an elitist activity," Ridings told Foundation 
Watch.  "I think a lot of grantmakers have not been media savvy and have been less than forthcoming for 
no reason other than they don't know what to do." 
<p>        The former newspaper executive confesses that some foundation leaders have not welcomed 
opportunities to explain their actions to the larger public. "There are those who say, 'That's not for us.' for 
reasons of family wealth or personal safety, or not wanting to be self-aggrandizing."  But Ridings seeks to 
reassure grantmakers that she is "not saying we all have to march to the same drummer."  Rather, she 
argues, "We ought to talk about what we do.  And the people whose work we fund ought to talk about what 
they do. We really have an obligation to help our grantees tell their story better."
<p>        Asked if a policy of openness, like Gorbachev's perestroika might not bring with it the risk of 
public disapproval, Ridings was confident.  She told Foundation Watch, "I'm a real believer in being open 
to people. It's more risky that way but in the long run it serves you better.  We're in a public business and 
we say we operate under the public trust."
<p>        Ridings says she believes the Istook amendment is a "symptom" of the "overall climate of 
distrust" surrounding philanthropy.  She hopes the Council can "become catalysts for a more open, 
encompassing public debate" about the purposes and methods of philanthropy.  "I believe debate and 
discussion educates and challenges us," she said.  Although she has a "quibble" whether her attraction to 
argument comes from a Southern sensibility, Ridings asserts that, unlike Yankees, Southerners have "never 
been very secretive" and have been "open about prejudices."  Some of this she attributes to a "strong caring 
for other people."
<p>        However, it is in her definition of caring for others that Ridings discloses the attitudes that made 
her palatable to those who named her Council on Foundations president.  Ridings takes strong exception to 
those who would limit charitable contributions to direct services to the needy, and she makes a strong case 
for the importance of advocacy activities.  "One of the reasons we have public charities is to advocate on 
behalf of the powerless," she told Foundation Watch.  "Charity is not just providing services.  A very 
important part is advocating on the part of those for whom you are providing the services."
<p>        "This is not a Lady Bountiful era of charity.  It is not food baskets and blanket distribution.  It is 
not just one thing.  You ought to be able to go down to the city council and say there: 'Charity cannot fill in 
all the gaps.'"

<CENTER><H3>PHILANTHROPY IN THE INFORMATION AGE</H3></CENTER>
A highlight of the conference was the presentation of the Wilmer Shields Rich Awards for Excellence in 
Communications.  At this grand ceremony in the grand ballroom, the Council on Foundations awarded 
prizes for best annual reports and newsletters, special reports and magazines, public information 
campaigns, published guidelines and World Wide Web homepages.  So that all might have some share of 
glory, awards were made in varying categories: for community foundations, corporate grantmakers, family 
foundations, and private foundations.  Similarly, the size of the foundation was acknowledged under $15 
million, over $15 million, over $25 million as well as the member's purpose public grantmaker or 
operating nonprofit.  
<p>        A beautiful brochure listed Gold, Silver, and Bronze award recipients.  All told, there were more 
than one hundred awards distributed for what were essentially achievements in public relations.
<p>        Each year the Council on Foundations also bestows the Robert W. Scrivner Award on a 
grantmaker "making a critical difference in a creative way"  and its Distinguished Grantmaker Award "to 
honor an individual whose long service and long-term commitment have helped elevate standards in the 
field."
<p>        Oddly, the Council has no award for the most cost-effective grants program that has delivered 
lives from welfare dependency, helped substance abusers overcome their addictions, placed abandoned 
children in loving homes, helped the handicapped, or found cures for sickness.  In other words, awards for 
actually doing good.
<p>        Ridings hesitated when Foundation Watch asked her if the Council might not institute awards of 
this sort.  "Maybe we ought to take a broader look at providing services," she said.  "But looking at awards 
programs, I'm not high on adding up more awards."  
<p>        When asked why the annual convention did not place as much emphasis on serving people 
directly as on formulating strategies for advocacy, Ridings responded, "The members make the program." 
<p>        The Council on Foundations does not need more public relations awards, nor does it require more 
rhetorical promises of "openness" or "accountability." Philanthropy's problems are not public relations 
problems, they are real ones.
<p>        What the Council needs to do is to reaffirm the centrality of service to the mission of 
philanthropy.  It ought to recognize what Bradley Foundation President Michael Joyce has called "a deep 
sense of disappointment, dismay, even shame, at the spectacle of the once-proud, optimistic, and 
forward-looking American charitable sector suddenly going AWOL at the precise moment the American 
public had turned to it with high expectations and hopes."
<p>        Unfortunately, Dorothy Ridings' declaration that "this is not a Lady Bountiful era of charity" gives 
little solace to those who were looking to her for a new era of leadership at the Council on Foundations.
<p>        Perhaps she and Skip Rhodes might reconsider their priorities  -- and put delivery of charitable 
services to the truly needy and the strengthening of traditional charitable institutions such as churches, 
orphanages, hospitals, and asylums at the top of their list.

<center><h3>COUNCIL AND AFFINITY GROUPS HOLD STRATEGY <br>SESSION TO FIGHT CCRI BALLOT 
MEASURE: <br>PLANNING SESSION MINUTES EXPOSE MULTIMILLION<br> DOLLAR FOUNDATION 
PUSH THIS  YEAR</center></h3>
<p>        Among the strategy sessions at the Council on Foundations event in Atlanta was one on fighting 
affirmative action, specifically the California Civil Rights Initiative scheduled for the November ballot.  
<p>        A copy of the minutes of the "joint affinity group meeting" on April 21st has been obtained by 
Foundation Watch. Called "Affirmative Action: What's at Stake," the action-oriented session was 
sponsored by Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders in Philanthropy; the Association of Black Foundation 
Executives; Hispanics in Philanthropy; the National Network of Grantmakers; Woman & Philanthropy, 
Women's Funding Network; the Working Group on Funding Lesbian and Gay Issues and the Council on 
Foundations,   "in cooperation with" the Council on Foundations and the Committee on Inclusiveness.<p>
<DD>    Some verbatim excerpts follow: 
<p>"This is an example of collaboration at its best, the mother of all collaborations,"stated Dot 
Ridings, the new president of the Council on Foundations, welcoming a large audience to an historic 
collaborative meeting of eight affinity groups in philanthropy.
<p>"I am a beneficiary of Affirmative Action, in spirit if not in letter. I am out today as a beneficiary, 
and I will do all I can not to retreat," asserted Cynthia Carey Grant, steering committee member, part of the 
statewide coalition "No on CCRI" - the so-called California Civil Rights Initiative on the ballot in 
November.
<p>        Bonnie Erbe, host of the PBS news magazine "To the Contrary" outlined the context in which the 
current attacks on affirmative action are occuring. She targed the "freelance economy" in which good jobs 
are lost, replaced by contract and contingent jobs with no benefits.
<p>        "At stake is not only affirmative action, but our collective vision for the year 2000," said [Karen] 
Narasaki [executive director of the National Asian Pacific Legal Consortium]. "Will we go back to the 
1950's or embrace the globalization of culture an economy and make it a positive force for change?"
<p>Behind the attack on affirmative action is a broad attack on women by the radical right, said Carey 
Grant. Affirmative action is only one item on their agenda. Who do they oppose? Not the extreme left, but 
moderates, centrists, even conservatives - anyone who wants to promote the welfare of the majority of the 
people.
<p>        Attacks on affirmative action always peak before elections. This is not a socially driven issues, but 
a political issue, said Barbara Arnwine, executive director of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights 
Under Law and head of the national consortium called Americans for a Fair Chance.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>The Strategies:</H3></CENTER>
	<B>Come together. </B>The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights is coordinating the legislative 
strategy. Asian Americans and women are important in the stuggle not to be divided (sic).
<p>        <B>Appeal to white women. </B>Surveys and focus groups indicate the more they learn about affirmative 
action, the more they support it. Equal Rights Advocates.
<p>       <B> Increase public educations.</B> Americans respond to information. Following public service ads 
conducted by Americans for a Fair Chance (a consortium of civil rights and women's rights groups in 
support of affirmative action), support among white men increased four percent; among white women it 
increased 13 percent.
<p>        <B>Hire the marketing professionals</B> - don't leave the ads to lawyers!
<p>        <B>Raise voter turnout</B>, especially minority and immigrant populations. Go to citizen classes, 
swearing in ceremonies. Support youth actions.
<p>        <B>Identify supporters in the business community.</B> Get your business allies to speak out. Citizens 
Commission on Civil Rights has documented business support on video.
<p>        <B>Support litigation</B> - court decisions are news items and thus public education tools.
<p>       <B> Show the opposition how they have benefitted.</B> Pull up our talented younger people of color; 
diversity is in the lower ranks.
<p>        <B>Use consumer power.</B> Women spend 80 cents of every consumer dollar.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>The challenge:</H3></CENTER>
	The right has coopted the dialogue. How can we get back in the discussion with a unified voice? 
Bonnie Erbe.
<p>        We  need to change the debate from who gains, who loses, to what society as a whole has gained 
and what it will lose. Karen Narasaki.
<p>        Tony Romero, program officer at the Ford Foundation agreed. Grantmakers fear that IRS 
restrictions do not allow them to defend affirmative action, he said; our staff attorneys have assured us we 
can. This a moral issue for funders he added - "we need to put our grant dollars where our mouths are."
	
<p>        According to Fall/Winter 1995 Women & Philanthropy News, an "affinity group" publication, the 
Ford foundation has awarded $1.4 million to 12 organizations to support affirmative action. Other 
foundations "actively funding affirmative action intiatives" are the Rockefeller Foundation, the Carnegie 
Croporation of New York and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation which have granted hundreds of 
thousands of dollars to the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law for the National Affirmative 
Action Consortium.

<center><h3>LESSONS FROM THE FALL:<br> FOUNDATIONS AND THE CRISIS IN ARTS FUNDING<br>
BY ROBERT HUBERTY</center></h3>
<P>
	Art Lessons: Learning for the Rise and Fall of Public Arts Funding by Alice Goldfarb Marquis 
(Basic Books, 1996, paperback, 304 pages).
<P>
	The names Mapplethorpe and Serrano ignite passionate debate on the nature and purpose of art.  
Can we know when art is obscene and blasphemous?  Should art depict obscenity and blasphemy?  If it's 
obscene and blasphemous, is it art?  Should government officials try to answer these questions before they 
spend public funds on whatever art is?  Why should government fund works of art at all?  And, the 
ultimate liberal handwringer, is refusing to fund art censorship?  
<p>        Art Lessons, Alice Goldfarb Marquis' engaging and instructive history of U.S. public funding of 
the arts, manages to put these questions into an entertaining context.  Her deft and amusing narrative 
surveys forty years of shenanigans by politicians, bureaucrats and wealthy patrons who scheme to spend 
public and private money for the creation and consumption of what is for them a valuable commodity: 
more good art.  The debate which is now culminating in bitter protest over who is responsible for squalid 
public displays began innocently enough as an exercise in high-minded liberal - and Republican - 
philanthropy.  Indeed, by carefully describing how private philanthropy made public arts funding possible, 
Marquis' study implicates it in the scandals that have led to the NEA's downfall.
<p>        Marquis does not begin her tale in 1965 when President Lyndon Johnson signed legislation 
enacting the National Endowment for the Arts.  She starts in the dark ages of the late 1950s.  A time that 
most Americans remember as happy days was for intellectuals an "age of anxiety," a time when televised 
and commercial mass culture threatened the life of the mind.  It was also a time when worried big city 
mayors watched their tax base erode as the middle class fled to their T.V. sets in suburbia.  City fathers, 
desperate for a solution to urban decay, seemed to find one in the performing arts complex, the cultural 
equivalent of the shopping center.   
<p>        Art, music and theater, they reasoned, would attract tourists and new business, lure suburbanites 
back to town at night, and give senior citizens and juvenile delinquents something useful to do.  An 
uncontroversial social benefit, art was good public relations.  So private philanthropy came to the rescue, 
working in "partnership" with public agencies to create venues for art.  John D. Rockefeller III mobilized 
Manhattan's civic elite to plan fundraising for construction of Lincoln Center; President Eisenhower signed 
legislation donating federal land for what became the Kennedy Center; and Governor Nelson Rockefeller 
established the first state arts council.  
<p>        The art moguls in Marquis' telling hardly attempted to answer the question of what art is.  Largely 
ignorant or indifferent to aesthetic questions, they were more at ease developing social and economic 
justifications for art's sake.  And they positively jumped at opportunities to work on the comparatively easy 
problems of finding money for art and developing new ways to spend it.  
<p>    Much of Art Lessons is an almost farcical recounting of the bureaucratic consequences of public 
spending on the arts.  As the NEA budget surged from $5 million to $40 million from 1969 to 1973 under 
director Nancy Hanks, a Nixon appointee, and from $100 million to $165 million from 1975 to 1979 under 
Carter appointee Livingston Biddle, there was a boom in grant administrators, categories, and applications 
(27,000 by 1982). 
<p>        Everyone wanted to get in on the act.  Big and small states jockeyed for NEA money for their arts 
councils - whose purpose is to lobby for more NEA money.  The multi-billion dollar film industry lobbied 
for NEA funding for the American Film Institute.  Dance companies multiplied on the expectation of 
continuing grants, and every congressman lobbied for his district's symphony orchestras.  
<p>        Even commercially successful art found ways to tap the federal treasury.  Since jazz ensembles 
already had ticket-paying audiences, the NEA set up and funded a nonprofit whose purpose was to fund 
presenters of jazz concerts.  The NEA even added a musical theater grants program after NEA council 
member Hal Prince, a highly successful Broadway producer, complained that composers were forced to 
move to California to write for the movies to survive.  
<p>        To be sure, arts activities rapidly increased in the 1960s and 70s.  But the Ponzi scheme of more 
groups pursuing public and private grants was sure to collapse.  NEA supporters, not Jesse Helms, 
weakened the faltering agency's capacity to identify and reward artistic excellence by demanding more 
subsidies for ever more arts groups.   
<p>        One ironic lesson of public arts funding is that it has made nonprofit arts organizations more 
financially insecure.  Marquis astutely observes that artists have been tempted by foundation philanthropy 
and by the availability of NEA grant money to overextend themselves while neglecting money-making 
opportunities.  By becoming nonprofits, the prerequisite for public funding and a mark of status for 
foundation elites, artists have forsaken the main chance - the commercial marketplace.  
<p>        Despite new technologies, artists have been led to believe that the arts cannot be self-supporting 
because they cannot achieve economies of scale.  Living hand-to-mouth on $5000 grants, they take the 
risks while administrators of foundations, arts agencies and advocacy groups reap the reward. 
<p>        Last month NEA director Jane Alexander protested Congress' $99 million appropriation and asked 
for $136 million for the next fiscal year.  These inflation-ravaged figures are a pittance.  But they represent 
the agency's continuing effort to credential arts groups, attract political patronage, and steer private funds 
toward privileged favorites.  Art Lessons does not inspire confidence that the agency can credibly fulfill 
this role.              By contrast, private philanthropy gave an estimated $9.6 billion to the arts, 
culture and humanities in 1994 (7.5 percent of all philanthropy).  A reading of Alice Marquis' study 
suggests that its credibility is also at risk.

<CENTER><H3>LETTERS TO THE EDITOR</H3></CENTER>
I read your story on the Rockefeller Foundation [vol.1, no.4] today.  While we at the Foundation do not deliberately "avoid the limelight" as 
you charge in your story, we did choose in this isolated case, not to respond favorably to your requests for 
interviews.
<p>        Your story has confirmed my initial judgement and that of others we consulted -- that we would 
not get accurate reporting of Rockefeller Foundation positions in your publication.
<p>        Any of your readers who are interested in receiving complete and accurate descriptions of our 
current funding priorities, including our support for arts and humanities worldwide, are encouraged to call 
or write us for a copy of our 1995 annual report. We can be reached on (212) 852-8414 or by writing the

<P>
	We would be happy to correct any specific errors you might care to point out. We did find one 
mistake in the story after it went to press. Peggy Dulany is David Rockefeller's daughter, so the family does 
have a living presence on the foundation board -- even though the name of Rockefeller has disappeared.
<P>
	I was delighted recently to discover Foundation Watch.  As a one-time denizen of the City of 
Light, the issue [vol. 1, no. 2] devoted to the decline and fall of the American Center in Paris and the 
liquidation of its jazzy, spanking new building designed by Frank Gehry was especially appalling. 
<p>         It was also a riveting read.  Your post-mortem account represents lively, no-holds-barred cultural 
reportage of a sort seldom seen in the main-stream press - particularly where international matters are 
concerned.
	Your profile on the Rockefeller Foundation [vol. 1, no. 4] was equally revealing.  The common 
thread, of course, is cutting edge philanthropy run amuck, propelled by the best and the worst of intentions.  
The excesses you have detailed (and the actions of the players you have, dare I say, outed) can be blunted 
only by rigorous investigative pieces such as these.  I look forward to more of the same.

I don't have to look at a U.S. flag in the toilet to know it's
wrong,&quot; Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich said on April
2nd. He was calling on the Phoenix Art Museum to cancel an exhibit
which featured one flag draped inside a porcelain toilet surrounded
by a jail cell and another placed on the floor to be stepped on.
<P>
Outside the museum American Legion veterans had protested the
flag abuse while inside eleven-year-old Fabian Montoya took up
the banner from the floor and folded it carefully. Museum curators
quickly replaced the flag. Director Jim Ballinger defended the
action, telling the Arizona Republic that to protect the flag
&quot;would be censorship.&quot; He declared, &quot;the artists
here are just celebrating their First Amendment rights.&quot;
<P>
Gingrich responded, &quot;When I talk about elite versus classic
American values, I think the Phoenix art exhibit is a perfect
example.&quot;
<P>
The culture that permits an arts administrator to defend flag
desecration is in great measure the culture created and funded
during the past fifteen years by the major foundations. And among
all the foundations supporting the arts, perhaps the most committed
to the goals of cultural affront and multicultural diversity --
and the anti-Americanism which goes with it -- is the Rockefeller
Foundation. It is the legacy of a living dynasty whose members
are still active in business, politics, and the arts.
<P>
Historian John Fonte wrote recently in National Review that schoolchildren
now learn &quot;that instead of one people the United States of
America consists of many diverse 'peoples.'&quot; He argues that
a multi-ethnic America has been reinterpreted through the lens
of &quot;the multiculturalist agenda [that] is shattering the
American identity.&quot; For at least a decade, that agenda has
been official policy for the Rockefeller Foundation.
<P>
<a name="rock"><b>ROCKEFELLER VS. STANDARDS</b></a>
<P>
John Frohnmayer, former chairman of the National Endowment for
the Arts during the Bush Administration, claims that since the
NEA's establishment in 1965, the Rockefeller Foundation has been
important precisely because it has &quot;sought out the under-represented
outside the mainstream in the arts.&quot; While some grantmaking
foundations fund the popular arts and others give to traditional
venues such as the opera, symphony orchestras and ballet, the
Rockefeller Foundation, says Frohnmayer, has consistently supported
the &quot;cutting edge.&quot;
<P>
Reached at his home in Bozeman, Montana, Frohnmayer told Foundation
Watch that he &quot;always considered the Rockefeller Foundation
very valuable in supporting the National Endowment for the Arts.&quot;
The Rockefeller Foundation's support is more than moral: it has
supplied millions of dollars in matching funds over the years
for NEA special projects.
<P>
The Rockefeller Foundation's early arts funding was praiseworthy,
focusing on both popular and high art and on support for performing
arts complexes such as New York City's Lincoln Center and the
American Center in Paris [see Foundation Watch vol.1, no.2 for
an account of the Center's demise]. However, according to its
own official history, presented in Senate testimony in 1990, the
Rockefeller Foundation gradually came to see its role as &quot;supporting
work which is not yet validated by time and which may not be recognized
or valued by others.&quot; This is the sort of new work, funded
on the basis of &quot;judgement of peer artists and experts&quot;
that would get the NEA in trouble in 1989.
<P>
While the Rockefeller Foundation might have gotten the NEA off
the political hook by privately funding the most controversial
works that were receiving NEA grants, instead it chose to strong-arm
the NEA to continue its support for the avant-garde.
<P>
The result: NEA funding dropped from a high of some $180 million
to its current $99.5 million appropriation. Mired in a series
of federally-funded fiascos over the works of Andres Serrano,
Robert Mapplethope, Joel-Peter Witkin, Karen Finley, Holly Hughes,
Tim Miller, John Fleck, Ron Athey, and the most recent flag incident
in Arizona, the NEA continues to confound its supporters and infuriate
its opponents by being unable to see the difference between insulting
and honoring the public's trust.
<P>
In 1990, Rockefeller Foundation president Peter Goldmark, Jr.
testified to Congress against &quot;standards&quot; for NEA-supported
art in the wake of the Mapplethorpe and Serrano controversies.
<P>
He argued, &quot;I think if it is possible to make a strong case
to put into law a standard about whether something is religiously
acceptable or whether it is obscene, no matter how harmlessly
it appears to be phrased, then I think it will likely be possible
for someone else to say we ought to have a standard that has to
do with whether the art appears to support evolution or whether
it does not, or whether it appears to be patriotic or whether
it does not. I would suggest to you, let us stay away from the
road of State involvement in content. I would argue to you that
is the only safe way in our society for the State to support the
arts.&quot;
<P>
Despite Goldmark's testimony, the NEA was reauthorized in 1990
with the stipulation that NEA awards should be made after consideration
of &quot;general standards of decency and respect for the diverse
beliefs and values of the American people.&quot; Goldmark had
failed to convince Congress, but his minions had more luck with
officials at the NEA.
<P>
<a name="friend"><b>WITH FRIENDS LIKE THESE...</b></a>
<P>
In his memoir of his life as a federal arts bureaucrat, Leaving
Town Alive (Houghton Mifflin, 1993), Frohnmayer recalls that he
suspended a NEA grant for a New York art gallery called Artist's
Space in 1989 because its material was &quot;cruder and potentially
more problematic than Mapplethorpe's photos.&quot; Frohnmayer
told Susan Wyatt, the gallery's director, that among other items
in the show, &quot;at least one photo of masturbation was potentially
obscene.&quot; Moreover, the artist, David Wojnarowicz, whose
work was prominently featured, called New York's John Cardinal
O'Connor &quot;a fat cannibal&quot; in the exhibit catalogue.
<P>
Frohnmayer decided to see the New York City exhibit for himself.
Upon arriving at the gallery, he was confronted with demonstrators,
camera crews swarmed about him, and a banner flew from a building
across the street denouncing the National Endowment for the Arts.
Wrote Frohnmayer, &quot;The scene reminded me of Tom Wolfe's descriptions
of the Bronx courthouse in Bonfire of the Vanities.&quot;
<P>
&quot;It was an extremely unpleasant situation,&quot; Frohnmayer
told Foundation Watch. &quot;I went there because I wanted to
talk to them and see the show for myself.&quot; In his book, Frohnmayer
describes a meeting with art world denizens who confronted him
over his decision to suspend the grant.
<P>
The group, he recalls, included David Wojnarowicz and leaders
of ACT UP, a group advocating radical gay rights; Andres Serrano,
whose &quot;Piss Christ&quot; photo of a crucifix in urine helped
start the NEA controversy; Martha Wilson, the director of the
Manhattan &quot;performance space&quot; called Franklin Furnace,
where Annie Sprinkle had offered her private parts for public
examination and told the audience the show was &quot;government
funded,&quot;; Nan Goldin, the curator of the exhibition; and
twenty or so others. Among those there, Frohnmayer clearly recalls,
was &quot;Alberta Arthurs, of the Rockefeller Foundation.&quot;
<P>
How did the group treat the new Chairman of the NEA in his moment
of crisis? Did they offer their services to protect the agency
from a potentially damaging political confrontation while taking
care of their &quot;cutting edge&quot; constituency with private
money? To the contrary.
<P>
Frohnmayer describes the occasion vividly: &quot;I said I had
come to listen. What I heard was a series of ad hominem attacks,
something that never before, in my pleasant existence, had been
directed at me. 'You have politicized the NEA.' 'You are a coward.'
'You have sold out the artists of this country; you should resign.'
'How do you feel about men kissing each other?' 'Why don't you
fight for removal of the language that Congress passed if you
don't like it?'
<P>
&quot;After about thirty minutes of listening to people beat up
on me, I was able to direct the conversation toward what the Arts
Endowment could do in the future,&quot; Frohnmayer wrote. &quot;I
didn't like the personal attacks, but I considered them part of
the price I had to pay to work myself out of this self-inflicted
mess. I was numb; my emotions were on hold. Only a solution mattered.&quot;
In other words, as Frohnmayer put it, &quot;We were in the process
of being had for at least the second time.&quot; And in a most
rude and unpleasant manner.
<P>
While Frohnmayer noted that Alberta Arthurs was present during
his battering, he cautioned that he thought &quot;it was not a
situation orchestrated by the Rockefeller Foundation.&quot; Yet
despite his visible discomfort, Arthurs (director of Arts and
Humanities for the Rockefeller Foundation) had said not a word
to defend Frohnmayer while he endured the torrent of verbal and
psychological abuse.
<P>
Frohnmayer confessed he was grateful to have been there in New
York for the experience. &quot;I felt the Rockefeller Foundation
was a valuable ally,&quot; he told Foundation Watch. &quot;They
had the very strong feeling that the underrepresented voices ought
to be heard.&quot; And who were the &quot;underrepresented?&quot;
Frohnmayer said it was &quot;clear&quot; that &quot;the group
way on the left was underrepresented.&quot; He estimated these
were &quot;about 20-30% of the American population.&quot;
<P>
Frohnmayer's own account to Foundation Watch presents a scene
of ideological rectification worthy of Darkness at Noon. He had
obviously strayed from the art world party line, had to endure
a self-criticism session with the relevant arts commissars and
ideological enforcers, and confess to his sins before returning
to Washington.
<P>
In retrospect, Frohnmayer concludes, &quot;They wanted to make
a point. You have to say they made their point.&quot; And he adds
that following his visit to New York, &quot;I restored the grant.&quot;
<P>
The NEA funds &quot;cutting-edge&quot; works like these, in part,
because, like a battered spouse, it has come to depend on being
tormented by grantmakers like the Rockefeller Foundation. While
the Foundation purports to defend the NEA from attacks by Congress,
it joins the &quot;arts community&quot; in abusing the NEA's processes
while denouncing the agency's integrity. The Rockefeller Foundation,
for instance, made grants to the American Civil Liberties Union
and others to sue the NEA on behalf of the artists denied grants
for offensive material: The ACLU claimed &quot;free expression&quot;
required overturning the law that the NEA respect &quot;general
standards of decency.&quot;
<P>
<a name="ludlow"><b>THE LEGACY OF LUDLOW</b></a>
<P>
No member of the Rockefeller family currently sits on the Foundation's
fifteen-member board of trustees. The family absence is a legacy
of the Foundation's role in the aftermath of the &quot;Ludlow
Massacre,&quot; which occured in 1913, the same year the Foundation
had been established. That year two women and eleven children
living in a striker's camp at the Rockefeller-dominated Colorado
Fuel and Iron company died during a raid by National Guard troops.
As Martin Morse Wooster notes in The Great Philanthropies and
the Problem of Donor Intent (Capital Research Center, 1994), &quot;the
'Ludlow Massacre' quickly became a cause celebre for the left.
Novelist Upton Sinclair picketed John D. Rockefeller's home, and
in New York City, four members of the Industrial Workers of the
World died when a bomb [intended for Rockefeller] exploded prematurely
in their apartment.&quot;
<P>
At the suggestion of Harvard president Charles Eliot, the Rockefeller
Foundation hired Mackenzie King, a Canadian politician to study
labor relations at Rockefeller-controlled businesses and improve
John D's image.
<P>
The move backfired badly. In public hearings government officials
grilled King and Rockefeller public relations advisor Ivy Lee,
and concluded that &quot;the huge philanthropic trusts, known
as foundations, appear to be a menace to the welfare of society&quot;
because they gave the wealthy a mechanism &quot;to become molders
of public thought.&quot;
<P>
Under pressure, Rockefeller transferred control over his fortune
to his children in 1916, and control over the foundation to his
son John D. Rockefeller, Jr. who, according to Wooster, made it
a principle to &quot;erect a firm wall between the Rockefeller
Foundation and the Rockefellers' personal affairs.&quot; The younger
Rockefeller also replaced his father's friends and business associates
on the Foundation board with pillars of progressivism.
<P>
Soon the reconstituted Foundation was rejecting a grant proposal
from John D. Rockefeller himself. He wanted to replace textbooks
&quot;calculated to lead astray and do harm rather than good&quot;
and he proposed to fund education with &quot;the most sane and
practical and possible views of life rather than...socialism and
some forms of Bolshevism.&quot; Rockefeller's lawyer, Starr Murphy
&quot;was aghast&quot; at this proposal and wrote &quot;it would
be extremely unwise for any donor to attempt to place limitations
on the character of the teaching which shall be given in an institution
to which he contributes.&quot; The divorce of the family from
the foundation was set.
<P>
To reconnect the Rockefeller families to the charities it had
created, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund was created in 1941 by
John D. Rockefeller 3rd, Nelson, Lawrence, Winthrop, and David.
Subsequently, the Rockefeller &quot;cousins&quot; also created
their own charitable vehicles. But the original Rockefeller Foundation
itself remained firmly in the hands of a liberal establishment
independent of the family.<a name="vocab"></a>
<P>
<b>THE MULTICULTURAL<br>
VOCABULARY OF THE BOARD</b>
<P>
Today, the legacy of an independent Rockefeller Foundation lives
on. One current board member characterizes the Rockefeller Foundation
Board of Trustees as &quot;more of a Who's Who board than a Social
Register board.&quot;
<P>
The current chair is Alice Stone Ilchman, president of Sarah Lawrence
College. Establishmentarians past and present like C. Douglas
Dillon, Cyrus Vance, and the late Dean Rusk have served, as have
media figures like pundit Bill Moyers, actor Alan Alda, and former
Times-Mirror Chairman Tom Johnson, now head of CNN, and the late
Disney exective Frank Wells. It is no surprise, then, that the
Rockefeller Foundation enjoys exceptionally good press coverage.
<P>
Moreover, as one observer remarked to Foundation Watch, &quot;When
you have two billion dollars you don't have any public relations
problems. Everybody loves you&quot;.
<P>
Perhaps for these reasons, and despite the increasing notoriety
of multiculturalism's excesses, the role of the Rockefeller Foundation
has escaped public criticism. The Rockefeller Foundation's officers
and staff have been careful to avoid the limelight and declined
to respond to Foundation Watch's requests for interviews. However,
several current and former board members freely offered their
opinions of the Foundation's cultural agenda.
<P>
The immediate former chairman of the Rockefeller Foundation board
of directors is Dr. John Robert Evans, a Canadian physician and
educator who is currently chairman of the parent company of the
Toronto Star. He told Foundation Watch that the board of trustees
had approved the Foundation's commitment to diversity and multiculturalism
because of the importance of &quot;understanding difficulties
across cultures&quot; and the need to appreciate &quot;the strength
of African American and Hispanic arts.&quot; Evans, who has served
on the Rockefeller Foundation board for fourteen years, explained
that the board's &quot;general tendency was to look at 'emerging'
areas&quot; in the arts and humanities rather than fund traditional
artistic disciplines and institutions. He said the &quot;style
of the Rockefeller Foundation&quot; was that &quot;non-expert
trustees take an interest&quot; in all areas of giving, including
the cultural realm.
<P>
Another Rockefeller director said the board was influenced greatly
in the direction of multiculturalism by a Hudson Institute report
called Workforce 2000 issued in the early 1980's. Its analysis
of demographic trends suggested that women and and minorities
held the key to America's social and economic future. However,
a source close to the Hudson Institute told Foundation Watch that
the Rockefeller Foundation &quot;took the wrong message out of
Workforce 2000. The message was that there was a problem in levels
of skills and education, not that we needed 'cultural sensitivity
training.'&quot; The source added that Hudson is currently working
on Workforce 2000 Revisited, which will make an explicit case
against multiculturalism.
<P>
Trustee Daniel P. Garcia, a vice-president of Warner Brothers
and head of the Los Angeles Airport Commission, also told Foundation
Watch that the board of directors was committed to multiculturalism
and diversity. Garcia is a former chairman of the now-defunct
Los Angeles Festival, a multi-ethnic assemblage of street fairs
and performances which banned Eurocentric theatre and dance. The
L.A. Festival was supported in part by the Rockefeller Foundation.
<P>
A Vietnam veteran and advisor to Republican Los Angeles Mayor
Richard Riordan, Garcia says he is proud that a Rockefeller Foundation
grant enabled &quot;the Bellas Artes&quot; dance troupe to come
from Mexico City to New York. Culture, he asserts, &quot;is not
a Eurocentric affair.&quot;
<P>
No art lover would deny Garcia's truism, but there is a vast difference
between a national folkloric dance ensemble and the ethnocentric
&quot;performance artists&quot; Time magazine critic Robert Hughes
has called &quot;all-purpose Barbarians.&quot;
<P>
In The Culture of Complaint (Oxford, 1993), Hughes points out
that &quot;multiculturalism means something less than genuine
curiousity about other cultural forms.&quot; It is unavoidable,
says Hughes, that, &quot;Most art made by white Americans is mediocre.
Most art made by black Americans is mediocre. Most art made by
Chinese-Americans, Japanese-Americans, and American Indians is
mediocre, too. And most art made by women is as mediocre as most
art made by men. The same applies to gays and straights and to
all the other polarities. We must therefore be extremely wary
of the sentimentality that institutional multiculturalism brings.&quot;
<P>
Yet this common-sense view from a respected art critic is out
of favor at the Rockefeller Foundation. Garcia says that Alberta
Arthurs, the Rockefeller Foundation's director of arts and humanities
for the past decade, has promoted diversity and multiculturalism
by following the &quot;general policy&quot; of the board of directors.
In 1990, Rockefeller Foundation president Peter Goldmark submitted
a copy of this policy to the U.S. Senate.
<P>
Its declared goal: &quot;The encouragement of creative artists...whose
work can advance international and intercultural work in this
country...supporting the flow of art between Third World cultures
and the United States, and increasing opportunities...for ethnic
populations in the United States.&quot;
<P>
At least one insider, however, is not impressed with Rockefeller's
policy, noting: &quot;What goes on at Rockefeller is that they
are just another group following the way culture seems to be going.
Large foundations are followers, not leaders, of what's going
on in the world.&quot;<a name="record"></a>
<P>
<b>THE ROCKEFELLER RECORD</b>
<P>
This was not always the case. The official mission of the Foundation
is to promote &quot;the well-being of mankind throughout the world.&quot;
In the sciences, for example, the Rockefeller Foundation has a
proud legacy of leadership in eliminating such infectious diseases
as yellow fever and hookworm. The Foundation also has played a
leading role in the so-called &quot;green revolution&quot; that
has spurred agricultural productivity through scientific research.
To this day, approximately fifty percent of the Foundation's budget
goes to three areas where it has been a pioneer: public health,
agriculture, and population control. Indeed, John D. Rockefeller
3rd once joked to reporters, &quot;If my parents had been exposed
to today's ideas of family planning, my brothers Win [Winthrop,
former Governor of Arkansas] and David [former chairman of the
Chase Manhattan Bank] might not have made it.&quot;
<P>
The Rockefeller Foundation is the eighth largest foundation in
the United States, with an asset portfolio worth some $2,364,552,922,
according to the most recent accounting in The Chronicle of Philanthropy.
In 1993 the Foundation distributed grants of some $93,260,988,
a little under four percent of assets.
<P>
Today the Foundation has an annual arts and humanities budget
of about $13 million, not including the Bellagio Study Center
in Italy, which provides accomodation for scholars and artists.
From 1965 to 1989 the Foundation spent about $73 million on the
arts. In 1993, the Rockefeller Foundation ranked eleventh in giving
to the arts and seventh in giving to the humanities, according
to appendices in Looking Ahead: Private Sector Giving to the Arts
and Humanities (December, 1995), a Foundation-sponsored study
for the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities. Author
Nina Kressner Cobb's analysis reveals that Rockefeller spent about
three times as much on the arts (161 grants totalling $10,403,575)
as on the humanities ($3,405,150 for 38 grants).
<P>
But Rockefeller's influence exceeds even its large size. The reasons
are manifold. The Rockefeller name alone, despite the absence
of actual family control, associates the Foundation not only with
great wealth, but with great American cultural institutions: the
University of Chicago, New York's Museum of Modern Art and the
Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, institutions which command
respect and due deference. Moreover, the Rockefeller family and
various Foundations have been enormously influential in the formation
of a national arts policy, a notion unheard of before the 1960s.
<P>
For example, The Rockefeller Brothers Fund, a family grantmaker,
paid for the 1965 study The Performing Arts: Problems and Prospects
(McGraw-Hill) conducted by a Rockefeller Panel chaired by John
D. Rockefeller 3rd, and staffed by Nancy Hanks, later to become
National Endowment for the Arts chairman. The establishment of
the National Endowment for the Arts can be traced directly to
that report.
<P>
Just as the Rockefellers rationalized, bureaucratized and attempted
to monopolize the oil industry, their institutional offspring
have performed the same function for a once-freewheeling arts
world. The arts grantsmakers have mangaged the growth of arts
administration by funding the creation of a corporate and government
arts bureaucracy (sometimes called &quot;public-private partnership&quot;)
to replace the once all-powerful individual impresario. For the
Rockefeller Foundation, three individuals have been key.<a name="hanks"></a>

Nancy Hanks did not work directly for the Rockefeller Foundation.
Beginning in 1953, Hanks worked as confidential assistant to Nelson
Rockefeller, with whom she &quot;fell hopelessly in love,&quot;
according to Alice Goldfarb Marquis's account in Art Lessons:
Learning from the Rise and Fall of Public Arts Funding (Basic
Books, 1995).
<P>
Over the years, Marquis says, Hanks &quot;was so enchanted with
her lover that she mended his socks, baked his birthday cake,
and paid for lunch, when, as usual, he had no cash in his wallet.&quot;
<P>
In return, &quot;Nelson showered her with gifts, including airline
tickets, drawings and etchings by Degas and Picasso, and a $200,000
securities portfolio.&quot; Marquis says the romance ended in
1955 when a press aide to the newly-elected Governor of New York
State told Rockefeller he had to &quot;get her out of here.&quot;
In 1956 she was made a key staffer for the Special Studies Project
of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.
<P>
Although she had been &quot;shipped out,&quot; Hanks &quot;remained
a creature of the Rockefeller family,&quot; researching arts policy
for the Rockefeller report and helping to found the Arts Council
of America, still a powerful arts lobby.
<P>
Former NEA Chairman Livingston Biddle, then a top staffer for
Senator Claiborne Pell (D-RI), remembers that Nancy Hanks accompanied
John D. Rockefeller 3rd when he testified before Congress in 1965
on the NEA's behalf. Biddle recalled in his memoir, Our Government
and the Arts (American Council on the Arts, 1989), &quot;I am
sure that Nancy's fine hand was visible in the Rockefeller statement.&quot;
<P>
After the election, and backed by &quot;Rockefeller Republicans,&quot;
Hanks was appointed the second chairman of the NEA by Richard
Nixon in 1969. On her watch the NEA budget increased fifteen-fold.
In 1966 the agency had only 28 full-time staffers. By 1977 Hanks
presided over 220 employees processing over 14,000 grant applications
annually.
<P>
Then-Congressman John Brademas (D-IN), later to serve on the Rockefeller
Foundation Board and currently chairman of the President's Committee
on the Arts and Humanities, is reported by Marquis to have &quot;noted
with some envy that 'a well-placed call from Nancy triggers calls
from all over the country and these people can exercise considerable
pressure.'&quot;
<P>
When President Nixon reappointed Hanks to the NEA chairmanship
in 1973, he joked that NEA funding had increased by 900 percent.
&quot;That is why we are reappointing you here,&quot; he said.
&quot;We don't want anything else increasing by that amount.&quot;
<P>
Even when controversy erupted over the NEA's support of controversial
items like Erica Jong's feminist comic best-seller Fear of Flying
or a one word poem _ the word was &quot;LIGHGHT&quot; _ which
received a $500 grant, Hanks used her connections and political
savvy to quell opposition. While not an employee of the Rockefeller
Foundation, Hank's example has inspired the generation of cultural
bureaucrats who followed her.<a name="center"></a>
<P>
<b>THE CENTER AND THE MARGINS</b>
<P>
The Rockefeller Foundation has not always always been committed
to the cultural margins. In the 1960's, most of the grants were
for more mainstream projects. A Rockefeller Foundation time-line,
called The Rockefeller Foundation: 1913 to 1988, bears witness
to this trend.
<P>
In 1935 the Foundation established the film library at the Museum
of Modern Art in New York. In 1936 it supported travelling productions
of Shakespearean drama. In 1942 the academic discipline of American
cultural studies was established with Rockefeller funds, which
also subsidized Dumas Malone's biography of Thomas Jefferson.
<P>
In 1946, Rockefeller gave some $7.5 million for education of Southern
blacks.The Rockefeller and Ford Foundations were among the earliest
backers of Lincoln Center in New York, giving matched donations
of $2.5 million each in 1957. In 1962 the Rockefeller Foundation
gave $7 million to support publication of the Lincoln, Hamilton,
Madison, and Wilson papers. In 1963 some $85 million provided
scholarships for black university students, and summer tutoring
programs at Princeton, Dartmouth and Oberlin. In 1967 major grants
went to the Eliot Feld Ballet, the North Carolina Dance Theatre,
and the Agnes de Mille Dance Theater.
<P>
However, in 1967 major grants also went to the &quot;experimental&quot;
La Mama Theatre Company and to Joseph Papp's Public Theatre. In
1973 Rockefeller began funding &quot;women's studies&quot; programs
at Radcliffe, Sarah Lawrence, and Harvard Divinity School. In
1978 the Foundation commissioned a report on the &quot;crisis&quot;
in the humanities. In 1981 the Foundation supported minimalist
composers Philip Glass and Steve Reich.
<P>
After the NEA became operational in the late 1960's the role of
the grantmaking foundations changed. Instead of providing grants
which would allow arts institutions to flourish in an essentially
private sector economy, the foundations would now make provocative
grants to supplement the public sector support on which arts institutions
grew increasingly dependent, and to &quot;leverage&quot; public
support for the avant-garde.
<P>
Michael Straight, NEA's deputy director in the Nixon administration
indicates in his book Twigs for an Eagle's Nest (Devon Press,
1979) that &quot;A number of foundations agreed [with the primacy
of the federal role] and decided to cut back their support for
the arts.&quot; Straight, who later confessed that he was the
&quot;fifth man&quot;- turned FBI informant in the 1930s Kim Philby
Cambridge spy ring, was Nancy Hanks's troubleshooter at the NEA,
responsible for &quot;flagging&quot; controversial grants such
as one to George Plimpton's The American Literary Anthology for
a pornographic Ed Sanders story.
<P>
That was then. Private sources could and did take up the slack
in the &quot;flagged&quot; cases. But in the 1980's the Rockefeller
Foundation decided that its priority would be not only to fund
that which would not otherwise be funded, but to insist that the
Federal government fund it, too.<a name="power"></a>
<P>
<b>PETER GOLDMARK: POWER OPERATOR</b>
<P>
By the mid 1980s The Rockefeller Foundation's had strengthened
its commitment to the multicultural agenda. That agenda is shared
by two key figures, Peter Goldmark and Alberta Arthurs. Through
their control of Rockefeller's arts budget, they share responsibility
for the trend in giving which places &quot;diversity&quot; ahead
of quality in the arts.
<P>
Peter C. Goldmark, Jr., age 56, is the current president of the
Rockefeller Foundation. He was recruited to his position in 1988
by his employer, Times Mirror president Thomas Johnson who, as
a Foundation director, headed a search committee established by
the board. At the time, Goldmark was a senior vice-president of
the Eastern division of Times Mirror. (Goldmark's succeeded Richard
Lyman, a former Stanford University president who resigned under
savage criticism over his performance. Lyman's record was &quot;slouching
towards senility,&quot; wrote Waldemar Nielsen in The Golden Donors,
a major study of grantmaking foundations.)
<P>
The son of the maverick inventor of the long-playing record who
later became head of CBS Labs, Peter Goldmark Jr. is a Harvard
graduate, was once a prep-school history teacher at the Putney
School in Vermont, and worked in the War on Poverty's Office of
Economic Opportunity during the Johnson Administration. A seasoned
political veteran, he also has worked for New York Mayor John
Lindsay, New York Governor Hugh Carey, and Massachusetts Governor
Francis Sargent.
<P>
Goldmark is a former executive director of the Port Authority
of New York and New Jersey. But although praised for his personal
style as an administrator, he has a spotty record of accomplishment.
Former Governor Hugh Carey gives Goldmark a mixed review. &quot;He
didn't succeed fully at what he had hoped to do,&quot; Carey told
an interviewer for Manhattan, Inc. in 1988.
<P>
Likewise, a 1988 New York Times business section profile offered
this faint praise of Goldmark: &quot;He cannot completely hide
the boredom brought on by narrowing his sights to the challenges
facing a single company. It is obvious to those around him that
he will fit more naturally into his new role, where he can spread
his attentions to global concerns.&quot;
<P>
Goldmark's global concerns are embodied in the rhetoric of social
obligation and racial awareness. In 1968 he co-wrote the preface
for the Kerner Commission Report, which was the Johnson Administration's
response to civil unrest. His words include the famous refrain,
&quot;Our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one
white _ separate and unequal. What white Americans have never
fully understood _ but what the Negro can never forget _ is that
white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto. White institutions
created it, white institutions maintain it, and white society
condones it.&quot;
<P>
Upon taking the Rockefeller post, Goldmark told The New York Times
that he would concentrate his attention on &quot;the underclass.&quot;
&quot;Nobody knows who they are, what they do, how they stay alive,
or why they are so totally cut off from the institutions of American
life. The only institution they come in contact with is the criminal
justice system,&quot; he told The Times' Kathleen Teltsch. &quot;The
underclass is not a topic to pursue from the library. You get
out and look for them.&quot;
<P>
Another guilty liberal? In the 1991 Rockefeller Foundation annual
report Goldmark's sense of shame assumed universal proportions:
&quot;To survive as a species of promise rather than a race of
destruction will require of us a degree of planetary cooperation
that we have barely begun to imagine. That should prompt us to
prepare soberly for the test of effectiveness. The history of
the 90's demands it.&quot;
<P>
Goldmark is well-regarded by associates and has been described
as charming and considerate. The secretaries of Rockefeller Foundation
board members know him for his Christmas gifts, which usually
are &quot;third world crafts, a pillow or embroidery,&quot; according
to one recipient.
<P>
Behind the geniality and the social conscience, however, Goldmark
runs hard. He craves power, Goldmark told Manhattan Inc. &quot;We're
very bad about talking about power in American culture. We're
probably more awkward talking about power than we are about sex.
We don't have much of a vocabulary of how to talk about power,&quot;
he said. &quot;But to exercise power...you have to believe that
every action you take is important, that every word you say is
heard.&quot;<a name="woman"></a>
<P>
<b>ALBERTA ARTHURS: A WOMAN OF INFLUENCE</b>
<P>
In the art world, power is typically exercised quietly, gloved
in velvet, behind panelled doors. As Tom Wolfe noted in The Painted
Word, the public is not invited into the decision-making process.
The results are merely announced, like weddings and funerals,
in the pages of The New York Times. This is certainly true of
Alberta Arthurs and her management style as Director of Arts and
Humanities. Immensely influential, while extremely private, Arthurs
is in the vanguard of Rockefeller's arts and humanities efforts.
She annually distributes about $13 million to some 200 successful
applicants.
<P>
While Goldmark's attentions are focused on the broadest aspects
of urban affairs, global environmental matters, and the goals
of free expression, Arthurs has made sure for over ten years that
the interests of feminism, multiculturalism, and &quot;diversity&quot;
define the Rockefeller Foundation's politicized giving in the
arts.
<P>
Among the recipients of Rockefeller Foundation largesse during
her 1994 term:
<P><ul>
<li>$25,000 to the ACLU Foundation, Inc. for the &quot;Arts Censorship
Project&quot; which paid for suing the NEA.
<P>
<li>$35,000 to the ETV Endowment of South Carolina, Inc., for pre-production
and development of a six-hour television series entitled &quot;With
God on Our Side: The Rise of the Religious Right in America.
<P>
<li>$60,000 to the Los Angeles Festival &quot;for a six-month feasibility
study of future organizational options.&quot;
<P>
<li>$75,000 to the National Black Arts Festival, Inc., Atlanta for
&quot;Celebrate Africa!&quot;
<P>
<li>$10,000 to Franklin Furnace Archive, Inc. for &quot;hiring a
consultant&quot; to &quot;implement new artistic programs.&quot;
The venue is famous for presenting Annie Sprinkle, a former prostitute
cum &quot;performance artist.&quot; The theater's basement location
was closed by the New York City Fire Department in 1990 after
complaints.
<P>
<li>$35,000 to Arthur Dong for &quot;They Called Us Lesbians.&quot;
Dong previously produced &quot;Coming Out Under Fire&quot; a film
about gays in the military.
<P>
<li>$50,000 to the National Cultural Alliance, a lobby for the NEA,
&quot;for its national campaign to expand public awareness of
the critical role of the arts and humanities in the United States.
<P>
<li>$25,000 to the National Endowment for the Arts for &quot;ART-21&quot;
a national advocacy conference
<P>
<li>$25,000 to the Nuyorican Poets Cafe in New York for &quot;a
series of developmental screenplay readings&quot; by Puerto Ricans
living in New York.
<P>
<li>$17,000 to Intermedia Arts in Minneapolis, a co-sponsor of torture
artist Ron Athey's 1994 slicing and dicing.
<P>
<li>$10,000 to 18th Street Arts Complex/Highways Performing Space,
Santa Monica, CA for &quot;development and production of &quot;The
Dodo Vaccine.&quot; Highways has hosted Ron Athey, and NEA litigants
Tim Miller and Holly Hughes. Miller is &quot;artistic director&quot;
of the venue. It was most recently in the news for presenting
a performance artist describing &quot;sex with Newt's mom,&quot;
subject of a debate on the floor of the U.S. Congress prior to
yet another NEA budget cut.
<P>
<li>$35,000 to Signifyn' Works in Berkeley, California for &quot;filmmaker
Marlon Riggs' film Black Is...Black Ain't.&quot; Riggs, a Harvard
graduate who died of AIDS in 1994, had previously produced &quot;Tongues
Untied,&quot; which created a storm of protest against its profanity
and explicit sexuality when aired on PBS in 1992. The film led
to Senate passage of a decency amendment to the Telecommunications
Act that same year, which the Supreme Court upheld against ACLU
challenges.
<P>
<li>1994-95 Rockefeller Foundation Humanities Fellowships advertised
in The Chronicle of Philanthropy include the Center for Lesbian
and Gay Studies at the Graduate School of the City University
of New York; the Susan B. Anthony Center for Women's Studies at
the University of Rochester; the Afro-American Studies Program
at Princeton University, and Claiming Social Equity and Cultural
Rights, Centro de Studios Pertorriquenos, at Hunter College, New
York.</ul>
<P>
This list is just a sampling of the venues and artists Arthur's
Rockefeller program supports. And this Foundation support for
the &quot;cutting edge&quot; can clearly be laid at Arthur's feet.
<P>
For Arthurs was already in charge of Rockefeller's arts and humanities
grants under Richard Lyman, Goldmark's predecessor. An ardent
and active feminist whom some critics call &quot;the Wicked Witch
of the West Side,&quot; she is a career academic and former college
president. A 1954 graduate of Wellesley College, Arthurs married
in 1959 and taught English at Rutgers University from 1964-73.
She earned a Bryn Mawr Ph.D. in English completing a dissertation
on landscape in the work of Jane Austen in 1972.
<P>
In 1973 Arthurs became Dean of Admissions at Radcliffe College,
then was named Dean of Undergraduate Affairs at Harvard from 1975-77,
and then served two years as president of Chatham College, a small
liberal-arts institution near Pittsburgh. She has been director
of Arts and Humanities at the Rockefeller Foundation since then.
<P>
In the late 1980's the Rockefeller Foundation began to provide
an annual one million-dollar grant to establish a new organization,
National Video Resources, Inc. Arthurs became chairman of the
board of the new enterprise. It helps to distribute &quot;independent&quot;
and &quot;avant-garde&quot; videos to libraries, schools and colleges.
To do this, it &quot;trains&quot; librarians, distributes bibliographies,
and sometimes arranges for donations.
<P>
In other words, National Video Resources subsidizes receptivity
to the type of marginal productions the Rockefeller Foundation
typically funds _ productions which would not ordinarily be included
in school curricula or library holdings without this outside &quot;incentive.&quot;
In the for-profit sector, such operations are sometimes called
bribery, kickbacks, and public relations.
<P>
No matter. Arthurs had been unafraid to advocate on behalf of
both the NEA and the NEH. Daniel Garcia, a Rockefeller Foundation
trustee, told Foundation Watch that Arthurs had &quot;given millions&quot;
over the years in matching grants to NEA projects.
<P>
Since Frohnmayer's capitulation, Arthurs has been vocal in lobbying
for the NEA. In 1993 Arthurs co-authored an op-ed piece for The
Los Angeles Times with NEA Visual Arts Policy panelist Douglas
Davis called &quot;News Flash To Washington: Americans Like the
Arts: Culture: Polls Show Strong Support For Government Leadership
and Assistance In All Fields of Creative Endeavor.&quot;
<P>
Arthurs was unrepentant, despite public outrage at the NEA's track
record of pornography, blasphemy, and horror, and despite punitive
budget cuts approved by a Democratic Congress spearheaded by the
then-Appropriations Committee Chairman, Senator Byrd (D-WV), Arthurs
argued for &quot;additional dollars&quot; for the NEA and NEH.
<P>
As recently as last year, Arthurs testified on behalf of the National
Endowment for the Humanities before the a Senate committee. Supporting
the NEH's multiculturalist promoter Sheldon Hackney, Arthurs declared
&quot;the Endowment is essential for scholarship.&quot; This was
shortly after former NEH chairmen William Bennett and Lynne Cheney
both called for the abolition of the Humanities Endowment.
<P>
If the Rockefeller Foundation faced the truth it would acknowledge
that its policies of multiculturalism and diversity have put the
future of the Arts and Humanities endowments in peril. The Rockefeller
Foundation's insistence that the federal cultural agencies maintain
these policies in the face of public outrage has sealed their
doom.

<b><i>Why the Wealthy Give: The Culture of Elite Philanthropy </i>by Francie
Ostrower (Princeton University Press, 1995, 190 pages)
<P>
Reviewed by Robert Huberty</b>
<P>
Why the Wealthy Give won't really help a fundraiser searching
for tips _ it's too poorly written for one thing _ but it does
present some useful ideas and information to suggest why the nonprofit
sector is in its current fix.
<P>
Ostrower, a Harvard professor of sociology, interviewed 88 very
wealthy New York City-area donors in the late 1980s. She wanted
to see whether philanthropy shaped a distinctive outlook and way
of life.
<P>
The author looked for differences and tensions in her group, which
she had randomly selected from lists of big givers. Categorizing
donors by religion and ethnicity, sex and marital status, and
areas and amounts of giving, she was able to discover some interesting
variations. And by getting the donors to talk about themselves,
she learned much about what they thought they were doing.
<P>
What these unidentified donors told Ostrower has led her to conclude
that they think of themselves as a distinctive social elite, and
they regard philanthropy as an activity of their class and a symbol
of their status.
<P>
Many organize their daily lives around philanthropy: they conscientiously
serve on nonprofit boards, generously volunteer their time and
expertise, and enjoy evenings at fancy galas and receptions that
raise money for favorite charities. They recognize each other
at such events and are proud to feel an obligation to contribute
to what one called, &quot;the whole range from what's acutely
necessary to what is desirable.&quot;
<P>
However, while most Americans' philanthropy goes heavily to religion,
this figured less prominently in Ostrower's donors' priorities.
The reason may have to do with Ostrower's methodology. Surprisingly,
when Ostrower constructed her initial database she did not include
churches or synagogues.
<P>
This biases her study, since it makes her sample appear less religious
than wealthy New York City donors may be. Certainly, it resulted
in fewer interviews with wealthy Catholics, distorting the world
of philanthropy which Ostrower claims to be describing.
<P>
In other words, while Ostrower may accurately describe &quot;her&quot;
social elite, it may not be representative of New York's let alone
the nation's.
<P>
Still, the results are interesting. Ostrower's donors' favorite
causes are education (especially higher education) and cultural
institutions. Hospitals and other health-related groups follow.
Those who graduated from the most prestigious private institutions
were more likely to have made large gifts to alma mater. This
will give no comfort to those hoping for more alumni help in fighting
political correctness.
<P>
Social service agencies received more support from Jews and unmarried
women. Married women were more likely to give to culture. Public
policy, advocacy, and environmental causes had few supporters.
Jewish-federations were well-funded, no doubt because 49 donors
in the sample were Jewish, more than half.
<P>
Ostrower's sampling are typically American in many ways: they
respect individual accomplishment, distrust government power,
and believe private institutions can carry out many functions
better than government.
<P>
They value individual choice and they believe government funding
will politicize decision-making.
<P>
Unlike many Marxist academics who think such attitudes disguise
selfish class interests, Ostrower takes the donors at their word.
She thinks their sense of mission is sincere, and generally finds
their approach to giving open-minded, self-critical and pluralistic.
<P>
Yet her donors also voice attitudes which betray certain limitations
in their thinking. These prevent them from doing as much good
as they might hope to achieve. And they contribute to serious
problems in philanthropy.
<P>
One trouble with social elites is that they don't want to interact
too much with other people. It's hard to involve donors with anyone
other than their own kind.
<P>
Ostrower found that her donors did not want to give to individuals.
Rather, they contributed to prestigous organizations. Or, as she
puts it in the language peculiar to social scientists: &quot;Identifications
with organizations become a central focus of donor loyalties and
concern.&quot;
<P>
Her donors seem to exert too little muscle, not too much. Some
donors gripe that they have no influence over the nonprofit professionals
who set their groups' agendas. Others seem only to want the status
of an institutional affiliation.
<P>
But by holding themselves aloof, donors fail to exercise a power
of the purse which is uniquely theirs. Organizations cannot be
accountable to donor intentions if they don't express them.
<P>
Ostrower's sample is also not very charitable. Because building
prestige institutions is so important to them, Ostrower discovered
that her donors sharply differentiate philanthropy from charity
to individuals.
<P>
Many saw direct services to the needy _ homeless shelters, soup
kitchens, disaster relief and the like _ as an entirely separate
activity. Said one donor, &quot;I do not give money to buy clothes
and food for individuals. My tax money goes for that.&quot; What
the comment demonstrates is that the rich, like the poor, will
succumb to the culture of welfare dependency.
<P>
Finally, Ostrower's donors don't seem to have given enough serious
thought to the long-term and public policy consequences of their
wealth. They believe they have a right to choose who will receive
their money, but are ambivalent about leaving estates to their
children, and leery about philanthropy by bequest -- recognizing
that their intentions may not be honored.
<P>
Almost unanimously, they rejected a hypothetical proposal to eliminate
the tax deduction for charitable giving in order to increase government
support for welfare and cultural activities. Says Ostrower in
one of her clearer sentences, &quot;Money that goes to government
is seen as taken away, while money donated to philanthropy is
seen as money given away.&quot;
<P>
Yet large majorities agreed that government should spend more
for health care, the arts, higher education, social services,
and environmental and animal protection.
<P>
The problem is Ostrower's donors want their philanthropy to &quot;make
a difference&quot; but they can only imagine this within the context
of the familiar. They relate philanthropy to personal attachments
and social networks more than to individual charity or public
policies towards broad social goals. 
<P>
In wanting to &quot;protect&quot; their philanthropy from welfare
and other social problems that they perceive as intractable, the
rich, like all of us, may really be yielding to a despair that
nothing can be done about the poor. That's a mistake which philanthropy
can correct once donors recognize that government isn't taking
care of the big problems now, and can't be expected to do so in
the future.

<b>From The Editor:</b>
<P>
Right now, courts are supervising the child foster care programs in some 21 states.  In the 
District of Columbia, a federal court judge has stripped mayor Marion Barry of control 
over child welfare and replaced the elected city administration with a court-appointed 
consultant.  The judge described the "outrageous deficiencies" in D.C.'s child foster care 
in a March 17th, 1996 news story headlined "A Dickensian Picture" and reported on the 
front page of the Sunday New York Times.<p>
	What readers of the article did not learn from reporter Robert Pear was that almost 
twenty years ago the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation, a private grantmaking 
philanthropy in New York City with current assets estimated at $90 million, laid the 
foundations for what has become the legal struggle to use the courts to revamp the child 
welfare system. <p>
	Led by its energetic and articulate executive director, Margaret C. Ayers, the 
Robert Sterling Clark Foundation is the story behind the re-orientation of the nation's 
thinking on child welfare.  Ayers is admirable for her forthrightness and willingness to 
clarify her views.  She spoke at length with Foundation Watch.  But the opinions she 
expresses and the goals for which she fights reveal the inherent limitations in her liberal 
though anti-bureaucratic stance:  She truly believes the paradoxical slogan "Pro-family, 
pro-choice."<p>
	Though it has funded the legal challenge to failing government child protection 
services, the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation also funds those who support state action 
for abortion rights while attacking the rights of religious groups to establish childcare 
arrangements when parents are absent or unfit.<p>
	Sympathetic government bureaucrats, like Br'er Rabbitt, have often appreciated 
the adverse publicity and legal briar patches into which they are tossed by the Robert 
Sterling Clark Foundation.  Seeming to be opponents, government and its philanthropic 
adversaries have been, in fact, complicit in attempts to expand the power of the state over 
childcare and reduce the influence of independent institutions such as the Catholic 
Church.  <p>
	Although once dubbed a "government accountability project," the Foundation has 
succeeded in removing child welfare programs from the direct supervision of government 
officials who are accountable to the electorate.  Instead, a cadre of professional 
criminologists, sociologists, psychologists, educators and social workers has been 
empowered by the judicial process.  And while it opposes the theories of so-called 
"family preservation," much favored by some prominent child welfare advocacy groups, 
the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation has funded those who would use the courts to 
establish alternative therapeutic regimes for the care of children.<p>
	Perplexingly, the Foundation's advocacy of child welfare derives from Margaret 
Ayers' feminism, which champions women's right to abortion and other so-called 
reproductive rights.  This is the second major funding priority of the Robert Sterling 
Clark Foundation.  The third is increased funding for cultural institutions and the arts.  In 
the past year, Ayers has capped these interests by announcing to the press her 
determination to resist those who are in opposition to the goals she supports.  She has

<b>IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD</b><p>

The executive director of the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation has spent a good part of her professional life working to reform the child welfare system.  In the 1960's Ayers spent four years as a New York City social worker who witnessed firsthand the abuse and suffering of children at the hands of an unresponsive bureaucracy.  She left the system after New York City's Commissioner of Welfare banned home visits by social workers in 1968, claiming that they constituted an invasion of privacy and an undesirable form of espionage.  (Ayers does not say this was the reason).  But she did not forget what she had seen nor the benefit of the home visits.<p>
	Ayers told Foundation Watch:  "Mitch Ginsberg [then-New York City welfare commissioner now deceased] separated income maintenance from services.  But the fact is that my colleagues and I were really social workers.  We were not there investigating clients.  We were there trying to help clients; help them get off welfare, substance abuse.  
When income maintenance was separated, the social work staff was reduced.  And the city hired paper pushers who did not provide services.  The caseworkers of the late 60s were not watchdogs.  We were trying to help welfare recipients get into programs that would enable them to lead constructive lives." <p>
	Following her stint in social work, and in a program associate position at the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation (no relation, assets $525 million), Ayers came to Robert Sterling Clark as a consultant in 1976.  She found a small private foundation which gave out grants in an unfocused manner in many areas. <p>
	The Robert Sterling Clark Foundation was incorporated in 1952  to shelter and distribute a portion of the inheritance derived from the Singer sewing machine fortune.  Founder Robert Sterling Clark was the grandson of Edward Clark, a lawyer who founded the Singer company with Isaac Singer in the nineteenth century.  Last year, with a smaller 
$70 million fund, the Foundation gave away about $3.5 million.  A small operation with a staff of five, its giving reflects Ayers' intense personal commitment and leadership.<p>
	Says Ayers:  "The board hired me to look at what they'd been doing and try to figure out what fields it made sense to be in.  At that point the foundation was giving grants in ten fields.  There were lots of small grants in science, health, population, environment, education.  It wasn't a developed grants program.  It wasn't focused beyond 
broad categories.  Some areas were sufficiently broad as to render our grantmaking ineffective."<p>
	Ayers proposed to concentrate Clark's grants in three major areas: child welfare reform, monitoring the performance of government agencies in delivering services, and support for cultural institutions and the arts.  Since then, the Foundation has combined the first two fields, kept support for the arts, and added a third area: "insuring access to reproductive health information and services," which paid out grants totalling $1,406,000 in 1994 (information for 1995 is not yet available).  The largest single grant _ $200,000 _ 
went to The Planned Parenthood Federation of America to conduct research on pro-life activists.  By comparison, projects to improve public institutions in New York City and State were funded at the level of $1,084,000. The Foundation funded the arts and cultural institutions with grants totalling $1,196,080.<p>
	Ayers' concern for child welfare was an aspect of the Foundation's "government 
accountability" project begun in 1979 during the administration of New York City mayor 
Ed Koch. That effort focused on the city's administrative failings in responding to child 
abuse and neglect.<p>
	The Foundation made grants to the New York Civil Liberties Union to support litigation against the city.  In particular, from 1979 to 1994 it earmarked annual grants (excepting 1980 and 1988) to children's rights advocate Marcia Robinson Lowry.  She had come to fame as an attorney in a 1973 case, Wilder v. Bernstein, which forced New York City to end the use of religious criteria in making foster placements of children to Catholic and other religious homes.  In a consent decree, the city agreed that such placements violated constitutional guarantees of separation between church and state.<p>
	Since its first grant in 1979, the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation has given over 
$900,000 to the ACLU's children's rights project, which was headed until last year by Lowry.  In 1994 the foundation gave Lowry's project $80,000.  Last year Lowry left the ACLU to establish her own nonprofit, Children's Rights, Inc., with $90,000 in foundation support from Ayers.  At the ACLU Lowry enjoyed considerable success litigating child 
welfare and adoption cases, including the D.C. case which ended the Barry administration's authority over child protection services.  The essential role of the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation in making those successes possible has received little public 
attention.<p>
	Stanley Brezenoff, who was responsible for child welfare enforcement as first deputy mayor in the Koch administration, says, "The unique thing about Peggy Ayers is that she and the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation don't shrink from cutting edge issues.  <p>
We wouldn't have redoubled our effort to improve such a massive system, so unrelenting, such an enormous system, with thousands of reports of abuse and neglect, without the advocacy and prodding which came from the children's rights project.  We needed to be pushed and prodded.  The ACLU has come down on both sides.  It's not a liberal or conservative issue.  I admire Peggy and that foundation tremendously for what they've done."<p>
	Unfortunately, says Ayers, "A lot of the good we did, came undone," when David Dinkins replaced Koch as New York City's mayor.  Claiming ongoing city neglect of child welfare, Lowry's Children's Rights project at the ACLU filed the lawsuit Marisol A. <p>
v. Giuliani which is currently before U.S. District Judge Robert Ward in New York.  (The case, televised on Court TV, will also set precedent regarding the presence of cameras in a federal courtroom.)<p>

<b>TARGETED GIVING TO "FIGHT THE RIGHT"</b><p>

Passionate" is the word often used by those who know Ayers, executive director of the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation since 1979.  She uses the word herself: "I feel passionately about our work, the work of the foundation." In a universe known for an addiction to euphemism and dissimulation, what Dwight 
MacDonald called the "foundation-speak" of the "philanthropoids," Ayers is a refreshingly straight shooter.<p>
	Ayers is a shrewd politician whose views are respected by others in the world of organized philanthropy.  And she has a reputation as a "hands on" donor:  Ayers not only consults with the CEOs and development officers of the groups she funds, but she works directly with the staff members who run the programs that her grants support.<p>
	In many ways Margaret Ayers is the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation.  A tall handsome brunette in her mid-fifties, Ayers lives in Manhattan in the fashionable East-60's, maintains a country house upstate and is known as a conservative dresser who 
favors Chanel-like suits.  Ayers' annual salary is $150,000, with $22,387 additional in benefits. <p>
	Yet in September, 1995 Ayers told the Chronicle of Philanthropy that her mission 
as head of the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation is to "fight the right."  The battle began, she said, with the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980.  Ayers says she concluded then that the most important threat to women's rights came from the White House and the Republican party.  Observing the appointment of conservative movement activists and religious conservatives to Executive Branch agencies, Ayers persuaded her board that the Foundation should initiate a grants program to support abortion rights.<p>
	In this regard, Robert Sterling Clark has made some extraordinary grants.  For instance, it has paid recipient organizations to engage in "opposition research."  Some 1994 grant projects include:<br><ul>
	<li>  $80,000 to the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League for a 
computer database tracking abortion legislation, court cases, and publication of Sexuality 
In America: A State-By-State Review. 
	<li>  $60,000 to Catholics For Free Choice for A New Rite, a published database 
compiling information on conservative Catholic organizations and individuals.
	<li>  $40,000 to the Feminist Majority Foundation for investigations of pro-life 
groups.
	<li>  $200,000 over two years to Planned Parenthood for "clinic defense strategies" 
and a database of abortion opponents. 
	<li>  $80,000 to People for the American Way for its "Artsave" database of 
controversial art and for publication of Artistic Freedom Under Attack.  
	<li>  $50,000 to the ACLU's "Arts Censorship Project" to represent artists and arts 
organizations that "are under attack by government and private-pressure groups for 
creating and exhibiting works of art that deal with sexual or controversial themes."</ul>
	
	Despite its small size, the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation exerts considerable influence over nationwide abortion rights grantmaking.  Ayers heads the Council on Foundations' official Reproductive Rights Affinity Group, "Grantmakers in Support of 
Reproductive Rights."  <p>
	Formed in 1990 at Ayers' urging in light of the restrictions on abortion contained 
in the Supreme Court's decision in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, the group 
has 80 grantmaker members who "encourage foundations to give more money to organizations that advocate broad access to abortion and birth control." <p>
	The group succeeded a smaller, more secretive and unofficial team organized in 
1984.  Ayers told the Chronicle of Philanthropy in 1990 that one in four foundations 
invited to join the group did so because the decision had "shaken a lot of people to the 
roots."  <p>
	In 1991 Ayers called on the twenty largest foundations that fund abortion rights to 
meet at the Ford Foundation to plan a strategy in response to Rust v. Sullivan, the 
Supreme Court ruling that upheld the federal government's authority to prohibit federally-
funded clinic workers from recommending abortion.  <p>
	In 1993, the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation donated $100,000 to the Center for 
Reproductive Law and Policy, when the pro-abortion group split from the ACLU.  <p>
	The New York Times reported that the new group was meant to attract 
Republicans such as Barbara Mosbacher, co-chairman of the New York State Republican 
Family Comittee and Republican Pro-Choice Political Action Committee, who opposed 
other ACLU positions. <p>
	 "Some people are incensed by some of the ACLU's stances," she told the Times.  
Nat Hentoff, a pro-life member of the ACLU board of directors responded, "It's good for 
the ACLU that this close identification gets  less close."<p>

<b>"PRO-FAMILY, PRO-CHOICE": FROM WOMEN'S RIGHTS TO CHILDREN'S RIGHTS</b><p>

As Ayers supported improving the lives of children, she also strengthened her commitment to the pro-abortion cause.  She sees no conflict and offers the argument:  "It is critical to the ability of women to be integral parts 
of our economic system for them to have control over their reproductive lives.  I don't 
want the government telling me what to do in my bedroom.  I don't want the church 
telling me what to do in my bedroom.  I don't want them controlling what I do."<p> 
	During pregnancy, Ayers believes that the rights of the mother are paramount.  
The tables turn at birth.  "The life of the child begins at birth," she declared.  Only in this 
way can one understand the zeal with which the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation 
campaigns to remove children from abusive parents and abusive government programs, 
while funding those who would make it easier for mothers to terminate their pregnancies.<p>
	Ayers' four years in New York's slums and projects apparently have convinced her 
that it is better that some children not be born; but once born, children deserve quick 
removal from bad homes.  Ayers is a strong opponent of "family preservation," a social 
welfare concept embodied in a 1980 law which requires social workers to keep families 
together for as long as possible and balance this requirement against others. Ayers, 
however, favors early removal of abused children "in the best interests of the child."<p> 
	In this, Ayers rejects the position of some of the most prominent and well-
connected children's rights advocates, the Child Welfare League of America, the 
Children's Defense Fund (CDF), and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, its former chair. 
In her new book, It Takes A Village (Simon and Schuster, 1996, reviewed in Capital 
Research Center's Alternatives In Philanthropy March, 1996), the First Lady tries to have 
it both ways, defending the priority of the "best interests of the child" while 
simultaneously arguing for family preservation efforts. "It is not only parents who need 
expert 'coaching' in children's development," she writes. "The rest of the village does 
too."  <p>
	The Robert Sterling Clark Foundation stopped funding the Children's Defense 
Fund in the late 1980's because, according to Ayers, "CDF was not conducting work that 
qualified it to receive funds under any of our programs." It was shortly after Ayers 
discontinued the national child welfare program she had established upon her arrival.  
Although Ayers will not criticize the First Lady or CDF, it should be noted that the 
foundation continued to fund other child welfare projects through its New York-centered 
"government accountability" efforts _ but it still does not fund CDF or its local "New 
York City Child Health Project" (with offices at 111 Broadway in Manhattan). Ayers also 
differs with CDF's refusal to fight against race-based placement for adopted children.  
Indeed, some consider Children's Rights Inc. to be a new competitor to CDF's base of 
philanthropic support.<p>
	Yet, despite her differences with the conventional wisdom of the child welfare 
establishment, some experts don't find that Ayers's position offers much of an alternative.  
Douglas Besharov of the American Enterprise Institute remarks that more money, more 
social workers, and more court supervision of child welfare programs have had no 
positive long term impact on the child welfare system.  <p>
	"My basic thought is that courts can't reform child welfare agencies." he says.  
"Real reform needs the will of the community. The track record of spending more money 
is there, hiring more caseworkers is there, and it doesn't necessarily improve services to 
children because judges and lawyers can't run social service agencies."<p>
	More critical is William Donohue, a sociologist who is president of the Catholic 
League for Religious and Civil Rights in New York City.  He accuses attorney Marcia 
Lowry of attempting to destroy the Catholic child welfare agencies when she filed the 
1973 Wilder v. Bernstein suit (that found payments to religious agencies for foster care 
and adoption in violation of the Constitution's guarantee of separation of church and 
state).  Donohue calls Lowry "anti-Catholic" (though Lowry denies it) and predicts that 
child welfare systems under court monitors will suffer the same legal problems as mental 
hospitals which have been forced to deinstitutionalize patients, prisons which have been 
under court order to release criminals, and school systems which have been ordered by 
courts to raise property taxes to pay for new buildings and more teachers in vain attempts 
to improve student achievement and stop white flight. <p>
	The goal of Children's Rights Inc. lawsuits, says Donohue, is not to improve 
children's lives, but instead to concentrate power in court-appointed monitors who are 
approved by ACLU lawyers like Lowry.  The suits themselves cost millions of dollars 
which are drained from child welfare budgets into the pockets of lawyers and consultants.  
And the result is that accountability is removed from an electorate which has very 
different religious and moral values.<p>
	"The New York foster-care issue represents a fair characterization of the atomistic 
view of liberty," writes Donohue in his critical analysis of the ACLU, The Twilight of 
Liberty (Transaction, 1994).  "According to this perspective, freedom from religion is 
valued more highly than religious liberty, and that is why state encroachment on religious 
institutions is not interpreted as a threat.  If anything, the atomistic view holds that the 
prospects of liberty are advanced by weakening the influence of religiously-sponsored 
institutions."<p>
	Ayers disagrees that religious liberty is endangered when courts take over child 
welfare, arguing that "litigation is the only certain method of shedding light on child 
welfare systems that hide behind confidentiality laws."<p>
	On the other hand, Richard Gelles, a professor of sociology at the University of 
Rhode Island and author The Book of David: How Preserving Families Can Cost 
Children's Lives (Basic Books, 1996), argues that lawsuits such as Lowry's are inevitable 
but entirely off the mark.  The badly-drafted 1980 federal law which is the basis for court 
filings requires cities and states to pursue mutually contradictory policies: family 
preservation and the best interests of the child.  Because it is impossible to do both, 
lawsuits are inescapable.  Yet they will accomplish nothing.  Gelles argues that the only 
criterion should be the best interests of the child. <p>
	"Connecticut had children dying left and right under a consent decree," Gelles 
told Foundation Watch.  "The decree didn't order them to do the right thing.  You can't 
balance family preservation and child safety." <p>
	And Elizabeth Bartholet, a professor of Family Law at Harvard University 
concurs:  "I think family preservation is part of the problem today.  There is an 
overwhelming bias in our laws and funding priorities for family preservation that is 
inconsistent with the best interests of children."<p>
	In this, Bartholet and Gelles agree with Margaret Ayers, who told Foundation 
Watch, "I've been an observer of the child welfare system for thirty years, and I don't 
think there are any studies which show that family preservation works." 	<p>
	But, says Gelles,  "Lowry believes more social workers, more training, more 
intervention can solve the problem.  They can't.  Until the law is changed, things can't 
improve for children." Yet Ayers disagrees about the root problem, claiming "it is not the 
law. The fault lies in its implementation."<p>
	Gelles responds, "You cannot implement a vague, ambiguous, and inherently 
contradictory law. If you change 'reasonable efforts' to 'child safety' then you hold the 
states accountable."<p>
	In the debate over adoption and foster care, Ayers drops ideological arguments 
and partisan rhetoric.  She says, "I hesitate to say whether it is a conservative or liberal 
position. Basically I'm concerned about the well-being of children in a very vulnerable 
situation."<p>
	In this area Ayers seems to have adopted the self-reflexive and self-critical 
position of Naomi Wolf, who wrote in The New Republic, "the best understanding of 
feminism involves holding women as well as men to the responsibilities that are 
inseparable from their rights."<p>

<b>OUR BODIES, OUR SELVES</b><p>

About abortion, however, there 	are no doubts.  In giving grants 	to groups monitoring the politics of the abortion issue, Ayers has put the 
Robert Sterling Clark Foundation firmly on the side of those who regard abortion as 
central to women's liberation.<p>
	Ayers, who never married, is a truly liberated woman. She says she is not 
primarily interested in abortion for "population control" or "environmental" reasons, the 
argument made by some in the philanthropic community.  Instead, she says the right of a 
woman to control her own body is fundamental to a woman's freedom from oppression.  
The ability to terminate a pregnancy at will must be a premise of individual freedom and 
women's liberation.  This outlook has its roots in the feminism of the 1970's and it 
informs her thinking and her grantmaking. <p>
	"We spend a lot of time trying to promote women's access to reproductive health 
care.  And we have abstinence, but that's where conservative groups end the discussion.  
Many of these groups are not supportive of abortion, not supportive of family planning, 
not supportive of sexuality education," says Ayers.<p>
	The Reagan administration agenda was diametrically opposed to hers, she notes.  
"In 1983-84 there was an edict that came out of the Office of Management and Budget 
that all grantmaking agencies had to examine the projects they were supporting and the 
organizations they were giving grants to insure the purposes of the organizations and 
projects were consonant with White House policies."  Ayers refers to an ACLU legal 
challenge that led to the reinstatement of a USAID grant to the Alan Guttmacher Institute.  
She also mentions Department of Health and Human Service regulations on health clinics 
that separated family planning from abortion and the Rust "gag rule"decision. <p>
	In response, the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation made abortion the battleground 
of feminism.  Its fight continues.  Besides the previously cited opposition research  
funding, the Foundation made the following grants in 1994:<br><ul>
	<li>  $75,000 to the New York Civil Liberties Union to pay for "litigation 
challenging the exclusion of abortion services from New York's expanded Mediaid 
program." 
	<li>  $50,000 to Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington for "coalition 
building and grassroots organizing and the development of a database of information on 
the theocratic right and its tactics." 
	<li>  $60,000 to the Ms. Foundation for Women for the "Reproductive Rights 
Coalition Fund." 
	<li>  $50,000 to the NOW Legal Defense and education Fund to "secure legal 
protection for abortion providers." 
	<li>  $60,000 to the National Abortion Federation for "the creation of a Legal 
Clearinghouse" to "combat clinic harrassment." 
	<li>  $200,000 over two years to Advocates For Youth (formerly the Center for 
Population Options) which provides sex education to teenagers. 
	<li>  $40,000 to the Center for Policy Alternatives for a "Support Network for 
Pro-Choice Leaders." 
	<li>	$30,000 to the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy FAIR Health Care 
Reform Project to advocate the inclusion of abortion in health care;
	<li>	$75,000 to the Communications Consortium, for the "Reproductive Health 
Media Strategies Project," whose goal is "achieving better press coverage from the 
pro-choice perspective." 	
	<li>	$55,000 to the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health 
Association to "redress health reform measures that threaten access to reproductive health 
care." 
	<li>	$60,000 to the National Women's Law Center, to "support the Center's 
reproductive rights work." 
	<li>	$41,200 to the ProChoice Resource Center of Mamaroneck, NY to 
"monitor voter identification projects." 
	<li>	$50,000 to the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, to 
"strengthen its Clergy Network. . .and raise the visibility of the pro-choice religious 
position." 
	<li>  $120,000 over two years to the Sex Information and Education Council of the 
US for "the expansion of the National Coalition to Support Sexuality Education.
	<li>  $60,000 to the Women's Legal Defense Fund for the "National Pro-Choice 
Coalition."</ul>
	Paradoxically, the success of the pro-abortion movement reduces the number of 
babies available for adoption by loving couples unable to have children _the clear goal of 
Robert Sterling Clark's children's rights efforts, which gets only a fraction of the 
Foundation's abortion funding. <p>

<b>A COMMITMENT TO THE ARTS</b>
<p>

Ayers justifies the Foundation's 
		commitment to the arts as in 
		keeping with the personal interests of Robert Sterling Clark, a collector 
who established the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, 
Massachusetts.  But in an unusual move, Ayers has focused her giving on administrative 
and infrastructure projects as well as on proposals purporting to defend free expression.<p>
	Like its schizophrenic policy of children's rights and abortion rights, the Robert 
Sterling Clark Foundation has a Janus-faced view of support for the arts.  It funds both 
business ventures to help generate revenues for arts organizations which conservatives 
would find easy to support,  as well as People for the American Way's "Artsave" project, 
which compiles charges of so-called "censorship" -- which often are just complaints from 
outraged citizens.<p>
	On the other hand, Ayers is very proud of the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation's 
support for income generating projects in the arts.  Among the most successful of these 
was a grant underwriting the scene shop of Playwrights Horizons, a small theatre 
workshop in New York City.  Once headed by Andre Bishop, now artistic director of the 
Lincoln Center theatre company, and Paul Daniels, Playwrights Horizons established 
"Scenic Central," a cooperative storage and construction facility which employed 
non-union labor to build sets for nonprofit theatre companies along New York's 42nd 
Street Theatre Row.  This enterprise created "a million dollar cashflow for the theatre 
company," says Ayers.<p>
	Andre Bishop told Foundation Watch that the scene shop "helped our whole 
theatre world. It grew to be pretty big, and was a way of achieving self-motivated 
financial independence."  Bishop added that "of all the funding sources, Peggy is the most 
knowledgable and sympathetic, very into improving business practices."  Besides "Scenic 
Central," Bishop says Ayers approved grants for new computer systems, audience 
devleopment, and other infrastructure programs.<p>
	However, the flip side of Ayers' union-busting entrepreneurship on Theatre Row 
is her support, on First Amendment grounds, for the most indefensible projects the 
National Endowment for the Arts has to offer.<p>
	By paying for legal defense teams, the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation helps 
insure that the NEA will remain unresponsive to taxpayers and their representatives. They 
approach arts controversies over Mapplethorpe, et. al. as free speech issues rather than 
issues of government accountability _ as the Foundation does over child welfare _ or of 
financial accountability _ as the Foundation does with its other arts grants.  This course 
will doom the NEA.  It caused Congress' two percent cut in the NEA's annual 
appropriations in 1992, then a five percent cut in 1994, a forty percent reduction last year, 
and now NEA's planned termination. For Congress must account for expenditures of tax 
dollars.<p>
	Foundation grants helped pay for  ACLU lawyers who represented the Cincinnati 
Museum of Art and director Dennis Barrie for an exhibition of works by Robert 
Mapplethorpe. They also represented so-called "NEA Four" performance artists.  The 
ACLU won the Mapplethorpe obscenity case, and it settled the grant denials litigation 
with Karen Finley, Tim Miller, Holly Hughes, and John Fleck (now a supporting cast 
member on NBC's Homicide) for a quarter of a million dollars.<p>
	By treating government arts funding as a First Amendment issue, Ayers has 
adopted the same "rights-based" arguments which she has used in fighting the abortion 
issue and that have become the essence of modern liberalism.  In 1994 Foundation grants 
defending the sanctity of the presumed "right" to offend the taxpayer have been made in 
the amounts of $50,000 to the National Campaign for Freedom of Expression, $50,000 to 
the National Cultural Alliance, $50,000 to the ACLU Arts Censorship Project, $25,000 to 
the Alliance for the Arts, and $80,000 to People for the American Way's Artsave Project.<p>
	Ayers fails to see the link between her funding and the NEA controversy, 
however, saying that "the Artsave project didn't really have anything to do with the NEA.  
The purpose was to make people aware of where people were being censored."  One 
suspects that the NEA is now expendable to arts advocates --  if its sacrifice on the altar 
of the First Amendment enables artists to continue to enjoy the myth of  their own 
rebellion.  It would be better if the Foundation concentrated on showing artists how to 
create markets for their work, attract audiences, and continue improving arts 
administration.<p>
	As in much of life, it seems as though the law of unintended consequences has 
directed the activities of the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation and its executive director.  
Despite its civil libertarian self-image, the Foundation has moved the arts into the 
marketplace.  And despite its aggressive advocacy of state-sanctioned abortion, it has 
highlighted the need to defend children from state welfare agencies and misguided 
"family preservation" policies.  In a sense, the Foundation is at a crossroads.  <p>
	For if Margaret Ayers would realize the good that the Robert Sterling Clark 
Foundation has done unintentionally, she might be able to re-orient her grants to match 
her empirical successes.  Ayers might fund maternity homes and orphanages instead of 
abortion clinics, religious instruction and etiquette classes instead of sexuality education, 
and concentrate on generating new profits and audiences for arts institutions and artists.<p>

<b>Robert Sterling Clark Foundations Clubbable<br> Board of Directors</b><p>

	The trustees of the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation have been described by 
those who know them as white shoe, Wall Street, and fiscally conservative.  One 
Ayers friend called them the kind of people [who], if you wanted to join a country club, 
you wouldnt want them to judge your application.  Yet Peggys got them buying 
condoms for high school kids.  Shes brought them around to positions they wouldnt 
ordinarily take.<p>
	The descriptions are entirely accurate.  If there is a Liberal Establishment, the 
Robert Sterling Clark board provides a good sampling of its members worthy of case 
study.<p>
	Winthrop R. Munyan, chairman of the board, is a prominent New York lawyer 
with offices on both Park and Lexington Avenues.  Director Raymond D. Horton heads 
New York Citys Citizens Budget Committee and boasts to reporters of receiving 
personal phone calls from former Governor Mario Cuomo while on vacation in Jamaica.  
Philip Svigals lives in fashionable Upper Montclair, New Jersey.<p> 
	Richardson Pratt, Jr., Williams class of 1946 and Harvard Business School, 
1948, is a resident of Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island, and a trustee of the Federation of 
Protestant Welfare Agencies, Near East Foundation, Brooklyn Botanical Garden, and 
Brooklyn Museum.  He is former chairman of Charles Pratt & Company, a director of the 
Dime Savings Bank of New York, and is now president of the Pratt Institute, a venerable 
art and engineering school in Brooklyn.<p>
	Miner Dunham Crary, Jr., Amherst class of 1942 and Harvard Law, 1948, is a 
Park Avenue lawyer with Crutis Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle.  A member of the Union 
League, Century, and Huntington Country Clubs, he is a trustee of the American 
University in Cairo, the Hecksher Art Museum in Huntington, Long Island, the Sterling 
and Francine Clark Art Institute, and former chairman of the Amherst College alumni 
council executive committee. <p>
	John Niebrugge Romans, Williams, 1964, and Columbia Law, 1967, is also a 
partner at Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle and chairman of the Bar of the City of 
New Yorks Aeronautical Committee.  He is a member of the Princeton and the 
Larchmont Yacht Clubs.<p>

<b>Anti Catholic Opposition Research</b><p>

	 A New Rite: Conservative Catholic Organizations And Their Allies, researched 
and written by Steve Askin,  was first published by Catholics For Free Choice in 1994 
and has been updated in 1995.<p>
	Except for its putative liberal tilt, the document reads like a Ku Klux Klan tract 
from the 1920's, complete with allegations of a Papist conspiracy active in America.  But 
this time, the charge is that the Church supports the Religious Right. Rather than 
advocating lynching, the author merely compiles an enemies list.<p>
	In compiling this directory, we attempted to identify the Catholic organizations -
- and their close collaborators -- whose agendas support this conservative blueprint for 
family and society says Askin.<p>
	Some of the organizations singled out for scrutiny include the Knights of Malta, 
the Knights of Columbus, and the Domino's Foundation (based on the pizza fortune).<p>
	The shrill tone plays to traditional anti-Catholic bigotry by scapegoating Catholics 
even for the activities of Baptists.<p>
	"It was a Catholic...Paul Weyrich... who concocted the phrase 'moral majority' 
and who designed the agenda of the organization that went by that name. It was the 
willingness of the Catholic bishops to speak out 'courageously' on abortion that Jerry 
Falwell cited as the stimulus for his own entry into the political sphere, declares the 
introduction. Pope John Paul II, Jerry Falwell once declared, is the best hope we 
Baptists ever had.<p>
	Askin ominously points out that Phyllis Schlafly... William Bennett... Patrick 
Buchanan... are all Catholics. <p>
	He then goes on to indulge in deconstructing a  newspaper photograph in the 
National Catholic Reporter. Seated on the dais are cardinals John J. O'Connor, 
Bernard Law, Anthony Bevilacqua, James Hickery, and Roger Mahony, whle pounding 
away at the podium before a 'March for Life' audience is a stern faced Jesse Helms...So 
even though the bishops and Helms take opposing positions on virtually every social 
question except reproductive issues, they are political pals.<p>
	Add the pope's anti-Communist crusade to his conservative family agenda, fierce 
opposition to abortion and contraception, lack of recognition of women's rights, an 
authoritarian style of leadership, and one sees a near perfect reflection of the agenda of 
the Religious Right, writes Askin. <p>
	He concludes his introduction with a call for a new crusade against an imposing 
force in public life, with enormous potential to affect politics, public policy, and the 
church. If Weyrich is correct, and this is war, we do well to know the enemy.<p>
  What is surprising is that the board of directors of the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation 
is apparently not ashamed of this document.

<b>Foundation Watch Study</b><p>

A study of recent IRS data has revealed that the median payout rate for grantmaking 
foundations in 1992 was 8.17 percent, up from 7 percent in 1990 as reported in 
Foundation News (March-April, 1994), which used a different method.<p>

  The new analysis, conducted for Foundation Watch, was based on the just-released 
Private Foundations and Charitable Trusts, 1992, in the IRS Statistic of Income Bulletin, 
vol. 15, no. 3.<p>

  The breakdown was as follows:<br><p>

Size of Foundation Average Distributions<br>
<pre>
$100k to $1m		19.7%<br>
$1m to $10m		10.7%<br>
$10m to $25m		10.5%<br>
$25m to $50m		9.1%<br>
$50m to $100m		7.7%<br>
$100m and above		6.4%<br>
</pre>
<p>
  The median payout rate was computed by dividing the median of overall qualifying 
distributions of grantmaking foundations by the median of overall foundation net worth.  
The  average distribution for each foundation size category was determined by dividing 
the net worth on column 46 of the "Private Foundation" spread sheet of the  IRS Statistic 
of Income Bulletin by the qualifying distributions in column 52 of the same document for 
each category.<p>

  Thanks for sending me a copy of Foundation Watch with your article on the National 
Issues Convention [February, 1996]. I read the article. I think you need more evidence of 
what actually transpired during the convention before you can make a convincing case 
that it was an exercise in enforced group-think. Im sure that reports and at least one 
book will be published on the convention. Perhaps they will supply you with the evidence 
you need. <p>

believe a detailed examination of the Pew Charitable Trusts would be interesting. The

  The article on the American Center in Paris is a wonderful piece of work [March, 1996]. 
Its packed with interesting information, planting the seeds for a royal scandal. I was 
furious to read how these cultural pirates hijacked a long-established institution. <p>

  In a sidebar called "PBS's 'Democracy Project' : Is It Really The Democrat Project?" in 
our February, 1996 issue (vol.1, no.1),  Foundation Watch erred  in stating that Senator

<h2></FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Times New Roman">How They Took the Stars and Stripes from the 
American Center in Paris: </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Times New Roman">The Boh<B>e</B>n and 
Mellon Foundations and the Death of a Cultural Institution.</h2>

	On February 12th, 1996, the doors at the American Center at 51, rue de Bercy in the 12th arrondissement 
of Paris closed for the last time.  Eleven days had passed since the death of Gene Kelly, whose MGM film
 <I>An American in Paris</I> had inspired architect Frank Gehry in his design of the Center's new headquarters.
  A white limestone monument designed to resemble a dancer amid the rooftops of the French capital, the
 198,000 square foot structure was less than two years old.  Now it was closing.  The headline in<I> Le
 Monde</I> observed simply:  &quot;A  VENDRE&quot;  (for sale).  The American cultural institution, founded
 in 1931, was &quot;Trop grand, trop cher, trop tard&quot; (too big, too expensive, too late).<p>

	The American Center had suspended most of its operations in 1987, when the original building at 261
 Boulevard Raspail was sold for some $42 million dollars. Gehry's new structure had opened only in June 1994.
  It contained a 400-seat theatre, a 100-seat screening room, a dance studio, art galleries, classrooms and twenty-six 
apartments intended for visiting artists and intellectuals.  At a cost of between $27 and $42 million
 (the figure is disputed), the instant landmark figured to transform an otherwise drab neighborhood of wine
 warehouses east of the city center.<p>  	

	What had happened?  There was a grain of truth to the <I>Le Monde</I> description.  Parisians,
 with the naivete of the sophisticated, expected such follies of Americans.  But to insiders who were familiar
 with the American Center and its history, the closure reveals something more.  The story of how officials from
 two American philanthropic foundations appeared as &quot;White Knights&quot; to rescue a struggling
 cultural institution but stayed to liquidate its assets testifies to the perils of permitting funders to exert direct
 control over organizations.  It also reveals the arrogance of America's avant-garde arts establishment 
during a period of post-Cold War re-evaluation of the U.S. role in Europe.  Finally, it exposes the greed of
 foundation officials who put their private agendas ahead of a nonprofit organization's welfare.
  Ironically, the Bohen and Mellon foundation executives came to Paris not to praise the American Center,
 but to bury it.<P>  

 	***<br>
<hr>
<a name="Yanks"></a>
<H3>THE YANKS ARE COMING</H3>
	The closure and sale of the American Center brought to a distressing end a seven-year run of dreams gone
 awry.  In February, 1987 the original American Center headquarters closed.  Situated in Montparnasse, the Left
 Bank neighborhood which Hemingway and Fitzgerald had made their haunt, it had been a focal point for French
 and American artists and students still searching for the ghosts of the &quot;Lost Generation.&quot;  The Center
 site had been Chateaubriand's garden, and it still sheltered the oldest tree in Paris.<p>

	&quot;The American Students and Artists Center&quot; was founded in 1931 by Frederick Warren Beekman,
 the Dean of the American (Episcopal) Cathedral in Paris (and father-in-law of Presidential candidate Malcolm S. (Steve)
 Forbes, Jr., whose wife Sabina was raised in Paris). The Beekman family owned New York's Social Register (later sold
 to Malcolm S. Forbes) and catered to a striving social elite of expatriate Americans.  Beekman modelled his Center on
 the YMCA, for he intended it to offer an alcohol-free environment protecting Prohibition-era Americans from the
 temptation of cafes while encouraging them to &quot;come to France to partake of its unparalleled culture.&quot;<p> 

	He was immediately successful.  Americans in France formed a 150-member fundraising committee which
 raised $175,000 in Paris and an additional $200,000 in the United States.  Architect Welles Bosworth, brought to
 France by the Rockefeller family to help remodel Versailles, was commissioned to contruct the Center's headquarters,
 a  neo-classical palazzo which contained a swimming pool, gym, bowling alley, billiard room, auditorium, library,
 canteen, enclosed garden, and art studios.  The building was completed in 1934.<p>
<hr>
<a name="Paris"></a>
<H3>AN AMERICAN IN PARIS</H3>
	In the thirties and early forties, the Center was eminently respectable.  The American expatriate community
 enjoyed its events, and it was well-known for its teas, served to patrons in club chairs.  The expatriate American 
community which built the Center was also known for its other good works. It was instrumental in establishing
 an American Hospital, an American Church, and an American Library -- all independent and privately funded -- 
&quot;just as they would be in Minneapolis or Kansas City,&quot; in the words of Henry Pillsbury, heir to the
 Minnesota flour fortune and former executive director of the Center.<p>
	
	During World War II the building was commandeered by the Nazis.  But at war's end Beekman regained the
 building from the French Army and, after retiring as Dean of the Cathedral, became the Center's first executive
 director.  Once independent of the Cathedral, the Center became a venue for American artists in the 1950's and
 60s, sponsoring concerts, theatrical peformances, and exhibitions. In post-war Europe nonconformity became the
 Center's watchword as &quot;beatniks&quot; and avant-garde artists began to change what journalist Claire
 Downey, a reporter for <I>Paris City</I>, called its &quot;Ivy-League, clubby atmosphere.&quot;<p>  

	The Center became known for its bohemian charm and chance <I>rendevous</I> of French and American
 students.  An English language program was instituted, and poetry readings, art and music classes were offered.
  Open all night -- until 7 a.m. -- the Center attracted jazz musicians who would stop by after the French clubs shut
 their doors.  In time, eighty percent of the Center's expenses were paid for by tuition for classes and ticket sales.
 Some 5,000 art students and 3,000 English students enrolled in Center programs annually.  Downey refers to it as
 &quot;a commercial enterprise which supported an artistic agenda.&quot;  This was in keeping with American
 traditions of art and commerce.<p>

	But the Center was changing.  After the rebellious days of the 1968 student uprising, hippies, drugs, and
 theft came to the American Center -- as they did to America itself.  &quot;It was like a small Berkeley,
&quot; observed one-time student Jimmy Shuman.  In 1969 Pillsbury took over as executive director.  In what
 Shuman called &quot;a revolution from the inside,&quot; Pillsbury adopted a new, laid-back approach to
 managing the Center. &quot;He was like a camp counselor,&quot; said one longtime American Paris resident.<p>

	Pillsbury's expatriate American bohemianism was in many ways quite traditional and fundamentally non-political.
  Among some Parisian leftists there were rumors that the Center was involved with the CIA.  In fact, the Minneapolis
 native was simply an eclectic individualist devoted to the arts.  He had once been a theatre director and occasionally 
staged his own productions at the Center. <p> 

	Like his Center, Pillsbury was well-liked by many quite conservative Americans in Paris.  Jean Gerard, President
 Reagan's appointee as U.S. ambassador to UNESCO called him a &quot;fine fellow.&quot;  A &quot;gentleman
&quot; is how he is described by Judith Bingham, a prominent figure among Republicans residing abroad. 
 Pillsbury's devotion to the Center was also quite tangible.  He donated at least $1 million from his personal fortune
 to the Center, making up an annual budget deficit not covered by other revenues.<p>

	The governing board of the Center, made up of primarily expatriate Americans from the listings of Beekman's
 Social Register, had confidence in Pillsbury, who had a relatively free hand as executive director.  &quot;The old
 American Center was deeply loved by both Americans living in Paris and the French,&quot; noted Downey. &quot;It
 was a miracle,&quot; said Michel Reilhac, who later came to work for the Center as its highest-ranking French 
employee, &quot;living on a shoestring it had managed to be a major focus of cultural life in Paris without any means,
 compared to richer French insitutions, which had less cultural influence.&quot;<p>

	In 1977, Pillsbury was joined by Judith Pisar, who had moved to Paris with her husband, Auschwitz survivor
 Samuel Pisar, an international lawyer specializing in East-West trade who represented British publisher Robert Maxwell,
 among others.  A New York City fundraiser for the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Pisar soon became chairman of the
 Center's board after garnering increased contributions.<p>

	Pisar's personal connections helped the Center's fundraising and raised its public profile among the French 
and back home in the United States. Together, Pisar and Pillsbury set their sights on expanding the American Center
 as, in Pillsbury's words, &quot;a place where you can see, where you can learn, and where you can do.&quot;<p> 

	In 1979 Pillsbury and Pisar had secured Rockefeller Foundation funding which supported an &quot;artists
-in-residence&quot; program.  Over the next eight years it would sponsor 500 artistic performances, 350 workshops 
and 30 exhibitions.  Merce Cunningham, John Cage, and Philip Glass graced the Center's stage.  Sources in Paris
 say Pisar was quite close to Republican Senator Charles Percy, who, as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
 Committee, worked to better relations between the Center and the USIA and, as father-in-law to Senator John D.
 Rockefeller IV, helped with Center fundraising.<p> 
	
As the decade came to a close, the Center was still a proud and representative American institution in Paris,
 supported by the American establishment and the Franco-American public.<p>	

<hr>
<a name="Singing"></a>
<H3>SINGING IN THE RAIN</H3>
	In 1987, at the height of the Paris real estate boom, Pisar and Pillsbury accepted a fantastic bid of $42 million
 from the Banque Arabe d' Invetissement for the Center's property in Montparnasse.  At that time, the Center's annual
 budget averaged only about $500,000.  The National Endowment for the Arts had given $250,000 to the Center in 1985
 for its endowment fund.  But the enormous pool of new money, Pillsbury and Pisar said, meant that the Center could 
meet ever-rising public demands.  With help from the City of Paris, the Center acquired a huge plot of land in Bercy,
 just across the Seine from the new French library and near the &quot;Palais Omnisport,&quot; a sort of French
 Madison Square Garden.  With $42 million sitting in the Banque National de Paris, Pisar and Pillsbury took a gamble
 and built a monument.<p>
	
	The Center held spectacular fund-raising events in the late 80's and early 90's at such venues as the Theatre
 de le Rond Pont on the Champs Elysees.  They starred the likes of Gene Kelly and Leonard Bernstein, and celebrated
 the elegant fashions of Hubert de Givenchy.  But the eclectic bohemianism of the center was also maintained by
 showcasing avant-garde darlings such as Jean-Louis Barrault and Peter Brook.  During the next decade, Pisar and
 Pillsbury helped raise some $11 million -- in addition to the sale price of the building and accrued interest reaching 
10 percent annually -- including a $5 million dollar matching grant from Minneapolis native and pop art patron  Frederick
 R. Weisman.  Among other old-line donors, the Dillon Foundation and Rockefeller Brothers Fund each gave $100,000.
  Walter Annenberg also made a substantial contribution.  And French companies such as Yves St.Laurent and the 
Banque National de Paris contributed half a million dollars each.  Pisar received a Legion d'Honneur from the French 
government in recognition of her work promoting exchanges of Franco-American culture.<p>

<hr>
<a name="Deux"></a>
<H3>FOLIE A DEUX</H3>
	Unfortunately, the financial windfall for the American Center carried with it some severe problems.  
Freed from the fiscal constraints of the past, Pillsbury and Pisar succumbed to a culture of spending during the
 seven years between buildings.  They executed a series of false starts, made unfortunate staff choices, and relied on
 &quot;consultants&quot; who undermined the Center even as the foundations of its new headquarters were being laid.
<p> 
	
	Michel Reilhac, a French cultural administrator hired by Pillsbury as general manager in 1992, says the Center 
&quot;got trapped in the process of getting rich overnight after having been poor a long time.&quot;  As word spread
 that it had millions in the bank, &quot;a whole group of so-called consultants became attracted to this newly rich
 institution, people who are attracted to making money in this field.&quot;  Reilhac feels that &quot;Pillsbury and
 Pisar didn't know how to say 'No.'&quot;  The result, he argues, was that money began to hemmorhage from the
 Center faster than it could be raised.  It is estimated that some $2 million a year was spent on administration and
 that the projected operating budget for the building was $2 million for programs and $2 million for maintenence.<p>

	To save $5-6 million dollars in construction costs by scaling down the building design, Reilhac flew to
 Los Angeles to meet with the architect, Frank Gehry, whose original design was rejected by zoning officials for the
 City of Paris.  But on returning to Paris, Reilhac discovered that Pisar and Pillsbury had told Gehry to go ahead and
 spend the additional money.<p> 

	Meanwhile, the Center's artistic aspirations were becoming increasingly expensive.  The old American Center
 was a labor of love, but the new operation was paying premiums to its associates.  Pillsbury's friends Martin and
 Mickey Friedman of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis were among the new &quot;consultants.&quot;  They
 had recommended Gehry as architect and were now assigned to direct the artistic program and decorate the building
 on a retainer estimated by sources at between $10,000 and $20,000 per month.<p>

	To be curator for the Center's art exhibits, Pillsbury then hired Adam Weinberg.  He had worked for Friedman
 at the Walker Art Center before moving to New York City's Whitney Museum.Weinberg reportedly objected to the
 taint of Reilhac's attempts to raise money by renting space to commercial clients from a temporary Center classroom 
building constructed near the Gehry construction site.<p>

	Reilhac also says Weinberg began planning an exceptionally expensive opening exhibition called
 &quot;Landscape as Metaphor,&quot; with Friedman as curator.  Presented with a $1.5 million budget, Reilhac
 asked Weinberg to raise the money.  Friedman got some $500,000 from the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Foundation,
 but it was not enough.  In 1992, Pillsbury fired Weinberg, and Friedmansoon left.  Rumored cash settlements 
of $200,000 to Friedman further drained the Center's finances and negative press reactions crimped fundraising.
  &quot;I must say, I have no respect for the Friedmans,&quot; says Reilhac. &quot;They have no idea what
 international culture is about.&quot;<p>

	Soon after the debacle, Pillsbury met Bill Arnett, an Atlanta art collector who manages the career
 of Mississippi's Thornton Dial, an African-American painter and one of the most prominent &quot;Outsider
 Artists&quot; working today.  Pillsbury agreed to an American Center show of Dial's work.  Reilhac describes the
 planned exhibition as &quot;just beautiful work&quot; and Arnett agreed to secure the show's financing at no cost
 to the Center.  Surely the Parisian love affair with African-American culture, from Louis Armstrong and Josephine 
Baker to James Baldwin and Richard Wright, would be rekindled by Dial.<p>

	Whatever their missteps and foolishness, Pillsbury and Pisar had the Center's interests at heart.  It seems
 probable that the American Center could have overcome their <I>folie d'grandeur.</I>  Once the amazing new building
 opened, the Center could have recaptured its role as a vital American presence in France and served as a genuine
 artistic balance to the popular appeal of Euro-Disney. <p>

	The Thornton Dial show was the sort of project that could have led the Center out of the wildneress.  But it
 was not to be. Pillsbury and Pisar lost control of the Center in 1993 after the press stories of its problems reverberated
 through the philanthropic and art communities.  The Center's new leaders cancelled the exhibit of &quot;Outsider
 Art.&quot;  The successors to Pillsbury and Pisar were very much New York art world insiders.<p>
<hr>
<a name="Fou"></a>
<H3>L'AMOUR FOU</H3>
	The final chapter in the collapse of the American Center stars a new cast of characters who assumed center
 stage in 1993:  representatives of the Bohen and Mellon Foundations who took control of the Board of Directors.
  Their role in the destruction of an American cultural institution tells much about the new philanthropy of culture.<p>

	Incredibly, after only eighteen months of operation in its prize-winning building, Frederick Bohen Henry, the
 new Chairman of the American Center's Board of Directors, ordered the Gehry landmark closed and sold.  Henry, the
 president of the Bohen Foundation (assets $6 million), and Rachel Bellow, his partner in the Center's reorganized
 &quot;Office of the Director&quot; and a program officer for the Arts and Humanities at the Andrew G. Mellon 
Foundation (assets $2 billion) preferred to liquidate the American Center's assets.<p>

	This drama took place behind the scenes during 1993 and 1994, as Pillsbury and Pisar were shunted aside
 and a new &quot;special committee&quot; of twenty-five art world superstars shuttled back and forth between 
Paris and the United States prior to the June 1994 opening of the Center.  In Paris, they
 stayed at the fashionable Hotel d'Alembert.  Some reportedly flew first class, others preferred the Concorde. 
 According to sources, neither Henry nor Bellow resided in Paris, preferring to visit for a few days each month.<p>

	While the Center had a New York apartment for &quot;fundraising&quot; purposes, neither of the new leaders
 made a similar commitment to Paris.  This should have been the first sign that neither Henry nor Bellow had the
 interests of the American expatriate community at heart.<p>

	After cancelling the Thornton Dial show, Bellow and Henry cancelled the English classes that Reilhac had
 championed.  They rejected offers from Robert Altman to rent space to produce his film &quot;Pret-A-Porter
&quot; and from Voyager Videodiscs to headquarter its project to digitize the Louvre on CD-ROM.  They even
 turned down a local cafe proprietor who wanted to open a bistro<B>t</B>.  Bettina Zilkha Trink, heiress to a
 Franco-American banking fortune, resigned from the board in disgust.<p>

	Plans for the June, 1994 Center opening continued, and Pillsbury and Pisar agreed to stay on for the sake
 of appearances.  They have never spoken about the final days.  But interviews with their associates make clear 
that by January, 1994, they were mere figureheads and the institution was under the control of the visiting 
Americans.<p>

	Bellow explained her new approach to the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>:  &quot;First we will see how much 
money we can get, and then we'll decide what we are able to do with it.&quot;  One of her first decisions was to 
spend an estimated $500,000 on an opening party.  David Byrne, the former Talking Head, and a gospel group 
provided the music, the decorations were by Andre Puttnam, the liquor flowed, and there was dancing till dawn. <p>

	Among the curious expenses paid by Bellow and Henry was a confidential settlement of a harrassment 
complaint filed by superlawyer Eddie Hayes, current involved in the fight over the Andy Warhol estate and the
 fictionalized protagonist of Tom Wolfe's <I>Bonfire of the Vanities.</I>  Hayes represented an American woman
 hired by the Center to help with fundraising.  How much did her two-month &quot;development&quot; tenure 
cost the Center?  No one is talking, but Hayes did remark, &quot;They were very reasonable.&quot; Coming 
from a plaintiff's lawyer, one can only shudder at the implications.<P>

	Bellow and Henry replaced the no-cost Thornton Dial show with a $250,000 exhibit from Los Angeles'
 Museum of Contemporary Art called &quot;Pure Beauty.&quot;  (Richard Koshalek, the director of L.A. museum,
 was a member of Henry's &quot;special committee&quot;; Bill Arnett was not.)  The show was a flop.  Of &quot;Pure
 Beauty&quot; the <I>Wall Street Journal's</I> Judy Fayard wrote, &quot;Most of it is so hopeless, so lazy, so utterly
 lacking in rigor or vigor or vision, that even the cost of shipping the silly things over seems too much.&quot;<p>


	But the Center's changed tone was noted by the <I>Journal</I> reporter, who quoted Bellow's declaration
 that the Center would now become &quot;a meeting place for an international community of artists and 
performers...&quot; rather than a Franco-American institution.<p>

<hr>
<a name="Vanities"></a>
<H3>BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES</H3>
	In September 1994, the Center hired Marie-Claude Beaud as executive director. She was given a remodeled
 and furnished New York apartment, a travel allowance, and permission to hire her own staff.  Beaud was a French
 cultural bureaucrat, who had managed state-supported museums in Toulon and Grenoble before joining the Fondation
 Cartier, which was, according to <I>Apollo </I>magazine, &quot;better known for its gimmicks and parties than for any
 lasting contribution to modern art.&quot;  Beaud had &quot;never raised a sou&quot; according to one former
 Center employee.  A curious choice for an institution in financial crisis.<p>

	Although Beaud declared in public that she liked America, former Center employees say that in private she 
was &quot;clearly anti-American.&quot;  Soon after her arrival, what had been English and French-language press
 releases were issued only in French.  The policy was not reversed until a prominent American reporter stationed in
 Paris said she would not cover any event without an English-language press release.<p>
	
	Beaud's program decisions parody an NEA annual report:  They include Leon Golub and Nancy Spero's
 left-wing agitprop, &quot;video art&quot; by Nam June Paik and Bill Viola, a Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, and
 presentations by politically correct Nobel laureate Toni Morrison, dancer Bill T. Jones, and Living Theatre relic 
Judith Malina.  Others events included Larry Clark's film on teen sex, &quot;Kids,&quot; art exhibits by European
 artists Phillippe Boardas and Nicholas Bouvier and writers Cees Noteboom and Michel LeBris, and concerts by 
UNUN, with singers &quot;Helda...Thor Eldon, guitarist of the Sugarcubes (Bjork) and Dr. Gunni, an independent
 rock star in Iceland...&quot;  The Center's last cinema event honored the work of Jonas Mekas, whose grainy loops
 of 16mm self-indulgence have a decidedly limited appeal.<p>

	A cynic might conclude that Bellow and Henry must have encouraged such programs to justify their decision
 to sell the building.  Certainly there were alternatives to their selection of <B>Madame Beaud.  </B>Robert Fitzpatrick,
 a Center board member who had headed Euro-Disneyland, the California Institute of the Arts, and the highly 
successful 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Arts Festival expressed interest in the executive director's job.  Pillsbury
 himself had proposed his name.  With contacts in Europe and America and experience in promoting popular and
 high culture, Fitzpatrick could have raised the money and protected the center's mission.  Rebuffed, Fitzpatrick
 became Dean of the Arts at Columbia University.<p>

	Observers close to the scene have revealed to <I>Foundation Watch </I>that Henry and Bellow, who have
 jointly managed the Center's day-to-day affairs since 1994, are personally responsible for sealing its fate.  Depending
 on the sale price of the building, estimates of the potential future endowment range from $10 to $30 million.  Instead 
of raising the money to save what had been an important institution representing American culture to France, the new
 overseers are converting its assets into funds that will be distributed by a grantmaking foundation that will fund art 
from and for &quot;the international community.&quot; <p>

	On January 24, 1996, an American Center press release reported that after the sale of the Gehry landmark
 -- which still awaits a buyer -- and debt repayments including a reported $4 million owed the city of Paris, all remaining
 funds will go into an endowment to be directed by Marie-Claude Beaud, last director of the American Center.  Fred
 Henry will be Chairman of the Board of the newly reorganized fund.  Rachel Bellow announced that she is leaving 
the Mellon Foundation to become a &quot;consultant&quot; to arts organizations.  It was not disclosed whether the
 American Center fund will become her first client. <p>

<hr>
<a name="Deconstructing"></a>
<h3>DECONSTRUCTING THE AMERICAN CENTER</h3>
	The cultural outlook implied in the decisions Henry and Bellow are making derive from the modern-day
 detractors of all things genuinely cultural who currently dominate so much of the art world: the post-modernists
 and deconstructionists who substitute nihilism for aesthetic achievement.  They have little in common with the 
celebration of the buoyant and eclectic American culture usually championed by Pillsbury and Pisar.  Moreover,
 by choosing to redeploy the American Center's financial assets rather than supervise its mission to represent
 American culture, Henry and Bellow are redefining the purposes of philanthrophy. <p>

	How did they manage to takeover the American Center?  In retrospect, there were warnings that should
 not have gone unheeded.  Pillsbury's downfall commenced with his decision to hire Adam Weinberg, late of the
 Walker and Whitney Museums.  It was Weinberg who introduced him to Frederick Bohen Henry.  Henry, a New
 York City attorney and avid art collector, was born in Des Moines, the heir to the Meredith Publishing fortune.
  He remains on the board of the family business, currently valued at some $700 million.  Henry lists his occupation
 as Bohen Foundation president.  (The Bohen board also includes pollster Daniel Yankelovich, co-founder of the
 Public Agenda Foundation.   Bohen gave $125,000 to the Public Agenda Foundation in 1991-92.  See <I>Foundation
 Watch v.I, n.1</I> for more on Public Agenda.)  Most importantly, Henry was a member of the Board of Trustees of 
tNew York's Whitney Museum of American Art.  <p>

	Since the mid-1980s the Walker and Whitney museums have been models and mirrors of the decadence and
 fiscal irresponsibility pervading the American arts establishment.  Representatives of both institutions are
 on Henry's influential &quot;special committee.&quot;  These &quot;cutting edge&quot; venues for self-mutilation
 performances and exhibits of plastic puddles of excrement and vomit have been funded targets of the 
public's outcry against National Endowment for the Arts grants<B>.</B>  (The Walker Museum sponsored the 
HIV-positive artist Ron Athey, who hoisted towels smeared with his victim's blood over the 
heads of art patrons.  The Whitney Biennial featured the poop and puke).  In any future history of the NEA's demise,
 the Walker and the Whitney surely will be featured for their roles in destroying a once bipartisan congressional 
consensus in support of the arts. <p>

	Fred Henry was no stranger to the gross and disgusting.  His Bohen Foundation had been a sponsor of a
 Bruce Nauman exhibit that was shown at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and at the Smithsonian's Hirshorn
 Museum.  It featured neon signs blinking &quot;F--- and Die,&quot; &quot;S--- and Die,&quot; and depicted excited
 male sexual organs and a merry-go-round of slaughtered animals.<p>

	Henry began his courtship of the American Center with a Bohen Foundation donation to support &quot;public
 art&quot; for the park at Bercy.  Well connected in the art-world, he also helped the Center secure money from New 
York City's public art fund in 1989.  By 1990 Bohen was on the American Center's board of directors.  Pisar had stayed
 on as titular Chairman of the board, but Henry in 1992 became Chairman of its Executive Committee.  In that capacity 
he organized the &quot;special committee&quot; of top officials in prominent arts institutions who reported directly 
to him.<P>

	How was Henry able to oust Pillsbury and outmaneuver Pisar? The answer is simple.  He used the assets of
 the Bohen Foundation to increase his influence among the artistic avant-garde so that they would second his 
recommendations on the fate of the American Center. In confronting the troubled institution, Henry's
 aggressive tactics were not unlike those of a corporate takeover artist.  The American Center was a target.  It would
 be a fine institution to run -- or sell -- after a leveraged buyout.  To secure its assets, which were worth over $40 
million, Henry needed only to make investments (i.e. contributions) of mere hundreds of thousands of dollars to 
his allies and then push the old guard aside.<p>

	According to IRS records, in 1991-92 the Bohen Foundation reported a contribution of only $50,000 to the
 American Center in Paris. (Bohen would eventually give about $500,000, roughly half of Henry Pillsbury's personal
 contributions over the years).  More interesting were the Bohen Foundation's grants to other American cultural 
institutions:  $173,000 went to the Whitney Museum of American Art, whose curator of Film and Video, John 
Hanhardt joined the &quot;special committee&quot; of the American Center in 1992; $50,000 went to Social 
Policy Inc. -- The New Press, headed by editor Andre Schiffrin who also joined Henry's &quot;special committee
&quot; in 1992; and $110,000 was contributed to the Museum of Modern Art, whose director, Richard Oldenburg
, joined the &quot;special committee&quot; as well.  A grant of $15,000 went to the Dia Center for the Arts, a venue
 for the avant-garde where Henry was a board member.  Its director joined the &quot;special committee&quot; in 1992,
 as did Harvey Lichtenstein, director of the Brooklyn Academy of Music.  BAM received $57,000 from the Bohen 
Foundation.  Clearly, the members of Henry's &quot;special committee&quot; were aware of his contributions to
 their institutions and unlikely to resist his plans for the Center.<p> 

	In 1994, members of the special committee were invited to join Henry in what an American Center press
 release called &quot;a radical innovation in the management of nonprofit cultural institutions.&quot;  The special
 committee had been &quot;assembled to help formulate and implement the Center's diverse artistic and educational
 program&quot; in order to develop &quot;a new strategic alliance&quot; which &quot;may signal the development 
of a new model for securing international hubs of artistic activity and exchange.&quot;  By such cloudy jargon did the
 arts elite ratify Henry's intention to sell the American Center's new building.  And what justified the sale would be a
 major philanthropy's predatory concept of how nonprofit arts organizations should deploy their resouces.<p> 

<hr>
<a name="Boardroom"></a>
<h3>INSIDE THE BOARDROOM</h3>
		Where did Henry get his ideas about how to proceed in philanthropy?  Some clue may be found in
 <I>Inside the Boardroom</I> (John Wiley, NY, 1994), a new book by William G. Bowen, president of the Andrew 
A. Mellon Foundation.  In his book, Bowen argues that the boards of directors of nonprofit organizations should 
take a more direct role in the day-to-day management of their institutions.  Henry followed this advice when he 
placed himself in power.  But he also innovated.  By consolidating decision-making in an &quot;Office of the Director,
&quot; but then sharing that post with the Mellon Foundation's Rachel Bellow, Henry devised a novel experiment in 
organizational infrastructure.<p>

	Henry's reliance on his &quot;special committee&quot; perhaps reflects Bowen's endorsement of outside
 consultants as a highly desirable board practice.  Bowen, a former president of Princeton University who once
 managed the private trusts of the Rockefeller family (estimated by <I>Fortune</I> magazine in 1986 to be worth some
 $3 billion) argues that good management requires &quot;the board should have ready access to advice from
 accountants, compensation consultants, lawyers, and investment bankers who are chosen by the outside directors,
 not by management,&quot; (i.e. the American Center's case, not Pillsbury and Pisar).   <p>

		More importantly, in <I>Inside the Boardroom, </I>Bowen specifically credits Rachel Bellow, Mellon's
 program officer on the American Center board, for helping reconcile the Center to its own suicide.  Concludes Bowen:
  &quot;More thought needs to be given, in my view, to ways of allowing nonprofits to achieve 'death with dignity'
 when that is appropriate.  In theory, some nonprofits recognize that institutional demise can signal success, not failure.
 . .For example, my colleague, Rachel Bellow, has called my attention to the Free Southern Theatre in New Orleans. . .The
 theater staged a large funeral through the streets of New Orleans and artists from all over the country attended to 
celebrate the 'death' (read:success) of the theater.&quot;<p>  

	What occurred in New Orleans foreshadowed what followed in Paris.  By hiring Marie-Claude Beaud
 as Pillsbury's successor, Henry and Bellow selected more than a promoter of the international avant-garde. 
 The former curator at the Fondation Cartier dreamed about shutting down cultural institutions
</B>Beaud once actually once told a journalist that she would like to close Cartier's museum and sell its collection. 
 In September 1992 she declared to Elspeth Moncrieff of Britain's <I>Apollo</I> magazine: &quot;With the ease of
 modern-day travel it makes more sense for the Fondation to contribute to existing centres of excellence, rather than
 create another institution in a minor Parisian suburb...There is no point in continuing to build our own collection...
If you have a collection, you need a museum and curators.  Even lending the works involves a good deal of
 administration all of which eats into our grant.  If I had my way I would give away the Fondation's collection,
 with the exception of the works which hang in our corporate offices.&quot;  When she took over the American
 Center one could ask for no clearer statement of Beaud's philosophy.<p>

		In his new mission statement for the Center, Henry declared his constituency to be not Americans
 or the French, but &quot;an international community.&quot;  He promised &quot;an entrepreneurship of new 
expressions.&quot;  Henry had made sure that he was joined in his venture by the most powerful officials from 
America's private arts bureaucracy.  And to the modest assets of his Bohen Foundation he added the backing of
 William Bowen's Andrew Mellon Foundation, whose $2 billion in assets makes it the largest single grantmaker in
 the arts and humanities in the United States. <p>

		Rachel Bellow, the woman who advised Bowen on the successful death of the New Orleans theater,
 is a program officer in the arts and humanities at the Mellon Foundation.  Her division alone distributes some $20 
million annually.  Bellow is widely considered an expert on arts management.  She has served as a consultant to the
 NEA and is married to Adam Bellow, an important neoconservative editor at The Free Press who is the son of novelist
 Saul Bellow.  Like the other art world denizens selected by Fred Henry, Bellow had been invited to join his
 &quot;special committee&quot; in 1992 for a purpose.  She was given leave by the Mellon Foundation for her
 new assignment. By 1993 Bellow was Henry's full partner in the newly constituted &quot;Office of the Director.
&quot;  But what was her purpose?<p>

		Some might have supposed that the Mellon Foundation would open its deep pockets to the Center.  
Former Center staffers thought so.  In 1993, Bellow's division in the Mellon Foundation gave $15 million in a single 
grant to the National Gallery of Art.  But they would misjudge the intentions of Henry and Bellow.<p>

		Consider, for instance, the disposition of a $440,000 Mellon grant to the American Center in 1993
 which was personally approved by William Bowen.  Mellon's annual report claims the grant went &quot;to 
strengthen its [the American Center's] core programs, collaborations with smaller arts organizations and financial
 stability.&quot;  Did the report's bland prose admit of a new definition for the Center's &quot;core programs,
&quot; or was the report a misrepresentation to the Mellon Foundation's board?<p>

		Certainly, the Mellon Foundation could have rescued the American Center had Bowen wished it.
  Would Mellon's Board Chairman, John C. Whitehead, Deputy Secretary of State in the Reagan Administration 
and a former head of Goldman, Sachs, have permitted the sinking of a flagship American cultural institution?  
Indeed, Bowen's book quoted Whitehead's own personal observation that &quot;A for-profit board has an 
obligation to <I>get out</I> of a bad business while a nonprofit board may have an obligation to <I>stay in</I>,
 if it is to be true to its mission.&quot;  <p>

		The mystery is that Henry, Bowen and Bellow were indifferent to such basic obligations.  Should
 not Whitehead call them to account for their decision to kill the symbol of American culture in Paris?  After all, it
 was William Bowen himself who wrote in <I>Inside the Boardroom, &quot;Nonprofit boards are tremendously 
important.  They can have more impact on the success or failure of an organization than can most for-profit 
boards.&quot;</I><p>

<h3>WHO IS WILLIAM BOWEN</h3>
	William Bowen is widely perceived as a mentor to University of Pennsylvania President Sheldon Hackney,
 the Clinton Administration's selection for Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities.  A 1965 Bowen
 study laid much of the groundwork for the National Endowment for the Arts.<p>

<a name="Never"></a>
<h3>	NEVER ASKED BOX</h3>
<b> 		Anne Radice, the first director of the National Museum of Women in the Arts (and acting chairman of
 the National Endowment for the Arts under President Bush) pointed out, she had built a new museum, with a new 
constituency, and an income-generating membership, with programs that required an annual operating budget of 
$6 million. And the National Museum of Women in the Arts did it without any endowment, and in a building which
 required monthly mortgage payments, and an initial $5 million renovation. <p>

		How did she do it? &quot;We were careful how we spent our money,&quot; Radice says. &quot;I
 wouldn't do an exhibit without underwriting. Never. We paid for everything before we did it. I never planned a budget
 on the receipt of grants.  And so we never had to fire people. Every night when I went to bed, I felt personally 
responsible for all of our employees. I would never have jeopardized their jobs.&quot;Clearly, had the American
 Center asked Radice, who has a MBA in addition to her doctorate in Art History (in Florentine art), and experience
 as an international cultural officer with USIA specializing in public diplomacy, she might have been able to help them
 out. The sad part is, as she notes, &quot;I was never approached.&quot;Ironically, Radice became available in
 November, 1992, when President Bush lost his bid for-re-election. Today she is involved with a different private
 foundation, not funding the arts.<p>

</B>(Architect Gehry disputes the figure, assigning a cost of $27 million, including architect's fees). 

 (Sadly, this relic was chopped down by the Fondation Cartier, the corporate foundation of the jewelry business, 
when it took over the site in 1990.)

<h2>From The Editor:</h2>
<P>
This is the first issue of <I>Foundation Watch.</I> Our motto
is &quot;sunlight is the best disinfectant.&quot;
<P>
Philanthropic foundations are growing increasingly important in
the United States, not only for how much they give, but for those
who get their grants. While individuals (who still provide the
bulk of contributions) usually wish to help other individuals
in need, many foundations have a more ambitious agenda. They see
grantmaking as a catalyst for social change.
<P>
The impact of this sector is clearly considerable. As the federal
budget begins to shrink, foundations will be called upon to fill
in the gaps. How will they respond?
<P>
That is the question which will undergird our reporting and is
the rationale for starting this publication. We maintain a critical
point-of-view, but we wish to be fair.
<P>
We look forward to thoughtful responses from interested readers,
and invite those with opposing points of view to contribute to
a lively debate.
<P>
We also look forward to <a href="mailto:info@crc.org">receiving letters to the editor, guest
columns, and your story ideas</a>. In coming months, we hope to add
a variety of features to our coverage of philanthropy, including
interviews, profiles, and book reviews.

<h2>PBS's National Issues Convention and the Charles F. Kettering
Foundation: The Power of Money in Politics</h2>
<P>
<I>In this election year, an imposing array of well-endowed American
foundations, following the lead of the Charles F. Kettering Foundation,
have been quietly funding a set of civic education projects. These
projects purport to promote clearer thinking about democracy by
improving the way journalists cover it. Last month their endeavors
aimed for a national audience on PBS's broadcast of the National
Issues Convention. The outcome suggests that neither democracy
nor journalism was well served.</I> 
<P>
Television watchers who tuned into the National Issues Convention
in Austin, Texas (broadcast live on PBS on the night of January
20th and morning of January 21st) could see what appeared to be
a worthy endeavor in civics education. The Convention was billed
as an opportunity for over four hundred ordinary American citizens
to talk with presidential candidates, policy experts, and with
each other about their genuine concerns.
<P>
PBS viewers saw a &quot;town hall&quot; event intended to be informative
rather than confrontational. In separate segments, casually dressed
Americans asked carefully worded questions about the economy,
foreign policy, and family values to Vice President Al Gore, who
represented President Clinton, and to Republican Presidential
candidates Senators Richard Lugar and Phil Gramm, former Governor
Lamar Alexander and Malcolm S. (Steve) Forbes, Jr. Jim Lehrer,
host of PBS' nightly <I>Newshour</I>, moderated the broadcasts,
which totalled nine and a half hours on the PBS schedule.
<P>
Professor James S. Fishkin, chairman of the department of government
at the University of Texas, had provided the blueprint for the
Convention. It was financed by major philanthropic foundations
and touted by a significant minority of the national media. And
it received advice and counsel from Washingtonbased political
elites. PBS called its undertaking &quot;The Democracy Project.&quot;
The $4 million cost of organizing and televising the National
Issues Convention was the first major investment by PBS in election-year
coverage for 1996.
<P>
Viewers would have no way of knowing that &quot;The Democracy
Project&quot; is but one part of a larger and long-standing project
to reshape American politics. Key players include the Charles
F. Kettering Foundation (assets $167 million) and its ally the
Public Agenda Foundation, the Pew Charitable Trusts (assets roughly
$2 billion) and the James S. Knight Foundation (assets approximately
$800 million).
<P>
The enterprises of these foundations travel under a number of
different names. The Kettering Foundation refers to its support
for &quot;encouraging deliberation.&quot; The Pew Charitable Trusts
fund programs in &quot;civic journalism,&quot; while the Knight
Foundation funds &quot;public journalism.&quot; Sometimes one
foundation &quot;fronts&quot; for another. For example, over $1
million over the last four years has been funneled from the Knight
Foundation through the Kettering Foundation for &quot;public journalism&quot;
projects.
<P>
When these foundations refer to &quot;deliberation&quot; and &quot;civic&quot;
and &quot;public journalism,&quot; they seem to refer to particular
proposals for reforming the way the media covers political debate
and election campaigns. Reporters are chastised for reporting
on the horse-race, &quot;who's ahead?&quot; aspects of campaigns
and for relying on sound-bites to convey candidates' positions.
Instead, the media are urged to be more serious and analytical.
<P>
This public agenda has a far more troubling private purpose. The
foundations hope to use a tamed media to change the way citizens
listen to candidates and learn about issues. By transforming the
way they select and present &quot;news,&quot; the newly &quot;re-educated&quot;
media will &quot;improve&quot; citizen decision making about politics.
&quot;Better&quot; candidates will be elected to public office
and &quot;better&quot; public policies will result.
<P>
In reality, the grantmakers are funding a multimillion dollar
experiment to reorganize the American political process to their
own liking, to protect their own priorities and privilege their
own programs.
<P>
National Issues Convention promoters wish to preempt the exciting
rough-and-tumble of American elections and replace them with a more
manageable &quot;deliberative&quot; process. This process is intended
to stifle genuine political disagreements, under the rubric of
&quot;deliberation,&quot; consensus, and nonpartisanship.
<P>
If the backers of the Convention have their way, sharp passions
will be smothered and political arguments muffled in a great liberal
stew of &quot;dialogue&quot; cookedup by PBS, the Kettering Foundation,
the Public Agenda Foundation, and their network of other government
and foundation-financed agencies.
<P>
At best, such programs would serve up pablum that cannot satisfy
the hunger of Americans for real public debate. At worst, the
body politic would be poisoned by a diet of thought-control.
<P>
<I><B>THE MEDIA'S NEW ASSIGNMENT: CREATING THE &quot;IDEAL CITIZENRY&quot;</B></I>

<P>
Liberals and conservatives love to complain about how the media
covers politics.
<P>
Pundits such as Anthony Lewis, David Broder and James Fallows criticize
the media for fostering a low level of public discourse. They
say public policy debate is pushed to the sidelines by corporate-controlled,
profit-oriented outlets which pander to the fascinations of a
mass public. The result is tabloid TV, Willie Hortonstyle political
advertisements, and photoops for politicians like the Contract
with America signing on the Capitol steps. Liberals conclude that
voters are kept ignorant because the media does not provide the
information they need to make rational decisions.
<P>
Conservatives answer that Americans are politically frustrated
because an iron triangle of government, special interests, and
the media shade the facts about government spending, taxes, education,
and crime. &quot;Reporting&quot; on television network news and
in major daily newspapers too often ignores or slyly denigrates
the genuine grievances of ordinary Americans while pushing the
public agenda of liberal elites. They say Rush Limbaugh provides
information which the American people otherwise would not hear.
<P>
The thesis underlying the National Issues Convention purports
to answer both of these concerns. It is developed in Professor
James Fishkin's book, <I>The Voice of the People</I> (Yale, 1995),
which is a sequel to his earlier <I>Democracy and Deliberation
</I>(Yale, 1991).
<P>
Fishkin argues that the media needs a new assignment if the American
republic is to achieve its full potential. He opines that the
media should not treat election campaigns as sporting events in
which one side scores points against the other. He suggests that
journalists pay less attention to the positions and promises of
the candidates.
<P>
Instead, he proposes that the media be of service to American
democracy by helping to educate<B> </B>its citizens about politics
and government through face-to-face encounters in small groups.
<P>
Fishkin says that to become &quot;ideal citizens&quot; ordinary
Americans need to be informed by &quot;nonpartisan&quot;and &quot;unbiased&quot;
factual materials instead of by partisan rhetoric. These materials
will give them a shared background for understanding the issues
of the day. Citizens can then sort through their findings by engaging
each other in facetoface discussions. This will help them learn
from each other's diverse experiences, hash out individual differences,
and find common ground. Disinterested experts will be available
to help them &quot;come to public judgement.&quot;
<P>
The result should be that rational &quot;deliberation&quot; replaces
&quot;debate.&quot; The ideal citizen will base his electoral
decisions on solid information and rational deliberations instead
of on soundbites and emotion. Last month's National Issues Convention
represented a major commitment by PBS and grantmaking foundations<B>
</B>to Fishkin's reform project.
<P>
Fishkin hands the media a plum assignment. His proposal plays
to the interest some in the media have to be more than passive
recorders of the day's events. It offers the media the chance
to be players in the political game, not mere reporters on the
sidelines. Fishkin means to mobilize the media to &quot;educate&quot;
voters to think the way he wants them to think. And his goal is
congruent with the aims of the large and powerful foundations
such as Kettering, which has worked with him since at least 1991.
Fishkin's &quot;deliberative poll experiment&quot; provides a
veneer of academic respectability to the &quot;Kettering technique.&quot;
<P>
<I><B>DEEP IN THE HEART OF TEXAS</B></I> 
<P>
Like Texas itself, the National Issues Convention event was nothing
if not big. PBS devoted some nine and a half hours to coverage
of the affair. Hundreds of newspaper and television reporters
flew into Austin from across the country.
<P>
On the day before the event, The Poynter Institute for Media Studies,
a private foundation which controls the stock of <I>The St. Petersburg
Times</I>, held its own seminar to instruct journalists on covering
the National Issues Convention.
<P>
And New York University's Project on the Press and Public Life,
which is supported by the Knight and Kettering foundations, offered
journalists seminars on how to cover the actual 1996 campaign.
<P>
Before the broadcast, in December of 1995, the National Opinion
Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago had polled
a random sample of<B> </B>900 citizens across America on their
political opinions. In January, some 600 were invited to travel
allexpensespaid to the University of Texas at Austin. Four hundred
fifty-nine arrived despite the East Coast blizzard. The participants
were welcomed by Governor George W. Bush, enjoyed free lunches
and dinners, went linedancing, and were further buoyed by $300
in spending money.
<P>
For four days these &quot;delegates,&quot; each supposed to represent
375,000 fellow Americans, listened to addresses by presidential
candidates -- but not Clinton, Dole or Buchanan -- and met in
small discussion groups to &quot;deliberate&quot;over public issues.
<P>
Facilitators trained by the Charles F. Kettering Foundation guided
their deliberations, and both facilitators and public participants
read discussion materials prepared by the Public Agenda Foundation
at the request of the Kettering Foundation. At the end of the
exercise, participants were polled a second time to determine
how the process of &quot;deliberation&quot; had affected their
thinking.
<P>
Fishkin had predicted that the process of deliberation would refine
and elevate the views of the Convention participants. At a Washington
press conference on January 25 and on a nationally-televised PBS
special the next evening, Fishkin announced results from the Convention's
&quot;deliberative poll.&quot;
<P>
Malcolm S. (Steve) Forbes, Jr. must have been sorry he agreed
to participate in the Austin pow-wow. The press release for Fishkin's
Washington, DC appearance trumpeted polling results showing support
for the flat tax dropped from 43.5 percent in December to 29.8
percent. This drop happened after Convention participants had
the opportunity to &quot;deliberate&quot;-- and after three Republican
rivals and the Vice-President of the United States had savaged
his proposal.
<P>
However, other post-deliberation poll results reflect a muddle
of opinions, some liberal, some conservative, some confused and
contradictory.
<P>
After the four days spent in small and large &quot;facilitated&quot;
discussions in Texas, &quot;delegates&quot; who reported believing
that the average worker does not receive a fair day's pay for
a fair day's work went up from 26.6 percent to 40.4 percent; that
the amount the U.S. is spending on education and training is too
little increased from 71.9 percent to 86.3 percent; that economic
pressure is the biggest problem for the American family rose from
35.5 percent to 50.7 percent; that making divorce harder to get
would strengthen the family climbed from 36.1 percent to 56.7
percent; that the federal government should not cut spending on
foreign aid to reduce the federal budget deficit ticked up from
9.3 percent to 20.6 percent (still leaving roughly 80 percent
in favor of cutting foreign aid); that federal programs such as
welfare<B> </B>should be turned over to the states <I>increased
</I>from 49.5 percent to 62.5 percent (Newt Gingrich, call your
office!)<B>.</B> 
<P>
In foreign policy, those agreeing to send the American military
to foreign trouble spots increased from 20.8 percent to 37.7 percent.
And those who expressed overall disagreement with an isolationist
foreign policy rose from 33.7 percent to 47.8 percent.
<P>
Yet, despite Fishkin's early predictions of change, other views
remained rock solid after &quot;deliberation.&quot; For example,
both before and after polling showed more than 80 percent of the
delegates believe that the economy can function only if businesses
make good profits; 68 percent think that the traditional family
has suffered a breakdown; 72.8 percent held that the post-Cold
War U.S. should shift resources from military to domestic needs;
68 percent continued to believe prayer in school would be somewhat
useful or very useful; 88 percent held that moral education in
the schools would be somewhat or very useful.
<P>
In short, the results were vague and confusing. While the delegates
desires seem quite predictable, the results undermined Fishkin's
own prophecy that delegates would be better able to make &quot;hard
choices&quot; after the &quot;deliberative process.&quot; Americans,
as one might expect, wished to have their cake and eat it, too,
even in his &quot;deliberative poll.&quot;
<P>
Nevertheless, Fishkin told reporters that the process of deliberation
helped Convention participants to act &quot;more like ideal citizens,&quot;
giving their judgments what he called a &quot;recommending force.&quot;
He argued,&quot;These people become representative of what the
country could come to if people were more engaged in the issues.
It is meant to be a poll with a human face. The real power of
this event is in the voice of the people.&quot;
<P>
Fishkin said he hoped the occasion would be a prototype for future
citizen gatherings. Yet newspaper accounts of the Convention's
actual procedures have cast doubt on such expectations. According
to <I>Washington Post </I>reporter John Yang, factual errors were
often not even corrected in the moderated group discussions. This
has led some to wonder how the &quot;deliberative process&quot;
was different from an ordinary barroom or dorm room &quot;bull
session.&quot;
<P>
Fishkin responded to the observation that delegates were sharing
ignorance by asserting, &quot;We were terribly concerned that
moderators might intrude their own views by giving facts to citizens.
So the moderators had to sit back. It was not their role to correct
them. Other citizens might. In the real world, when you are engaged
in political discussions, you might not have your facts exactly
right. The point was that people were not meant to make a political
judgement.&quot;
<P>
Similarly, the claim to rational deliberation has been undermined
by participants who reported emotional interchanges in group meetings.
One moderator explained, &quot;Emotion is very much a part of
it. There were many emotional moments in our conversation. I keep
coming back to the welfare mother in our group who got $10.90
twice a month from child support from the father of three of her
five children. There were times where there were tears in the
room, too. I think the level of emotion came from how close we
felt to each other.&quot;
<P>
When asked about the crying jags, Fishkin said, &quot;There's
emotion involved in the way people make judgements, can't take
it out completely, value judgements take emotion as well.&quot;
Yet Fishkin had earlier said the value of &quot;deliberation&quot;
was its rationality, not arousal of feelings.
<P>
Finally, the presidential candidates continued to make stump speeches
and hurl soundbites. No improvement there. Vice President Al Gore,
for instance, violently attacked the flat tax, calling it &quot;a
huge tax cut on those who are most able to pay, and a huge tax
increase on those who are least able to pay.&quot;
<P>
During his session Gore even resorted to an audience &quot;show
of hands&quot; to ratify his opinions, which Jim Lehrer did not
stop, simply saying, &quot;You're the Vice President.&quot;
<P>
One might also question whether the 459 Convention delegates were
truly representative of the American public. They were meant to
be a random sample of citizens by age, race, sex, region, marital
status, and voting history. But were they?
<P>
Former CBS News polling director Warren Mitofsky asserted that
such a small, and effectively self-selective sample, could not
represent the public: &quot;It's not deliberative, and it's not
a poll.&quot; Andrew Kohut, former director of the Times Mirror
polling center and an advisor to the project concurred, &quot;It's
not a poll.&quot;
<P>
Even non-experts could question the delegate sample: a mere seven
percent of the group earned $40,000 $49,000; 18 percent listed
&quot;Other&quot; as religion, rather than Protestant, Catholic
or Jew, and 12 percent listed &quot;None.&quot; Young people seemed
to outweigh the elderly: only 9 per cent were aged 6069, 12 per
cent aged 5059, and 21 percent aged 4049. NORC could not provide
a breakdown by occupation, and it did not provide statistics giving
comparable U.S. averages for age and occupation.
<P>
<I><B>DEVELOPING &quot;THE KETTERING TECHNIQUE&quot;</B></I> 
<P>
So what were the foundations get
ting for their money, if not a poll? <BR>
On its face, the Convention appears to have provided a pleasant
and perhaps edifying vacation for some four hundred Americans,
air-time for some Presidential candidates, a moment of celebrity
for Professor Fishkin, and stupefying boredom for anyone mistaken
enough to have watched the PBS coverage.
<P>
A closer look at the organizations and individuals supporting
the Convention provides clues to the real agenda and issues at
stake. <B> </B>Materials published in support of the Convention
suggest that the issues raised in the televised &quot;deliberative
poll&quot; owe less to the real concerns of the American people
or even the professional interests of<B> </B>Professor Fishkin
than to the long-standing interests of the Charles F. Kettering
Foundation. Under the direction of its president, David Mathews,
the Foundation has developed and promoted its ideas on &quot;encouraging
deliberation.&quot; It may well be that what Fishkin calls the
&quot;voice of the people&quot; is actually the &quot;Voice of
Kettering.&quot;
<P>
Fishkin's deliberative polling techniques are not unlike those
used by the National Issues Forums which the Kettering Foundation
has sponsored since 1981. (The one major difference is Fishkin's
selection of the Convention's participants by random sample rather
than by pure selfselection.) Moreover, both the National Issues
Convention and the National Issues Forums use materials on public
affairs prepared by the Public Agenda Foundation. Both also rely
on intensive small group discussions with moderators and use participant
polling<B> </B>before and after group discussions.
<P>
The Kettering Foundation was established in 1927 by Charles F.
Kettering, inventor of the automatic starter and the Delco generator.
A private operating foundation headquartered in Dayton, Ohio,
with offices in Washington, DC and New York City, Kettering maintains
a staff of twenty-five full-time professionals and about as many
support personnel. Kettering says it does not make grants, although
its grants are clearly reported on the IRS forms of the Public
Agenda Foundation. Nor does it publish an annual report. It reported
spending almost $8 million dollars in 1992. Kettering is ostensibly
non-partisan, and the roster of board members includes several
corporate executives and Republican Congressman Jim Leach of Iowa.
<P>
A recent brochure summarizes the Foundation's mission and methods:
&quot;Kettering treats politics in its broadest sense: politics
as a dimension of everyday life rather than only what officeholders
and governments do. The research is done for practical purposes;
it goes into crafting `tools' (study guides, community worksbooks,
and other exercises) that help a public act responsibly and effectively
on its problems.&quot; The Foundation reports that these materials
are used by a network of over 6,000 civic and educational organizations,
ranging from literacy groups to religious groups and neighborhood
associations.
<P>
Kettering's interest in reshaping the deliberative process can
be traced back to the early 1960s<B> </B>during the Cold War.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->At that time, the
foundation was a supporter of the Dartmouth Conference, a project
of <I>Saturday Review</I> editor Norman Cousins, a Kettering board
member. The Conference's mission was to ease U.S.-Soviet tensions
by promoting East-West &quot;understanding.&quot; It did this
by<B> </B>sponsoring &quot;face-to-face&quot; meetings between
selected Soviet and American citizens.
<P>
The concept of promoting personal encounters between people of
different backgrounds to talk about politics was established in
this dubious context. From the first Dartmouth meeting in 1960
through subsequent international affairs programs in the Soviet
Union and China in the late 1980s, Kettering has always taken
a keen interest in promoting discussion processes &quot;designed
for situations where traditional negotiation and mediation are
of limited usefulness.&quot;
<P>
At home, Kettering's support for the Domestic Policy Association,
the original sponsor of what became the National Issues Forum,
had a similar aim. Other Kettering projects have included the
Community Foundations Network, which links local foundations with
one another; Youth At Risk Forums and Classroom Forums, held in
cooperation with schools and colleges; the Humanities Project,
done in collaboration with libraries and educators; the Civil
Society Exchange, to smooth international relations in the way
of the Dartmouth Conference; Public Journalism seminars, and the
Public Voice PBS program, sort of stripped-down versions of the
National Issues Convention. All share the same premise that &quot;public
talk fosters knowledge, deliberation, and reason qualitatively
superior to narrowly focused and particularized points of view...&quot;
<P>
One 1987 project was described in the Kettering newsletter thus:
&quot;prisoners at the Westville Correctional Center in northern
Indiana have taken on a new role: that of public policy experts
on farm, immigration, and crime issues.&quot; This event was repeated
at a number of other prisons.
<P>
Clearly, the National Issues Convention was a logical outgrowth
of these Kettering activities. They have been described as &quot;deeply
interdependent&quot; and &quot;mutually reinforcing&quot; by president
David Mathews. &quot;They fit together like one of those pyramids
of oranges in a supermarket,&quot; he wrote in <I>Connections</I>,
the Kettering newsletter.
<P>
<I><B>THE PEOPLE OF KETTERING</B></I> 
<P>
<B>DAVID MATHEWS </B>The president of Kettering, age 61, is a
political &quot;independent&quot; who was Secretary of Health,
Education, and Welfare in the Ford Administration from 1975-77,
then president of the University of Alabama. He joined Kettering
in 1981. Mathews whose salary of over $190,000 a year is more
than Bob Dole's, Phil Gramm's or Al Gore's<B> </B>is also a trustee
and member of the executive committee of the Public Agenda Foundation.
<P>
Mathew's foreword to a 1991 Kettering study, <I>Citizens and Politics:
A View from Main Street America</I> referred to &quot;the erosion
of political legitimacy&quot; which requires changes to &quot;the
basic conditions of political practice.&quot; Mathews expressed
concern over the public's distrust of politics and government,
but marvelled at its involvement in local community affairs. He
concluded, &quot;The real challenge is to get the formal political
system reattached to the politics that people practice in trying
to deal with local problems.&quot; Interestingly, the study was
conducted by Richard Harwood, a former staffer at the Public Agenda
Foundation.
<P>
In 1980, in the <I>Washington Post</I>, writer Walter Shapiro
described Mathews as &quot;...the best recent example of a cipher
in the cabinet. As one high ranking veteran of the Ford White
House put it, 'We sent Mathews to HEW and never heard from him
again. He used to show up at cabinet meetings every three or four
weeks but nobody was ever sure why...'&quot;
<P>
Mathews' one major venture into the headlines may have stimulated
his interest in &quot;deliberation.&quot; <I>The Swine Flue Affair:
Decision Making on a Slippery Slope</I>, a special report prepared
by Richard Neustadt for Joseph Califano, Mathews' successor at
HEW, concluded that<B> </B>Mathews played a central role in the
failure of<B> </B>a 1976 federal program against an epidemic which
never materialized, an enterprise which cost taxpayers $135 million,
left 12 people dead, and over 250 paralyzed.
<P>
On March 15, 1976, Mathews wrote OMB director James T. Lynn, &quot;There
is evidence there will be a major flu epidemic this fall...The
projections are that this virus will kill 1 million Americans
in 1976.&quot; In fact, the only deaths reported from swine flu
were those resulting from Mathews' vaccination program.
<P>
As detailed by<B> </B>Neustadt, the litany of Mathews' failures
in judgement included:
<UL>
<LI> &quot;overconfidence by specialists in theories spun from
meager evidence;&quot;
<LI> &quot;conviction fueled by a conjunction of some preexisting
personal agendas;&quot;
<LI> &quot;zeal by health professionals to which make their lay
superiors do right;&quot;
<LI> &quot;premature commitment to deciding more than had to be
decided;&quot;
<LI> &quot;failure to address uncertainties in such a way as to
prepare for reconsideration;&quot;
<LI> &quot;insufficient questioning of scientific logic and of
implementation prospects;&quot;
<LI> &quot;insensitivity to media relations and long term credibility
of institutions.&quot;
</UL>

<P>
Not surprisingly Mathews is also trustee of the Public Agenda
Foundation -- and a member of its executive committee. Kettering
gave over $1 million to the Public Agenda Foundation in 1992.
<P>
Some years earlier Mathews was an executive committee member for
a Public Agenda project, &quot;Public Summit,&quot; which challenged
Americans to engage in &quot;cooperative problem solving&quot;
with the Soviet Union.
<P>
<B>ROBERT KINGSTON </B>Fishkin worked closely with Kingston, editor
of <I>The Kettering Review</I>, to train moderators for two earlier
British public affairs telecasts based on his book and in preparing
subsequent procedures for the Convention.
<P>
Kingston, born a British subject, has considerable experience
in directing programs for public uplift. Like Mathews, he was
an official in the Ford administration. As a former acting chairman
of the National Endowment for the Humanities, he ran comparable
discussion groups on the 200th anniversary of the Declaration
of Independence. Later, Kingston headed the College Board, which
administers the national Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT). Kingston's
fee as a Kettering &quot;Associate&quot; was $132,431 in 1992.
<P>
<B>DIANE EISENBERG </B>Eisenberg, another Kettering &quot;Associate,&quot;
was the first to initiate discussions with Fishkin about the project
in 1991, in her work for the foundation's Washington, DC operation.
She is a classic &quot;educrat,&quot; former Washington representative
of the American Association of Community and Junior Colleges and
executive director of the Washington, DC<B> </B>Council for the
Advancement of Citizenship. Eisenberg was paid $94,011 by Kettering
in 1992.
<P>
<B>NOELLE McAFEE </B>Fishkin's assistant director for the National
Issues Convention and a graduate student in the department of
philosophy at the University of Texas, McAfee is also an editor
of <I>The Kettering Review </I>and has worked with Kettering for
eight years. In 1987 and 1988, she worked as an &quot;organizer&quot;
with &quot;Congress Watch,&quot; a project of the Naderite group
Public Citizen. At the time, Public Citizen was helping to organize
the vicious media and political campaign to defeat President Reagan's
nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court.
<P>
<B>KATHERINE FANNING </B>Fanning is chairman of the board of the
Kettering Foundation. She is former editor-in-chief of the <I>Christian
Science Monitor </I>and<I><B> </B></I>the mother of Frederick
W. (Ted) Field, a Hollywood movie producer and heir to the Marshall
Field family fortune worth an estimated $700 million. (According
to <I>The Los Angeles Times</I><B>, </B>Ted Field is the fifthlargest
donor to the Democratic Party, having personally contributed over
$1.2 million since 1986. Field explained his partisan generosity
this way: &quot;I consider the Religious Right in the Republican
Party to be very close to Nazism.&quot; He also owns the gangsterrap
label Interscope Records, which Sen. Bob Dole has criticized for
producing songs containing violent and offensive lyrics.)
<P>
In the late 1980s Fanning was a member of the PBS program policy
committee.<B> </B>Currently she sits<B> </B>on the board of the
Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, which has assets of over one
billion dollars. Out of annual grants exceeding $40 million, the
Mott Foundation contributed $300,000 to The Kettering Foundation
in 1993.
<P>
In the area of &quot;public affairs broadcasting,&quot; the Mott
Foundation has granted $70,000 to the Council on Foreign Relations
for a weekly NPR series on international issues and $49,450 to
the Tides Foundation of San Francisco to &quot;support the devlopment
of an eightpart series for public television and other forums
that will explore major American Issues.<B>&quot;</B> The Tides
Foundation's Institute for Global Communications helps provide
computer networking for PeaceNet, EcoNet and feminist groups,
among other political advocates.
<P>
The Mott Foundation has also contributed $500,000 to Independent
Sector, $290,000 to the Union Institute and $75,000 to the National
Council for Responsive Philanthropy, all liberal social policy
outifts which have well-developed networking strategies.
<P>
<I><B>&quot;DELIBERATION,&quot; BUT NO DEBATE</B></I><B> </B>
<P>
Key to the &quot;Kettering Technique&quot; is the sidestepping
of direct debate on specific issues, an emphasis on collective
decision-making by groups, and the goal of consensus.
<P>
Many of the Convention's discussion group moderators, some trained
by Kettering, others fulltime Kettering employees, had experience
in running earlier National Issues Forums.
<P>
Predominantly educators, they were told to begin each session
by distributing a preforum ballot to determine initial participant
attitudes. The &quot;ground rules&quot; begin with Rule Number
One in bold faced capital letters:
<P>
&quot;MAKE CLEAR THAT THE DISCUSSION WILL NOT BE A DEBATE. Stress
there is work to do, and that the work is to move toward making
a shared choice on a public policy issue. The work will be done
through deliberation.&quot;
<P>
Deliberation sounds suspiciously like group therapy. Among Kettering's
other guidelines are, &quot;Get beyond the initial positions people
hold to their deeper motivations...&quot; and &quot;WORK THROUGH
(emphasis in original) the conflicting emotions that arise when
various options pull and tug on what people consider valuable.&quot;
<P>
To avoid &quot;debate,&quot; it appears that genuine philosophical
and religious disagreements were deliberately sidestepped. For
instance, in the PBS broadcast, speakers from the liberal People
for the American Way and the conservative Concerned Women for
America said that they agreed in their support for &quot;family
values.&quot; By prohibiting debate, the Kettering &quot;rules
of engagement&quot; forced a phony verbal consensus.
<P>
Dr. Everett Carl Ladd, president of the Roper Center for Public
Opinion Research, has called Fishkin's method &quot;flawed science
and dubious democracy.&quot; As editor of the December 1995 issue
of the journal <I>The Public Perspective</I>, Ladd published a
series of essays raising objections to the National Issues Convention.
Scholars criticized the absence of a control group, selectivity
and bias in briefing materials, the likelihood that group dynamics
would affect individual perceptions in the polling sample, and
the danger that participants would attempt to please event organizers.
Far from promoting the ideal citizen<B>, </B>the Kettering Technique
appears to use controlled small groups to manipulate the individual's
perception of reality.
<P>
Before the event, Fishkin had replied that these are &quot;empirical
matters which the National Issues Convention will provide the
data to address. Let us get the data and see.&quot;
<P>
<I><B>INSIDE THE PUBLIC AGENDA FOUNDATION</B></I> 
<P>
Kettering relied on the Public Agenda Foundation to select the
topics for the delegates' reading and discussion. Founded in 1975
by pollster Daniel Yankelovich and Cyrus Vance, Jimmy Carter's
Secretary of State, the Public Agenda Foundation is a $3 million-dollar-a-year
operation based in New York City which conducts polls and focus
groups for foundations and corporate clients on a variety of issues.
It has also coordinated many of the issues used in &quot;public
journalism&quot; special issues of Knight-Ridder newspapers. One
paper, the <I>Tallahassee Democrat</I>, even called its series
&quot;The Public Agenda.&quot;
<P>
Public Agenda's 1992 annual budget was $3,319,158. Public Agenda
received a total of $1,197,475 in &quot;general support&quot;
from Kettering in 1992, as well as $400,000 from the Ford Foundation
and $100,00 each from Metropolitan Life, Baxter Healthcare, and
IBM. Union Carbide contributed $208,000, the Carnegie Corporation
$225,000, and the Markle Foundation $427,000.
<P>
The organization received grants of $10,000 from the New York
Times Company Foundation, $150,000 from the Edna McConnell Clark
Foundation, $250,000 from the Bohen Foundation, $50,000 from the
Ford Foundation, $16,000 from the Markle Foundation, $7,500 from
General Mills, $5,000 from Ford Motor Company, and $149,000 from
the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to study the priorities
of American &quot;opinion leaders.&quot; The research was used
to make programming decisions for PBS.
<P>
The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation gave Public Agenda $250,000
in 1992<B> </B>to prepare materials for small group discussions
and polling on health care options.
<P>
Public Agenda's &quot;policy review board&quot; provides further
evidence of its private issues agenda. It has included John W.
Gardner, Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare in the Johnson
Administration and founder of Common Cause; Newton Minow, co-chair
of the advisory board for the National Issues Convention; economist
Lester Thurow, a panelist on the Convention broadcast; D.C. delegate
Eleanor Holmes Norton; Children's Defense Fund founder Marian
Wright Edelman and CDF then-chair Donna Shalala, and David Mathews.
<P>
Retired Admiral Bobby Inman (a Public Agenda trustee), Elliott
Richardson, and George Romney are about as conservative as the
list gets.
<P>
Public Agenda has prepared background materials and conducted
polling for Kettering's National Issues Forums since 1981.
<P>
Even earlier, it prepared the 1976 presidential debate briefing
books for Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford on three issues: foreign
policy, inflation and employment, and moral leadership.
<P>
For the Convention, Public Agenda did not restrict itself to the
most-talked-about issues. According to a tabloid distributed to
delegates, the Foundation chose to include issues &quot;that citizens
are having a hard time sorting out for themselves.&quot; Public
Agenda and the Kettering Foundation<B> </B>selected three major
themes for discussion by Convention participants: &quot;Mission
Uncertain: Reassessing America's Global Role,&quot; &quot;Pocketbook
Pressures: What Should Be Done About Them?&quot; and &quot;The
Troubled American Family: Which Way Out of the Storm?&quot;
<P>
Public Agenda selected issues that it thought the public ought
to care about. But it managed to avoid the debate over education
choice and Goals 2000, the death penalty, &quot;three-strikes
and you're out&quot; crime legislation, drug policy, or, House
Speaker Newt Gingrich's favorite, the information revolution and
the economic potential of cyberspace. Instead, Public Agenda focused
on America's place in the world and on arguments over the cause
of the wage-gap in the current economy.
<P>
The National Opinion Research Center (NORC) received $500,000
for its polling work. According to Warren Mitofsky, this was more
than ten times what CBS would pay for an election-year opinion
poll. But the questions NORC asked were based on materials provided
by Kettering and Public Agenda<B>. </B>In response to a call from
Capital Research Center, a NORC spokesman confirmed that its questions
were developed in consultation with the two foundations in addition
to Fishkin. NORC's representative said that it often works from
a list of client questions when it is on contract.
<P>
<I><B>HOW SPECIAL INTERESTS DEFINED THE &quot;PUBLIC AGENDA&quot;
</B></I>
<P>
If the Austin agenda was not set by the participants themselves,
where did Public Agenda get its priorities? The answer, of course,
is that the &quot;deliberative&quot; conclusions of Fishkin's
prototype &quot;ideal citizens&quot; are mere surrogates for the
conventional wisdom of the government and foundation liberal elites
who line the Northeast corridor.
<P>
For, after being concocted by the Kettering and Public Agenda
foundations, the Convention's issues were reviewed and approved
by a distinguished advisory board of ex-officeholders and lobbyists,
many of whose current clients include government-dependent special
interests.
<P>
Calling the advisory board's cochairs &quot;the voice of the people&quot;
with a straight face would be a stretch. They included former
United States Representative Bill Frenzel, a fellow at the Brookings
Institution; Newton Minow, remembered for calling television a
&quot;vast wasteland&quot; several decades ago, but since then
a director of CBS and an attorney at the Chicagobased Sidley and
Austin law firm who sits on corporate and foundation boards; and
super-lobbyist Charles E. Walker, nemesis of the capital gains
tax. At one time Walker's firm reportedly had 129 lobbying clients
registered with the clerk of the House of Representatives.
<P>
Other board members included former Senator David Boren (D-OK),
president of the University of Oklahoma, a federal grant recipient;
former Representative William Gray (D-PA), who heads the United
Negro College Fund; and erstwhile liberal Bill Galston, who was
President Clinton's domestic policy czar.
<P>
No wonder the role of government was the overriding concern of
the National Issues Convention. If the delegates had known more
about the backgrounds and interests of those advising their meeting,
they might have reconsidered its basic assumptions.
<P>
<I><B>THE PEOPLE OF PUBLIC AGENDA</B></I> 
<P>
Also revealing are the interests of Cyrus Vance and Daniel Yankelovich,
co-founders of the Public Agenda Foundation, whose board of directors
lists Judith Davidson Moyers, wife of PBS ominipresence Bill Moyers.
<P>
Department store mogul Maurice Lazarus is chairman of the executive
committee. Other trustees include Adm. Bobby R. Inman (Ret.),
Ann McLaughlin, former Secretary of Labor in the Reagan administration,
businessman Sidney Harman, and William T. Coleman, Jr., from Secretary
of State Warren Christopher's law firm, O'Melveny and Meyers.
Frank Stanton, former CBS president, is a member emeritus.
<P>
<B>CYRUS VANCE</B>, the chairman of the board, is a quintessential
establishmentarian. He is a director of The New York Times Company,
a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and a director
of the liberal nonprofit Center for National Policy, formerly
headed by UN ambassador Madeline Albright and chaired by Vance's
successor at State, Edmund S. Muskie.
<P>
Last year Vance was hired by<B> </B>Archer Daniels Midland to
defend the agribusiness giant against federal charges of price-fixing
in its sales of high-fructose corn syrup. Vance also reportedly
donated $1,000 to President Clinton's legal defense fund.
<P>
1992<B> </B>political contributions by Vance include $250 to Senator
Arlen Specter, $250 to Geraldine Ferraro's 1992 Senate bid, two
$1,000 contributions to the Democratic National Committee, $450
to Rep<B>. </B>Les Aspin and $1,000 to the Clinton for President
Committee. In 1994, he gave $1,000 to Senator John Chafee, $1,000
to the Democrats' Senate Victory '94, $1,750 to Senator Daniel
Moynihan, and $250 to Tennessee's Jim Cooper.
<P>
<B>DANIEL YANKELOVICH</B>, Public Agenda's president, is chairman
of DYG, Inc., a private polling company. He also sits on the board
of directors of the Kettering Foundation, which pays him $12,000
in annual compensation. Yankelovich has served on the board of
the Loral Corporation, a defense contractor with annual revenues
of over $1 billion; and he is on the boards of directors of telecommunications
giant US West and the Meredith Corporation, a media giant whose
$790 million in annual revenues derives from publishing magazines
like <I>Better Homes and Gardens</I>, broadcasting, real estate,
and franchising.
<P>
Yankelovich contributed $500 in 1998 to Les Aspin, $1,000 in 1992
to Jane Harman, a liberal California Democratic candidate for
Congress, and $500 again to Harman in 1994. Harman's husband,
Sidney, is on the board of directors of the Public Agenda Foundation,
as noted earlier.
<P>
In a 1995 article in<B> </B><I>Mother Jones</I>, &quot;Restoring
Public Trust,&quot; Yankelovich urges liberals to recover their
moral authority by &quot;internalizing the public's point of view&quot;
in order to better change public perceptions of the liberal agenda.
This tactic follows the model used by the Convention.
<P>
<I><B>SPREADING THE `KETTERING TECHNIQUE'</B></I> 
<P>
While a breakdown of revenue sources was not available at press
time,<B> </B>the National Issues Convention received considerable
support from a range of interests. The Kettering and Public Agenda
connections and<B> </B>the fundraising skills of lobbyist Charls
E. Walker helped attract financial and in-kind support from private
corporations like American Airlines, Freddie Mac and Southwestern
Bell; from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, a United Parcel Servicebased
philanthropy; and from public sector institutions like PBS, the
LBJ presidential library, the city of Austin, and the University
of Texas. They supplemented the initial in-kind support for the
project from the Charles F. Kettering Foundation, whose research
and materials were the basis of the &quot;deliberation.&quot;
<P>
Who benefitted? The noted historian Daniel Boorstin has provided
a way to understand the significance of the National Issues Convention.
In his 1987 study, <I>The Image</I>, Boorstin observed that modern
society has created a new public phenomenon. It is situated between
real events, which are the subject of history, and staged propaganda,
which substitutes lies for truth. Boorstin called it the &quot;pseudo-event.&quot;<B>
</B>It would provide &quot;..synthetic facts which move people
indirectly, by providing the `factual' basis on which they are
supposed to make up their minds.&quot;
<P>
The first targets of those who organize pseudo-events are fact-hungry
journalists, and it is they who have most to lose from programs
like the National Issues Convention and further applications of
the &quot;deliberative poll.&quot; Similarly, &quot;public journalism&quot;
projects imperil the credibility of the American media which may
end up serving as propagandists for the agenda of grantmaking
foundations.
<P>
But as for most American citizens? They probably have much less
to fear.<B> </B>Would the Convention delegates act on their &quot;deliberations&quot;
when they returned to their homes?
<P>
Or is it not more likely that they will consult their real principles,
life experiences, and interests once liberated from the enforced
group-think of the &quot;Kettering Technique?&quot;<HR>

<h2>PBS's &quot;Democracy Project&quot; : Is It Really The Democrat
Project?</h2>
<I>Although they profess impartiality,a look at the list of
key personnel in PBS's &quot;Democracy Project&quot; reveals a

<h2>National Issues Convention Sponsors Show A Liberal Bent</h2>
<P>
<I>Although the Kettering Foundation was not listed as a sponsor
in the on-air television credits (a Kettering spokesman preferred
the term &quot;collaborator&quot;), the PBS broadcast noted three
&quot;underwriters.&quot; They were the <B>Annie E. Casey Foundation,
Freddie Mac</B>, and<B> Southwestern Bell</B>. </I>
<P>
Robert V. Pambianco recently characterized the <B>Annie E. Casey
Foundation</B> -- a United Parcel Servicebased philanthropy whose
board contains current and retired UPS executives -- as a &quot;progressive
philanthropy&quot; which &quot;rarely strays from the liberal
social agenda&quot; (see CRC's<I> Organization Trends</I>, December
1995). Grants included: $200,000 to the Children's Defense Fund,
formerly chaired by First Lady Hillary Clinton; $5.1 million for
Sustainable Milwaukee, &quot;nothing more than a creation of the
radical left&quot;; and $252,00 to HandsNet, &quot;a conduit for
political information aimed at mobilizing activists.&quot;
<P>
Austin Fulk and Stuart Nolan analyzed the donations of <B>Freddie
Mac </B>and <B>Southwestern Bell</B> (in CRC's <I>Patterns of
Corporate Philanthropy IX</I>, 1996) and scored giving on a scale
of 1 to 8 from left to right.
<P>
<B>Freddie Mac</B>'s gifts included $129,800 to the Children's
Defense Fund, $25,000 to Planned Parenthood, and $10,000 to the
Center for Population Options. Its score was 2.55 and its giving
pattern &quot;Liberal.&quot;
<P>
<B>Southwestern Bell</B> gave $45,000 to NAACP chapters and $25,000
to the Public Agenda Foundation. The phone company's score was
3.52 and giving pattern analyzed as &quot;Center-Left.&quot;<HR>

<h2>Ridings New President of Council on Foundations</h2>
<P>
Dorothy S. Ridings was appointed president of the Council on Foundations
on February 5th. President of the League of Women Voters from
1982 to 1986, Ridings has been publisher of Florida's <I>Bradenton
Herald</I> since 1988, and an executive with Knight-Ridder. Ridings
is a trustee of the Ford and Benton foundations, an advisor to
the Knight and the Mary Reynolds Babcock foundations, and active

<center><h2>
Why Is New York Times Columnist Maureen Dowd Driving the White House Crazy?
</h2></center>
<img src="/crc/images/cw-0796.gif" ALIGN = "left">
<p>
Maureen Dowd is the iconoclast of The 
	New York Times. She is known for her 
	feisty and cutting accounts of life in 
	Washington, especially her tart ridicule of the antics of the current occupants of the White House. This has made her public enemy number one for President Clinton's supporters in the press. James Fallows, a Carter speechwriter and Clinton appointee, blasted Dowd in his book Breaking the News, objecting to this opening sentence from a June, 1994 news story: "President Clinton returned today from a sentimental journey to the university where he didn't inhale, didn't get drafted and didn't get a degree." Fallows said the columnist's caustic style "aggravates today's prevailing despair and cynicism about public life." Following his lead, Dowd was lambasted as a "fifties sweater girl" in The Nation by feminist Susan Faludi and charged with "making mischief" in The New Yorker by James Woollcott.
<p>
Dowd is so radioactive at the White 
	House that when press secretary 
	Michael McCurry accidentally found 
	himself joking about her writing before a briefing on terrorism, he begged assembled reporters, "Isolate the 'I agree with Maureen Dowd' part, guys." One reason Dowd is unpopular -- and pointedly not invited to state dinners at the White House -- is her savage criticism of the First Couple.  In a column headed "The State of the Fish," she describes Hillary Clinton's memories of working in an Alaskan seafood processing plant during summer vacation, and quotes the First Lady's description of fish as "purple and black and yucky looking." Comparing the fish to Mrs. Clinton's professional and business record, Dowd concludes: "If anybody notices something yucky about her financial and political entrails they are supposed to trust that she is working for the greater good... As she must remember, the fish rots from the head down.'" 
<p>	
Dowd was not always a political pundit. But she 
		is no stranger to controversy. During the 
		Reagan years, she created a stir with a page one story drawing on Kitty Kelley's biography of Nancy Reagan -- reportedly assigned by an editor who received an advance copy of the book from Kelley's agent, Kathy Robbins, who asked that the naughty bits be rushed into print. After her editors placed the story on the front page,  Dowd was chewed out by then executive editor Max Frankel, who felt the gossip was unfit to print.  Only the intervention of Joseph Lelyveld (Frankel's successor as executive editor) persuaded Dowd, practically in tears, to stay on the job. It was good for the paper that she did. Dowd was made White House correspondent in 1988 and nominated for a Pulitzer prize in 1992. In 1994 Times columnist Anna Quindlen presented her with a Matrix Award from New York Women in Communications. Within a year, Quindlen would resign her job, and Dowd took over the position of resident essayist for the woman's point of view. 
<p>
Compared by some to Maureen O'Hara, Dowd
		drives a zippy Mazda Miata convertible, and 
		remains loyal to her Hibernian roots, praising President Clinton when he visited Ireland, and writing in her column about lunching at "The Irish Times" pub on Capitol Hill with The New Yorker writer Michael Kelly, newly named editor of  The New Republic . Dowd was squired around town by Crossfire's Michael Kinsley before he departed for Seattle, Vanity Fair reported. But she is intensely private, and little is known about her personal life. Only once has Dowd been victimized by the tabloid press, in revenge for columns satirizing Barney's,  the New York temple of fashion intimidation. A practical joker pretending to be her stormed into the store  and demanded a discount -- resulting in a Page Six story in The New York Post headlined "Dowd in dither over discount denial."  Dowd fought back in print in The Times.  Her alibi: She was in Washington interviewing Senator Strom Thurmond at the time of the alleged incident. Thurmond graciously confirmed her account, and later the prank was revealed to be a hoax by Spy magazine. No wonder she prefers maintaining a Woman of the Year pose as a "woman of mystery." 
<p>
Darling of her paper's editors and publishers, 
		Dowd is also respected by her peers. Liberal 
		Times columnist Frank Rich worked with her covering the 1992 political conventions. Rich, then Times drama critic, told Culture Watch, "It was great fun, and I had the time of my life working with Maureen," who was the paper's White House correspondent. They were good friends then and are good friends now, he says. Dowd's writings are widely read and quoted in Washington, whether she is chastising "Bill Clinton's style of casuistry and prevarication," conjuring up a debate between  Elizabeth ("Sugar Lips") Dole and Hillary ("Sister Frigidaire") Clinton, or noting how "novelistically interesting" Bob Dole's candidacy has become, dubbing him "the candidate of not." Dowd commented, "If we voted on the basis of overcoming adversity, Bob Dole would win easily. But we want to know where he's going as much as where he came from." Against the Kansas Republican's primary opponent, she argued that "you don't have to be anti-Catholic to be anti-Buchanan," citing William Bennett and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, but also pointed out that she and Pat Buchanan are "two peas in a pod," Irish-American journalists from northwest Washington. Dowd revealed that her mother asked her not to be mean to Dole's rival for the Republican nomination because "he's one of us."  Another column tagged President Clinton "the man from Hot Springs, the old hangout of gamblers and roues where he grew up...the golden boy who leaves his messes behind for others to clean up, sliding out of predicaments that would be fatal to less nimble pols. " A keen observer of America's hurly-burly, she punctured the hype around the tragic flight of seven-year-old Jessica Dubroff by simply saying, "Why didn't we all just get up and begin screaming: THIS IS CRAZY?" So influential is Dowd's writing that Fallows notes she "has found herself cited in almost every article about excess cynicism in the press."
<p>
Not bad for a working-class Irish-American girl, 
		born in 1952 to Michael Dowd, a District of 
		Columbia police inspector whose duties included assignments on Capitol Hill. A good student, Dowd is remembered fondly by her senior year homeroom teacher at Immaculata High School, class of 1969. "She was outstanding," Sister Petra (S.P.) told Culture Watch, "and very promising."  Dowd earned  her English literature degree from Catholic University, and began her career in journalism at the age of twenty-two at the dictation desk of the now-defunct Washington Star.  She patiently paid her dues for almost a decade, writing obituaries and weather stories, writing her way onto the sports pages (then written by guys for guys) and  the paper's city desk and "Portfolio" section, which competed with The Washington Post's "Style" section in covering society and fashion. Dowd was loyal and stayed on even as other staffers migrated elsewhere during the paper's final days. After the Star closed, Dowd was hired by Time magazine, which moved her to New York in 1983. She joined the metropolitan section of The New York Times a few months later, then transferred to the Washington bureau in 1986, where ever since she has delighted readers with her caustic observations on politics and politicians. Now the focus of celebrity gossip in the national press, Dowd's every word echoes in the corridors of power. She is definitely unpredictable as a writer, calling herself a "pathological truthteller." Her motto remains: "No one is safe."

<H2>Why did a nice young composer <br>like Frederick Stocken<br> become the British musical establishment's<br> hated heckler?</H2>

<a href="#lament">Lament for Bosnia went to the top of the charts...</a><br>
<a href="#irk">In March, 1994, irked at the realization...</a><br>
<a href="#press">The press was not nice to Stocken.</a><br>
<a href="#future">What does the future hold?</a><br>
<p>
Frederick Stocken calls himself "Britain's most backward-looking composer."  Born in 1967, Organ Scholar at Cambridge University's St. Catherine's College and a graduate of Chetham's School of 
Music, the prize-winning Fellow of the Royal College of Organists is a composer of  organ works, songs, 
wood quintets, string quartets, an oratorio, and a violin concerto.  Stocken is best-known for his lush string 
composition Lament for Bosnia (Chatsworth CD, 1993).  A private commission by wealthy English arts 
patron Todd Longstaffe-Gowan, the piece was recorded by The Strings of the New Queen's Hall Orchestra 
under the direction of John Lubbock, using gut strings instead of metal to allow for a greater warmth of 
tone. The recording session took place at EMI's  Abbey Road studios made famous by The Beatles. 
<p>
Soon he was dubbed "one of the most promising talents of his generation" by Malcolm Williamson, Master of the Queen's Musick. Williamson said of Stocken's composition, "As music becomes more 
complex and unintelligible, it is refreshing to find a composer who is producing music which is clear, 
profound, free-flowing, and superbly composed."  Stocken said that he composed the Lament "not only for 
artistic reasons, but also to raise money for the victims." Stocken and his publisher had arranged for a 
portion of the sales to go directly to "Feed the Children," a British charity which has been aiding refugee 
families in the former Yugoslavia since 1992. In this effort, Stocken combined a commitment to traditional 
British romanticism in the manner of Ralph Vaughn Williams with his own personal belief in private 
charity and private support for the arts. The Evening Standard praised Stocken fulsomely, declaring,  "At 
last a young English composer has chosen to write accessible, beautiful music which is unashamedly 
passionate and melodic."  The Spectator music critic declared, "It is music which makes me believe that a 
new Sibelius or a new Elgar has been born. Try it."
<P>
<a name="lament"></a>
<CENTER><H3>Lament for Bosnia went to the top of the charts... </H3></CENTER>
on a double bill with Samuel Barber's Adagio for String Orchestra, and the set became the number one best selling CD in London's Tower Records by early 1994. Shortly 
thereafter, Stocken began work on a violin concerto, which he planned to dedicate to Margaret Thatcher.  
But there were some clouds on Stocken's horizon. Stocken had discovered composers who wrote 
hummable melodies are black-balled by the British musical establishment. He learned this lesson the hard 
way, after he was rejected by the Royal Academy of Music with the comment: "We do not use key 
signatures here at the Academy." Stocken later acidly retorted such a remark was "equivalent to being 
turned down by an art college with the comment: 'We do not use perspective here at the Slade.'"Denied 
acceptance by the official guardians of his chosen field, Stocken plotted his next move.
<P>
<a name="irk"></a>
<CENTER><H3>In March, 1994, irked at the realization...</H3></CENTER>
that the very musical competitors  who had black-balled him enjoyed substantial taxpayer subsidies through the BBC and the Arts Council for what he considered atonal "modernist plink-plonk," 
Stocken placed a classified advertisement in The Spectator. It gave his home telephone number and read: 
"THE HECKLERS: Too afraid to boo at Modern Music? Join The Hecklers and provoke change." The 
target was an April 14, 1996 performance of Sir Harrison Birtwistle's 1989 opera Gawain. Birtwistle is the 
most prominent living composer in Britain, knighted by the Queen and recipient of an estimated $350,000 
in annual support from British institutions. <p>
Stocken took on this pillar of the musical establishment directly, 
declaring his compositional efforts to be "sonic sewage." Stocken then published a manifesto in The 
Evening Standard announcing "this evening, The Hecklers will rise to their feet, a militia for melody" as 
Birtwistle's opera Gawain "squeaks and splutters to a close at the Royal Opera House."  The event, Stocken 
told Culture Watch, "was a very feeble protest." With about two dozen colleagues, he politely waited until 
the performance had ended, stood up, and booed. The small group of protesters sitting in the top balcony 
were overwhelmed by the standing ovation the opera received from the cream of British society in the 
stalls, the cheering led by no less a personage than the chairman of the British Arts Council himself, Lord 
Gowrie.
<P>
<a name="press"></a>
<CENTER><H3>The press was not nice to Stocken. </H3></CENTER>
He was damned as a "Thatcherite," called a "self-appointed cultural policeman," 
and his group labelled "a group of young fogeys" by Classical Music, which 
concluded in an editorial that "Mr. Stocken and his bunch of halitosis-ridden hoorays are not the first [to 
protest concerts]...it was very popular with the Nazis." On May 2nd The Times condemned Stocken and his 
Hecklers as "The Red Guards of Taste" and declared "Sir Harrison...is the finest modern British composer, 
some would say of all time..." Stocken's support was slight:  a column by Miranda Jackson in Classical 
Music, an elliptical comment by Prince Charles in favor of melody, an editorial in the Journal of the 
Institute of Economic Affairs, and an article in the Sydney Morning Herald pointing out that Australians 
know that Italians boo opera all the time were all he could show in his defense. Perhaps wary of a 
controversy on unfamiliar terrain, Thatcher declined to attend the upcoming premiere of her concerto and 
Stocken has removed her name. (However,  Minister for National Heritage Virginia Bottomley will attend.) 
<p>
Yet despite the establishment's disapproval, Stocken's protest has struck a chord with the music-going 
public. British concertgoers now boo modernist performances. In August, 1995 they booed Birtwistle's 
Panic when the BBC orchestra performed it at the Proms in Royal Albert Hall. Just this April, they booed a 
modernist staging of Verdi's Nabucco -- portraying the Babylonian captivity in Auschwitz -- at the Royal 
Opera House, an incident reported on the front page of The Times. Stocken did not in attend. Instead he 
was at work on a new composition, a Mass. Stocken recently converted to Roman Catholicism at the 
Brompton Oratory where his Mass will be performed. Stocken says he wishes to dedicate his music "to the 
service of the Church" and to private patrons.  
<P>
<a name="future"></a>
<CENTER><H3>What does the future hold?</H3></CENTER>
As Washington Post music critic Tim Page told Culture Watch when asked about the Birtwistle vs. Stocken debate, "If this guy just manages to stick 
around, he'll probably be one of the old fogeys himself, someday."

<a name="intro"></a>
<P>
<br>
When voters rejected George Bush in 1992, liberal commentators and the press argued that the Administration's economic policies were only partly to blame.  They claimed that conservatives cost Bush the presidency by debating social issues and family values.  Partisan liberals went further, concluding that the public had repudiated an entire decade of greed.  All believed that Bill Clinton successfully campaigned as an agent of change.
<P>
	Since the election, Clinton has abandoned most of his &quot;New Democrat&quot; rhetoric and has promoted traditionally liberal policies.  The public feels increasingly uneasy about the nation's direction and the durability of the social fabric.  Why has the President failed to inspire?  The answer is simple.  Americans see all about them the continuing moral and cultural distintegration that accompanies expanding social welfare programs.  They want changes more profound than government programs; they want an end to the something-for-nothing mentality that passes for public participation in the modern welfare state.
<P>
	During the past thirty years nonprofit public affairs and advocacy groups have claimed to speak for the American public.  Concentrated in the nation's capital and proliferating as the federal government identifies ever more problems as its responsibility, these groups have become the idea factories and advertising agencies of public policy debate.  At key points in what Washington euphemistically calls &quot;the policy process&quot; advocacy groups become very influential.  By providing information and useful arguments to policymakers, the media and the public, they affect political outcomes.  When they advocate policies in &quot;the public interest,&quot; public affairs groups influence whether government will afford its citizens opportunities or whether it will distribute entitlements.  In the case of Randall Robinson's TransAfrica, an advocacy group can even affect whether America chooses to go to war.  Corporate contributions to nonprofit advocacy organizations implicitly acknowledge their importance.  But corporations have failed to understand how they operate or what they really want.  
<P>
	For eight years Capital Research Center has tracked corporate giving to nonprofit public affairs groups.  Regrettably, Corporate America continues to fund groups that advocate welfare state policies.  Corporate philanthropy too often supports interest groups that denigrate market incentives and economic growth.  Whatever their motivation, corporate managements are contributing stockowner funds to groups that obstruct genuine economic, social and political reforms that can renew America's traditions of limited government, a free market, and respect for individual rights and responsibilities.
<P>
	Public debate over the health care &quot;crisis&quot; offers a telling example of how advocacy groups use corporate dollars.  For decades advocacy groups and think tanks championed health care policy ideas that can be found in the plan devised by Hillary Clinton's health care task force.  The Administration's plan for &quot;universal coverage&quot; through regional health care &quot;alliances&quot; and its rhetorical emphasis on &quot;managed competition&quot; can be traced to a variety of nongovernmental sources: from the Progressive Policy Institute, a project of the the Democratic Leadership Council (which Gov. Bill Clinton once chaired) to the Children's Defense Fund (which Hillary Clinton once chaired).  Planned Parenthood joined the coalition for universal coverage on condition that it include taxpayer-funded abortions on demand.  As the entries in this study indicate, these advocacy organizations received financial support from major American corporations.  How many of the companies funding them would eventually spend far more to fight the Administration's 1342 page health insurance bill? 
<P>
	Nonprofit advocacy groups cannot market their ideas without money.  They depend on tax-deductible contributions from individual donors sympathetic to their aims, grant-giving foundations, and corporations.  But the financial contribution of a large corporation, even a modest donation, has one added benefit.  Corporate money can obscure the radical economic or political agenda of an advocacy group, giving it an unearned credibility with otherwise cautious individual donors.  Indeed, corporate funding can help a nonprofit increase its budget exponentially, opening doors to other corporate and foundation donors and to government grants.
<P>
	It is clear that too many corporate executives just don't get it.  The trends in corporate philanthropy have not improved during the eight years Capital Research Center has conducted this study.  There are few individual exceptions.  Among the 43 most significant corporate contributors to nonprofit advocacy groups (<a href="/crc/patterns/pcp10b.html">SEE TEN BEST GIVERS</a>), only Eli Lilly received a grade of &quot;A&quot;, the first corporation to be so designated in eight years.  No corporations received a &quot;B.&quot;  Nine corporations received a &quot;C&quot; grade; of these, however, only Amoco and Cigna displayed slight right-of-center giving patterns.  The patterns of public affairs giving by Coca-Cola, Anheuser-Busch, Fannie Mae, and J.P. Morgan earned these corporations the lowest possible grade -- &quot;F&quot;.  All others on the list earned &quot;D&quot; grades.  Waste Management, General Mills, Dayton Hudson, and American Express--each with a long-standing tradition of funding Left-oriented advocacy groups--are especially familiar faces on this list.
<P><br>
<a name="how"></a>
<B>How Corporate Philanthropy Hurts Traditional Charity</B>
<P>	
Traditional charity involves individual acts of virtue:  charitable individuals voluntarily offer direct assistance to the needy.  Traditional charities--groups like the Boy Scouts, Catholic Charities, the Red Cross, and the Salvation Army--work to alleviate suffering and assist the recovery of personal independence.  In contrast, the welfare state mandates social programs that empower service professionals, generate dependency in their clients, and promote a sense of entitlement in both.  Proponents of so-called &quot;progressive philanthropy&quot; are encouraging corporations and foundations to adopt a new philosophy of philanthropic giving.  Occupying leadership positions in key organizations like the Council on Foundations, they deemphasize support for traditional charities and would shift philanthropy's financial resources to nonprofit advocacy groups, especially those that actively promote welfare state programs.
<P>
	The majority of companies surveyed in this study devote less than 10 percent of their charitable contributions to nonprofit advocacy groups.  But the trend toward advocacy and away from traditional charity is growing.  Moreover, most of the corporations that contribute significantly to nonprofit advocacy groups (<a href="/crc/patterns/pcp10w.html">SEE TEN WORST MISGIVERS</a>) favor groups that are committed to expanding the welfare state.  
<P>
<ul>
<li>Exxon contributed the most money to nonprofit advocacy groups--more than $2.7 million.  Other members of the million dollar club included Aetna, Ford, NYNEX, AT&amp;T and General Electric.  Together these five companies gave nearly $6.4 million to largely center-left and liberal interest groups.
<li>IBM devoted more than 25 percent of its philanthropic dollars to advocacy groups in a year when it lost almost $7 billion.  Monsanto gave over 24 percent of its total contributions to nonprofit advocacy groups; Archer Daniels Midland gave over 17 percent.
<li>Fannie Mae contributed almost 30 percent of its philanthropy--almost $2 million--to left-of-center advocacy groups.  None of the company's 26 grants to advocacy nonprofits went to a right-of-center group.  Freddie Mac gave over 13 percent to advocacy groups.  Both corporations enjoy government guarantees enabling them to make huge profits in an otherwise risky secondary mortgage market.
<li>FMC, Unocal, Reynolds Metals, W.R. Grace, and Amoco deserve recognition for supporting advocacy groups that favor competitive free markets and limited government.  Sun Microsystems is the only company whose charitable contributions program does not fund nonprofit advocacy groups.
</ul>
<P>
	The advocacy groups that bid for corporate philanthropy enjoy the same tax-exemption as a church or a traditional charity, even though they recognize no obligation to provide charity's direct assistance.  When corporations fund these nonprofits from their philanthropic budgets, they give traditional charities an incentive to alter their priorities to compete for the advocacy dollar.  Worse, the advocacy groups that receive corporate funding tend to be those most favorable to welfare state policies, policies that co-opt the aims and undermine the achievements of genuine charity. 
<P><br>
<a name="whose"></a>
<B>Whose Money Is It?</B>
<P>
	Conservatives understand that limited government is necessary for civil order as well as for liberty, and that local government works best to provide services protecting the community.  Conservatives understand that religion and education instill good character in the young and that a strong family is the best safety net.  Conservatives know that work creates wealth, and that property rights protect opportunity.  Does it matter whether big business agrees?  Shouldn't corporations be free to make charitable contributions to whichever groups they favor?
<P>
	The answer is no.  Charity is a voluntary and virtuous act of giving by one person to another.  But the companies examined in this study issue shares of stock that are publicly traded.  Except insofar as they are shareholders, company executives are <I>management</I>, not <I>owners</I>.  To truly engage in an act of charity with corporate funds, management would need to inform shareholders of the company's proposed contribution and obtain their consent. Management's fiduciary trust requires that its decisions properly represent shareholder interests.
<P>
	Milton Friedman has argued that &quot;socially responsible&quot; companies are those that operate most profitably for their owners.  In doing that they supply jobs, products, and services that are in demand.   When USAir indefinitely suspended its corporate philanthropic program until the company returned to profitability, it was taking Friedman's advice.  Sadly, other companies ignored the message in their bottom line.  In 1991, the most recent year for which information in this study can be gathered, 21 corporations gave away their shareholders' money despite the red ink on their books:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Equitable contributed $3.5 million to charity, or nearly 11 percent of the $32.2 million the company lost.  Ashland Oil's philanthropy budget amounted to $5.2 million, or close to 8 percent of its $66.8 million loss.
<li>IBM lost nearly $6.9 billion, but still found nearly $3 million to give away.  General Motors lost $2.6 billion, but found $21 million for charity.
<li>Ford Motor gave away over $19 million even as it lost more than $500 million.  The St. Paul Companies made contributions of $8.8 million while losing over $232 million.  Westinghouse gave $6.8 million to charity in a year in which it lost $953 million.
</ul>
<P>
	At least the corporate managements at Georgia-Pacific, W.R. Grace, and Reynolds Metals could claim they were pursuing their companies' longer term interests by contributing to right-of-center think tanks and advocacy groups.  But what excuse could the managements at 18 other money-losing companies give for dispensing shareholder monies?  It was, after all, not theirs.  Corporate philanthropists may fancy themselves modern-day Robin Hoods.  But management's fiduciary trust is not a license to steal. 
<P><br>
<a name="feeding"></a>
<B>Feeding the Mouths That Bite Them</B>
<P>
	The old argument that what's good for business is good for America (and vice-versa) is enjoying a peculiar revival.  Advocacy groups claim that what's bad for particular American businesses is bad for America.  When a dynamic, competitive market threatens the well-being of major American corporations shouldn't something be done?  For instance, Ford and Chrysler each gave $150,000 to the protectionist Economic Strategy Institute.  General Motors gave $17,000.  Won't contributions to this group fund the studies that protect jobs and return profits to Detroit?
<P>
	Such claims ignore the interest of shareholders in the <I>long-term</I> competitiveness of their company.  Anti-market policies may help companies retain current market share and protect top management in the <I>short-term</I>.  But the benefits of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) outweigh any negative consequences from foreign competition.
<P>
	The automobile industry offers a particularly salient example: Artificial price barriers like tariffs or &quot;voluntary&quot; limits on imports have not stopped foreign companies from setting up shop in the United States.  Consumer demand for a superior product has pressured Detroit automakers to improve auto quality or lose market share.
<P>
	If management gives away shareholder profits through a corporate philanthropy program, wouldn't it be best to contribute to traditional charities that provide direct services?  If management looks for advocacy groups to fund, why not those that encourage self-help and individual responsibility like Robert Woodson's National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise?  There is no ethical explanation or excuse for supporting proponents of the welfare state.  Consider the following examples of self-defeating corporate philanthropy:
<P><ul>

<li>ACORN, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, received $123,000 from financial institutions BankAmerica, Fannie Mae, First Chicago and J.P. Morgan.  ACORN activists are best known for targeting banks, telling them who should receive minority set-aside loans.  Banks that reject ACORN's advice risk charges that they have failed to comply with the Community Reinvestment Act.
<li>The Center for Community Change, which supports raising personal and corporate taxes, received 
$319,000 in corporate contributions.  Fannie Mae contributed $100,000; Aetna - $70,000; Dayton Hudson - $34,500; and AT&amp;T - $25,000.
<li>Children's Defense Fund wants to nationalize distribution of child vaccines and greatly expand Medicaid and Head Start.  Once chaired by Hillary Clinton and then by Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, CDF backed the Clinton health plan and prods the Administration's social welfare agenda.  Corporations gave CDF over $700,000 in 1992.  This includes $75,000 from J.P. Morgan, $70,000 from American Express, $60,000 from Fannie Mae, and $50,000 each from Aetna, AT&amp;T, Citicorp, and Coca-Cola.  Merrill Lynch provided at least $36,000, General Mills gave $35,600, and Dayton Hudson gave $30,000 to CDF.
<li>The Alliance to Save Energy has supported a fifty-cent per gallon gasoline tax that would dampen consumer demand for larger and safer, but less fuel-efficient American-made cars.  Ashland Oil, Chevron, Chrysler and Texaco each contributed $5,000 to the Alliance.
<li>Exxon contributed $5,000 to the Environmental Law Institute, which economist Paul Craig Roberts credits with formulating the legal rationale for Exxon's criminal indictment for the <I>Valdez</I> oil spill. 
<li>The Audubon Society and the National Wilderness Federation oppose exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  Chevron and Enron combined to give Audubon $30,000, while Amoco gave $46,000 to the National Wildlife Federation.  NWF also supports an &quot;Environmental Quality Amendment&quot; to the Constitution and would elevate the Environmental Protection Agency to cabinet-level status.  Chevron also gave $5,000 to the Center for Marine Conservation, which has blocked oil drilling in Monterey Bay.
</ul><P>
	Why do corporations feed the mouths that bite them?  The answer is unclear because many corporations are unwilling to reveal which charities they fund.  In responding to Capital Research Center queries, many corporate contributions managers claimed that company policy prohibited them from disclosing grant recipients lists.  Others insisted that the requested information was confidential or &quot;proprietary.&quot;  In a &quot;politically correct&quot; environment, companies are torn between their desire for good public relations and their fear of public controversy. 
<P><br>
<a name="corporate"></a>
<B>Corporate Culpability</B>
<P>
	Evidence of corporate support for nonprofit proponents of the welfare state is compelling.  Of 36 nonprofit advocacy groups that received more than $250,000 in corporate contributions, 27 had liberal public policy agendas.  It is striking that the top five left-of-center groups received over $9 million in corporate contributions, over $1 million more than the total corporate contributions to 87 right-of-center groups.  The top five:
<P>
<ul>
<li>The Urban League received over $3 million from corporations.  It supports an &quot;Urban Marshall Plan for America,&quot; a $500 billion expansion of the welfare state to achieve the &quot;goal of black-white parity by the year 2000.&quot;  Toward this end it opposed U.S. military action against Iraq fearing the deaths of a disproportionate number of blacks.  The League receives over half of its $26.5 million budget from the federal government. 
<li>The Enterprise Foundation received nearly $2 million.  A recipient of large U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development contracts, it would dramatically increase federal funding for low-income housing.
<li>The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has seen its proud history of civil rights activism tarnished by scandal.  And its support of racial quotas in hiring undermines a commitment to equal rights.  The NAACP received nearly $1.6 million in corporate contributions.
<li>The Nature Conservancy boasts that it is &quot;the largest private system of nature sanctuaries in the world.&quot;  But it has sold millions of acres of private lands to the federal government at a profit to itself, actions for which it was reprimanded by the General Accounting Office.  Corporations contributed $1.2 million to the Conservancy.
<li>The Committee for Economic Development supported the government mandates of the Family and Medical Leave Act.  CED Chairman Owen Butler opposes school choice initiatives.  The Committee received nearly $1.2 million from corporations.  
</ul>
<P><br>
<a name="big"></a>
<B>Big Business and Interest Group Liberalism</B>
<P>
This edition of <I>Patterns of Corporate Philanthropy</I> tracks the source and destination of nearly $37 million in corporate philanthropy.  This is the amount that 129 of the nation's largest companies contributed to over 300 nonprofit advocacy groups in 1992, the most recent year for which records are available.  For eight years Capital Research Center has surveyed giving to nonprofit advocacy groups by America's largest corporations as determined by <I>Forbes Magazine</I>.  Our findings have never been worse:  Big businesses gave $3.46 to left-leaning interest groups for every dollar contributed to right-of-center groups.  
<P>
	Recipient groups are classified according the the following criteria:
<P><ul>
<li><I>The Change-Oriented Right</I> includes conservative organizations like The Heritage Foundation, Hoover Institution and Capital Research Center, as well as market liberal and libertarian groups like the Cato Institute, Reason Foundation and Competitive Enterprise Institute.  These groups are strong defenders of individual liberty and responsibility, and they are convinced that major cuts in government programs, taxes, and regulations are essential for economic prosperity and personal freedom.  They received only 11% of 1992 corporate contributions to nonprofit pubic affairs groups.
<li><I>The Establishment Right</I> includes the American Enterprise Institute, Center for Strategic and International Studies, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  These organizations favor less systemic reforms to eliminate waste and fraud in government and to improve economic efficiency.  These groups actually received slightly less funding from corporations than the Change-Oriented Right.
<li><I>Non-ideological</I> groups like the Center for Governmental Research and the Rand Corporation avoid controversy over political values and offer pragmatic or &quot;good government&quot; policy prescriptions.   They received the smallest share of corporate philanthropy, less than four percent.
<li><I>The Establishment Left</I> consists of moderate center-left groups like the Brookings Institution and the National Alliance of Business, as well as liberal groups like the Urban League, Enterprise Foundation, and Nature Conservancy.  These groups defend government's role as a problem-solver and look favorably on increased government regulation and taxation.  The lion's share of corporate contributions--nearly 64 percent--went to them.
<li><I>The Change-Oriented Left</I> includes groups that favor a government-initiated restructuring of American economic and social institutions.  Groups like the Center for Community Change, Children's Defense Fund, the NAACP, and more radical activists like Greenpeace pursue collectivist public policies through activist politics.  These groups received 11% of corporate contributions.
</ul><P>
	Corporate America's connection to interest group liberalism is most evident when funding of &quot;change-oriented&quot; groups, Left and Right, is compared to corporate funding of &quot;establishment&quot; groups.  Corporate contributions to nonprofit groups on the change-oriented Right were equal to corporate contributions to nonprofit groups on the change-oriented Left.  This finding suggests that corporate funds may neutralize or cancel out the impact of the most determined agents of change.  But the Establishment Left received more than six dollars in corporate contributions for every dollar that went to Establishment Right groups.  Money means influence inside the Washington, D.C. Beltway.  By a six to one margin, corporate executives gave it to liberal interest groups.  Is it any wonder that politics is in gridlock and public policies reinforcing a failed welfare state remain in place?
<P>
<br>
<a name="conclusions"></a>
<B>Conclusions</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>That big business funds the liberal agenda flies in the face of conventional wisdom.  But the common presumption that American corporations are conservative advocates of the free enterprise system is far from the truth.  The charitable contributions of America's largest companies provide financial support for group interests well to the left of mainstream Americans.
<li>Corporations undermine traditional charities by giving to advocacy groups.  The poor are ill-served when funds that might have been used for them go instead to groups favoring programs of advocacy.
<li>Finally, it is improper for unprofitable corporations to make philanthropic donations.  Worse, it is inexcusable that corporations, profitable or not, contribute to groups whose political agenda undermines the conditions that make possible their own economic prosperity.  In neglecting shareholders' interests in long-term profitability, managers betray their fiduciary trust.
</ul>
<P><br>
<a name="call"></a>
<B>A Call To Action</b>
<P>
What will change the behaviour of corporate management?  If shareholders believe corporate philanthropy is directly or indirectly hurting profits, they may want to confront company policies directly.  Capital Research Center urges corporate shareholders as well as taxpayers, consumers, and citizens to express their dissatisfaction to company executives.  Let them know that corporate contributions:
<P><ul>
	<li>should not take precedence over returns to investors;
	  <li>should not fund advocacy groups over traditional charities;
 	  <li>should not favor liberal interest groups over groups favoring market reform.  
</ul><P>
	Without popular pressure the pattern of bias in corporate philanthropy will continue, and Americans' desire for change will remain frustrated.  If big business will stop funding liberal advocacy groups it may be possible yet to replace the welfare state with the land of opportunity.

	Capital Research Center wrote to each of the 250 largest American corporations (as ranked by <I>Forbes</I> according to sales) and requested information on both direct corporate and corporate foundation charitable contributions, including a complete list of grant amounts and recipients for 1992.  We obtained partial or complete lists of grant recipients from 147 corporations.  (These lists included data on giving by the corporation, its subsidiaries, and/or its corporate foundation.  The structure of each corporate program determined the nature of the lists.)  The 147 corporate responses included ten lists of direct corporate grants only, 110 lists of corporate foundation grants only, and nine lists of both corporate foundation and direct corporate grants.  Another 18 lists lacked the data necessary to determine a company rating. (In some cases the company did not have a philanthropic program, or no grants to advocacy groups were found, or the grant recipients were listed without corresponding dollar amounts).  While most scholarly studies consider data samples of 5-10% a success, we obtained sufficient data to establish giving patterns for 51.6% of the <I>Forbes</I> 250.
<P>
	Each corporate foundation is required to file a Form 990-PF annually with the Internal Revenue Service.  The form lists grant recipients and the amounts awarded to each.  We obtained copies of these forms from the Foundation Center or from companies directly.  In Section Two, citation of a Form 990-PF as the only available data source indicates that the company did not provide independent information for its direct giving or that of its subsidiaries.  In these cases the list of grant recipients represents only those grants made through the corporate foundation.  Capital Research Center made at least two follow-up telephone calls when a corporation failed to send requested information, or sent only partial information after three requests.
<P>	In addition to all non-advocacy related grants, we generally excluded three types of giving: &quot;in kind&quot; contributions such as land or computer equipment, because data are not readily available; grants matching gifts from company employees, because employees generally determine the choice of recipient; and contributions to political action committees, because grants to candidates are fundamentally different from nonprofit advocacy giving.
<P>	After a careful review of annual reports, newsletters, books, pamphlets, and other relevant publications, Capital Research Center classified over 300 grant recipients, using an eight-point scale: 1 (radical left), 2 (left), 3 (liberal), 4 (center-left), 5 (center), 6 (center-right), 7 (market liberal), 8 (conservative).  	Ratings were based on primary source information and reputable secondary sources.  Evaluators worked separately to assure independent analyses of the documentation, and individual group ratings were averaged to determine each organization's final rating.  Although this process is judgemental, similar category and rating systems are common in social science and public policy research measuring the impact of ideology on public policy.
<P>	To analyze the giving patterns of each corporation and, where applicable, its foundation, we computed a mean from the ratings assigned to each corporate grant recipient, <I>adjusted </I>by the dollar amount of each grant.  The company rating, then, is a weighted average of its recipients' ratings.  For example, if a company makes 10 grants to public affairs organizations, 9 for $1,000 each and 1 for $50,000, with all $1,000 grants awarded to conservative groups (rated 8) and the $50,000 grant to a group with a rating of 2 (left), the adjusted mean is 2.9 * ([{9 * (8 * $1,000)} + {2 * $50,000}] / [{9 * $1,000} + $50,000]) because the corporation gave far more in dollar terms to leftist than to conservative groups.
<P>	Thus, the corporate rating is a computation and letter grades were derived from this figure for every corporation giving at least $250,000 to nonprofit advocacy groups.  Based on ratings of 8 and 7 for change-oriented right, 6 for establishment-right, 5 for nonideological, 4 and 3 for establishment-left, and 2 and 1 for change-oriented left groups, an adjusted mean of at least 6.5 merits an &quot;A;&quot; an adjusted mean of 5.5 to 6.4, a &quot;B;&quot; an adjusted mean of 4.5 to 5.4, a &quot;C;&quot; an adjusted mean of 3.0 to 4.4, a &quot;D;&quot; and an adjusted mean below 3.0, an &quot;F.&quot;  A corporation that consistently supported nonprofit advocacy groups that favor reducing regulatory barriers to enterprise would thus easily merit an &quot;A,&quot; while one that supported nonideological groups or that contributed equally to groups of both the left and right would receive a &quot;C.&quot;

<P>	Grades refer only to corporate contributions to nonprofit advocacy groups that attempt to influence public policy.  Giving to museums, symphonies, medical research and education institutions, and organizations that primarily provide direct services to the poor is not counted.

<p>
<P><I><blockquote>Karen was 15 when she became pregnant.  Her 
parents urged her to have an abortion -- they didn't want to 
raise another child, they said.  And since she was already in 
her eleventh week, there was no time to wait.  Her mother took 
her to the clinic and the thing was done.  Crisis over.</blockquote></I>
<P>
<dd>
Or so it seemed.  But that abortion would haunt Karen 
for years until she went through a post-abortion support 
group sponsored by a crisis pregnancy center.
<P>
<dd>
Karen is like many others -- Catholic and evangelical, 
Christian and atheist, pro-life and pro-choice -- who have 
sought help to deal with past abortions.  Although officially there is 
no such thing as post abortion stress, the experience of tens 
of thousands of women and men suggests that abortion has 
spiritual, social, and psychological consequences that 
professional therapists are only now beginning to acknowledge.
<P><dd>Hurting women haven't waited for  the American 
Psychiatric Association to recognize their pain.  They have developed 
a network of support groups, sympathetic clergy and 
therapists through organizations such as Project Rachel, sponsored by 
the Catholic Church; or PACE, sponsored by Care Net, an 
evangelical network of crisis pregnancy centers.   Other have 
turned to Abortion Survivors Anonymous (ASA), a 12-step 
program, or one of hundreds of other groups with names like 
Silent Voices or Rachel's Hope.  Even some family planning 
clinics now acknowledged the existence of post-abortion distress 
and have begun to offer counseling.
<P><I><blockequote>For five years after her abortion,  Karen devoted herself 
to making a relationship with the father of her never-born baby. 
 &quot;I put all of my focus into validating the relationship I had 
with the boy,&quot; she says.  And even after moving thousands of 
miles away and engaging in relationships with other guys, 
she believed her future was with him: &quot;[the other guys] were to 
pass the time until Scott and I could be together.&quot;</blockquote></I>
<P>
<dd>Most women resume their lives after an abortion.  As 
Lisa Salcedo, former longtime PACE (Post Abortion 
Counseling and Education) coordinator at the Austin Crisis 
Pregnancy Center, notes, the most common emotion immediately 
following an abortion is relief.  &quot;A crisis pregnancy is indeed 
thatit is a crisis.  And when you choose an abortion, that crisis is 
over . . . of  course you're going to feel relief.&quot;
<P>
<dd>But some women find the relief is short-lived. They 
may show mild signs of depression as  Jennifer did.  She was 18 
and a college student when she had her abortion.  It took place 
in August and Jennifer did fine in school that fall semester.  But 
by spring things were different.  &quot;When I'm sad the best thing 
for me is to sleep,&quot; she says.  &quot;I slept that whole spring semester 
in college.&quot; Later on she felt a lack of desire for sex in her 
marriage and a general emotional numbness, feeling neither great 
sorrow nor great joy about anything.
<P>
<dd>Abortion Survivors Anonymous explains the reason 
for depression this way: &quot;When a child dies, grief is a 
normal reaction of surviving family members.  Few of us thought 
of abortion as a death loss.  We did not expect or 
acknowledge grief.  So we stuffed our feelings of emptiness, loss, anger 
and despair.  Normal grief in time leads to reconciliation 
and acceptance of life without the one we lost.  When grief 
goes unrecognized or denied, it goes undercover and endangers 
our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual well being.&quot;
<P>Vicki Thorn, executive director of the National Office 
of Post-Abortion Reconciliation &amp; Healing and founder of 
the Catholic Church's Project Rachel, puts it this way: &quot;The 
societal message says that this experience solves a problem and 
that it is a non-experience.&quot;
<P>For some women the abortion aftermath goes much 
further than mild feelings of sadness or depression.  Lorraine 
dabbled in drugs and alcohol and suffered through bouts of 
depression after her abortion.  She was able to hold herself together 
during her father's last illness and death, but then she began a 
period of self-loathing.  &quot;I put myself in a position where I could 
get really, really hurt -- physically hurt, emotionally hurt, on 
purpose, because I hated myself so badly that I wanted 
somebody -- although I couldn't do it myself -- I would wish my 
car would break down out in the middle of nowhere and wish 
that someone would pull over and actually physically abuse me 
and rape me and leave me for dead.  I can't tell you how many 
times I felt that.&quot; 
<P>As Abortion Survivors Anonymous explains, &quot;'Time 
doesn't heal all wounds' . . . .  When abortion wounds our hearts, 
tears may cleanse it and our pain may be soothed in sharing 
with others.  But when we hide our tears and seal our grief in 
tight-lipped isolation, time only makes it worse.&quot;
<P>Both Jennifer and Lorraine showed symptoms typical of 
post abortion syndrome (PAS), although Jennifer's symptoms 
were mild.  Vicki Thorn has put together a list of manifestations 
of what she calls &quot;abortion's aftermath.&quot;  
<P>It includes low self-esteem, grief, depression, guilt, a 
sense of alienation from self, family, and friends, shame, 
isolation, anger, dreams, flashbacks, ideas of suicide, drug and 
alcohol abuse, and relationship problems.  The intensity and number 
of symptoms differs from one woman to the next.  But even 
when the feelings are very intense, women rarely make the 
association between their feelings and behavior and an 
abortion because they have successfully absorbed the message 
that abortion solves problems, and does not create them.  It 
usually takes a trigger event for a woman to make the connection.  
<P>
<bolckquote><I>Five years after her abortion, Karen's relationship with 
the baby's father, which she had nurtured as a way to justify 
the abortion, was over.  She slipped into depression.  &quot;That's 
when I started doing drugs and got heavily involved in one 
night stands.  I became worthless.  I sought avenues to try to cover 
up how I was feeling and the worthlessness that I felt.  I sought 
out really toxic relationshipslike each relationship got 
even worse and worse. I kept putting myself into 
circumstances where  I think I wanted to be killed, but not having 
enough courage to do it myself. . . .  I think deep down I really 
wanted to get rid of the feeling I was having and I didn't know what 
to do with it.  Didn't really know how to pinpoint it either, until 
I came face to face with death, really, because my boyfriend 
had killed himself while he was talking to me on the phone. . . . 
 That's when I realized, &quot;Whoa, why am I choosing death?&quot;
<P>Four years ago Karen gave birth to a daughter.  And 
though she says she had grieved over the abortion in lots of ways, 
her daughter's birth triggered something new.  &quot;I started 
grieving for the baby.  That's when I had guilt.  It was a panicky 
feeling because  I wanted to go to the clinic, which was 2,500 
miles away, and find my baby.  There was just a real feeling of loss 
and mourning and not having anywhere to go to try to fix it.&quot;</I></blockquote>
<P>
<dd>For Karen, the birth of a baby triggered her 
long-suppressed memories of a previous abortion.  Sometimes an 
abortion protest or a movie about fetal development, or even a 
popular television movie can act as a trigger.  Vicki Thorn said 
the recent HBO movie, &quot;If These Walls Could Talk,&quot; resulted 
in phone calls to her office.  Sometimes the trigger is as 
ordinary as seeing a child the same age as the aborted one would be.  
<P>
<dd>For an older woman who has never married or is 
having fertility problems, the trigger may be feeling that she  
aborted the only child she may ever have. Ava Torre-Bueno, a 
therapist in San Diego, and for 10 years involved in abortion 
counseling at a Planned Parenthood clinic, still supports abortion rights.  But she 
sees many women in her practice who are suffering from what she calls &quot;post 
abortion distress.&quot;  
<P>
<dd>Ms. Torre-Bueno says an abortion that made sense during one period in 
a woman's life takes on a different meaning when her circumstances change. 
 She may, for instance, be in her 40s now, and having hot flashes at night. 
 Never married with no current partner, she begins to view an abortion she had at 28 &quot;as her only 
chance to have a child.&quot;  According to Ms. Torre-Bueno, &quot;her 
feelings change with the new circumstances.&quot;  Or there may be 
an intervening medical event.  &quot;A partner may die, now 
the abortion is a mistake, before it wasn't.&quot;
<P>
<dd>The triggering event, whatever it is, may happen two 
years, five years, ten years or longer after the abortion.  Lisa 
Salcedo, the Austin PACE coordinator, says lots of women feel 
some pain regarding the loss of their babies.  &quot;It typically shows 
up when they hit their  late 20s,  30s  and early 40s -- when they 
are most likely to have children of their own.&quot;  Women 
who managed to grieve the loss of their baby at the time of 
the abortion are less likely to have dramatic symptoms later on, 
but Ms. Salcedo is emphatic that at some point all abortive 
women will mourn: &quot;You can't lose a child and not grieve 
sometime,&quot; she says.  &quot;You must mourn for that baby. . . .  That's just 
the way we're created.&quot;
<P>
<P><CENTER><B><H4>Project Rachel</H4></B>
</CENTER><P>
<dd>When the crisis comes, women have several choices of where to go and what 
to do for help.  Many Catholic women have found healing with Project Rachel.  It 
was founded in 1984 by Vicki Thorn, who at that time was the Respect Life 
coordinator for the diocese of Milwaukee.  She saw the need for 
the Catholic Church to be reaching out to women who had 
experienced abortions, especially as she saw a friend struggle 
with post abortion pain.  &quot;I can live with my adoption, but not 
with my abortion,&quot; this friend told her.  Ms. Thorn believed &quot;that 
we as the Church needed to be responding since the pain is 
so incredible.&quot;
<P>
<dd>In September of 1984, Project Rachel was born as a 
national model of post-abortion counseling.  From the beginning 
Project Rachel relied on professional counselors and clergy 
because &quot;we needed to offer the best we had.&quot;  Project Rachel 
continues to rely primarily on professionals, although some dioceses 
have started support groups.  Thousands of people in the 
church structure have been trained over the past 12 years; in one 
year alone, 3,000 people received training.
<P>
<dd>In Austin, Project Rachel has seen 200 to 300 women in 
the five years it has been operating.  The group is a 
low-budget operation, having just enough money to pay for a phone line 
in volunteer coordinator Susan Stavinoha's house and a 
brochure, which is made available in area Catholic churches. Like 
Project Rachel nationally, the local affiliate uses clergy and 
professional counselors, although two years ago it began a 
support group.  So far 18 women have gone through it.
<P>
<dd>Ms.  Stavinoha says several things happen in a Project 
Rachel group.  First a woman &quot; needs to tell her story in detail.  We 
go in detail in what you wore, who went with you, what did it 
smell like.  They need to get in touch with anger, disgust, 
hatred towards their selves, their spouse, the father of the child, 
their parents, the Church.&quot; 
<P>
<dd>Second, the group works &quot;on establishing some 
relationship between the mother and the child.  Once they acknowledge 
that `yes, it was their child and they had a hand in destroying the 
life of that child,' they can begin grieving.&quot;
<P>
<dd>The third step is forgiveness: God forgiving them, and 
the women forgiving themselves.  Ms. Stavinoha says, &quot;They 
think that God will never forgive them and they will go to hell. 
 They're really at the bottom and when they see that God is 
there for them, that relationship becomes stronger.&quot;
<P>
<dd>Project Rachel is designed to use the sacraments and 
traditions of the Catholic Church to bring about reconciliation. 
 Whether a woman chooses to see a priest, a therapist or take 
part in a support group is up to her.  &quot;Within the Catholic 
tradition of reconciliation, its important that at some point they go to 
a priest.&quot;
<P>
<dd>One of the most intriguing innovations in Austin's 
Project Rachel has been the introduction of art projects by art 
therapist Stephanie Woodruff.  The purpose of the art is not to make 
a product, but to open up an experience to a woman.  
For example, participants use craft clay in one project to 
sculpt some aspect of the life that was lost during an abortion.  
Ms. Woodruff says that the models that result are &quot;healing 
images that define for the woman that this is a life.  That it is a life 
that is specifically related to her.  That she is the mother.&quot;
<P>
<dd>An icebreaker used often during the first session has 
the leader asking participants to draw the answer to the 
question: &quot;If you were a flower, what would you look like?&quot;  
Afterwards each woman describes her flower and explains its meaning 
to the group.  A third project uses white and black materials 
to depict the abortion experience itself.  The works often 
express all the anger involved in an abortion.
<P>
<dd>Throughout the sessions, participants use the art projects 
to stimulate thoughts and deeply buried feelings and then 
explain them to the group.
<P>
<P><CENTER><B><H4>Post Abortion Counseling and Education (PACE)</H4></B>
</CENTER><P>
<dd>PACE is the largest post abortion network in the country. 
 Currently, PACE programs for women are offered by 297 
crisis pregnancy centers in the U.S.  that are affiliated with Care 
Net. Forty-four centers offer men's groups as well.  In 1986, 
when the program started, 700 PACE Bible studies were distributed. 
 Between 40,000 and 50,000 have been sold in the past ten years.
<P>
<dd>Although there are many similarities between Project 
Rachel and PACE, there is one basic difference.  PACE is a 
Bible Study.  According to Judy Brown McDonough, Care 
Net's general counsel, &quot;PACE is all about who God is.  It's 
the character of God and who he is that promotes healing.&quot;  
Most of the women who come to a PACE Bible study are 
Christian women.  According to Ms. Salcedo, &quot;Especially for 
Christian women there are  guilt and forgiveness issues.  Not only the 
guilt and forgiveness from God issues, but also the forgiveness 
of oneself.  You have to get to the other side, where you are 
willing to forgive yourself and move on.&quot;
<P>
<dd>But shame and guilt can make it hard for Christian women 
to come forward.  Jennifer, who had become a Christian 
several years after her abortion, never told anyone in her church 
about it.  On Sanctity of Human Life Sunday (in January) &quot;a 
well respected man gave his abortion testimony,&quot; she says.  
&quot;The way the congregation was accepting of him, supportive of 
him and sincerely thankful that he had had the courage to 
share -- when I saw him stand up, and then their reaction, it gave 
me inspiration to go to talk to someone.&quot;
<P>
<dd>Ms. Salcedo acknowledges the problem in many 
evangelical churches.   &quot;There are so many cases of women being 
rejected in our churches, that make women and men so wary, 
so frightened to share it with people. . . .  A woman who has 
had an abortion feels bad enough about it.  She doesn't need 
any more criticism or judgment, and she certainly doesn't need 
to be reminded how much of a sin it was.  Particularly 
Christian women know it was a sin -- most of them.  They need 
outstretched hands, a shoulder, a friendly ear to listen, to help 
them through their healing path.&quot;  According to Ms. Salcedo, 
that's what PACE offers.
<P>
<dd>Most PACE groups are led by volunteers who have 
had abortions themselves.  Typically, a group of five to 
eight women will go through the PACE study, looking up the 
Bible passages at home,  and discussing issues of anger, 
grief, depression,  and forgiveness when they are all together. 
<P>
<dd>Lorraine, the woman who had wished to be raped and left 
for dead, said the most important thing she gained from her 
eight week PACE group was an idea of &quot;God's grace for you.  
When you feel so awful for what you've done. . . .  And then 
He actually shows you the Scripture . . . that He has those 
loving arms and when you walk to him, He's there.&quot;
<P>
<dd>Not every person comes out of a PACE group with a 
huge revelation -- nor are they all seeking one.  Jennifer 
wanted &quot;people to know me with all my faults and PACE gave me 
the courage to say, `I made a huge mistake'. . . .  I am so 
thankful that God allowed me to go through PACE and go through 
the abortion because before the abortion I thought I was  a 
good person that would go to heaven, and now I know just 
how deceitful and manipulative and self-centered and selfish I 
was apart from God.  And I know I am not any worse than anyone else, even 
those who haven't had abortions.&quot;
<P>
<dd>Getting to that place, though, is not easy.  During one week of a 
PACE group, each participant writes a letter to God expressing her anger with 
everyone and everything connected to the abortion.  The letters are not 
pretty because they vent so much anger.  For many women it's hard even to 
acknowledge that the anger exists because they've been holding the lid on it for so many years.  But 
once encouraged to express it, it comes pouring out.  It may 
be directed against the boyfriend or husband who encouraged 
the abortion.  Sometimes parents are the targets, or siblings, or 
the abortionistand always there is anger directed by the 
woman at herself.  
<P>
<dd>Participants aren't encouraged to nurse their anger.  The 
next week they read scripture passages about forgiveness and 
their duty to forgive those who have hurt them.  While not 
every woman can move from anger to forgiveness in a week, 
the process is an important one -- whether it takes a week, a 
month, or a year -- because carrying around a load of bitterness 
is harmful to her.  
<P>
<dd>Even though PACE has grown tremendously over the 
past ten years, Care Net's Judy McDonough is not satisfied.  
&quot;We should have PACE groups in the millions,&quot; she says.  About 
2.7 million born-again women have had abortions, and we've 
only sold in the tens of thousands [of Bible Studies].&quot;
<P>
<CENTER><P><B><H4>Abortion Survivors Anonymous (ASA)</H4></B>
</CENTER><P>
<dd>ASA is a 12-step program based on the twelve steps 
of Alcoholics Anonymous.  The group, which was founded in 
San Diego, California in 1988, operates on a shoe string since 
it receives no funding from anyone accept participants.  
The group also stays clear from all political controversies.  Sarah 
J. said, &quot;We stay completely apart from whatever controversy 
is going on in this country.  We all have our own 
individual opinions. . . .  Our premise is, when someone calls and says, 
`I'm pro-choice, anti-religious, can you help?' We say `It 
doesn't make any difference what your standing is.  You hurt.  
Your emotions have no opinions.&quot;
<P>Since the group's founding in 1988, it has received calls 
from 37 states and average about a call a day.  ASA has sent 
out several hundred workbooks during that time. The work 
book can be used by individuals, but it also contains information 
on how to run a small group; it states clearly that &quot;the study is 
most effective in a small group setting.&quot;
<P>
<dd>Perhaps the greatest difference in the 12 Step approach 
to healing is spiritual. PACE is unabashedly evangelical 
Protestant in its understanding of God and the Bible.  Project 
Rachel is a ministry of the Catholic Church.  But ASA follows the 
lead of AA and teaches the need to believe that an unnamed 
&quot;Power greater than ourselves can restore us to wholeness.&quot; 
According to Sarah J., ASA's founders felt there was 
an empty holea space that needed filling for those women 
from no particular theological tradition who needed help.
<P>ASA explains its philosophy to newcomers: &quot;Our goal 
for our journey to wholeness after abortion is three fold:  first, 
to work through our feelings of fear, anger, grief and guilt. 
 Second,  to reconcile with others who shared responsibility 
for the abortion, with God, with the aborted child(ren), and 
with ourselves.  And third, to sort guilt from grief and begin 
healthy grieving for our children.

<CENTER><P><B><H4>Peace After Abortion</H4></B>
</CENTER><P>For a long time it has been pro-life people who have 
fought to have PAS recognized as a legitimate mental health diagnosis. 
 Most pro-choice advocates have denied its existence.  But 
Ava Torre-Bueno is different.  This licensed M.S.W. began 
doing pregnancy counseling in a Planned Parenthood Clinic in 
1975, two years after <I>Roe v. Wade</I> was decided.  Five years later 
she became director of counseling at that clinic.   She left the 
clinic in 1985 and three years later opened up a private 
counseling practice.  Ms.  Torre-Bueno continues to see women who 
are distressed by their previous abortions.
<P>
<dd>Although she denies the existence of PAS, preferring to 
talk about post abortion distress, Ms. Torre-Bueno does 
acknowledge that abortion affects women.  She has written a book on 
the subject called <I>Peace after Abortion</I>.  In her opinion the 
abortion experience cracks open old feelings that have been locked 
up inside a woman.  She says that anxiety about abortion 
&quot;has opened up long suppressed feelings that they're bad, 
they're wrong. . . .  Something unresolved has come back on them.&quot;
<P>
<dd>So in her counseling practice she does not focus on 
grieving the loss of a baby, as the other programs do.  She encourages 
her clients to think about when else they have had similar feelings. 
 Maybe they are deeper, older issues of abandonment 
coming from the death or divorce of parents, and then Ms. 
Torre-Bueno encourages her clients to deal with those issues.
<P>
<dd>Post abortion distress, she says,  can be beneficial.  
Clients learn that &quot;you can heal spiritually, you can heal 
emotionally, you can grow up. . . .  It's like the silver lining.  You can 
heal old stuff.  You're in pain from it, but you can heal from it.&quot;
<P>
<dd>Although Ms. Torre-Bueno has received some positive 
feedback from family planning clinics, especially in the 
Pacific Northwest, she has also heard the question, `Why don't 
you stop talking about it?' from many of her pro-choice colleagues. 
 For a long time, she says, &quot;pro-choice folks have said no.  
They wouldn't look at [post abortion distress] seriously and deeply. 
 They wouldn't address it.&quot;
<P>
<dd>The publication of Naomi Wolf's essay, &quot;Our Bodies, 
Our Souls&quot; in <I>The New Republic</I> several years ago was a 
turning point of sorts: &quot;I was so glad that she had opened up the 
issue to the public. . . .  I'm getting orders [for the book] from 
family planning clinics.  Some think it's great, others won't order it.&quot; 
<P>
<dd>To her critics who think she has been co-opted by 
pro-life people, Ms. Torre-Bueno responds: &quot;They can't hear the 
client.&quot;  She explains that many women come into family 
planning clinics saying, &quot;I want the pill because I could never 
have another abortion.&quot;  The family planning counselors are 
so pleased to have a woman who is committed to using 
birth control that they don't hear what the client is really saying.  
Ms. Torre-Bueno says counselors should say, &quot;Tell me about 
your previous abortion,&quot; but they don't because &quot;people in 
family planning don't want to hear that she had a problem.&quot;   Her 
goal, says Ms. Torre-Bueno, &quot;is to just get them to hear that 
sentence and ask the next sentence correctly.&quot;
<P>
<CENTER><P><H4><B>Dads For Life</B></H4>
</CENTER><P>
<dd>Although most post abortion groups target women, there 
is a growing recognition that men, grandparents and siblings can 
 all have strong feelings about abortion.
<P>
<dd>Gary Bell was married and working in a TV repair shop 
in West Virginia when his wife had an abortion.  It took him 
seven years before he ever talked about it to anyone, even her.  
But then she had an affair and wanted a divorce.  &quot;
We had a 16-month old son. . . .  I lost everything that mattered to me, my 
wife and my son.&quot;
<P>
<dd>A local TV program, featuring NOW's Molly Yard 
talking about how fathers can't be good single parents, 
triggered something in Mr. Bell. He called the television studio.  
The producer was intrigued by his story -- and the idea that 
abortion affects men -- and scheduled him as a guest.  Men began 
coming out of the woodwork, he says, interested in getting help 
for themselves.  National television programs, including 
<I>Nightline</I>, scheduled him as a guest and 
<I>Newsweek</I> featured him in an article.
<P>
<dd>The attitude of the national media, he says, was &quot;very 
biased towards the women's point of view.  They were upset with 
the idea that men would have the right to stop an abortion.&quot;
<P>
<dd>Mr. Bell set up an organization called Dads for Life, 
and began receiving calls and letters from men suffering 
from abortion's aftermath.  Men, he says, go through many of 
the same abortion related feelings as women.  And social status 
is no predictor:  Mr. Bell has talked to people &quot;from all walks 
of life, from street bums to the wealthiest man you can imagine. 
 They all have the same kinds of feelings.&quot;
<P>
<dd>But there are differences: The man may have been the one 
to force his girlfriend or wife to have the abortion; he may 
have opposed it and been powerless to stop it;  or perhaps he 
didn't even know she was pregnant.  Many men wanted to be dads, Mr. Bell says,  
&quot;They may say, `I want to live up to my 
responsibilities' and the lady says `no you can't.'&quot;  
<P>
<dd>It has been harder for men to admit post- abortion pain.  As Mr. Bell puts 
it, &quot;People look at you funny if you say, 
`I'm hurting because my wife had an abortion.'  It's a lonely feeling because we 
are conditioned to think it is so private.  I've heard, `take it like 
a man.'  Well, how do you do that?&quot;
<P>
<dd>That's what happened to Ken, a young man who 
went through ASA's support group.  Though he tried to talk his 
girl friend out of an abortion, she went ahead with it.  Later he 
wrote, &quot;Elisha can't understand when I tell her how much I hurt.  
I know I wasn't the one who actually had the abortion, but I 
lost my son too.&quot;
<P>Vicki Thorn says that the National Office of Post 
Abortion Reconciliation and Healing receives far more calls from 
men than we ever used to.&quot;  It's similar to the situation for 
women ten years ago, she says.  After a speaking engagement men 
will come, &quot;one-by-one with tears in their eyes to talk to me.&quot;  
Ms. Thorn says that the growth of Promise Keepers and 
Covenant Keepers &quot;is going to unleash a tidal wave of pain among men.&quot; 
<P>
<dd>If that is true, local support groups are going to be 
overwhelmed.  Many local PACE and Project Rachel groups do 
not currently have support groups for men, and Mr. Bell has 
found it difficult to run and fund Dads for Life himself.  He has 
looked for a national group to provide leadership in this area, but 
has not been successful.
<P>
<CENTER><H4><B>National Office of Post Abortion Reconciliation and Healing (NOPARH)</B></H4></CENTER>
<P>
<dd>NOPARH is central clearinghouse for information 
about post abortion stress.  Although Vicki Thorn was the founder 
of the Catholic Church's Project Rachel, NOPARH is 
non-sectarian and has a broad outreach.  It keeps track of post 
abortion support groups throughout the country, and at its yearly 
convention at Marquette University, NOPARH tries to keep 
volunteers, therapists, clergy, and post-abortive women and 
men informed about the latest research on the issue.
<P>
<dd>Ms. Thorn  sees at least three main  challenges for the future. 
 First, she is concerned that there are &quot;no healing outreaches 
in the black community.&quot;  She believes that post abortion 
aftermath can explain some of the troubles in the black family.  
&quot;It has to have an impact on family systems,&quot; she says.  &quot;There 
isn't anything else in the country that has that scope.&quot;  And she 
says the problem will not be solved until leadership from the 
black community comes forward. 
<P>
<dd>Second, she is concerned about the potential implications 
of RU-486 as an easily accessible alternative form of abortion. 
 Ms. Thorn says RU-486 will &quot;create immediate and 
acute trauma.  We're going to have women having acute reactions.&quot;
<P>
<dd>The problem with the chemical is that it is 
self-administered, thus perhaps compounding feelings of guilt,  and it 
requires several days to bring about the abortion.  Even Ava 
Torre-Bueno says, &quot;I can't imagine doing RU-486.  The dragging 
out of this thing seems so awful to me.&quot;  
<P>
<dd>If a woman were to change her mind after taking the 
required first drug, but before taking the second one necessary 
to complete the abortion, &quot;that's going to be hell,&quot; Ms. 
Torre-Bueno says.  And Ms. Thorn adds that a woman's home, 
where the abortion takes place, is likely to become an aversive 
place to her, just as an abortion clinic is aversive to many women 
after their abortions.
<P>
<dd>It is too soon to tell what the consequences of RU-486 will 
be; clinical trials have just ended and the drug is not yet 
widely available.  But post abortion experts expect it to have 
serious effects on the women they see who are trying to piece back a 
life after abortion.
<P>
<dd>The third area of concern is lack of funding for research 
into post-abortion stress.  Ms. Thorn says that &quot;pro-abortion 
people are pumping money into politicized research&quot; designed to 
show that abortion does not cause problems.  Many of the 
studies funded by these people track women for only six months 
after an abortion, long before any adverse side effects 
generally show up.  As long as the &quot;secular community doesn't want 
to believe PAS exists,&quot; Ms. Thorn says, there won't be funding 
for it.
<P>
<dd>Debates about whether post abortion stress is actually a 
form of post traumatic stress syndrome don't seem to matter all 
that much to the volunteers in the field.  Many have had 
abortions of their own.  As Project Rachel's Susan Stavinoha says, 
 &quot;People can not deny a woman who has had an abortion 
and speaks from her heart about the effects of it.  It's not a statistic. 
 It's a true story.  If enough women tell their true stories, it 
will change things little by little.&quot;

<p>
<dd>Post abortion grief is not a new phenomenon.  One hundred and fifty years ago,  America went through 
another &quot;free love period&quot;; one hundred and twenty years 
ago, Elizabeth Evans wrote a book, <I>The Abuse of 
Maternity</I>, in which she described the effects of abortion on women.  
One told Evans, &quot;I recognized my real condition as a 
criminal, none the less because undetected and unpunished.  
[The memory] serves as an effectual damper upon 
whatever degree of pride or satisfaction I might otherwise feel in 
the more praiseworthy deeds of my career.&quot; 
<P>
<dd>A second told Evans, &quot;From the moment when I 
began to appreciate my irreparable loss, my thoughts were 
filled with imaginings as to what might have been the worth 
of that child's individuality . . . nor, during the interval, 
have I ever read of an accident by land or by water, or of a 
critical moment in a battle, or of a good cause lost through lack 
of a brave defender, but my heart has whispered, `He 
might have been there to help and save; he might have been 
able to lead that forlorn hope; his word or his deed might 
have brought that wise plan to successful issue.'&quot; 
<P>
<dd>Post abortion grief caused another to say, &quot;I was for 
a long time as near being insane as one can be without 
really going mad. . . .  I had an idea that I had lost, through 
that unnatural deed, the normal powers and qualities of a 
human being.  I no longer ate and drank with the old hunger 
and thirst, nor slept the quiet sleep of innocence; I took no 
heed of the passage of time, and all that I saw and heard 
seemed to be the occurrences of a dream, as though life was 
already finished for me.&quot; 
<P>
<dd>The sorrow at not having a grave or place in which 
to mourn the child led another mother to say, &quot;I envy a 
mother who goes to weep beside her baby's grave; because 
she knows where it is laid, and remembers how it looked in 
life, and is not ashamed to say, `I have lost a child.'  And 
when I hear mothers lamenting over such a loss, I pity 
them indeed; but I feel like saying to them, `You think you 
are deeply afflicted, but your trouble is really light, because 
it is not mingled with remorse, and you are not to blame 
for the infant's death.'  Truly, all sorrow that I have ever 
known or heard of is not to be compared with my sorrow, and 
that or others who have sinned in like manner!&quot;

<CENTER><H4><B>Pro-life, Pro-choice: <I>Can We Talk?</I></h4></CENTER>
<P>
By Frederica Matthewes-Green</B><p>
<dd>&quot;What's the point of talking to pro-choicers?&quot; a 
pro-lifer may well ask. Yet in cities across the country 
some pro-lifers have decided to do exactly that. 
Pro-life/pro-choice dialogue meetingsa phenomenon known 
as &quot;Common Ground&quot;have sprung up spontaneously 
in cities from San Francisco to St. Louis to Buffalo.
<P>
<dd>The motivation for, and the style of, these 
meetings varies a great deal. What they have in common is 
some basic ground rulesto speak respectfully, avoid 
combative argument, and keep group discussion 
confidential. They also share goals that are fairly modest. 
While the term &quot;common ground&quot; may, in some contexts, 
imply compromise, that is not the case here. Abortion 
dialogue groups do not try to negotiate a set of statements 
about abortion that are agreeable to all sidesfor 
example, pro-lifers giving up early abortions while 
pro-choicers give up late ones. Instead, dialogue participants look 
for areas where agreement already exists (adoption, 
for example) and try to build upon it.
<P>
<dd>Three possible benefits can result from such 
discussion. First, the two sides may actually find 
concrete action they can agree on, action that hopefully 
will reduce the numbers of abortions even while it 
continues to remain legal. Second, civil dialogue sets an 
attractive example for the &quot;muddled middle,&quot; who are 
disturbed and wearied by the polarized debate. This 
stimulates renewed hope, honest discussion of ambivalence, 
and fresh thinking. Third, dialogue, in itself,  has a 
goodness. As a Christian, I know that I am called to love 
my enemies. Before I became a pro-life activist, I didn't 
even have any enemies! But now, since I &quot;cannot love 
the brother I have not seen,&quot; I make an effort to attend 
our local common ground group regularly. As trust 
has grown over the years, so has love.  In our common 
ground group I can speak my mind freely, and know that my 
pro-choice friends will listen and understand, even when 
they disagree. I lose nothing by doing the same for them.
<P>
<dd>As local groups proliferate, the national 
umbrella linking them, the Network for Life and Choice, 
finds itself increasingly busy. The Network, a project of 
the Washington, DC-based Search for Common Ground, 
grew from a request from one such local group. In 
the wake of an Operation Rescue campaign, clergy in 
Buffalo, NY, asked for help in enabling opponents to 
understand each other. Search for Common Ground had 
facilitated dialogues between Israelis and Arabs and 
between Americans and Russians, but this would be their 
first purely domestic project.
<P>
<dd>Four years later, the Network has accomplished 
some important goals, and has set more for the future. 
Committees composed of both pro-life and pro-choice 
members have released working papers on adoption and 
teen pregnancy, and the movement's first national 
conference was held this past June in Madison, Wisconsin. At 
a recent meeting of the Network's national steering 
committee (which balances members from each side), 
Network director Mary Jacksteit listed ongoing and 
potential projects:
<P> 
<dd>The Network's Task Force on Adoption has met 
with leaders of several adoption education groups, and 
is seeking ways to counter negative publicity about 
that option with accurate information. The Task Force 
intends to develop an educational program for direct 
service providers, media messages and programs, and 
an educational program for adolescents and their families.
<P> 
<dd>The Action Initiative Pilot Program on Teen 
Pregnancy was conducted in Buffalo, NY. Nearly a year 
of preparation went into a two-day forum involving 
fifty adults and ten teens, who generated a list of seven 
areas of common ground. The next phase of this project 
will examine how to move forward in action on these items.
<P> 
<dd>A new working paper will be developed between 
an Operation Rescue activist and an abortion clinic 
administrator. Topic: abortion clinic demonstrations.
<P> 
<dd>A team will explore the feasibility of creating a 
data bank of facts about abortion that neither side 
disputes, and possibly a glossary as well. This would be an 
&quot;unbiased source&quot; available to the press and public. 
Some conflicts regarding details of the abortion issue are 
not based in philosophical disagreement, but only 
uncertainty about facts, and the Network may be able to 
defuse some unnecessary conflict this way.
