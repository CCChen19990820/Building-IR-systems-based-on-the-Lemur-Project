MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i>, we stand with the American Family
Association and recognize Pornography Awareness Week.

<p>

Pornography permeates our society in a variety of 
forms, most of which we try to keep from children.  Yet 
pornography has entered a new, more accessible frontier, 
cyberspace.  Child pornography and other hard-core obscenity 
travels through cyberspace at an alarming pace and not only 
reaches children, who are often more adept on the computer 
than their parents, but also abuses children by portraying 
them in a sexual manner.

<p>

In fact, it is not illegal to send a child hard-core filth 
through e-mail or to make it easy for kids to 
find obscene pictures of sex and sexual-mutilation deaths.
Children, women, and men, though pornography addiction, are 
all victims of a multi-million-dollar pornography industry. 
And it is of particular concern now, because President 
Clinton has pledged to get every school hooked up on the 
Internet, a sometimes dangerous computer playground.
Tonight we talk to two key players in this crucial battle 
against pornography.

<p>

But first, let's talk about the election less than 
one week away.  The majority of U.S. voters are women, whose 
voices both inside and outside the beltway can no longer be 
ignored.  It is important for conservatives and liberals 
alike to learn how to talk to this constituency of women, to 
win their hearts and their votes.

<p>

Let's hear how women at a special Heritage 
Foundation event addressed this gender issue, as we take you 
Behind the Headlines.

[Segments from The Heritage Foundation Conference 
entitled "Women, Politics, and the 1996 Elections," held 
September 27, 1996, follow:]

<p>

MS. BLAIR: In America today, the term "working 
family" is practically an oxymoron.  You can work or you can 
have a family, but it is awfully, awfully hard to have both. 
The reason why that happens is, quite simply, the tax 
burden. The tax burden is what drives the second person in 
the family into the work force, as we have seen from the CWA 
poll, which showed that 80 percent of women, if they could, 
would stay home with their children.

<p>

What drives the tax burden?  It is often called 
women's interests, but what it really is is interest groups' 
interests.  Those are the folks who want to get every 
taxpayer in America to contribute one penny so that they can 
do this good thing, and those pennies add up, and you find 
that you've got folks working very, very hard to pay the 
government and try to manage to have a decent life for 
themselves.

<p>

If you look at the social issues, it seems to me 
that one thing we really cannot deny is that money has not 
solved those problems, and we would all have to acknowledge 
that it is going to be time and attention that solves those 
problems. Unfortunately, the more government we have, the 
more we are simply throwing money at those problems and not 
time and attention; and the more we drive women unwillingly 
into the work force and drive taxes up to take money away 
from families, the more we are simply doing the wrong thing 
for those problems.

<p>

The women who would like to be at home, the women 
who would like to be able to do volunteer work in their 
communities, so they say, would be exactly the people who 
would be doing volunteer work in their communities to help 
these social problems, who would be raising their children 
in a way that they felt confident that the children would 
turn out to be okay and solve some of those social problems.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MS. ARNETT: Let's listen to what women are 
saying.  And I think that something I am hearing today is, 
as a conservative women, I don't understand why the polls 
show that women are so overwhelmingly supporting Bill 
Clinton, because he stands for everything that I as a 
conservative woman think is contrary to our interests.

<p>

I believe that conservative women are really at 
the critical threshold of being the most important voice and 
the one that is the least heard in this debate, because 
conservative women have a sense of a society in which values 
matter and the individual and the family are the center of 
decisionmaking, not the government; in which there is a 
balance between different levels of government, where 
community service is something that we consider to be 
something that we want to do, where children and the future 
generations are something that we think about every day.

<p>

When you have a government that -- the classic 
quote -- "a government who can give you everything you want 
is a government who can take away everything you have," and 
there is just this disconnect with women being concerned 
about the future, being compassionate, wanting security, and 
yet all of the programs that have been shown by liberal 
agendas in which government controls the center of power are 
against the things that women most, in my sense, value.

<p>

So I think, as conservative women, we have an 
obligation to help others understand the consequences of 
these government policies.  And I also think women, in a lot 
of ways, are the ones who suffer most right now from the 
policy fixes that we most need.

<p>

The taxation and the tax treatment of health 
insurance is a tremendous problem that drives many of the 
distortions that we see in the current system.  For example, 
let's take two people, one woman who is working two jobs -- 
she may be divorced, she may be a single mom -- with two 
kids, and she doesn't have health insurance.  She is 
working. She is trying to provide for herself, for her 
family. She has stretched time and resources absolutely to 
the limit. She doesn't have health insurance, but she still 
has to pay her taxes.

<p>

She works at a company as maybe a temp, and the 
chief executive officer has this incredibly generous health 
insurance policy.  The reason for that is that the only way 
you can get a generous tax break for health insurance is if 
your employer buys the policy for you.  And so you wind up 
with this incredible, incredible distortion at the center of 
our health care system that costs $100 billion a year in tax 
benefits, in which the chief executive of a company can get 
all of his medical bills paid, absolutely everything, 
probably time at a spa, mountain climbing, all part of a 
health plan.

<p>

And here is this woman who is paying her taxes and 
working as hard as she possibly can.  She doesn't have 
health insurance.  The only way that she can get health 
insurance is to either go on welfare so she can get Medicaid 
or to try to get a job that pays generous enough benefits so 
she can get health insurance.

<p>

That is a terrible problem, where you have this 
woman paying taxes to subsidize health insurance for the 
chief executive officer so he can have this generous health 
benefit plan.  That is the kind of invisible problem in the 
current system that, if women knew about that, they would be 
outraged.

<p>

On taxes, we did a little chart here -- I should 
have brought it as an overhead to show you -- that shows 
that the average family pays more in taxes than it spends 
for food, shelter, transportation, and clothing combined.  
If you visualize a bar chart in which state and local taxes 
are a higher line than those four other things -- food, 
clothing, shelter/housing, and transportation combined -- 
people don't understand that, because they see the paycheck 
that they get, and they don't understand the reason you're 
having to work a second job, the reason you're having to be 
in the work place instead of being home where you want to 
be, raising your children, as eight of ten women say they 
want to do, is because you have to pay all these taxes.

<p>

Government security, the security that you say you 
want from government, is the very reason that your life is 
being so disrupted by a government that is seeping in in its 
power and authority to either take away the resources and 
the authority that you have or to pretend to give you 
something on one hand but to take two handfuls out on the 
other side.

<p>

That kind of education, I believe, as conservative 
women, we have a responsibility to help other people 
understand that government security and compassion and the 
sense of being in control of your own life is not something 
that can come from Washington.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MS. SILBERMAN: I believe that conservatives are 
somewhat tone-deaf in the way that they relate to American 
women and the American people.

<p>

I don't know whether you all have noticed, as I 
have, in the last few weeks, there have been pundits on all 
sides of the ideological spectrum (who) having been talking 
about the "feminization of American politics" in relation to 
the gender gap.

<p>

I am absolutely fascinated by this, and I think it 
behooves conservatives to spend some time figuring out the 
whys and wherefores of this phenomenon, because it 
absolutely is a phenomenon.

<p>

At first blush, I think, to speak of the 
feminization of American politics is counterintuitive to the 
principles which many of my friends take as an article of 
faith, and that is that one's gender should not dictate 
one's ideology and that having a uterus does not 
automatically mean that you are a liberal.

<p>

It seems to me that the gender gap's inescapable 
concomitant is the feminization of American political 
discourse, and I have come to believe that both the gender 
gap and the feminization of our politics have resulted from 
the fact that conservatives are tone-deaf, and that 
everything that people hear in the media and from our 
culture really reflects the resonance of the liberal point 
of view, because conservatives just don't know how to talk 
to people.

<p>

[Segments concluded.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When we return, we'll talk to those 
in the fight against pornography, as <i>Straight Talk</i> observes 
Pornography Awareness Week.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. For more than a decade, the 
American Family Association has declared Pornography 
Awareness Week.  To help us understand why this week is so 
crucial, I am joined by two of those who have worked 
together in the battle against the multi-million-dollar 
pornography industry.  I would like to welcome Dee Jepsen, 
president of Enough is Enough, and Cathy Cleaver, the Family 
Research Council's director of legal policy.  Welcome to the 
show.

<p>

You all have been working on this issue for a long 
time, and why is that?  I think a lot of people think, well, 
I've seen some naked pictures and it hasn't really had an 
effect on me.  Why do we even need to be concerned about 
pornography?

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Well, first of all, the material that 
we are talking about is illegal material, and it has a very 
harmful effect upon society in general, and specifically, we 
have a great concern for children.

<p>

Today, with the availability of this material via 
the Internet, through the computers that kids are more 
literate at than most adults, it is a very big problem and 
getting bigger.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: We have so many ways in which we 
have seen pornography devastate communities and 
relationships. Sometimes we talk about the victims of 
pornography, and they, of course, include women and 
children, but not just women and children.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: Men also are very manipulated by 
pornography, and some don't realize it until they find that 
they have a compulsion to consume it.  So it really has no 
beneficial effect in our society, and we ought to keep 
working to try to push it away from the mainstream and into 
the fringes.

<p>

We have to tolerate some of it, some marginal 
amount, because of our free speech jurisprudence, but we 
don't have to tolerate it in front of our kids and we don't 
have to tolerate it in front of non-consenting adults.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Go ahead, Dee.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: It is ironic, too, Kristi, that some 
people in our society feel, men feel they should have the 
freedom to have this material.  The irony is that once they 
get addicted to it, which happens quite easily, they are no 
longer in control of that desire to see that material; it is 
in control of them. And we see all kinds of devastation, as 
Cathy mentioned, within family structures, and it becomes 
the hard copy, if you will, of what is playing in the 
theater of their minds, and what you see and what you hear 
does affect how you act.  I mean, that is what education is 
all about.  That is why we have multi-millions and, I am 
sure, billions of dollars spent on advertising in this 
country, to affect action.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The scope of pornography -- and 
let's just define it for a second about some of the kinds of 
pornography you are most concerned about -- I mean, a lot of 
people, they think pornography, they think <i>Playboy</i> magazine,
and I am not sure that they are really aware of the kinds of 
material that is available and that there is pornography 
that is actually illegal, because free speech seems to be a 
get-out-of-jail-free card, you know, in our society. It's a 
speech issue, so we can't stop anything.

<p>

But, Cathy, you are a lawyer.  How do the courts 
define what is illegal pornography?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: Well, the word "pornography" is not 
a legal term.  Pornography refers to any representation that 
is designed to arouse the viewer.  But then we move beyond 
the general definition into the legal terms.  There is a 
term called "obscenity," and what that doesn't mean -- 
people think that means foul speech.  It can include foul 
speech, but what obscenity is is the hard-core pornography 
that the Supreme Court says deserves no legal protection.  
The First Amendment does not protect obscenity or hard-core 
pornography.  Adults can't trade in it; they certainly can't 
give it to kids; they can't export it or import it; you 
can't sell it or buy it.

<p>

So obscenity, hard-core pornography, and that 
would be the XXX type of material or worse, simply is not a 
legal commodity.  It's like drugs:  it's illegal.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It's like bestiality, torture -- 

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Mutilation. Child pornography, of 
course, is a form of it, but all kinds of really bizarre 
behavior involving numerous men, women, animals.  It is 
beyond description.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: It is the deviant -- things people 
that aren't into this wouldn't even imagine.  It is beyond 
the imagination.  But then you look at the category of 
things, examples of which might be <i>Playboy</i> and <i>Penthouse</i>.
Those types of things have been deemed by the courts -- we 
don't always agree with this -- as being legal for adults 
but illegal for kids, and that would be legal pornography.
It is not obscene, but it can be characterized certainly as 
pornography.  And those things, we are allowed as citizens 
to enact laws or to encourage our legislators to enact laws 
to restrict the sale of these things, but we cannot prevent 
adults completely from getting them.  So that would be the 
second category of pornography.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Dee, you had a long and prestigious 
career before you came to Enough is Enough, which truly 
focuses on the hardest kind of pornography.  But what is the 
scope of pornography?  This is Pornography Awareness Week.
How many lives are touched by it?  How much money is 
involved?

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Well, we have always said, in recent 
years it is an $8 billion to $10 billion a year industry.
With the advent of the computer and the Internet as the new 
delivery system, I imagine those figures now have changed 
quite a bit. It is hard to measure. But the effect that it 
has had in human life is beyond measurement.  You know, we 
get letters, and we look into the faces and the hearts of 
people every day in one way or another that have been harmed 
by it.

<p>

Children who were molested, and one of the major 
tools in that molestation was pornography, will have a pain, 
a hurt in their heart that, even if they go through 
counseling and healing, there will always be a scar from it 
all their life. Ofttimes people that molest children were 
molested as children, not always certainly, but that is a 
factor.  Sometimes people turn to self-abuse because of 
misplaced guilt or low self-esteem.

<p>

It has a huge effect upon society, and I think it 
is even bigger than that, because it is a devaluation of 
human life, and there is no respect because there is no love 
involved.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I have certainly read in some of the 
literature on pornography that it encourages -- you know, if 
men see women as objects and they need these kinds of 
devices to become aroused, I mean, eventually, you can't 
have a healthy relationship if you can't see women as 
anything other than something that is a tool.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That is right.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: That is interesting.  Just this 
year, a psychiatrist named Dr. Gary Brooks has come out with 
a book that I would recommend called <i>The Centerfold
Syndrome</i>. It talks about how society is perpetuating and 
helping perpetuate the myth of the centerfold as the ideal 
woman, and all other women as being inadequate.  And men are 
manipulated by this, the result of which is inability to 
have intimacy with real women.

<p>

It is a fascinating book.  He is by no means any 
sort of conservative or religious leader.  He is a 
psychiatrist who has counseled men for many years about 
their issues of masculinity, and he has come out with this, 
and many people are angry with him.  The ACLU and others 
think he is a fraud.  But some feminist groups are taking 
note and saying, yes, that is what we have been trying to 
say all along.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Well, you know, every feminist, every 
religious, every non-religious, every moderate, every 
conservative, every liberal woman in this country ought to 
agree on this issue, and caring men should, also.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And I think they do.

<p>

We are going to want to hear more about this and 
what happens with children when we come back. When <i>Straight 
Talk</i> returns, we are going to bring you more about the fight 
to protect our children from hard-core pornography.  Stay 
tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>, where we are joining with the 
American Family Association in recognizing Pornography 
Awareness Week.  With me to discuss the need for such a week 
is Dee Jepsen, president of Enough is Enough, and Cathy 
Cleaver, the Family Research Council's director of legal 
policy.  Welcome back.

<p>

We were talking a little bit earlier about the 
effect that pornography has had on men, but pornography, 
Dee, has it not had an effect on crime?

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Yes, it really has, and Cathy can 
probably cite some studies about how it has affected areas 
where there is pornography available, sexually oriented 
businesses exist.  But it encourages rape, because a lot of 
this material is showing women being portrayed as being 
overpowered by men and used sexually, and demeaned and 
degraded.

<p>

It also plays a very large role in the molestation 
of children.  It very often, in fact most often, is involved 
in child molestation.  They use it not only for their own 
incitement, but they use it to break down the inhibitions of 
the child, and they use it as an instruction manual to show 
the child what to do.  And then if they photograph or film 
that molestation, producing child pornography therefore, 
they will often use it to blackmail the child into silence.

<p>

So it plays a huge role in that, and it has an 
economic effect upon communities, as well, where this is 
available.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: There are many ways in which the 
impact of pornography has been studied, and you don't 
usually hear a lot about this because there are forces out 
there -- free speech rights, absolutists -- that don't want 
people to really know this, and that is, where there is a 
high consumption of pornography, there is a correlative high 
incidence of rape and sexual attack.  There just simply is.

<p>

Oklahoma City was studied over a four-year period 
in the mid-eighties, and over 130 porn and sex businesses 
were run out of the city, and the rape rate dropped 50 
percent as it was rising in surrounding cities.  There was a 
direct correlation to the amount of pornography that was 
available and that was being consumed by the people of that 
area.

<p>

There are studies upon studies of community values 
and community worth and how housing and businesses and the 
value of that property diminishes immediately as soon as 
porn businesses move in en masse to an area.  You might 
think this is common sense, but it is also good business 
sense.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: There are many ways to approach 
fighting pornography.  There are spiritual, moral, but also 
business and just simple common-sense ways.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, the use of pornography in 
sex crimes, I think, has been really illustrated by the 
National Center on Missing and Exploited Children, which we 
have had on the show before, but just talking about how they 
use that pornography in the same way that men become 
addicted.  You become stimulated, and then you need to 
escalate the kinds of materials -- 

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right. It's an addictive process.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is, and a desensitization to the violence of it, and 
then in acting out.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There was some legislation recently, 
Cathy.  It didn't work, but it was interesting, to attempt 
to deal with the fact that pornography is used to act out 
sex crimes in a pattern of use.  Could you tell us about 
that?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: Sure. A few years ago, we were all 
fighting for the Pornography Victims Compensation Act.  What 
that would have provided would be a tool for people, 
individuals who are harmed by pornography because of either 
an attack or some other personal violence, allowing that 
individual to attempt to prove that this pornography played 
a significant factor in their harm.  That law failed, but I 
wouldn't be surprised if we see that coming up again, 
because it makes a lot of sense.

<p>

When there is a direct business injury because of 
an unreasonable and careless business operation, you can 
recover business damages.  But there is no personal damage 
recovery right now from the ill effects of pornography.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes.  What I found so interesting 
about that case was it was a case where a gentleman had a 
video, that he would kidnap a woman -- 

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: And imitate the video.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: -- and imitate the video, actually 
play and stop the video and do that thing to the woman, and 
did this repeatedly.  It was very clear that he was acting 
out that specific video.  And they were not able to do 
anything to the company that had sold him a blueprint for 
murder.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's really what it is, and people 
may not have accepted this idea at the time, but I do think, 
over a period of time -- it takes a while for the public to 
become educated to something.  You think about what has 
happened in a generation as far as smoking is concerned, 
about drinking and driving.  It took 10 or 11 years for 
MADD, Mothers Against Drunk Drivers, to bring about a public 
change of heart, a mind-set.

<p>

You have to focus on the problem, and most of 
America hasn't done that because it's not a pleasant topic. 
It is very distasteful, especially as women, to work in 
this area.  But if we don't do it, our children and 
grandchildren will suffer because we haven't.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right. I know that you all are both 
really concerned because of the Internet and its effect on 
children.  I mean, as easy or difficult as pornography may 
have been to get before, now you can type in a word, a 
single word, like "sex" or "zoo," and get all kinds of 
horrible bestiality or any kind of molestation information 
coming up.

<p>

I was really disturbed to learn recently that 
there are some words on the Internet which are common, like 
"recipe" or the most common words that someone might type 
in, that pornographers have been putting those common words 
on their screens just to bring up the pornography, even if 
their screen has nothing to do with it.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: If Clinton really does have the 
Internet in every school in America, what are you all going 
to be concerned about?

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Well, we are very, very concerned.
In fact, Enough is Enough has revised its whole strategic 
plan to focus at this point in time on making the Internet 
safe for children.  That is a huge job, but it is a growing 
technology, and with, as you say, every child being able to 
have access to a computer by the year 2000, which is four 
years away, every parent and grandparent and teacher in this 
country ought to be concerned, and we ought to be doing 
everything we can to address that.

<p>

We feel, frankly, that it is going to take a 
multifaceted approached.  We need tough legislation with 
aggressive law enforcement.  We need an educated public, 
especially parents.  We need a technology industry that 
becomes family-friendly, and I think that is not only a 
civic responsibility, but I think it is a good marketing 
approach, and I think we are going to see more of that as 
time goes by.

<p>

We will need an international coordinated effort 
as time goes by, also, because it is an enormous problem.
It is not just in the United States where there is concern; 
it is growing around the world.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, Cathy, I know you and I 
have talked about this on occasion, but there has been a sad 
increase in molestation and rapes of children, of younger 
children, 8-year-olds molesting 4-year-olds and 7-year-olds 
and infants.  I mean, we are really seeing little children 
with not a -- and what has been interesting in some of the 
cases is their arguing that the children did not have 
criminal intent because they didn't understand, although 
they did act out a sexual molestation of a younger child.
Is it accurate to say that pornography on very young 
children has even a stronger effect than on adults?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: Well, it can.  It can absolutely 
have a stronger effect, and I think that what this 
highlights is how many liberal activists like to experiment, 
frankly, with our children, experiment with their new 
agenda.

<p>

The American Library Association, for instance, as 
a matter of policy, says it will never use screening 
mechanisms on computers in libraries, even when a child as 
young as 10 years old or younger sits down at that computer.

<p>

In my opinion, that is a reckless disregard for 
children, and that is really experimenting with their lives. 
And then when we see these cases, we can see how truly 
devastating this can be for children.

<p>

There are many other ways in which we sort of 
experiment with children with pornography.  It is absolutely 
dehumanizing.  In the recent case on computer pornography, 
we saw ACLU experts come up on the stand and say, "I show my 
5-year-old hard-core pornography."  This is supposed to be 
some sort of psychologist, sexologist, or something.  And he 
was applauded, and he was one of their star witnesses.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is amazing.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Yes, it sure is.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: Now, this is just completely 
unhuman, and we seem to have checked out our common sense at 
the door on some of these issues with kids.

<p>

But pornography can completely ruin a child's 
impression of the world, himself, his body, other people, 
and it's like a poison, and we've got to be careful not to 
feed kids.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We're going to have to hear more 
about this in a moment.  Following this commercial break, 
we'll continue our discussion, and we hope you'll stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Joining me tonight to talk 
about Pornography Awareness Week is Dee Jepsen, president of 
the Enough is Enough Campaign, and Cathy Cleaver, the Family 
Research Council's director of legal policy.  Welcome back 
again to our show.

<p>

You know, one thing that really struck me about 
the pornography discussions, we have all agreed, on a whole, 
in a society that some information is not appropriate for 
children.  You know, we no more give children guns, even 
though guns are legal in certain settings, or medicines, 
even though certain narcotics are legal in certain settings, 
than we give them pornography.  You can't sell it over a 
counter, or in a video store they couldn't check it out.

<p>

But on the Internet, I was shocked to learn 
recently that it is legal to e-mail a child the most graphic 
obscenity, and there is no law to stop it; that somehow on 
the computer world the law is void or suspended or 
something.  How do we explain that?

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: It is a very difficult thing to deal 
with, and Cathy might talk about some of the legal 
intricacies of it.  But we have had some victories in recent 
days. We were able to see the Communications Decency Act 
passed.  It is now being challenged in the courts and will 
be going to the Supreme Court.  Cathy probably knows more 
about that than I.  And we also saw a bill pass that made 
computer-generated child pornography illegal, just like 
child pornography per se is illegal.

<p>

Today, you look at modern movies and you see how 
that which you know is not real becomes real before your 
eyes, and they can do that on the computers, and that 
material is still used in the same way that other child 
pornography is used by pedophiles.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So, basically, although we know 
there were no dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, they could create 
them.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Exactly.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So if you created children for 
obscene pictures, that also would be illegal.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right. That's right, and this 
material now being available by computer makes every home 
and school and library, every place there is a computer 
outlet hooked to the Internet, a site of delivery or 
distribution for pornography.  That is an appalling 
situation.

<p>

Cathy mentioned earlier about those within the 
library community that do not want to have any kind of 
filter system so children cannot -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And that's our taxpayer-funded 
libraries, too.  I mean, let's be clear.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  That's right.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: But some of these very same people 
would be so supportive of trying to create a risk-free 
environment in the area of toys and everything else that 
children are involved with, and they want quality control on 
everything, and I am not knocking that at all.  All I am 
saying is, this is what we are pouring into children's 
minds, and somewhere logic has become convoluted in that 
whole argument.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: We really treat both pornography, 
which we have been struggling with, and now the Internet 
with kid gloves, I think.  In the next few months we are 
going to be seeing at the Supreme Court the ACLU and other 
pornography magazine distributors, their challenge against 
this computer pornography law.  So there are many anti-pornography 
groups -- Enough is Enough, Family Research 
Council, and others -- who are trying to defend this law 
because it makes sense.

<p>

Guccione, the publisher of <i>Penthouse</i>, is now 
filing suit, we understand, against the military anti-pornography 
law, which says that we ought not sell pornography on our military bases.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: At a discounted rate.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: At a discount to our servicemen, yes.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: So that makes sense.  The law makes 
sense.  The challenge doesn't make any sense.  But it's a 
constant battle.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's where he makes his money.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: That's where he makes his money, so 
it makes sense to him.  There is a battle in our courts 
always, and there is a really a battle for the hearts and 
minds of the people of our society.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, here is an interesting 
counter to that.  Let's look at what has happened in 
television.  You have the President for the V-chip, 
assuming, of course, that the government decides what should 
be blocked as violence.  And you've got all of these so-called 
child advocates favoring pornography and pornography 
distribution, but on the other hand saying we must mandate 
more educational television, and we must govern advertising 
on television for its impact on children; we have to be 
harsher on cigarette and alcohol ads, so that even the 
presence of Joe Camel on a race car is anti-child.

<p>

And these same people who seem to think that Joe 
Camel on a race car will drive children to smoking don't 
think that killing people in a slasher film will have any 
effect on them at all.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That is a great example.  That is 
exactly right.  It makes no sense whatsoever.  But I really 
believe, if we talk about it long enough, that the American 
public are finally going to have the light bulb go on, and 
they are going to say, "Wait a minute.  There's something 
wrong here, and we're going to have to do something about 
it."

<p>

You know, homes and libraries and schools across 
this country should be at least installing blocking 
technology, and now there is new technology that can be 
installed, second generation, at the server level.  And we 
are going to be doing everything we can to get that done.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We just have a couple minutes left. 
Tell us how people could find out about that.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Well, one thing they could do is 
contact our office.  That telephone number is 703-278-8343, 
and we could get material to them.  We would be happy to do 
that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There is a little bit of technology. 
I know Cathy has been concerned about how thorough it can 
be, but it would be something.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That is right.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: It should be done.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: It's a beginning.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: It's a beginning. Many parents have 
decided simply not to have the Internet in their homes if 
they have children.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: We hear it all the time.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: And if I had children, right now, I 
don't think I would have the Internet in my home.  The 
software blocking mechanisms are very inadequate, and it 
only takes one picture to really assault a child.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: And so you might want to consider 
that if you are a parent now with kids, just not bringing 
the Internet in your home until it gets better, until these 
laws start to be enforced.  But at all costs, you ought to 
employ, find out which software blocking program is 
esteemed.  Enough is Enough has some ideas about which ones 
are good programs, and they are a good resource for parents.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to have people 
call us for that information.

<p>

I would like to thank both of you, and this is not 
over.  I know the court case is going to come up the first 
of the year, and we are going to want to hear back.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will present 
another aspect of how this year's campaigns address women 
and the so-called women's issues.  Stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>.

<p>

I was fortunate to join the discussion at The 
Heritage Foundation, which you caught a glimpse of earlier 
in the show. These panels showed that there really are no 
kneejerk women's positions, although two issues, education 
and the life issue, are usually played as if there are.
Let's see how those issues unfold as <i>Straight Talk</i> presents 
some Homefront News.

<p>

<p>

[Segment from The Heritage Foundation Conference 
entitled "Women, Politics, and the 1996 Elections," held 
September 27, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I want to just put forward that 
there are two issues that I am going to address that I think 
are fundamental to our natures as women.  Harkening back to 
this obsession with feminine hygiene, I think there is 
something true about women's fundamental physical nature 
that makes you very practical about your children and about 
not just the children that you have but that you could have 
or that other women are having, that we are regularly 
reminded that we are not alone in the world, that we have a 
generation to think about before us and that we come from 
something, and I think it makes women, in particular, very 
practical.

<p>

There are two issues that I wanted to address that 
I think are fundamental issues for their importance to 
women, although I don't want to box them in as women's 
issues, but also the problem with them, from my perspective, 
and that launched me on a heated diatribe with Karen, was 
the way in which they are discussed.

<p>

Those issues that I think are very interesting to 
women are education and life.  And again, because of their 
fundamental connection to our interest in children and to 
our interest in our society's longevity, it is a long-term-thinking 
approach.  Both education and the life issue 
connect us to the future.  Both of them say that we are 
going to be building something and we are concerned about 
it.

<p>

But what irritates me about these two issues is 
that they are described in such kneejerk fashion, and I 
didn't get a chance to ask this question, but I think that 
women, in particular, have to be a little more irritated 
with the way in which the debate goes, because its competing 
slogan -- education, tax thing, you know, education, 
program, education this, education that -- as though somehow 
we are too unintelligent, A, to make our own decisions, B, 
to understand a greater context of the debate.

<p>

And so on the issue of education in general, at 
Family Research Council, I will tell you right up front, we 
think that people are smart enough to choose schools that 
have opportunity, and to take tax dollars and set them up as 
a sacred cow in a school system in which you have no input, 
in which groups like the People for the American Way or the 
American Library Association will label your calling the 
school an act of censorship, not because anything happened 
but because a parent accidentally got involved in the 
process, that somehow this is an offense to the educational 
system because you had a thought about your child's 
education.

<p>

And so what we have tried to do in terms of the 
education debate is say, look, people are intelligent.  They 
can make intelligent decisions, and the education debate is 
so jargon-full and practicality-absent.

<p>

And so what I wanted to say to the Dole campaign, 
if they were listening, is it's not to talk about education 
but to talk about it specifically and with compassion, 
because I don't think that Bill Clinton wins in the 
specifics, but I think sometimes he wins in the compassion, 
that as women we are very concerned about what happens to 
our children, and sometimes the green-eyeshade approach, 
which is a Republican-heavy approach, doesn't cut it for us.

<p>

I am not per se -- I can tell you for myself, if 
the money that my husband and I paid out in tax dollars was 
effective, I probably would be thrown out of the Republican 
Party for saying, "Well, sure, it's a lot, but, you know, 
they're doing something."

<p>

But the problem with a lot of people is they're 
taking a lot of my money and doing nothing.  They're doing 
nothing.  It is not just that my money disappears but that 
it ineffectively disappears.

<p>

I have been working for the end of the Department 
of Education for a long time, and I want to tell you why.
Seven cents out of every dollar spent in the local school 
comes from the Federal Government, but the majority of the 
mandates for education come from the Federal Government.  So 
for a toehold of dollars, we get a barrelful of policies, 
and none of them to our liking.

<p>

We have 150 education programs; 16,200 employees 
here in Washington, D.C.; a budget of more than $3 billion, 
bigger than five other departments, and for that we get 
nothing.  We get nothing.  And what I am arguing is that 
education might be a fundamental interest to us, but if you 
don't explain why what you are doing will help people do 
better, it is insignificant if it is less expensive, and 
that that is a problem with the education debate today.

<p>

In the same token, I am unimpressed with Bill 
Clinton's, "How about $1,500 for a trade school of any 
kind?"  Well, what if I didn't want to do that?  What if I 
had different goals for my money?  Why should Bill Clinton 
dictate for me where I spend my education goals, because 
then the government still is making choices for me.

<p>

The way that we have to talk about education 
today, though, has to be both pragmatic and specific and 
compassionate.  We cannot merely be cutting the dollars.  We 
have to be talking about where they're going to go.

<p>

I, for one, am a gigantic advocate of school 
choice, and you are always seeing people say, "Oh, you're 
going to get people out the process.  They are not going to 
get involved."  We have had several very successful school 
choice programs in the United States that didn't violate 
anyone's wall between church and state.  The first one was 
the GI bill, which educated a generation successfully and 
gave them money to go to the school of their choice, and the 
entire nation prospered.

<p>

The second one had to do with Pell grants and 
other educational grants that went to people to go to the 
school of their choice, and again, a tremendous success from 
choice.

<p>

In the same way -- let's not argue about the 
details today, because maybe we wouldn't all agree -- but 
can we not agree that people can make better choices and 
that it is not just the money but it is the way in which it 
is spent?

<p>

So I am a little annoyed sometimes by everyone 
trying to poke my woman button by mentioning education but 
not taking the time to explain how your program works, 
number one, and whether it is even a better use of my money 
than a couple of ideas that I have, frankly.  And so we have 
to start talking about education issues in a compassionate way.

<p>

And I go to the life issue again.  The research is 
clear, and I can go through the numbers but I will skip 
that, that women are pro-life (more) than men.  Again, I 
think it is a fundamental thing, that we understand 
something about what is happening on that area.  But again, 
I am painted as a caricature of myself in the public debate, 
and I reject it.

<p>

Partial birth, yesterday, I think, a very sad vote 
in which viable, healthy children can be stabbed in the base 
of the skull in the name of choice.  Even if a person is for 
abortion, is there no line that goes too far?  Is this the 
oozy of the NRA, frankly?

<p>

But let me take a look at a different abortion 
issue from the standpoint of a woman, and that is RU-486.
Let's say that you really think there should be abortion 
somewhere along the line.  So let's just say, yeah, we want 
abortions to be safe, legal, and rare, but certainly safe.
So we see the Clinton Administration lobbying for RU-486,
which is a chemical abortifacient.

<p>

This morning on NPR I awoke to the very 
fascinating and meaningless knowledge that, in the 1960s, 
Procter and Gamble developed Olestra, which is a pretend fat 
substitute that they will now use to make potato chips, and 
the consumer groups are going to go to court to stop it 
because it might not be healthy, despite the fact that they 
have been testing it for 30 years.

<p>

And in a six-month test on RU-486 in which we 
don't understand its impact on women's long-term fertility, 
whether these drugs originally designed for cancer and for 
ulcers might build up and be a toxin in your system, whether 
there is any impact on your ability to have future children 
-- we don't know any of this, but you know, because it is 
abortion and it's a "woman's issue," we are going to force 
it through and we're going to have abortion, thank God, with 
this chemical.

<p>

I just want to encourage us in our discussion as 
women of the life issue and of the education issues to put 
our practical and our nature-oriented issues to bear and to 
ask harder questions of people.  I think these two issues 
are powerful as long as we discuss them pragmatically and 
compassionately.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to a special live edition of 
<i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. I'm your 
host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight, we will bring you election 
analysis from a family perspective.  What does this split 
decision between the White House and Congress mean about the 
policies that will affect your family?

<p>

We've got some special guests to answer that 
question, but none more important than you, and we'll be 
taking your calls throughout the show.

<p>

With me tonight is former Presidential candidate 
Ambassador Keyes, who is founder and chairman of the board 
of the Declaration Foundation.  He is a syndicated columnist 
and host of his own nationally syndicated radio show, 
<i>America's Wakeup Call</i>.

<p>

Also with us is Marjorie Dannenfelser, the 
president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which is a 
nonpartisan, pro-life political action committee founded to 
help elect pro-life women to public office.

<p>

And another member of the Dannenfelser family 
joins us, her husband Marty, who leads the Family Research 
Council's Government Relations Department.  He heads the 
pro-life fight on Capitol Hill.

<p>

Welcome, each of you, to the show.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I appreciate your joining with us, 
and we will look forward to hearing what our viewers have to 
say to you.

<p>

Ambassador, let's start with you.  As you evaluate 
what just happened in the election -- Bill Clinton has 
returned, the Republicans have the House and Senate -- what 
do you think the take-home message is of the 1996 election?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think it is pretty clear.
Bob Dole attempted to run a campaign that was strictly based 
on economic issues against a President whose great 
vulnerabilities were on the moral front. It was an insane 
strategy.  I said so for months.

<p>

In the last three weeks, four weeks, he tried to 
shift and talk more about what they called the character 
issues, but it was out of context.  He hadn't addressed the 
moral crisis that this country faces, and so, stupidly, 
pollsters were able to ask people, "Which do you think is 
more important, the issues or character?" when in point of 
fact character is an element of all the important issues, 
and that distinction showed that the homework hadn't been 
done.

<p>

The relationship between America's crisis in the 
family, in the schools, on the streets, the crisis of crime, 
even in the area of health care, you can see the impact of 
behavior that is resulting from the moral breakdown in the 
society.  Every one of these issues is in fact a reflection 
of the moral crisis, and to make a separation between the 
issue of character, the moral issues, and the tremendous 
issues that we face as a people, particularly as they affect 
our family and our kids, this is insane.  But I think it 
reflected the deficiency of the Dole camp.

<p>

On the House side, I think what we saw, however, 
was a confirmation of what began in 1994.  Essentially, the 
conservatism of America was confirmed in this election by a 
President who felt he had to run as a conservative, even if 
it meant lying all the time, and by a Congress that, in the 
end, is in the hands of an even more strongly conservative 
and strongly morally conservative Republican coalition than 
was the case before the election.

<p>

So I think, all told, the outcome of the election 
is a strong message that we had better start taking the 
moral issues seriously.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And everybody was a pro-family 
conservative.  I woke up to NPR one morning, National Public 
Radio, to hear Bill Clinton explain how the liberal, Paul 
Wellstone, is really a conservative.  I thought, boy, 
conservative values really must be playing if Paul thinks he 
has to be one.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

Marty, when you look at the Congress, do we have a 
more conservative Congress?  It would appear from the 
campaigns, anyway, that everyone is a conservative today.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, on paper, I would say 
certainly the Senate is more pro-family conservative.  You 
might look at who won and who lost in the House and see a 
narrow diminution of the strength in the House.  But you had 
a gap between the House and Senate last time, whereas the 
House was the real stronger body taking the lead on those 
issues, and some of them would get tied up in the Senate.

<p>

So I think the House is probably still 
sufficiently strong to push forward on many of these issues 
and now, hopefully, with some of the House members going 
over to the Senate, like Tim Hutchinson and Sam Brownback 
and so on, to add to that strength, they will be able to 
carry through and send more issues down to Mr. Clinton, who 
will have an opportunity to then show us what a pro-family 
conservative he is by signing some of these bills that we 
heard about on the Christian radio ads, and so on.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Tim Hutchinson has got to be a great 
story. I mean, here you've got Bill Clinton from Arkansas, 
and then you have, in his own Senate seat, he cannot put a 
Democrat in there.  We get not just a Republican but a 
conservative Republican.  We don't have a William Weld kind 
of Republican in that chair.  What do you make of that?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, you've had people like 
that getting elected ever since -- in Arkansas -- ever since 
Bill Clinton got elected President.  Mike Huckabee got 
elected lieutenant governor immediately after Bill Clinton, 
and now he is the governor.  He succeeded in the wake of a 
scandal involving the governor.  He was prepared to run for 
that Senate seat himself, but when the incumbent governor 
dropped out, he had to go fill it, and Tim Hutchinson was 
able to step into that void and fill that seat, and the 
trend in Arkansas is very much towards pro-family 
conservatives.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, Marjorie, you track the 
pro-life issue, and speaking for myself, personally, I had 
to be disappointed that the pro-life issues, they certainly 
motivate a lot of people at the grass roots, but at the 
Presidential level, there was almost a vacuum.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What do you see on the pro-life 
front in this election?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: On the Presidential level, you 
mean, or on the congressional level?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: On any of the levels.  Where is the 
good news for us?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Well, in several of our 
congressional races, abortion was a very high-profile issue, 
and the Susan B. Anthony List only picks candidates that are 
going to be very aggressive on the issue.  So where there 
are opportunities, our candidates were very forthright.  And 
certainly in some districts it is going to play better; in 
some districts it is just going to play not as well.

<p>

One of our best pieces of news is that Jo Ann 
Emerson, who ran for her husband's open seat in Missouri, 
beat the Emily's List candidate, whose name is Emily 
Firebaugh -- how about that?  And I understand she was.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

We really found that when our candidates used 
especially the partial-birth abortion ban issue, which no 
human being alive can be for partial-birth abortions, for 
the first time they had the courage to talk about it, a lot 
of candidates had the courage to talk about it because they 
knew that everyone was behind them, and their opponents were 
in retreat on that issue, because we focused on challenges. 
We were challenging incumbents, and all of them had voted 
against the ban.  So it worked well in those elections.

<p>

The problem was that there was a very concerted 
national effort to oust all those great Republican pro-life 
women who ran and won with our help, and they were 
successful in many cases.  So we had sort of a wash.  Picked 
up two, lost two.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I was watching CNN today and was 
very interested to hear that the pro-life issue is not 
influential anymore.  Do we agree with that?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think there is going to be a 
lot of brainwashing garbage going on in the media right now 
in order to camouflage the truth of this election.  But I 
think that the aim of many things that happened this time 
around on the part of an establishment that included a lot 
of Republicans, meaning no offense, was to try to drive the 
moral issues, not just the pro-life issue but the moral 
issues, out of American politics.  They did not succeed.

<p>

I think there was a concerted effort to do that 
during the Republican primary season.  That failed.  I think 
that it was clear at the convention that an effort was made 
from the podium to lie about the real nature of the 
Republican Party and its issues, and that effort from the 
podium succeeded, with the result that Bob Dole never 
consolidated his base and ran one of the poorest campaigns 
we have ever seen in terms of an ability to consolidate 
support within the Republican ranks.

<p>

So I think that there was thinking that said we 
are going to use this election to get rid of the influence 
of these moral conservatives, and it simply did not work.  
And indeed, I think the election results, particularly with 
the defeat of prominent pro-abortion liberals, as I call 
them, the Colin Powell liberals, like William Weld, like 
Zimmer, I think it really put a wrench in the works of those 
people who had written their stories already about how this 
election proved that the moral issues were no good, the pro-
life issue was no good, Republicans were going to have to 
broaden their base by picking the likes of Susan Molinari 
and Christine Todd Whitman.  All of that is laughable in the 
face of the results of yesterday's election.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The Northeast was great.  I mean, 
there is Bob Smith, who struggles to a victory, and then 
you've got the Zimmers and the Welds who don't.  I mean, 
Zimmer took Christine's formula.  Marty, what did you think 
about that?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, it was interesting the 
way the networks were so quick to pronounce Bob Smith dead 
last night.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: They all projected that he was 
defeated early on in the evening -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: They had to resuscitate him.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: -- and he cast himself as Mark 
Twain today, that reports of my death have been greatly 
exaggerated.  But they all made these projections, and here 
was Bob Smith, who had been the champion of the partial-
birth abortion (ban), who had taken heat for talking about 
this on the floor of the Senate, which was not proper.  You 
know, that was not the type of thing you should do on the 
floor of the Senate, after all.  And yet they didn't, in the 
end, really get him.

<p>

And they called another state, the whole state of 
North Carolina, going the other way early in the evening, as 
well, and that came out five points in the opposite 
direction.  So it was very interesting.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I don't know if Bob Smith saw 
it, but I thought that there was a real Providential irony 
in the fact that Bob Dole wanted to be the one who could 
hold a newspaper that had printed a false headline, and to 
do that, he abandoned essentially the prominent position of 
the moral issues.  Bob Smith stuck with those issues, and he 
could have held a copy of the Washington Post that said, 
"Smith Loses."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, he could have.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I mean, God gave him that 
victory because he had stood firm on the right issue.  I 
deeply believe this is true.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to talk more 
about this in a second.  When we return, we will open the 
phone lines so you can join the discussion with tonight's 
very special guests.  You can reach us by the phone, 1-800-
5000-NET, or by fax at 202-544-2405.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>, where we are coming to you live 
to talk about the election results.  I am joined by 
Ambassador Alan Keyes; Marty Dannenfelser, who heads the 
Family Research Council government relations operation; and 
Marjorie Dannenfelser, who is head of the pro-life PAC, the 
Susan B. Anthony List.  You can call us at 1-800-5000-NET or 
reach us by fax at 202-544-2405. Welcome back, everyone.

<p>

Marjorie, I was intrigued by a comment you made at 
the break about what we should have learned about how to 
choose our issues.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes. I was just following up 
on what Alan was talking about earlier about how candidates 
choose what they talk about in campaigns, and when they 
decide to open the newspaper and look at whatever poll data 
might happen to be out that day and choose that to talk 
about, they are destined to lose, because it never gets 
below the epidermis and you never reach the heart.

<p>

That is what happened to Bob Dole, and it happens 
to candidates around the country, too.  It is not just on 
the Presidential level.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is true.

<p>

We have our first caller on the line.  We have 
Carmen from Flagstaff, Arizona.  Carmen, do you have a 
question for our panel of guests?

<p>

FLAGSTAFF (AZ) CALLER: I have two comments.
Yesterday when I was going to vote, and I asked a lot of 
people that said, "We're not going to vote" -- people in the 
office, people everywhere -- "We're not going to vote.  You 
can buy the electoral votes, so my vote doesn't count."  
They said, "The unions already bought those votes, no matter 
how people vote, so it doesn't really matter." They 
wouldn't even think about going to vote.

<p>

The other comment is that -- I said it in 1992.  
King Solomon said it in the book of Proverbs.  "When the 
wicked are in authority, transgression increases."  So don't 
be too surprised if our moral values go all the way down, we 
see more terrorist attacks, more of everything.  That is 
what has been happening in the last four years.

<p>

But my biggest concern is the electoral vote, what 
people said yesterday.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's a really good point, Carmen. 
You know, Marty, we were looking at that this morning a 
little bit, about the fact that even though the unions put 
all that money in, and a lot of people had the same idea 
that Carmen did, that a lot of the freshmen survived despite 
$35 million or $40 million worth of onslaught.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: They did. They went out there 
and in some cases created a backlash.  They were pointing 
out that this was a lot of money coming in just to distort 
what they had really done. These were outside groups that 
really had no interest in informing their own constituents 
but rather to create this distorted image to the more 
general public, and it did create some backlash in certain 
areas.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think there was a concerted 
effort, too, that dovetailed with what the newspapers and 
the television people were doing.  I can't help but think it 
was no accident that you had these wildly exaggerated poll 
numbers, as it turned out, and that in fact the most 
accurate pollster turns out to have been Zogby, who all 
along showed a much tighter race, going at one point to less 
than four percentage points.  And if that had been the kind 
of polling that had been characteristic, then all along it 
would have been portrayed as a tight race with Bob Dole 
fluctuating, and I think we would have seen a very different 
mentality among voters in terms of participation, interest, 
because they would not have had the sense that it was a 
forgone conclusion.

<p>

So the union money plus the media presumption 
about the outcome, I think, helped to induce apathy.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think it did, too.

<p>

Let's take another quick caller.  We have on the 
line Chuck from Ohio.  Chuck, what do you have to say?

<p>

XENIA (OH) CALLER: Good evening.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Hi!

<p>

XENIA CALLER: Thanks for taking my call.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thanks for calling.

<p>

XENIA CALLER: I am a conservative Christian. I 
am also a retired UAW member, so I was involved in unions, 
too, and I am just so glad that I am not working now or I 
would really be raising Cain, because I am one of the 40 
percent that voted Republican.

<p>

I saw Mr. Keyes on <i>Cornerstone Live</i> back in March.
Do you remember that?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Yes.

<p>

XENIA CALLER: You were on there with Elizabeth 
Dole, and it was right after your little escapade in 
Atlanta.

<p>

Well, I voted for Buchanan in the primary, but I 
wanted to make two points.  I was just wondering why 
Elizabeth Dole didn't have a little more influence with her 
husband in this partial-birth ban.  Now, I was wondering 
when it was ever going to come up.  It finally came up.  I 
followed him all over the country on satellite, on KU band, 
and he addressed it to just a couple thousand here and a 
couple thousand there.  He never really nationally exploited 
it.

<p>

The other point I would like to make is, right 
after the election last night, on CBS, Dan Rather thinks the 
Republican Party must pull together and move to the center 
and away from the religious right.  I can't see where he is 
coming from.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What is so ironic about that -- I 
want to hear what you have to say about that, Ambassador -- 
but the voting numbers were clear.  I know we have all heard 
them, that the best bloc of the GOP was the people of faith.
I mean, how could Dan Rather say that?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: This is why Rather wants us to 
move to the center, so we'll lose all the time.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I was sitting next to, what is his name, Bob 
Fromme(?), I think, who was Torricelli's campaign 
consultant, and he was also responsible for that despicable 
commercial that featured David Duke against the civil rights 
initiative in California.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, that is right.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: And his advice to the 
Republican Party is that you had better go with the Whitmans 
and you better leave -- and I hope you'll follow Keyes' 
advice and do all of this moral stuff because then you'll 
lose.  No, it's not true.  They want us to abandon the moral 
issues because then we'll lose consistently, as Dole just 
did, and I think that is what Dan Rather and his cronies are 
up to. They would love to see Republicans behave every time 
the way Dole and Kemp behaved this time because we'll get 
creamed as they got creamed, in the debates and before the 
electorate. That is their wish, that we should do the wrong 
thing. I think if we ignore them and instead build on the 
base of strong moral conservatism, there is a majority 
there, including especially those people, some of whom sat 
out the election this time because they weren't very 
enthused --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, definitely.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: -- some of whom we still 
haven't awakened yet to move out of the pews and into the 
voting booth.  But we're going to.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: I find it interesting, every 
four years or sometimes even on the two-year cycles, the Dan 
Rathers and people like that have the same conclusions.  
They wring their hands about negative campaigns.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's right.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: They profess that the 
candidates are not talking about the issues.  But as you 
study the news, you find out that the sound bites of the 
candidates talking about the issues get shorter and shorter. 
I think they averaged about six or seven seconds in this 
most recent campaign cycle.  And then it is the same advice. 
It was the religious right again.  No matter how strong of a 
margin they got with them, they are the ones who were 
causing them this problem.  It is always the same 
conclusion.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems to me that Bob Dole and 
Bill Clinton ran the campaign that the media would like -- 
no issues, lots of fluff, absolutely nothing of substance --
and we had the lowest voter turnout since, what, the 1920s?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes. About a million dollars 
of consultant fees will pay for that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Their idea of negative is very 
strange, too.  I mean, if you said anything at all, however 
true, about Clinton or about Democrats that brought out a 
lot of the negatives, which are there in the record, then 
that was negative campaigning.  But if you had a filthy 
piece like the Schrum(?) commercial, which basically used 
David Duke in order to do what, produce a 60-second slur 
that called everybody who supported the CCRI a racist, that 
is name calling, but they didn't consider that negative 
campaigning.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And they paid him to do that, too.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: That is right.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: I think it is important for 
people to realize how much is working against elected 
officials to do the wrong thing, you know, to make bad 
decisions, even when they are really well grounded in their 
faith when they arrive, they are still going back to their 
districts all the time, everything in Washington trends 
towards making the wrong decisions. The consultants, who 
just basically they worked on a congressional staff once and 
now they have the great position of telling other people 
what to do, I mean, they are not necessarily qualified to 
tell candidates how to run a good campaign. The 
consultants, the atmosphere of Capitol Hill.

<p>

Without the real active involvement of people out 
in the country, that will prevail, without, first of all, 
the faith and then the really active involvement of people 
out there.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It involves people.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will 
bring you more about the battle to protect pro-family 
issues.  Stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>, where we are coming to you live 
with Ambassador Alan Keyes; Marjorie Dannenfelser, president 
of the Susan B. Anthony List; and political expert Marty 
Dannenfelser of Family Research Council.  And we would also 
like to hear from you, so you can please call us at 1-800-5000-NET.

<p>

Ambassador, we were just talking about the fact 
that it is not so often that our issues are not advanced; 
they are not even -- you know, no one takes the time.  No 
one wants to do the fight, giving up before we even get 
started.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, I think you see a lot of 
that.  In fact, it is induced in a way by the media, and 
then it affects the minds of folks.  I thought it was a real 
disease on the Dole campaign, where they seemed very anxious 
to give up, I mean Scott Reed giving an interview to The New 
Yorker a week and a half before the campaign ended, that 
came out the day before the election, saying that, "I told 
Bob Dole every day, I put the poll numbers in front of him 
and said, 'You know, Bob, we might not win this one.'"

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I know.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: And I am thinking, what a thing 
for a campaign manager to be doing.  And the very night of 
the election, Nelson Warfield, two hours before the 
California polls closed, issued a statement praising Bob 
Dole for his courage in defeat.  And I am thinking, this is 
crazy, what is he up to?

<p>

But there was this mentality of preemptive 
surrender, and I am glad, actually, that at a personal level 
-- his staff apparently was very defeatist, but Dole went on 
fighting right to the end, and I think his willingness to 
put up a strong fight, not to back off and kind of collapse 
the way, unhappily, Bush did in 1992 was very important in 
helping Republicans to keep the Congress, because it buoyed 
up the party around the country psychologically; it helped a 
lot in California to keep things from getting out of hand 
there; and I think it helped to maintain the sort of 
firewall that prevented Clinton's victory from expanding 
into control of the Congress.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It could have saved the House and Senate.

<p>

We have a caller on the line from historic Valley 
Forge, Pennsylvania.

<p>

VALLEY FORGE (PA) CALLER: Oh, hi.  How are you?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Hi. Thanks for joining us.

<p>

VALLEY FORGE CALLER: When they wanted the Jews to 
repent, they showed the bodies, shriveled, and when they 
wanted people to send to Ethiopia, they showed the bloated 
bodies.  Why aren't Christians putting up billboards with a 
manger scene, with an empty manger, with the words, "I'm 
sorry, Joseph, we couldn't afford him"?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Good point.

<p>

Marjorie, you work on this pro-life issue.  What 
kinds of messages do you find really motivate people when 
you are working on them?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Well, that was very touching, 
and that was a beautiful way to put it.

<p>

I find, and we have a unique stance at the Susan 
B. Anthony List among PACs.  We really require of our 
candidates that they do two things, that they project the 
justice of changing laws to protect the unborn, and they 
project the mercy and the compassion that we have to reach 
women where they are.

<p>

I mean, the reality of this issue is that women 
have abortions, and when we have women in public office who 
are talking to women on their own terms and saying that they 
have a sense for where they are -- I mean, I think it is 
very important.  It is very important to have that 
connection, and I think it is important to have women 
discussing it in those terms.

<p>

I think what resonates the most, frankly, just on 
a debate level -- I think that ad is a great idea that the 
caller called in with -- but is, what is it?  You know, 
whenever I am debating the issue, what is an abortion?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What are you choosing?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: What is it? I mean, what is 
that "thing"?   You have to address that before you can move 
on.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Let's take one more quick caller.
We have on the line Kay from Wyoming.  Kay, do you have a 
question or a comment for our distinguished panel?

<p>

RIVERTON (WY) CALLER: I do. I have a couple 
things.  First of all, on the issues, our issues do not lend 
themselves easily to sound-bite campaigning, and until we 
break through that format that we are permitted, we are 
going to have problems getting our point across.

<p>

Dr. Keyes was pointing out about the polls, and 
you have to remember, the American press uses polls as a 
weapon, not a tool.  They try to use polls to change 
people's opinion or to frame it.  They don't use it for a 
measuring device.

<p>

My question, also, is -- the big question is, did 
the RNC learn anything this time around, and what are they 
going to foist upon us in 2000?  Are we going to have 
another left-leaning candidate and more empty issues?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, hours of conversations have 
gone into that.  I would have to say one thing, though.  I 
think that is the strength of NET as a network, to have an 
expanded conversation, and radio shows like yours.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Yes. Well, I think with 
respect to the RNC, we are just at the beginning of what is 
going to be, I believe, a very intense battle within the 
Republican Party between the grass roots, which I believe is 
overwhelmingly Reagan conservative -- pro-life, morally 
conservative, fiscally conservative, interested in 
reclaiming power from the central government and rebuilding 
the institutions of local self-government and civil society. 
I think that is the essence of the true conservatism at the 
grass roots in the Republican Party.  That is going to be 
pitted against the party elitists, the people who controlled 
the podium at the convention this time around, the people 
who had planned consistently a strategy aimed at dumping the 
moral issues, at emphasizing money above everything, and at 
trying to promote Colin Powell, Christine Whitman, others 
who basically represent the abandonment of the Republican 
Party's moral heart. We are at the beginning of that 
struggle.

<p>

I think that for the caller and for others around 
the country, what they have to realize, I think, is that in 
the next several years, we are going to have to commit 
ourselves at the grass roots to lighting fires that can be 
seen from every horizon so that nobody in the Republican 
Party structure or leadership can mistake the true sentiment 
that exists in the party at the grass roots, because it is 
going to require a lot of action; it is going to require a 
lot of persistence and perseverance on the part of people 
who are moral conservatives to keep the Republican Party 
where it belongs and to do what is necessary.  By the year 
2000, we must transform the leadership of the party.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Marty?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: On that point, I think the 
caller identifies a problem for pro-family conservatives 
that people in the major news media, the three or four major 
television networks, the newspapers on the Eastern -- you 
know, we know the newspapers, <i>New York Times</i> and others -- 
do not agree with us on these cultural issues.

<p>

But a candidate, particularly a candidate for 
President of the United States, has a unique opportunity to 
speak directly to the people.  Alan Keyes has done that, 
Ronald Reagan did that. Ronald Reagan faced a very hostile 
press.  We do hear some revisionist history from the press 
now about how nice they were to Ronald Reagan.  But those of 
us who remember the Reagan Presidency know otherwise.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's right.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Bob Dole and Jack Kemp had that 
opportunity in this campaign, and they had a moderator in 
those debates who was really a very fair-minded journalist 
who gave them some open-ended questions like, "Tell us about 
Clinton's character," or, "Tell us about the moral crisis in 
the country today," between the questioners from the 
audience in the second Presidential (debate), and they had a 
minute and a half or so to articulate these positions, and I 
don't think they did it.  They came around in circles back 
just repeating economic theory and things like that, and it 
was just absurd.

<p>

The other thing is, federal candidates can 
completely control the content of their advertising.  They 
are getting $60 million in federal funds to run a campaign. 
They can choose to do a 30-second spot, they can choose to 
do a one-minute spot, they can choose to do a five-minute, 
or Ross Perot did some half-hour spots, and they can speak 
as short or as long, within certain limits, as they want to, 
and as long as their resources will hold out, they need to 
identify the message and articulate it to the people.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And we are going to have to demand that.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: And Bob Dole obviously didn't 
do that, and he paid the price for it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's right.

<p>

We're going to have to talk more about this in a 
second.  Following this commercial break, we will continue 
our discussion about yesterday's election results and how 
they affect you.  Please stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Joining me tonight to discuss 
how yesterday's elections affect pro-family issues is 
Ambassador Alan Keyes, a steadfast leader in the pro-family 
movement, both inside and outside the beltway.  Also with us 
are Marjorie and Marty Dannenfelser.  Marjorie is the 
president of the pro-life PAC, the Susan B. Anthony List.
Marty heads Family Research Council's government relations 
efforts.  We are taking your calls at 1-800-5000-NET.

<p>

Coming back, Marty, a lot of us have been talking 
about who is going to be RNC chair.  Haley Barbour says he 
is stepping down.  Is this the kind of power struggle that 
pro-family people need to watch?  Where is the leadership 
going to come from?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, there are many different 
factions of people around the country, and people have 
formed their own coalitions.  They will look at who the 
members of the Executive Committee of the Republican 
National Committee are in the 50 states around the country 
and try to formulate a strategy for reaching them.

<p>

I think that is something; if people can have an 
influence on that process, it is probably worth doing.  But 
I don't think we should allow ourselves to become fixated on 
that, because the ultimate way that you nominate a candidate 
is at the grass-roots level, is to send delegates to the 
national convention, and it is the delegates who ultimately 
nominate the candidate -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: People who manage leadership.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: -- and then the candidate who 
sets the tone for the party and for the convention and for 
the campaign.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The Bush tone kind of was in our mouth this time.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I do think it is important, 
though, right now to try to work towards someone who is not 
going to be pushing what was, as I said, a conscious 
strategy of jettisoning the moral issues, which Haley 
Barbour was very open about.  I mean, he went around the 
country telling everybody who would listen for a while there 
that we had to get that pro-life plank out of the platform, 
we had to put these issues aside, and they were divisive, 
and all of this.

<p>

We don't need that.  What we need is someone who 
is going to articulate in a persuasive way the reasons for 
the positions that the Republican Party takes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: TO explain what we believe.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Exactly, and to do it in a way 
that will make sense to people and make them realize that 
the things we talk about are the issues.  They are not 
separate from the issues, as the media tries to imply.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Let's take a quick caller.  We have 
John on the line from the great state of Texas.  John, hi.
Do you have a comment or a question?

<p>

MIDLAND (TX) CALLER: Good evening. How are you 
doing?  I've got a quick comment, and then I've got a 
question for Alan.  I've heard all day long on the radio 
that women voted for Clinton because of abortion rights.  If 
that's true, I really feel sorry for a lot of these women.
I have Catholic friends -- I am Catholic and I even have 
Catholic friends that I know voted for Clinton, and I really 
feel sorry for them.

<p>

Alan, I was also at <i>Cornerstone</i>. I voted for you 
in the primary, and I saw you on TV last night, and you said 
something about you weren't a good speaker and you cheated.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Me?

<p>

MIDLAND CALLER: Keep on cheating, brother. We love it. We love you.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Oh, I was joking.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MIDLAND CALLER: Where does your show originate from?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: The show originates from 
Rosslyn, Virginia.  We are on 35 stations now around the 
country and building.  So, hopefully, we will reach into 
your area sometime soon.  I hope so.

<p>

MIDLAND CALLER: Thanks a million for your show.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Can I comment for a minute, 
though, on this gender gap thing?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, the gender gap.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Before we even start to take it 
seriously.  I think it's a phony issue.  I do not believe 
there is a gender gap.  I think the gender gap is in fact a 
false symptom of something else.  And the simple fact of the 
matter, which nobody wants to really dwell on but which is 
the truth, is this:  Take Hispanic and black women out of 
the mix, and the gender gap evaporates.  It is not there.

<p>

And what does that mean?  It means you don't have 
a gender gap.  The gender gap is actually a symptom of the 
fact that we have large minority groups, Hispanics and 
blacks, who are captives of the Democratic Party; that 
amongst the white electorate, Republicans and Democrats 
compete pretty evenly still in terms of their ability to win 
the allegiance of voters; but that when you continue to get 
these lopsided majorities amongst Hispanics and blacks for 
Democrats, that produces a distorted outcome.

<p>

I think that is a very telling fact.  I am going 
to refuse to talk about this gender gap thing anymore 
because I think it is all a lie.  If one alteration makes 
the gap go away, that means that the true cause of the gap 
is not gender, it is something else, and this something else 
in this particular case is in fact racial politics, the 
politics of terrorizing minorities, which I think has been 
once again practiced in this election year by the Democrats.

<p>

But I also think it is going to change, because 
the Democrats have lost their base in the Congress which 
they used to buy off the leadership in the minority 
communities, and I think, over time, without the gravy 
train, they are going to have a very hard time continuing to 
dangle things they can't deliver in front of a coopted 
leadership, and people in the community are going to say, 
"Well, wait a minute.  We'd better start making our peace 
with these Republicans because, otherwise, we won't be part 
of the political process anymore."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That is a fascinating analysis, 
because in <i>USA Today</i> and a Wirthlin poll I saw today all 
agree with that statement that you just made, that when you 
take minority women out, all the other things kind of break 
out evenly.

<p>

And in fact, Marty, is it not accurate that we 
have seen women more pro-life than men, generally, that 
women are more motivated for their concern for life?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: There are. There are more 
women who seem to vote on that issue, but on balance, more 
of those women vote on the pro-life side than on the other 
side.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: I don't know.  I think it is 
tremendously insulting to women to say that if you are of a 
certain gender, you are automatically going to vote -- you 
are going to have this opinion on this, this opinion.  We 
are thinking individuals that differ on all sorts of things, 
and it is more -- my vote has more to do with my core 
beliefs, what I believe in; also, my situation.  We have a 
family.  You know, things like that, not because I am a 
woman, because I am a human being.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think you are right.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: You know, the thing that I 
found striking, two things were true.  One, the lie about 
the gender gap very much influenced the thinking of the 
strategists in the Dole campaign to such an extent that they 
made foolish errors. The Susan Molinari pick was the 
stupidest thing they could have done for keynote speaker, 
except maybe for Colin Powell.  But why?  Because they 
wanted to reach out to Catholics. And what did they do? 
They put a pro-abortion Catholic on the podium who 
absolutely insulted the convictions and work of the 
Catholics who would lean toward Republicans because of their 
pro-life sentiment.  It was insane.

<p>

So Bob Dole ended up getting all the votes of pro-abortion Catholic 
women, right?  That's why he won the election.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: That's right, absolutely.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: He couldn't get those votes, 
but the votes he could have gotten, the strongly committed 
pro-life Catholics, were instead insulted by this notion 
that a pro-abortion speaker speaks for them.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: See, that is what is funny about 
that.  There was no big tent until Ronald Reagan pulled in 
pro-life Catholics and working-class Americans who felt that 
the Democratic Party was becoming liberal and insulting to 
their values.

<p>

The big tent -- I mean, you hear the Haley 
Barbours and Romsfields(?) of the world talking about it.
You would think they created it rather than they just 
benefitted from coming under the flaps.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, they didn't even 
understand it.  They are still talking as if the big tent 
has something to do with money.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: And it does not. The big tent 
had to do with the fact that the moral culture of the 
Democratic Party was hijacked by radical left-wingers who 
moved away from the traditional values of the American 
people and lost a lot of people amongst the union workers, 
amongst the ethnic groups, amongst the Catholics, who simply 
were not going to abandon their faith and their principles.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We will come back in a second.  When 
<i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will take more calls and continue 
our discussion with tonight's special guests.  Please stay 
with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to tonight's live 
edition of <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>.
I am honored to be joined by Ambassador Alan Keyes and 
Marjorie and Marty Dannenfelser, both long-term political experts.

<p>

We would also like to hear from you.  You can 
reach us at 1-800-5000-NET.

<p>

We have a caller on the line, Robert from 
Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Robert, hi.

<p>

ALBUQUERQUE (NM) CALLER: Well, good evening.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Good evening.

<p>

ALBUQUERQUE CALLER: This is the first time I have 
watched your show.  I have watched NET for a while.  But I 
like it so far.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, good. Thanks.

<p>

ALBUQUERQUE CALLER: I have two questions.  One 
you have actually partially answered.  Maybe Alan could add 
more to it.  That is, why did the Catholic vote go the way 
it did?  Two, what do you think is going to happen to the 
Republican hierarchy after actually -- I mean, it is pretty 
much common knowledge that they picked Bob Dole, they gave 
it to him, they got him through the primaries, and he lost 
the White House.

<p>

And then I have a comment, if I may.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Why don't you give us your comment 
really fast and then let's get to Alan's answers.

<p>

ALBUQUERQUE CALLER: Oh, okay.  Over the years I 
have dealt and struggled with abortion.  When it first came 
about, I went, "Yippee."  Then as I grew older and wiser, I 
realized that something was wrong here.

<p>

But the argument for abortion has always been, 
you're killing a baby, and that's true.  But I have taken on 
another tactic.  I have looked at these people who are pro-abortion, 
and I said, what gender actually benefits from 
abortion?  And the answer is men.  Men only benefit from it.

<p>

I am beginning to hear a little more about this, 
or talk this way in the media, not very much.  Do you think 
that -- or maybe my suggestion would be that you people 
would take the same course and that abortion does not 
benefit women.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is interesting.  Polling data 
indicates that single men are the biggest proponents of 
abortion, which I think there is a little self-interest 
there.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Oh, definitely.  I think they 
are very anxious to escape their responsibility toward their 
children, and so they are willing to kill the child and 
burden the woman with this awful psychological burden for 
the rest of her life that is involved in this, and we are 
not protecting.

<p>

In terms of the Catholic vote, one, I think we 
always have to remember that we are dealing with a situation 
where Catholics were overwhelmingly voting for Democrats 
until Ronald Reagan came along, and even Reagan's success 
meant that we moved from, what, 20 percent of the Catholic 
vote or less up to around 40, and even during Reagan, this 
is what we reached.  So we are not talking yet, at least, 
about getting the majority of the Catholic vote.

<p>

But I think, as I said, one mistake that was made 
in this election was that Bob Dole thought he was going to 
reach out to Catholics.  They said, "Oh, you've got to reach 
out to the Catholic vote."  And, of course, there was a 
great opportunity.  The Catholic hierarchy, for the first 
time that I can remember, actually came forward in an 
election year against a sitting Democratic President, and 
they were more Catholic than Democrat.  And for those of us 
who are Catholics, this was breathtaking, and I was so 
pleased to see it happen.

<p>

Now, what did that mean?  It meant a great 
opportunity, but to do what?  To reach out to pro-life 
Catholics and pull them in more strongly into the Republican 
cause.  And so what does Bob Dole do?  He chooses Susan 
Molinari, a pro-abortion, outspoken, rabidly pro-abortion 
Catholic, to give the keynote speech, and he thought this 
was going to help him with Catholics.  He's insane.

<p>

What it did, I think, was to take a lot of people, 
and I know, because as I went around the country speaking, I 
have found it infuriated a lot of people.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Oh, it did.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: They just felt deeply insulted 
that he simply didn't understand what was going on, who they 
were, and as a result, I think he actually may have hurt 
himself at that point and not really recovered in terms of 
the perceptions of a lot of the pro-life Catholics and I 
think, also, pro-life Christians who were not Catholic, who 
just felt like, what is this man trying to tell us?  Doesn't 
he understand who his people are?  And the answer, I think, 
was, unhappily, no, he did not, or at least his advisers 
didn't.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, I think that Bob Dole is 
fundamentally an honest and decent person, but his whole 
aura throughout this campaign seemed very calculating.  The 
debate over abortion in the Republican platform was very 
much, now we're going to have it this way, I'm going to do 
it this way, and we have to reach out to the moderate women 
and we can't offend them, so we're going to have this 
tolerance language in there.

<p>

And then he never talked about CCRI for a while 
until, all of a sudden, the last few weeks of the campaign, 
he acknowledged, yeah, we're going to talk about that 
because that's a wedge issue.  And then he didn't answer the 
question when Jim Lehrer asked him about Bill Clinton's 
character during the debate in front of 40 or 50 million 
people, and then he decided to go out on the campaign trail 
and conduct a discussion with the people in his audiences, 
"Should I get tough in the next debate?" and so on.

<p>

Just everything looked so calculating that people 
had to start wondering, well, what does this guy really 
believe in?  I think that is what came across, that every 
position he seemed to be taking was based on some political 
calculation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Rather than on what he believed.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: And it may very well be that 
Bill Clinton made his share of calculations, but at least 
when he was out on the stump, he was talking about how 
issues connect with people's personal lives.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Ironic as it may seem, I think 
some people -- and I am not saying they were right in this 
-- but they seem to prefer a sincere liar to an insincere 
honest man.  And I have to tell you that it's a dilemma, 
isn't it?

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But don't you think that argues for 
something that I think we would be in agreement about, that 
people should stand up for something?  I think we would call 
them to stand for pro-life, pro-family values, but the 
politicals and the Dan Rathers and the Peter Jenningses say, 
"Don't stand for that much because that really offends 
people," when clearly, it draws them.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: I think the chief problem 
among candidates is just wanting to be liked.  It is a very 
basic human need.  But if you are not driven by your core 
beliefs, that just takes over.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I also think the media is very 
manipulative, because we were talking earlier about negative 
advertising.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: And the truth of the matter is, 
when you actually look at election results, challengers and 
others who are faced with tough fights, they only win when 
they are able to show people that an incumbent is not voting 
their views and values.

<p>

Now, the media calls that negative.  It is 
actually just truth-telling.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's right. It's a report card.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: If somebody has gone to 
Congress and voted in a way that betrays the values of their 
constituents -- you have liberals like a Barbara Mikulski 
pretending when they go to the Eastern Shore of Maryland 
that they are conservatives and respect family and all of 
this, meanwhile voting for everything that people there 
hate.  Well, if you want to beat somebody like that, you've 
got to tell people what she is about and what she stands 
for.  And they want to stigmatize that as negative 
advertising, and the only time -- the only time -- when that 
sort of thing is really, really bad, in their eyes, and you 
absolutely must not do it is when you are telling the truth 
about Democrats.

<p>

Now, of course, if you do the same thing and fill 
your commercials with lies, which is what the AFL-CIO did, 
they told untruths about the Republican Congress, but that 
was not characterized as negative advertising.  It's 
amazing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Isn't that funny?  Demagoguery was okay.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As long it was on Medicare.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, they were fortunate the 
Democratic members of Congress, and to a certain extent Bill 
Clinton, that they had surrogates, in a sense, doing their 
dirty work for them.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Weren't they, though?  They had the union money.

<p>

I would love to talk a little bit more.  I would 
like to thank all my guests, and we are going to have to 
have you back.

<H2>THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT:<BR>
IT'S TIME TO FREE THE ARTS</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER>
<I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Robert H. Knight</I></CENTER>
<P>
After years of debate and attempted reform, it has become clear
that the National Endowment for the Arts is beyond reclamation
and should be zero-budgeted by the 104th Congress. 
<P>
Particularly with regard to the visual arts (drawing, painting
and sculpting) and &quot;performance&quot; arts (theater, film,
live acts), the NEA has been a platform for attacks on religion,
traditional art forms, traditional families and traditional values,
and a forum for the promotion of homosexuality.  In the name of
tolerance, it has shown increasing intolerance toward standards
of any kind, including ordinary standards of artistic skill. 
Its peer review process has long been a buddy system for awarding
grants to colleagues, friends and clients of panel members, who
are almost uniformly hostile to traditional culture.   
<P>
However, even if the federal agency did manage to clean up its
act, the entire idea of government sponsorship of art is a bad
one.  Whenever the government decides to subsidize one artist
and not another, the government, in effect, determines what is
art and what is not.
<P>
Unlike any other arts sponsor, the federal government has unique
authority and responsibility.  Its powers derive from its claim
to represent all Americans and its money from mandatory taxes.
 NEA grants greatly influence what is presented in museums and
theaters and what private donors feel is worthy of support.  As
former NEA Chairman John Frohnmayer noted: &quot;Our grantees
state unequivocally that fund-raising is substantially easier
because of an Endowment grant.  It is an endorsement -- a mark
of quality and achievement.&quot;[1]
<P>
And what has the NEA done with this awesome responsibility? 
<P>
Since its founding, the NEA has openly favored the avant-garde
-- defined by <I>Webster's Third New International Unabridged
Dictionary</I> as: &quot;Those who 
create, produce or apply new, original or experimental ideas,
designs, techniques...and sometimes: a group that is extremist,
bizarre, or arty and affected.&quot;[2]  Unfortunately, the NEA seems
to have taken the latter portion of the definition to heart. 
There is a place, of course, for experimental art, but it should
be funded privately, not by taxpayers whose money often is used
to disparage their most deeply held beliefs.
<P>
As a federal agency, the NEA should not be fostering a bias toward
one particular art style over another.  In fact its own grant
guidelines specifically forbid it to do so or attempt to direct
artistic content.[3]
<P>
One reason the NEA has been able to promote bad art without public
scrutiny is that the media are not telling the whole story.  TV
broadcasters and newspapers are restrained by the bounds of good
taste from reproducing the most offensive works funded by the
NEA.  A January 2, 1991 <I>Los Angeles Times </I>article about
an NEA grant to performance artist Karen Finley described her
work only as &quot;strongly feminist in tone.&quot;[4] This leaves
the impression that Finley, who calls herself the &quot;Queen
of Dung,&quot; is controversial merely for being a feminist, not
because of her vulgarities.  
<P>
Because of this kind of obfuscation, most Americans have only
an abstract concept of the works in question.  Senator Jesse Helms,
the NEA's most active critic, has offered to debate the issue
on any TV network providing he can show viewers what is being
debated.  All have refused.  And for good reason.  If NBC-TV actually
aired some NEA-funded works, it would violate Federal Communications
Commission rules against obscenity and risk losing its broadcasting
license.  One federal agency would find itself prosecuting a company
for displaying materials sponsored by another federal agency.
<P>
<H3><CENTER>THE CHAIRMAN'S VIEWS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Under the chairmanship of actress Jane Alexander, the NEA has
not curbed its hostility toward traditional values.  In fact,
Alexander told the homosexual magazine <I>The Advocate</I> that
she intended to use the NEA to &quot;introduce people gently to
gay themes all across the country. And I mean gently, because
if you start with a kind of very overt thing, people get scared....
 You gently bring in gay people and introduce them to the world
through art.&quot;[5]
<P>
When asked, &quot;What sorts of grants would you reject out of
hand,&quot; Alexander answered: &quot;It's hard to say at this
point if there is any grant that I might reject.&quot;[6]
<P>
Indeed, Alexander later defended a performance in February 1994
at the NEA-funded Walker Art Center in Minneapolis in which an
HIV-positive performer, Ron Athey, sliced into another man's back
with a knife, mopped up the blood with towels and sent them on
clotheslines over the horrified audience.  He also had two female
assistants weave acupuncture needles through his own scalp and,
in turn, pierced the women's cheeks with steel spikes.[7]
<P>
Asked by a reporter what she thought of the performance, Alexander
replied that she trusted the judgment of the Walker management,
and said, &quot;Not all art is for everybody....  Americans are
certainly not used to seeing bloodletting, except in films, and
when it happens in person, it must be surprising.&quot;  Alexander
added that she thought &quot;all appropriate precautions&quot;
regarding health had been taken, &quot;So what are we left with
that was considered controversial?  The sacrification [sic], the
ritual-like aspect?  Is it that the man is homosexual?&quot;[8]
<P>
Congress responded to Alexander's lack of action by cutting $4
million from the NEA budget.  Athey then performed his act at
another NEA-funded theater, New York's P.S. 122.  &quot;With full
knowledge of this,&quot; culture critics David Horowitz and Laurence
Jarvik note, &quot;The NEA again funded both P.S. 122 and the
Walker Art Center in the most recent grant cycle.  Plainly, the
agency is deaf to the concerns of Congress and the public.&quot;[9]
<P>
Some of the more serious problems[10] at the NEA include:
<P>
- Bias against religion; rejecting positive portrayals of religion
as violating the separation of church and state, but funding attacks
on religion as &quot;artistic expression&quot;;
<P>
- Elevation of &quot;freedom of expression&quot; and &quot;artistic
merit&quot; as the main criteria for grants, ignoring the NEA's
charter legislation of 1965, which set &quot;encouragement of
excellence&quot; as the No. 1 criterion, followed by &quot;access
to the arts for all Americans&quot;;  
<P>
- Confusion in upper management about how to comply with congressionally-mandated
standards;
<P>
- Confusion about the NEA's primary mission;
<P>
- Conflicts of interest in the grant-awarding process;
<P>
- A bureaucracy openly hostile to public scrutiny;
<P>
- Bias against traditional forms of art and traditional values
in general.
<P>
<H3><CENTER>HOSTILITY TOWARD RELIGION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The First Amendment prohibits Congress (and federal agencies authorized
by Congress) to infringe on religious liberties.  It is clearly
unconstitutional to use federal tax dollars to create and distribute
an attack on religious beliefs.  The government has no business
dictating the value of religious beliefs or prescribing changes
in them. 
<P>
Yet the taxpayer-supported NEA over the years has funded works
that degrade or mock religious belief, particularly Christianity.
<P>
- In June, 1993, the Whitney Museum of American Art, which received
$200,000 from the NEA during 1992-1993, displayed <I>Abject Art:
Repulsion and Desire in American Art</I>.  The exhibit's journal
explains the focus: &quot;Although 'abject art' is a play on 'object
art,' the term does not connote an art movement so much as it
describes a body of work which incorporates or suggests abject
materials such as dirt, hair, excrement, dead animals, menstrual
blood, and rotting food in order to confront taboo issues of gender
and sexuality....  Employing methodologies adapted from feminism,
queer theory, post-structuralism, Marxism, and psychoanalysis,
our goal is to talk dirty in the institution [of art] and degrade
its atmosphere of purity and prudery by foregrounding issues of
gender and sexuality in the art exhibited.&quot;[11]
<P>
The Whitney show included works by Joel-Peter Witkin, who received
four fellowship grants from the NEA: Fiscal year 1980, $3,000;
FY 1981 $12,500; FY 1986, $15,000; FY 1992, $20,000.[12] Witkin's
work includes &quot;Maquette for Crucifix,&quot; a naked Jesus
Christ surrounded by sado-masochistic obscene imagery, and many
grotesque portrayals of corpses and body parts.  Another Whitney
exhibit was a film by Suzie Silver titled &quot;A Spy,&quot; which
depicts Jesus Christ as a woman standing naked with breasts exposed.
 The Whitney also included &quot;Piss Christ,&quot; Andres Serrano's
photograph of a crucifix in a jar of urine, and a film by porn
star Annie Sprinkle titled &quot;The Sluts and Goddesses Video
Workshop or How to be a Sex Goddess in 101 Easy Steps.&quot;[13] Sprinkle
has performed numerous times in NEA-funded venues such as Highways
in Los Angeles and The Kitchen Theater in New York, where she
has had audience members come on stage to examine her exposed
genitals.
<P>
- Diamanda Galas, who was The Kitchen Theater's first artist-in-residence,
performed &quot;Plague Mass&quot; at the Cathedral of St. John
the Divine in Manhattan in 1990, during which she appeared topless
and covered with blood.[14] A member of ACT-UP, the AIDS activist
group, she was arrested during a demonstration at St. Patrick's
Cathedral in New York in 1989.[15] On July 8, 1993, she opened the
Serious Fun Festival at Lincoln Center, which was supported by
a $14,700 dance grant from the NEA.[16] As the New York Times explains,
&quot;Conceptually, her work is close to that of the late David
Wojnarowicz, the visual artist-writer who died of AIDS in 1992.&quot;
 In 1990, the NEA gave a $15,000 grant to Wojnarowicz, who specialized
in photographs of men performing oral sex, anal sex, anal-oral
sex and masturbation.  An essay in one of his exhibits described
New York's John Cardinal O'Connor as &quot;a fat cannibal from
that house of walking swastikas up on fifth avenue,&quot; and
a &quot;creep in black skirts.&quot;[17]
<P>
- Anti-Christian material is distributed through the NEA-supported
Video Data Bank at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.[18]
The following are a couple of the offerings, with descriptions
cited from &quot;Gay and Lesbian Tapes Distributed by the Video
Data Bank&quot;:
<P>
<I>Popular Thought</I>.  This video equates the &quot;moral majority&quot;
with totalitarianism.  &quot;UThe message reverberates with the
interweaving of archival footage of Nazi Youth, book burnings
and modern day Ohio Youth for Jesus creating an audiovisual fabric
of hatredU -- Carole Ann Klonarides.&quot;
<P>
<I>Peccatum Mutum (The Silent Sin)</I>.  &quot;...explores relationships
among cloistered nuns....  Utilizing gothic expressionistic sets,
humor, serious kissing, and melodrama, this work expresses the
contradictions and ironic similarities between physical desire
and spiritual fervor.  A rare glimpse at the other side of Catholic
guilt.&quot;
<P>
<H3><CENTER>TARGETING THE FAMILY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Promotion of &quot;alternative lifestyles&quot; has long been
a staple of NEA grants.  A case in point is, again, NEA support
of the Video Data Bank, which offers these films and accompanying
synopses:[19]
<P>
- <I>Swamp</I>.  &quot;This subversive soap opera targets the
family, psychotherapy and property as the villains.&quot;
<P>
- <I>A Coalminer's Granddaughter</I>.  &quot;This hysterically
funny epic about a brutally realistic American family does for
lesbians what John Waters did for Baltimore....  Under the thumb
of her sleazy, evil father (brilliantly portrayed by novelist
Kevin Killian) Jane is not the hero of her own life....  <I>Coal
Miner's Granddaughter</I> opens up into the impressionistic world
of her sexuality...highly charged sexuality [that makes] staples
of lesbian erotica seem tepid and silly.&quot;
<P>
- <I>Talk to Me Like the Rain</I>.  &quot;...two brothers whose
incestuous behavior feeds a disillusionment in the trust and faith
with one another [sic].&quot;
<P>
- <I>Stephen</I>.  &quot;This production focuses on the story
of siblings and, in this case, twins locked in a complex, emotional
and sexual relationship....  In the end, the expectations of both
religion and a modern world are abandoned....&quot;
<P>
- <I>The A Ha! Experience</I>.  &quot;...explores the erotic elements
of mother-infant intimacy that are repeated in the oedipal devaluation
of the mother, the object of desire for the daughter.&quot;
<P>
<H3><CENTER>PROMOTING HOMOSEXUALITY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
By validating the pro-homosexual viewpoint through taxpayer-supported
government grants, the NEA has helped legitimize pro-homosexual
theater in general.  <I>New York Newsday</I> arts critic Linda
Winer notes that: &quot;The fact is, much of the theater these
days is gay....  Indeed, much of it has been for a very long time....
 This season there have been so many gay projects that I've been
searching for an alternative to the term 'straight play' when
describing a nonmusical.&quot;[20]
<P>
NEA-funded venues such as The Woolly Mammoth Theatre in Washington,
D.C., The Franklin Furnace and The Kitchen in New York, Highways
in Los Angeles, and countless other NEA-funded theater groups
around the country present works promoting homosexuality and blasting
traditional morality.  The NEA also supports pro-homosexual projects
shown on the Public Broadcasting System.  Some recent examples
of pro-homosexual, NEA-supported works:
<P>
- In April, 1994, Woolly Mammoth staged NEA grant recipient Tim
Miller's one-man performance, &quot;My Queer Body,&quot; in which
he, among other things, describes what it's like to have sex with
another man, climbs naked into the lap of a spectator, and finally
arouses himself sexually in full view of the audience.[21]
<P>
- In January, 1994, the Public Broadcasting Service showed <I>Tales
of the City</I>, a three-part miniseries celebrating homosexual
life in San Francisco in the 1970s.  The series was full of gratuitous
nudity, crudity, lewdness and dozens of instances of foul language.
 Families are lampooned and homosexuality is portrayed as superior.
 The series was co-produced by American Playhouse, which received
$750,000 in NEA funds in 1993.  NEA received an on-screen credit
as a supporter of the film. 
<P>
- In August 1994, the Public Broadcasting Service aired <I>One
Nation Under God</I>, a misleading, one-sided documentary by two
homosexual activists that attempts to discredit ex-gay therapy
and counseling.[22] The NEA is credited as a main sponsor for the
film, which links Christian ministries to Nazi techniques such
as shock/aversion therapy, a practice which has long been denounced
by the ex-gay movement.  The film misportrays several homosexual
activists, misrepresents Evelyn Hooker's psychological studies
of homosexual men in the 1950's, and uses Biblical references
out of context.  The film also takes quotes from several therapists
and former homosexuals out of context.  In one clip, a former
homosexual explains that he used to think that &quot;God hates
homosexuals,&quot; but that he now knows that God loves them.
 The filmmakers include only the fragment, &quot;God hates homosexuals,&quot;
reversing the man's intended meaning.  Dr. Elizabeth Moberly,
author of <I>Psychogenesis</I> and founder of a Pennsylvania-based,
ex-gay ministry, says the filmmakers misrepresented themselves,
took her out of context in her taped interview and distorted severely
what she and other therapists had said.[23] The film was shown at
several gay and lesbian film festivals during the summer of 1994
and at the 1995 Gay Games and Cultural Festival in New York City.
 Over the years, the NEA has supported several gay and lesbian
film festivals, which have presented hard-core pornography and
anti-religious themes.[24]
<P>
- The NEA-supported Video Data Bank at the School of the Art Institute
of Chicago offers numerous homosexual films.  <I>Danny</I>, a
20-minute documentary, includes footage touting &quot; Uthe raw
sensuality of cruising and anonymous encountersU -- Robert Rosenberg,
Global Village.&quot;  <I>Jollies</I> is an 11-minute film by
Sadie Benning, who &quot;recounts her earliest sexual encounters.&quot;
 Another Benning work, <I>Me and Rubyfruit</I>, &quot;chronicles
the enchantment of teenage lesbian love.&quot;  Other titles in
the catalog are frankly pornographic.   
<P>
<H3><CENTER>TALKING POINTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B>Curbing the NEA would amount to censorship, and that's against
the First Amendment, isn't it?</B>
<P>
The First Amendment to the Constitution states that &quot;Congress
shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom
of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peacefully
to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&quot;
<P>
The Constitution limits the federal government and, by extension
of the 14th Amendment, the states, from censoring protected speech,
as defined over the years by Supreme Court cases.  It does not
limit individual citizens nor private groups, which have freedom
to maintain their own standards of decency and their own viewpoints.
 The issue is one of sponsorship, not censorship.  There is no
constitutional &quot;right&quot; of an artist to a subsidy from
his fellow taxpayers.  
<P>
<B>But won't the arts collapse without federal aid?</B>
<P>
More than $9 billion in private giving sustains arts in communities
all over America.[25} The NEA's $175 million is important more for
its symbolism than for the actual dollars involved.   An NEA grant
validates an artist, and the government should not be in the business
of determining what is art.  That process smacks of &quot;official&quot;
art, such as is imposed on the artistic communities in totalitarian
societies.
<P>
<B>Can the NEA be reformed?</B>
<P>
No, it can't.  Congress has tried several times to rein in the
rogue agency, including appointing an independent commission to
study the NEA in 1990.  With some fanfare, the NEA adopted a few
reforms, but continued to fund the worst excesses in the art world.
 Even after Congress slightly cut the NEA's budget in 1994 as
a message of discontent, it continued to shovel money to artists
whose primary purpose is to insult the majority of taxpayers.
 Also, NEA officials consistently have displayed an arrogant disregard
for the taxpayers.  Even a pro-reform arts critic, the late Samuel
Lipman, who had been a member of the National Council on the Arts
during the 1980s, finally came to the conclusion in the 1990s
that the agency was irreparable and should be abolished.
<P>
<B>Besides ending subsidies for bad art, are there any other reasons
to defund NEA?</B>
<P>
Yes.  The federal deficit is out of control, so Congress must
find ways to cut back without endangering infrastructure.  Before
1965, the United States got along just fine without federal art
subsidies, which are a product of the Great Society's massive
government expansion.   Also, NEA funds are distributed in a grossly
distorted fashion, with certain areas such as New York, Los Angeles
and Minnesota receiving far more money than other states and cities.
 And many grants go to artists who are already successful and
do not need the money.  Finally, ending federal subsidies would
put a dent in cultural imperialism; pampered artists could no
longer use the federal government to tell the rest of the nation
what is art and what isn't.  Pulling the plug on NEA money would
mean that communities would support the arts that the people in
those communities wanted -- not the art that is dictated from
Washington, D.C.

<P>
Over the past decade, the federal government has spent billions
of dollars on HIV research, which has been geared predominantly
toward end-stage HIV (full-blown AIDS).  In Fiscal Year 1995,
the U.S. Public Health Service will spend $2.7 billion directly
on AIDS, the highest expenditure for any of the nation's 10 most
lethal diseases.[1]
<P>
AIDS ranks near the bottom of the list of the top 10 mortal diseases
and accounts for about 35,000 deaths annually.  Heart disease
claims 720,000 lives annually, and cancer kills 505,000.  Yet
the federal government will spend more on AIDS than on heart disease
($828 million) and cancer ($2.4 billion).[2]
<P>
The point is not that AIDS should cease receiving attention. 
HIV is a contagious disease and its victims deserve compassion
and help.  Funding should continue for treatment, prevention and
care.  However, AIDS funding must be brought into line with expenditures
for other life-threatening diseases, and the money must be redirected
toward more effective approaches.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>A CHANGING EPIDEMIC</CENTER></H3>
<P>
The scourge of AIDS, which began in America among white, male
homosexuals, has moved into poor, minority communities, driven
by prostitution, drug abuse and promiscuous sex.  Yet most AIDS
funding is still directed by, for and to the original target population.
<P>
AIDS funding generally is allocated according to the numbers of
people who ever have contracted AIDS -- including those who already
have died -- not those currently diagnosed with HIV.  This formula
has, for example, directed money to white, homosexual AIDS groups
in San Francisco while cities which now may have greater numbers
of HIV-infected patients get less financial aid.  The CDC has
reported that 55 percent of AIDS cases in 1993 came from minority
communities, with blacks having the worst rate of all the groups.[3]
Black women were approximately 15 times more likely than white
women to get AIDS, and black men were five times more likely to
get AIDS than white men.[4]
<P>
For many years, AIDS policy has been driven by the demands of
HIV-infected people who dominate AIDS organizations.  Their situations
are tragic, and their focus on finding a cure is understandable.
 But because of their considerable influence, the lion's share
of AIDS funding has been spent for treatment of end-stage HIV
(AIDS) and not on the full spectrum of HIV disease. 
<P>
Even the prevention efforts have been tailored toward protecting
the identities of those with HIV rather than toward measures that
have proven effective in stemming other serious epidemics.  Much
government time at AIDS conferences has been spent on perfecting
&quot;nonjudgmental&quot; vernacular, such as substituting &quot;people
living with HIV&quot; for the word &quot;victim&quot; or even
the word &quot;patient&quot; in order to reduce stigma.  In the
same vein, concern for confidentiality, while important, has been
overemphasized, and sound medical procedures have been thwarted
and often ignored.  The first step in stopping an epidemic is
identifying, on a confidential basis, those who have the disease.
 This process has been hampered by federally-funded AIDS activists,
who have defeated efforts to increase early diagnosis and confidential
partner notification, the surest ways to pinpoint the disease
and to help check its spread. 
<P>
Furthermore, the federal government's preventative response to
the epidemic has consisted largely of a million-dollar ad campaign
promoting condoms and hundreds of millions of dollars for AIDS
education that targets schoolchildren, acquainting them with graphic
materials explaining the various ways AIDS is transmitted, whether
they are at risk or not.  At the same time, populations that are
most at risk for HIV transmission are under-served, particularly
in black or Hispanic communities.
<P>
The current premise of many AIDS prevention efforts is that <I>uninfected</I>
persons have primary responsibility for stemming the epidemic,
not those already infected.  The focus must be changed to make
personal responsibility on the part of those infected the foundation
of future programs. 
<P>
The most successful AIDS eradication program in America has been
run by the U.S. armed forces.  Early diagnosis is the key.  Since
1985, every member of the military has been screened regularly
for HIV, resulting in a depth of knowledge about the disease that
is unparalleled.  Unlike civilian doctors, military medical personnel
are not &quot;flying blind&quot; in this epidemic and are getting
early treatment and notification to those affected.  There is
no &quot;AIDS epidemic&quot; in the military because aggressive
knowledge-based intervention prevents the spread of disease.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>IDEAS FOR POLICY MAKERS</CENTER></H3>
<P>
Here are some proposals to overhaul federal AIDS programs, with
thanks to Americans for a Sound AIDS/HIV Policy, a nonpartisan
Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group, for their
wise counsel on several of these points: 
<P>
<LI><B>Initiate prenatal HIV testing for all pregnant women</B>,
with an opt-out for those who want it.  Twenty-six percent of
HIV-infected mothers transmit the disease to their babies today
in the United States.  However, mothers who do not know they are
HIV-positive can unwittingly transmit it to the 74 percent of
uninfected babies by breast-feeding.  Furthermore, research shows
that when HIV-infected mothers are treated with the drug AZT,
the transmission rate drops from 26 percent to 8 percent.  Thus
knowledge of HIV status can save many lives.
<P>
<LI><B>Begin HIV partner notification programs in all 50 states,
the District of Columbia and U.S. territories</B>.  Partner tracing
is the fastest way to alert those in danger of infection and is
standard public health procedure for virtually all contagious
and sexually transmitted diseases.  Earlier this century, epidemics
of gonorrhea and syphilis were greatly reduced using this time-proven
procedure. 
<P>
<LI><B>Guarantee confidentiality to all who are tested.</B>  Concern
over misuse of HIV status has been the main obstacle to effective
testing programs.  But public health departments have reported
more than 400,000 cases of AIDS to the CDC without a single breach
of confidentiality in any of the 50 states.  Moreover, venereal
disease testing has been done for years without any serious breach-of-confidentiality problem. 
<P>
<LI><B>Overhaul the Ryan White Act</B>, which dispenses about $650
million annually in federal funds.  The Ryan White Act is due
to expire in 1995.  Hearings need to be held to examine how the
money is being spent.  And the spending formulas should include
the following changes:
<P>
1) Only those infected with HIV or AIDS who need care should receive
benefits.  Formulas based on &quot;AIDS prevalence&quot; distort
funding needs because they count the dead along with the living.
 Money ought to go where it is needed most, which is, increasingly,
to under-served minority communities.
<P>
2) People with HIV or AIDS should qualify where they are currently
living, not where they were diagnosed.  Slating funds to areas
of diagnosis misses areas where AIDS patients are actually residing.
 For example, someone might be diagnosed with AIDS in a large
city, but return home to a suburban or rural area for care.
<P>
3) Means testing for AIDS care dollars should be introduced. 
Those with adequate insurance should not be in the same pool with
those who truly have no other means of payment.
<P>
<LI><B>Overhaul HIV/AIDS education</B>, which now emphasizes condoms
and has not been shown to be effective.  In fact, programs seeking
funding renewal should be required to show evidence that they
have reduced HIV transmission. 
<P>
Sex education should be geared toward abstinence education and
knowledge of HIV status.  True abstinence programs (not those
that merely mention abstinence and then focus on contraception)
are the only sex education programs that have been proven to alter
behavior in positive ways.  &quot;Comprehensive&quot; (contraceptive-based)
programs have been proven to have either no effect or to actually
encourage earlier or more frequent sexual experimentation.  The
key to stopping AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases is
not in the promotion of condoms but in the promotion of delayed
sexual activity and early knowledge of infection.  In a recent
test, three groups of people were monitored: 1) a group who received
HIV education, 2) a control group with no HIV education and 3)
a group who received HIV education, and who also underwent an
HIV test.  Only the latter group registered any behavioral change.
 Testing in and of itself heightens consciousness of the seriousness
of premature or promiscuous sex.
<P>
The federal AIDS education campaign has emphasized condoms first
and has treated abstinence as a largely unrealistic goal, even
though medical experts agree that it is the most medically sound
response.  Condoms are seen by some as a way of continuing high-risk
behavior regardless of HIV status.  But no honest medical professional
would recommend that an uninfected person have sex with an HIV-infected
partner using a condom for protection.  Condoms can reduce the
risk in a single encounter, but not to where it is anywhere near
acceptable to be considered in the context of &quot;prevention.&quot;
<P>
The CDC has even misrepresented the concept of abstinence, stating
in its literature that there is a &quot;26 percent failure rate
for periodic abstinence.&quot;[5] What they are really describing
is &quot;periodic sex.&quot;  There is no such thing as &quot;periodic
abstinence.&quot;  To understand the absurdity of this statement,
try imagining the police describing a burglar as having a 26 percent
&quot;periodic honesty&quot; failure rate.  Funding for all federal
AIDS programs that promote condom use and misrepresent abstinence
should be halted immediately.  Sex education programs under Title
X (a program that was a colossal, $3 billion failure over two
decades) should be zeroed out.
<P>
<LI><B>Focus research on the &quot;full spectrum&quot; of HIV</B>,
from inception on, instead of merely focusing on HIV's final stage
(AIDS).  Dr. Robert Redfield of Walter Reed Hospital notes that
finding a &quot;cure&quot; for this tricky retrovirus is only
a distant possibility (and still a worthy goal), but that early
detection is the key to prevention.[6] Also, research subject pools
need to include more women and people from minority communities,
where the epidemic is increasing at the fastest rates.
<P>
<LI><B>Change the formula for the Centers for Disease Control's
prevention planning committees.</B> They are currently biased
toward white, homosexual men, although the HIV epidemic has shifted
toward minority communities.  Testing authorization should not
be limited to licensed phlebotomists but expanded to include small,
trained groups that can operate within minority communities inexpensively
and efficiently, using the Orasure saliva-test collection device
recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
<P>
<LI><B>Support distribution of the saliva-based HIV test</B>, approval
of which was held up for nearly four years by the FDA.  The test
is a reliable, inexpensive and convenient way to detect HIV. 
The sample is processed in a lab, so public health professionals
can track the epidemic when names are gained through confidential
testing.  Conversely, an<I> anonymous</I> home test backed by
AIDS activist groups would help &quot;drive the epidemic underground,&quot;
a concern voiced, ironically, by those same groups whenever the
testing issue is raised.  Anonymous home tests would discourage
people from being tested in a manner that fosters early counseling
and treatment and that could be tracked by public health professionals,
and it would severely limit the impact of partner-notification
programs that are under way in many states.  Furthermore, the
trauma of discovering that one has HIV infection, experienced
alone, could lead some to suicide. 
<P>
Although concerns of confidentiality are not to be taken lightly,
the idea of anonymous HIV testing is being driven by the notion
that the primary responsibility for the epidemic should fall on
those who are uninfected, not on those who have the virus.  
<P>
<LI><B>Require routine testing of patients and health care workers.
</B> Both parties should be notified of the results.  Ignorance
of infection has never aided the cause of good medical care. 
In many cases, women do not show early signs of HIV infection,
and the first indication comes when the patient is actually dying
of AIDS.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</CENTER></H3>
<P>
In testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in
1991, Dr. Robert Redfield said, &quot;The chilling reality is
that the AIDS epidemic of the next decade has already occurred.
 Central to the military response was the recognition of HIV infection
for what it is -- a sexually transmitted, progressively fatal
infection, which, although not yet curable, is treatable and preventable.&quot;
<P>
The AIDS epidemic of the year 2000, indeed, has occurred already.
 In fact, it took place around 1990.  The HIV virus' incubation
period typically takes 10 years, so when public policy makers
are addressing full-blown AIDS in 1995, they are dealing with
behavior and causes that occurred in 1985.  While care of AIDS
patients and basic AIDS research is essential, prevention efforts
need to be targeted toward current patterns of behavior and the
current population groups most adversely affected.  Homosexual
white males still account for the largest number of AIDS cases,
but the growth in HIV infections increasingly is among poor, black
and Hispanic urban dwellers, including women.  It's time to gear
the federal AIDS effort toward sound, time-tested medical procedures
such as early diagnosis, reporting and confidential partner notification,
and it's time to make individual responsibility the touchstone
of public policy.

Authorization for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is due
to expire at the end of 1996.  But Congress must appropriate money
each year.  The new 104th Congress should decline to do so. 
<P>
There is no reason Congress should force the taxpayers to continue
subsidizing this outdated system, much of which (the best parts)
would survive nicely without federal aid.
<P>
The CPB, overseer of the Public Broadcasting Service and National
Public Radio, was created in 1967 to meet a perceived need for
taxpayer-financed alternative programming not provided by commercial
networks.  That need, if there ever was one, has passed.  The
advent of cable television, satellite dishes and improved radio
technology has created an enormous menu of broadcasting choices
for consumers.  America has more than 11,700 radio stations and
more than 3,100 television licensees, plus 109 cable networks[1]
and another 6,963 translators and boosters, which extend the reach
of existing stations.[2] In addition, computer technology has created
a multitude of interactive computer highways, such as the Internet.
 It is not as if consumers don't have enough access to information.
<P>
The basis for CPB's existence has always been an anti-free market
philosophy.   Proponents have said that the market is incapable
of providing good programming, so the government must step in
and do it, to the tune of $285.6 million annually.[3] This insults
the intelligence of the viewing/listening public, because it assumes
they won't appreciate or support good programming.  Yet the shows
that register high ratings on PBS turn out to be the very programs
that the public perceives to be excellent: <I>Sesame Street</I>,
<I>Barney and Friends</I>, <I>The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour</I>,
and <I>Masterpiece Theatre</I>, for example.  All of these shows
are generating more than sufficient revenue from sponsors, donors,
grants and product marketing.  They do not need taxpayer subsidies.
But there is other CPB programming that probably would fail to
attract a sufficient viewing/listening audience or donor support.
 These programs are so bad that their creators must dig into the
public purse.  Subsidizing bad art is a donor's prerogative, of
course -- unless the &quot;donor&quot; is the taxpayer, who has
no choice.  
<P>
In a time of massive federal deficits, it makes no sense to require
taxpayers to shell out their hard-earned dollars for art of any
kind.  And the CPB, like any government bureaucracy, has waste
built into it.  A Congressional Conference Report on the Public
Broadcasting Service discloses that &quot;a single individual
is paid $438,000 annually for his once a week 30 minute appearance.&quot;[4]
<P>
It also makes no sense when cable television and satellites are
providing hundreds of programming alternatives.  Anything that
is worth viewing on PBS, for instance, would be picked up by Bravo,
The Learning Channel, the Arts &amp; Entertainment Network and
other channels. 
<P>
Public broadcasting advocates acknowledge that major PBS and NPR
stations would continue to thrive without federal subsidies. 
Their concern, they say, is that smaller, rural stations would
be forced to close.  But rural radio listeners or TV viewers can
tune in to numerous commercial stations or even to National Public
Radio or Public Broadcasting Service stations in distant cities
merely by acquiring better equipment.  Would it really be a great
loss if rural folks were denied the ability to see <I>Tongues
Untied</I> on their own, local station? Living in the country
has its own rewards, but forcing other taxpayers to subsidize
money-losing operations and bad art should not be one of them.
<P>
Besides, there is no public clamor from rural people or suburbanites
or urban dwellers, for that matter, to continue to subsidize the
pet projects (and paychecks) of a small radical elite that is
at odds with most American values.  The case for CPB subsidies
is being made almost exclusively by those in &quot;the arts community&quot;
and radical political activists who stand to benefit directly
from taxpayer largesse.  A case in point is a recent letter from
Independent Television Service Executive Director James Yee to
public broadcasting advocates.  The taxpayer-supported (and, therefore,
in no way independent) ITVS was created in 1988 to provide new
programming for public broadcasting.  Yee urges his &quot;independent
colleagues&quot; to &quot;become involved in future efforts to
drum up support for public broadcasting, especially with your
local and national elected officials, local public broadcasting
station(s), media arts organizations, and civic and cultural institutions.&quot;[5]
Yee warned that &quot;an extensive informational outreach campaign
will have to be waged,&quot;[6] which means newspapers and broadcasters
will begin pelting their audiences with scary stories about the
demise of Big Bird, should budget cutters prevail.   
<P>
But the debate over CPB is not about grounding Big Bird.  Through
PBS and NPR, the CPB is peddling a political and social agenda
that is offensive to many.  For example, NPR reporter Sunni Khalid
revealed more than a bit of political bias when commenting on
the Republican Congressional victory during a C-Span <I>Journalists
Roundtable</I> (C-Span is not funded by CPB, but by America's
cable TV operators): &quot;I think there's a big difference when
people told Father Aristide to sort of moderate his views, they
were concerned about people being dragged through the streets,
killed and necklaced.  I don't think that is what [House Speaker]
Newt Gingrich has in mind.  I think he's looking at a more scientific,
a more civil way, of lynching people.&quot;[7]
<P>
The bright side is that few folks are tuning in to public broadcasting's
truly awful programs.   The bad side is that their money is being
used to produce shows that are used to validate attacks on them,
and then the same shows are foisted, in videocassettes, on unsuspecting
schoolchildren as &quot;educational&quot; supplements. 
<P>
Here are a few of the anti-family, anti-religious, pro-homosexual
offerings from public broadcasting in recent years:
<P>
<CENTER><H3>ANTI-FAMILY PROGRAMMING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>In July 1994, a mother in Akron, Ohio, was shocked to find a
program titled <I>What if I'm Gay</I> sandwiched between <I>Kidsongs
TV</I> and <I>Sesame Street</I> from 10:00 to 11:00 a.m. on her
local PBS station.  The mother's concern about placing such programming
at a time when many pre-school children and toddlers are watching
T.V. seems to have been largely ignored by the station.  After
the woman called the station to complain, the programming director
defended the show, saying, &quot;The quality of the program is
unquestionable.  It has good
writing and production and is well thought out.&quot;[8]
<P>
<LI>The Independent Television Service (ITVS) has been awarded more
than $38 million in public broadcasting funds since 1989.  For
that princely sum, according to public media watchdog <I>COMINT</I>
magazine, the public has received a mere nine hours of programming.
Perhaps this is a blessing, given ITVS's focus.  One five-hour
series called <I>Television Families,</I> for which ITVS (through
the taxpayers) ponied up $1.9 million, plans to feature &quot;tales
of more or less dysfunctional families&quot; which &quot;all fall
outside the mainstream.&quot; ITVS earlier had announced that
it is seeking programs that will &quot;test the boundaries, both
of form and content, that have defined the family's role on television.&quot;
 These include &quot;new alternative households, new patterns
for adoption and birth...new articulations of rights for children.&quot;
<P>
The anti-family agenda in this case is obvious.  It incorporates
and goes beyond <I>Murphy Brown's</I> glorification of single
motherhood.  The term &quot;alternative households&quot; is often
used to describe homosexual households and other non-traditional
households, putting them on the same moral plane as traditional
families.  &quot;New patterns for adoption and birth&quot; are
terms used to describe adoption of children by homosexuals and
artificial insemination.  &quot;Children's rights&quot; is the
anti-parent philosophy in which the state knows best when it comes
to handing out condoms, referring children to abortionists and
otherwise undermining the authority of parents. 
<P>
Another ITVS offering is <I>Dottie Gets Spanked</I>, a mockery
of 1950s American family life from the producer of the cult homosexual
films <I>Superstar</I> and <I>Poison</I>.  Yet another is <I>Terminal
USA</I>, described by the ITVS newsletter <I>Buzzwords</I> as
being about &quot;wholly unwholesome folks&quot; who &quot;cram
a lot of skeletons in their closet: drug abuse, homosexuality,
teen pregnancy, elderly abuse, unemployment, and infidelity (with
the pizza delivery boy) -- all under one roof.&quot; Making a
gratuitous slam on conservative Christians, <I>Buzzwords</I> concludes:
&quot;Unlike the absolute 'family values' of censorship-minded
evangelicals, <I>TV Families</I> values all kinds of families.&quot;[9]
<P>
<LI>In May of 1992 PBS broadcast a documentary called <I>What Kids
Want to Know About Sex and Growing Up</I>.  Produced by the Children's
Television Workshop, the show was an attack on traditional family
values in the guise of a pseudo-scientific presentation. 
<P>
The program contains graphic sexual information, aimed at children
as young as 8 years old.  Children are encouraged to use condoms
without being informed about high condom failure rates.  Abstinence
is given only a passing mention.  Parents are nearly invisible,
as are clergy or any other adults who would normally articulate
moral and familial ramifications of sexuality. 
<P>
Having a baby is illustrated through an exercise in which teens
carry around a bag of flour for a week and then talk about how
it cramps their style.  This exercise fails to take into account
the joys of parenthood.  It dehumanizes babies and subordinates
life itself to the cold sexual imperative. 
<P>
None of the instructors use the word &quot;marriage&quot; in any
context.  Sex is portrayed strictly as a physical act, without
the larger moral and social contexts that constitute the real
&quot;facts of life.&quot;  &quot;Husbands&quot; and &quot;wives&quot;
are not mentioned, just &quot;partners.&quot; This video is now
available in commercial video stores.
<P>
<LI>Children's Television Workshop also publishes <I>Sesame Street
Parents</I> magazine, which features an advice column by New York
University psychologist Lawrence Balter.   In the January/February
1994 issue, Dr. Balter advises parents that masturbation is a
&quot;tension-relieving activity that, much like hair twirling
and thumb-sucking, serves to soothe and calm children.  Masturbation
can also help a child learn more about his body and help him develop
positive attitudes toward sex....Avoid telling your son that touching
himself is 'not nice.'&quot;[10]
<P>
<LI>In 1992, the POV (Point of View) series began with <I>Color
Adjustment</I>, a documentary by homosexual writer and AIDS victim,
the late Marlon Riggs (see <I>Tongues Untied</I> item below),
who complained about the heterosexual bias of most family programming:
&quot;Have we exchanged the myths of pre-television America for
new fictions just as confining, for impossibly rigid, homogenized
fictions of the family, and the American dream....?&quot;[11]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>PRO-HOMOSEXUAL PROGRAMMING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>On January 5, 1995, National Public Radio's &quot;All Things
Considered&quot; ran what amounted to a promotion of homosexual
punk rock music, focusing on the new activist group Homocore.
 NPR reporter Rick Carr describes New York's Pansy Division as
&quot;one of hundreds of bands that infuse punk rock's do-it-yourself
aesthetic with gay themes.&quot;[12] 
<P>
<LI>In early 1994, PBS ran the miniseries <I>Tales of the City</I>,
a celebration of homosexuality in San Francisco during the 1970s.
 The series presents the homosexual lifestyle as superior to marriage
and family, with few apparent consequences from promiscuous sex
or illicit drugs.  The series is full of gratuitous nudity, crudity,
lewdness and foul language.  Traditional families are lampooned
through stereotypical caricatures of stupid fathers and meddling
mothers.  The only person dying from an incurable disease is a
heterosexual businessman who winds up cheating on his wife with
a transsexual.  Even an edited version of the series that ran
on Oklahoma public television caused a &quot;quite a bit of animosity
amongst a considerable number of legislators from rural areas,&quot;
Bob Allen of Oklahoma ETV told <I>Current</I>, a public broadcasting
trade journal.[13] The publication noted that <I>Tales</I> had also
drawn acclaim from critics and &quot;just about everywhere, local
outlets heard both praise and disapproval from viewers.&quot;[14]
<P>
<LI>In 1991, PBS aired a film documentary titled <I>Tongues Untied</I>.
 Written by ITVS grant recipient Marlon Riggs and shown under
the banner of POV, the documentary was so offensive that more
than 100 PBS stations refused to air it.  Still, many urban stations
did air the show, which contained full frontal nudity, bare buttocks
and 20 seconds of two men disrobing and having sex.
<P>
<LI>In June of 1992, PBS aired <I>The Lost Language of Cranes</I>
as part of Gay Pride Month.  The film features a father and son
&quot;coming out,&quot;  to declare their homosexuality.  The
movie also shows a man attempting to initiate anonymous sex with
a man in a homosexual porn theater.  Graphic scenes of homosexuals
kissing and engaging in sex are also featured.
<P>
Homosexual activists have acknowledged CPB's contribution to their
cause.  At a public hearing on CPB held in Washington, D.C. in
January 1994, Cathy Renna of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against
Defamation (GLAAD) congratulated CPB, which, she said, &quot;has
aired many documentaries, films, and series that have touched
on or dealt with gay issues.&quot; She urged CPB to &quot;continue
to bring as much gay-oriented programming as possible to the viewing
public without fear of reprisal or complaint.&quot;[15] At the same
hearing, Gregory King of the Human Rights Campaign Fund noted,
&quot;...the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, through your
support of National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service,
has had an important impact on the ability of lesbian and gay
Americans to emerge from the shadows of society into the sunlight
of American life.&quot;[16] He singled out NPR's <I>Morning Edition</I>,
<I>The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour</I> and the <I>Charlie Rose Show</I>,
which &quot;regularly include discussions with gay and lesbian
Americans on issues of public importance,&quot; and praised CPB
for its support of gay-themed programming, such as <I>In the Life</I>,
<I>The American Playhouse</I>, <I>Longtime Companion</I>, <I>Andre's
Mother</I>, <I>The AIDS Quarterly</I>, <I>The Lost Language of
Cranes</I>, <I>Silverlake Life: The View from Here</I> and Armistead
Maupin's <I>Tales of the City</I> for bringing &quot;gay and lesbian
concerns into the mainstream of American life, where they belong.&quot;[17]
<P>
What King failed to add is that these aforementioned programs
are loaded with homosexual activists' propaganda and ignore the
health consequences of homosexual behavior.  They also ignore
the existence of the burgeoning ex-gay movement, reserving that
topic for the smear show, <I>One Nation Under God</I>.  PBS' pro-homosexual
programs also typically screen out any knowledgeable opponents
of the gay rights movement. 
<P>
In closing, King urged CPB to &quot;continue to provide leadership
in using the airwaves...to break the bonds of bigotry.&quot;[18]
<P>
Speaking of bigotry, public broadcasting harbors the last respectable
form of bigotry in America: Christian bashing.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>ANTI-RELIGIOUS PROGRAMMING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>On September 6, 1993, National Public Radio's <I>All Things
Considered</I> chronicled a controversy in Colorado Springs. 
The story was about some parents who objected to their children
being baptized without their parents' knowledge during a local
church carnival.[19] The controversy was real, and the conflict compelling.
 However NPR's handling of the story was anything but evenhanded.
<P>
Opening remarks by the reporter implied that children are no longer
safe in Colorado Springs because of the presence of Christian
groups.  No spokesmen are included to combat the anonymous charge
that Colorado Springs is fraught with &quot;religious extremism.&quot;
 The story presented an organization named The Citizen's Project
as a &quot;liberal volunteer&quot; organization that promotes
communication and understanding between its members and conservative
Christians.  However, on another program aired on NPR, which was
also openly biased against Christians, the Citizen's Project is
described as a &quot;watchdog&quot; organization that gives citizens
a sense of belonging by &quot;organizing opposition to [the Christian]
agenda.&quot;
<P>
<LI>In October of 1993, NPR broadcast a documentary titled <I>The
Politics of Bigotry</I>.  Described as an &quot;in-depth investigation
of the Christian Right...,&quot; the show was actually an ugly
smear of Christians which violated the First Amendment protection
against infringement on the free exercise of religion.  
<P>
The two-and-a-half hour documentary contains many opinions presented
as if they were fact and gives Christians no opportunity to respond
to the majority of statements made by their detractors.
<P>
<LI>A segment of PBS's <I>Bill Moyers' Journal</I> titled <I>The
New Holy War</I>[20] was supposed to be a documentary about Colorado's
&quot;Amendment Two,&quot; a statewide ballot initiative which
would have prohibited political jurisdictions across the state
from granting special rights to homosexuals.  Instead it was an
anti-religious hit piece disguised as balanced journalism.  The
issue is framed in terms of a struggle between homosexuals, who
Moyers portrays as oppressed victims fighting for their rights,
and Evangelical Christians, who are pictured as intolerant bigots.
<P>
Moyers works hard to pass himself off as an objective journalist.
 However, he reveals his bias when he conducts an in-depth critical
look at an organization supporting Amendment Two without so much
as mentioning any one of the several organizations fighting against
it.  Also, Moyers fails to inform viewers of vote totals, the
percentage of evangelical Christians in the state, or that many
non-evangelicals supported Amendment Two.  Moyers charges, but
fails to present any evidence, that the conflict was strictly
between homosexuals and Christians.[21]
<P>
Moyers' greatest omission was his failure to present an accurate
portrayal of the homosexual lifestyle.  The show features male
and female homosexual couples who are clean cut, monogamous and
well-spoken.  While this image may be true of the couples featured
on the show, it is in sharp contrast with what the research tells
us about the homosexual lifestyle.  Research shows that male homosexuals
typically are quite promiscuous, with many sexual partners over
the course of a lifetime.  In addition, homosexuals are at high
risk for a host of sexually transmitted diseases and violence
within relationships.  Homosexual males typically and tragically
have shorter lifespans.[22]  Homosexuals are also more likely to have
drug and alcohol abuse problems.[23]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>RADICAL POLITICAL PROGRAMMING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Ultra-left <I>Pacifica</I> radio, along with PBS's <I>Frontline</I>,
<I>Point of View</I> and dozens of PBS specials, have been criticized
for left-wing bias.  Some recent examples:
<P>
<UL><LI> In 1992, KPFK, the <I>Pacifica</I> station in Los Angeles, broadcast
an <I>African Mental Liberation Weekend</I>.  The 26-hour marathon
of speeches and interviews was called a &quot;hatefeast&quot;
by members of the L.A. Jewish community.[24] Speakers included Louis
Farrakhan, who said that whites and Jews were &quot;the pale horse
with death its rider and hell close behind.&quot;[25] The broadcast
also featured black supremacist Leonard Jeffries lecturing on
Jewish involvement in the slave trade and Steve Cokely, who evoked
a &quot;Jew doctors conspiracy to infect black children with AIDS.&quot;[26]
<P>
<LI>In May 1994, NPR announced plans to run prison-life commentaries
by convicted cop-killer and former Black Panther Mumia Abu-Jamal,
claiming that the show would bring a &quot;unique perspective
to listeners.&quot;[27] Although the show was canceled after Sen.
Robert Dole took to the Senate floor to decry CPB's lack of balance,
the incident raised serious questions about CPB's judgment and
commitment to balanced programming. 
<P>
<LI>Several specials have been broadcast which support totalitarian
and anti-American causes.  For example: <I>Maria's Story</I>,
a show about the war in El Salvador from the communist FMLN's
perspective and <I>Cuba in the Shadow of Doubt</I>, which was
described by a <I>New York Times</I> critic as having &quot;...a
romantic infatuation with Cuba.&quot;[28] Another example is a PBS
documentary on families divided over the Castro regime entitled
<I>Miami-Havana</I>.  The credits of the film contain a &quot;special
thanks&quot; to the Combinado del Este prison.  According to Alberto
Mora, a Cuban-American lawyer, &quot;no prison has a grislier
reputation than Combinado del Este.  Mind you, this notoriety
stands out even in the context of a prison system infamous for
its barbarism.&quot;[29]
<P></UL>
<CENTER><H3>NO NEED FOR SUBSIDIES</H3></CENTER>
<P>
In a truly free broadcasting market, programs of very limited
appeal would most likely not garner advertising support.  They
would be confined to media that are supported by those who seek
this information.  Left-leaning foundations and individual donors
might be persuaded to fund them, but they have little incentive
to do so while it is so easy to tap the taxpayers.
<P>
The programs mentioned above are not the examples that CPB supporters
cite when they complain that good programming would be lost without
CPB.  Instead, CPB advocates point to popular shows such as <I>Sesame
Street</I> and <I>The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour</I>.  They fail
to mention that the popular shows will fare well in free market
competition.  Children's Television Workshop, parent company of
<I>Sesame Street</I>, has a stock and bond portfolio worth more
than $51 million.[30] And gross merchandising sales of Sesame Street
items rack up $1 billion annually, earning CTW about $100 million
in royalties.[31] One divisional CTW president had an annual salary,
including bonuses, of $625,000.[32] 
<P>
CPB funding makes up only 14 percent of public broadcasting's
total budget.[33] Federal grants from other agencies, such as the
National Endowment for the Arts, make up another 5 percent.  The
rest comes from donors, businesses, foundations, state governments,
public colleges and universities, auction participants and private
colleges and universities.  All told, 49 percent of public broadcasting's
budget comes from taxpayers at all levels, but the direct federal
component makes up only 19 percent.[34]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Pulling CPB's tax-funded plug would force producers to take into
account the tastes of their audiences and would motivate public
broadcasters to look to their lucrative offspring, like Barney
or Bill Moyers, to contribute more to the collective coffers.
 The result? Good programming would continue to thrive, and the
offensive and meritless programs would likely go the way of that
other big bird, the dodo.  
<P>
It's time to zero-budget the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
 Big Bird should leave the nest of Big Government and fly on his
own.

<H2>SUFFER THE CHILDREN:<BR>
TITLE X's FAMILY PLANNING FAILURE</H2>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<I>by </I>
<P>
<I>Gracie S. Hsu</I></CENTER>
<P>
Title X of the Public Health Service Act is a categorical grant
issued by the federal government to fund family planning projects
throughout the United States.  Enacted in 1970, Title X was supposed
to help reduce the unplanned pregnancy rate, especially in the
teenager population.  However, Title X has not only failed to
reduce the teenage pregnancy rate, but teenage reproductive health
has drastically worsened in every category.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>TITLE X'S IMPACT ON TEENAGE HEALTH</H3></CENTER> 
<P>
Over the lifetime of Title X, the number of teenage clients has
grown due to increases in both Title X funding and the overall
number of enrollees in Title X clinics.  Currently, an estimated
1.5 million Title X clients are teenagers, constituting approximately
one-third of the program's total clientele.  But even though more
teenagers are being exposed to these family planning &quot;services,&quot;
the rates of out-of-wedlock births, abortions, sexually-transmitted
diseases, and pregnancies have all risen significantly in the
teenage population since the program's inception.
<P><UL>
<LI><B>Out-of-wedlock births -- <I>Since the introduction
of Title X, the teenage out-of-wedlock birth rate has doubled.</B></I>
 The out-of-wedlock birth rate per 1,000 unmarried girls aged
15-19 rose from 22.4 in 1970 to 44.6 in 1992 (teen births have
declined since 1992).
<P>
This illegitimacy figure is especially important to note because
Title X advocates have sought to claim &quot;success&quot; by
pointing out that the overall teenage birth rate has declined.
 However, such a decline is only attributable to the decline in
<I>marital</I> births, <I>not</I> in illegitimate births.  In
1970, seventy percent of teenage births were marital; in 1991,
7 in 10 teenage births occurred <I>outside</I> marriage.
<P>
The same trend toward out-of-wedlock childbearing is evidenced
in the female population at large.  In 1970 when Title X began,
children living with one parent were more than four times as likely
to be products of divorce as they were to have been born out-of-wedlock.
 But by 1993, the Census Bureau reports found that American children
who live with one parent were almost equally divided between children
of divorce and those born to unmarried parents.
<P>
<LI><B>Abortions -- <I>Over the lifetime of Title X, the
teenage abortion rate has more than doubled.</B></I>  In 1972,
the abortion rate per 1,000 girls aged 15-19 was 19.1; in 1990,
the rate was 40.6.  While the abortion rate grew rapidly from
1972 to the early 1980s, the rate has apparently reached a plateau,
hovering between 40 and 43 abortions per 1,000 teenage girls over
the last 10 years.
<P>
While the rapid growth of the teenage abortion rate during the
early years of Title X is no doubt attributable, in large measure,
to the <I>Roe v. Wade</I> decision, the past decade's more stabilized
abortion rate cannot be viewed optimistically.  For during this
time, a rapid rise also occurred in out-of-wedlock births.
<P>
Interestingly, the women whom Title X clinics target -- low-income
women, minorities, and unmarried young people -- have the highest
abortion rates.  And, the Alan Guttmacher Institute reports that
half of all women having an abortion used a contraceptive method
in the month during which they conceived.
<P>
<LI><B>Sexually-Transmitted Diseases (STDs) -- <I>Sexually-transmitted
diseases among teenagers have increased dramatically despite the
fact that many Title X clinics provide both contraception and
STD screening.  In fact, teenagers now have higher rates of gonorrhea
than any other 5-year age group between 20 and 44.</B></I>  Currently,
one in four sexually experienced teenagers -- about 3 million
-- become infected with an STD every year.
<P>
For the first time ever, teenage girls have the highest gonorrhea
rates in the nation; teenage boys rank second.  The rate in adolescent
girls is 20 times higher than in women over 30, according to the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  Infectious
syphilis rates more than doubled among teenagers since the mid-1980s.
 Additionally, up to 15 percent of sexually experienced teenage
girls are infected with human papilloma virus, many of them carrying
a strain that can cause cervical cancer.  Chlamydia also has spread
explosively, currently infecting 22 percent of sexually active
girls and 10 percent of sexually active boys.  Finally, one in
five reported full-blown AIDS cases is diagnosed among people
in their 20s.  Due to the virus' long incubation period (about
10 years), most were adolescents when they were infected, according
to the CDC.
<P>
Sexually-transmitted diseases can lead to cancer, pelvic inflammatory
disease, ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and/or even death.  Estimates
from the general population indicate that between 100,000 and
150,000 women become infertile each year as a result of an STD,
and about 15 to 30 percent of the 2.3 million U.S. couples who
are infertile may be unable to conceive as a result of an STD.
 But beyond infertility, STDs also increase the likelihood of
contracting HIV.  According to some estimates, having an STD,
such as gonorrhea, increases by as much as 100 times the chance
of contracting HIV from an infected partner.
<P>
<LI><B>Pregnancies -- <I>Since the introduction of Title
X, the out-of-wedlock pregnancy rate among 15-to 19-year-old girls
has doubled.</B></I>  In the same time span, the <I>overall</I>
teenage pregnancy rate (marital and nonmarital) increased 23 percent,
climbing from 95.1 per 1,000 girls aged 15-19 in 1972 to 117.1
in 1990.  So not only did the overall teenage pregnancy rate increase,
but a greater proportion of these pregnancies are now out-of-wedlock.
 This trend is best evidenced by the growing rate of out-of-wedlock
births.  When Title X began, only 3 in 10 teen births were out-of-wedlock;
now 7 in 10 teen births occur outside marriage.
<P>
Despite the 23 percent increase in the overall teen pregnancy
rate, Title X advocates still claim &quot;success&quot; by stating
that &quot;fewer sexually experienced teenagers become pregnant
each year.&quot;  Advocates often remark that the pregnancy rate
among sexually experienced teenagers has decreased from 254 to
207 per 1,000 (19%) in the last two decades.  However, this figure
is derived from a statistical invention called the &quot;sexually
experienced teenage pregnancy rate&quot; (SETPR) which obscures
the disastrous changes in teenage sexual activity and ignores
the real indices of social health, i.e., the rates of teenage
pregnancy, abortion, out-of-wedlock births, and STDs.  The fact
is, a greater proportion of teenagers are sexually experienced
today than 20 years ago.
<P>
Consider the following hypothetical comparison of two nations,
Country A and Country B:
<p><pre><center>
<B>Country    # of teenage     # sexually     # pregnant    SETPR
          girls 15-19      active         annually           </B>
<P>
  A        1,000,000        500,000       200,000       400
  B        1,000,000        100,000       50,000        500
</center></pre><p>
In this straightforward example, Country B has a 25% higher &quot;sexually
experienced teenage pregnancy rate&quot; than Country A.  But
Country B has only one-fifth the sexual activity rate of Country
A and one-fourth of its teenage pregnancy rate.  In fact, it is
obvious that Country A can have a lower SETPR than Country B while
still having a higher sexual activity rate, a higher rate of STDs,
a higher number of pregnancies, and both four times as many abortions
and out-of-wedlock births as Country B!  SETPR may be of some
statistical interest at the margin, but as a measure of adolescent
well-being it is not merely useless, but grossly misleading.
</UL><P>
<CENTER><H3>TITLE X FUNDING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
By all accounts, teenage reproductive health has suffered under
Title X's watch.  Yet, incredibly, Title X programs continue to
receive <I>increased</I> government funding, currently reaching
an all-time high of $193 million for fiscal year 1995.  Why? 
Because there is <I>no</I> <I>accountability</I> or measure of
effectiveness connected to the funding of the program.  There
has never been an evaluation component included in the grants;
and in 1983, the Department of Health and Human Services discontinued
collecting client data.
<P>
The federal government is not only funding a failed program, it
is funding an <I>unauthorized</I> program.  Title X's funding
authorization officially expired in 1985, but the program continues
to receive federal dollars every year through inclusion in the
Labor/Health and Human Services Appropriations bill.
<P>
<B>PROHIBITION OF ABORTION</B> -- Section 1008 of Title X states
that &quot;none of the funds appropriated under this title shall
be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning.&quot;
 Yet many of the clinics which receive Title X funds perform abortions
in addition to providing other family planning services.  These
clinics creatively &quot;obey&quot; the prohibition by maintaining
separate budgets for abortion and family planning.  However, when
self-titled &quot;family planning&quot; clinics perform abortions
and refer clients for abortion when contraception fails, an implicit
assumption exists that abortion is indeed a method of family planning.
 Additionally, many Planned Parenthood (PP) clinics receive Title
X funds.  And while not all of these PP clinics perform abortions,
Planned Parenthood's reputation as an abortion provider is undisputable.
 Thus, to the client, no relevant distinction is made between
abortion and family planning; in fact, the prohibition has been
reduced to a mere bookkeeping formality.  Such a misuse of the
statute must be immediately halted and the integrity of the prohibition's
original intent restored.
<P>
<CENTER> <H3>TEENAGE SEXUAL ACTIVITY AND CONTRACEPTIVE USE</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Poor teenage reproductive health outcomes and Title X funding
are clearly correlated.  But the question that begs to be answered
is, &quot;What accounts for the correlation?  What effect do contraceptive
counseling and dispensing have on teenagers' sexual behavior?&quot;
 While such questions cannot be answered easily, there are clues
which point in a common direction.
<UL><P>
<LI>Sexual activity rates among teenagers are higher now than ever
before.  Currently, fifty-six percent of girls and 73 percent
of boys have intercourse before age 18, compared to 35 percent
and 55 percent in the early 1970s.
<P>
<LI>A 1993 <I>Public Health Reports</I> article found that adolescent
males who had been instructed in sexual biology and birth control
were at a higher risk of early first intercourse than were those
who had received no instruction.
<P>
<LI>Research from Planned Parenthood shows that the number one reason,
by far, that teenagers initiate sexual activity is peer pressure.
 By promoting contraceptive use among teenagers, Title X clinics
reduce the number of outside forces bolstering teenagers' resolve
to save sex for marriage.
</UL><P>
<B>MULTIPLE PARTNERS</B> -- According to the Centers for Disease
Control, &quot;The initiation of sexual intercourse early in life
is associated with an increased number of sex partners and a greater
risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).&quot;  Data show
that one-half of sexually experienced teenage girls wait almost
18 months between first intercourse and having sex with a second
sexual partner; another one-fourth wait almost 2 years.  Thus,
helping teenagers to delay sex initiation is especially important.
<P>
However, evidence also indicates that <I>contraceptive use leads
to increased sexual activity, with a greater number of partners.</I>
 Consequently, the dispensing of prescription contraceptives without
parental involvement by family planning clinics would serve to
exacerbate this trend -- which is, in fact, what is happening
today.
<UL><P>
<LI>Among sexually active girls aged 15-17, 55 percent have had
2 or more partners and 13 percent have had at least 6.
<P>
<LI>Between 1971 and 1988, the percentage of sexually experienced
women aged 15-19 living in urban areas who reported 4 or more
sex partners increased from 14% to 31%.
<P>
<LI>Forty-five percent of 15-24-year-olds who had initiated sexual
intercourse before age 18 reported having had four or more partners;
75 percent reported having had two or more partners.
<P>
<LI>Dr. Robert Kistner of Harvard Medical School, one of the developers
of the oral contraceptive, subsequently acknowledged that use
of contraceptives among teenagers is stimulating higher levels
of promiscuity:  &quot;About ten years ago I declared that the
pill would not lead to promiscuity.  Well, I was wrong,&quot;
he said (<I>Family Practice News</I>, 1977).
</UL><P>
<B>CONTRACEPTIVE FAILURE</B> -- Not only does contraceptive use
lead to increased sexual activity with a greater number of partners,
but contraception is not terribly effective at protecting teenagers
from unplanned pregnancy and/or STD infection.  Indeed, one-third
of teenage pregnancies occur <I>while a contraceptive is being
used</I>, and this figure does not even take into account the
STD transmission rate.
<P>
In part, this is due to the fact that no contraceptive method
is highly effective in protecting simultaneously against pregnancy
and infection.  Contraceptives with the best record for reducing
pregnancy risk offer little, if any, protection against STDs.
 On the other hand, condoms have a standardized failure rate of
15.7 percent at preventing <I>pregnancy</I> over the course of
a year; in teenagers, the rate is even higher.  In addition to
a poor contraceptive record, condoms have not been shown to be
effective at protecting women against STD infection.  A recent
<I>Family Planning Perspectives</I> article found that condoms
may protect women against some STDs, but the data are equivocal.
 In several studies, condoms showed no protective effect against
cervical human papilloma virus, chlamydia, or bacterial vaginosis
in women.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>MATERNAL AND INFANT MORTALITY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Maternal and infant mortality might not seem, at first glance,
to be related to a discussion of Title X's impact on teenagers;
but, in reality, the two concepts are inextricably connected.
 Title X's mandate is to reduce maternal and infant mortality
and to promote the health of mothers and children.  However, Title
X has miserably failed in fulfilling this mandate.  America ranks
24th in the world in infant survival, a very low ranking for a
developed country, let alone the wealthiest country in the world.
 And the problems associated with Title X -- out-of-wedlock births,
teenage pregnancies, and STDs -- are major factors undermining
maternal and infant health.
<UL><P>
<LI><B>Out-of-wedlock births</B> -- Nicholas Eberstadt and others
have shown that marital status at birth is the key indicator for
infant mortality, transcending both ethnicity and poverty.  And
the out-of-wedlock teenage birth rate has soared under Title X's
watch.
<P>
<LI><B>Teenage pregnancy</B> -- One major cause of infant mortality
is low birth weight, which is directly related to teenage pregnancy.
 Thus it comes as no surprise that Title X's failure to reduce
teenage pregnancy would also result in higher infant mortality.
<P>
<LI><B>Sexually-transmitted diseases</B> -- As was discussed earlier,
STDs have a negative impact on women's health, possibly leading
to cancer, infertility, and even death.  Ectopic pregnancies,
which can be caused by STDs, have quadrupled since 1970, and the
rate of infertility among women has also dramatically increased.
 But in addition to women, STDs hurt infants.  The infection of
infants from the mother's STDs (including, but not limited to
HIV) has become a significant problem and will only continue to
worsen as nonmarital sexual activity remains unchecked.
</UL><P>
<CENTER><H3>FRC RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING TITLE X</CENTER></H3>
<P>
<B>(1)</B>  <B>Remove all funding from Title X</B> -- Title X
has not only failed to reduce the rates of teenage pregnancy,
out-of-wedlock births, and sexually-transmitted diseases, it has
exacerbated these problems.  The program's lack of evaluation
criteria and its approach as an open-ended project grant have
frustrated accountability.
<P>
Title X does not deserve to continue receiving taxpayer dollars
and, in fact, <I>should</I> not be receiving federal dollars,
as an unauthorized program.  The federal government has a responsibility
to use federal funds wisely, and it should not be funding programs
which, by all accounts, have produced worsened health outcomes.
<P>
<B>(2)</B>  <B>If Title X comes up for reauthorization, do not
reauthorize</B> -- Title X's authorization expired in 1985.  And
Title X should remain unauthorized because it has never been shown
to benefit the American public.
<P>
<B>(3)</B>  <B>Promote saving sex for the context of marriage</B>
-- If the federal government must play a role in &quot;family
planning,&quot; it ought to promote the optimum health message
-- that sex should be saved for marriage.  Research shows that
people who postpone sexual activity until marriage and practice
monogamy within marriage are more likely to be sexually satisfied,
to have enduring marriages, and to be free from the ravages of
out-of-wedlock pregnancies and sexually-transmitted diseases.

<P>
Adoption is a good choice and sound policy.  And now it is finally
receiving some well-deserved attention by Congress.  Under consideration
are two laudable reform proposals which would make it easier for
more people to choose adoption.
<P>
(1) <B>Reducing financial obstacles</B> -- The House GOP's Contract
with America includes the Family Reinforcement Act, of which adoption
assistance is a primary component.  This proposal would make adoption
a more affordable choice for prospective adoptive parents by allowing
a tax credit of up to $5,000 for qualified adoption expenses.
 These expenses could include adoption fees, court costs, attorney
fees, and other expenses which are directly related to the legal
adoption of the child.  Appropriately, the legislation explicitly
excludes payments to surrogate mothers and to individuals adopting
their spouse's children.
<P>
(2) <B>Reducing legal (and psychological) barriers -- </B>As
a proposed amendment to the welfare reform bill, the National
Council for Adoption has suggested that unmarried mothers who
place their babies for adoption should be exempted from provisions
which require welfare recipients to identify the father of the
child as a condition of receiving assistance.  The proposal recognizes
paternal rights by giving fathers a period of up to thirty days
after the child's birth to come forward and claim custody of the
child.  Should the father fail to do so, his rights would be terminated,
and the child would be eligible for adoption.  This proposal should
be reviewed as a possible alternative to single parenthood that
increases the incentive for unwed mothers to choose adoption.
<P>
These proposals are laudable because they encourage adoption --
a beneficial option for the birthmother, the adopted child, and
the adoptive parents.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>BENEFITS OF ADOPTION FOR THE CHILD</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Adoption holds many benefits for the child involved.  Recently,
the Search Institute conducted the largest U.S. study of adopted
adolescents and their families to evaluate the mental health of
these adolescents at a time when they are forming their identities.
 This study, combined with other research, found that adopted
adolescents reap the following benefits:
<P>
<UL><LI><B>A Loving, Intact Family</B> -- Ninety percent of adopted
children live with married parents, and these families exhibit
high levels of warmth, communication, discipline, and cohesion.
 Indeed, the Search Institute's representative sample found that
only 11 percent of adopted adolescents report divorce or separation
compared to 28 percent in a national survey of adolescents.
<P>
<LI><B>Deep Child-Parent Attachment</B> -- Adopted adolescents
are as deeply attached to their parents as are their non-adopted
siblings.  Fifty-four percent report strong attachment to both
parents; another 30 percent are deeply attached to one parent.
 Equally compelling is the fact that 95 percent of parents experience
strong attachment to their adopted child.
<P>
<LI><B>Strong Self-Identity</B> -- Most adopted adolescents have
a strong self-identity, exhibiting higher levels of self-esteem
than their peers.  They accept their adoptive status with relative
ease and are as likely to report a positive self-identity as their
non-adopted siblings.
<P>
<LI><B>Positive Psychological Health</B> -- Based on multiple
indices of psychological health, the study found that at least
three-quarters of adopted adolescents are within the zone of positive
psychological health, even surpassing a comparison sample of public
school adolescents on several measures.
<P>
<LI><B>Financial Provision</B> -- Fifty-four percent of adopted
children live in homes with family income three times higher than
poverty level.
</UL><P>
<CENTER><H3>BENEFITS OF ADOPTION FOR THE SINGLE MOTHER</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Research shows that young, unmarried women who choose adoption
for their babies reap many personal benefits.  Comparing favorably
to their counterparts, who choose single parenthood, women who
choose adoption exhibit the following characteristics.  They are:
<P>
<UL><LI>More likely to complete high school and advance further educationally.
<LI>More likely to be employed and have a higher income.
<LI>Less likely to live in poverty.
<LI>Less likely to receive public assistance than birth mothers
who chose to parent out-of-wedlock.  In fact, 60 percent of welfare
recipients are, or were at one time, teenage mothers.
<LI>More likely to marry subsequently.
<LI><B>Less likely to have a repeat out-of-wedlock pregnancy</B>
than the teenagers who choose parenting or abortion.
</UL><P>
<CENTER><H3>THE NEED FOR ADOPTION POLICY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Adoption provides children with the benefits of solid, two-parent
homes while giving birthmothers the opportunity to mature before
taking on the adult responsibilities of childrearing.  That policy
should encourage adoption as a positive alternative for women
facing crisis pregnancies seems especially prudent during this
time when our nation's rates of out-of-wedlock pregnancy, abortion,
and single parenthood are skyrocketing.
<P>
<UL><LI><B>Illegitimacy</B> -- Births to unmarried teenagers continue
to escalate dramatically.  In 1992, there were 365,000 out-of-wedlock
teenage births -- a six-fold increase since 1950.  But even in
the population at large (not limited to teenagers), illegitimacy
is rampant.  Thirty percent of all our nation's children were
born to unwed mothers in 1991; in the black community, the figure
was an astounding 68 percent.
<P>
<LI><B>Single Parenthood</B> -- The number of children being raised
in single-parent homes is rapidly rising.  In 1970, 7.5 million
children lived in single, female-headed homes; by 1993, the figure
had more than doubled to 15.6 million.  In fact, over 27 percent
of all children under 18 live in single-parent homes (1993).
<P>
<LI><B>Abortion</B> -- Abortion is strongly linked to unwed pregnancy.
 Indeed, unmarried mothers account for 70 to 80 percent of the
1.5 million abortions performed on U.S. women; 406,000 abortions
were obtained by teenagers in 1992.  Thus, helping to make adoption
a more viable option could mean (1) fewer abortions, including
repeat abortions, and (2) many women being spared from experiencing
the trauma of post-abortion syndrome.
<P>
<LI><B>Poverty</B> -- Regardless of race or socioeconomic background,
a high correlation exists between single parenthood and poverty.
 Of all children under age 6 living in poverty, 61 percent are
from single-parent families (1992).  In fact, children under age
6 from single-parent households are more likely to live in poverty
than not.
<P>
<LI><B>Breaking the cycle</B> -- For the child of a single parent,
the statistical odds of becoming an unwed mother later in life,
or fathering a child out-of-wedlock, are staggering.  One study
found that 80 percent of the girls who were mothers at 15 were
themselves daughters of teenage mothers.  Adoption can help break
that cycle.
</UL><P>
The American public overwhelmingly supports adoption policy. 
A recent Family Research Council survey of 1,000 Americans found
that, by a margin of 3-to-1, respondents favor efforts &quot;to
make it easier for children born out-of-wedlock to be adopted.&quot;
 And when presented with four options to resolve out-of-wedlock
teenage pregnancies, 33 percent of respondents thought it best
to &quot;have the child and put it up for adoption;&quot; 25 percent
thought it best for the mother &quot;to marry the child's father
and have the child;&quot; 13 percent thought it best for the mother
&quot;to have the child and raise it by herself;&quot; and only
10 percent thought it best for her to have an abortion.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>THE CURRENT STATUS OF ADOPTION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Even though most people agree that adoption is a good choice,
few exercise that option.  Only 6 percent of all teenage mothers
choose adoption for their babies; in the black community, adoption
accounts for less than one percent.  So while the number of potentially
adoptable children is theoretically large due to the high numbers
of out-of-wedlock births and crisis pregnancies, there remains,
ironically, a shortage of children.  An estimated one to two million
prospective parents are <I>still waiting to adopt a child</I>.
<P>
Perhaps one of the reasons why so few unwed mothers choose adoption
for their babies is that adoption frequently is not presented
to women as a viable choice.  One study found that nearly 40 percent
of pregnancy counselors fail to include adoption as an option
in their counseling.  Even worse, the counselors had a 40 percent
rate of uncertainty and inaccurate knowledge about adoption. 
Incredibly, some pregnancy counselors who thought adoption would
be a good choice still failed to present it as an option, because
they thought the girls would not want to hear about it.
<P>
Consequently, the number of adoptions reflects the lack of attention
adoption has received.  The latest available data show that 51,157
unrelated adoptions (adoptions by people not related to the child
by blood or marriage) of American children occurred in 1986. 
Of these 51,000-plus domestic adoptions, approximately one-half
were adoptions of healthy infants (under 2 years of age) of all
races and ethnic backgrounds.  The remaining adoptions were of
older kids or of children with special needs, i.e., physical,
mental, or emotional disabilities, part of a sibling group, etc.
<P>
In addition to the adoption of American children, there were 10,097
foreign-born children adopted by Americans in 1987.  However,
due to a decrease in the number of adoptions of South Korean children,
this figure has since declined to an estimated 6,500 adoptions
in fiscal year 1992.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>FURTHER POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Because of adoption's many benefits for both mother and child,
enabling more women to choose adoption should be a policy priority.
 Thus, in addition to the two proposals discussed earlier, the
Family Research Council recommends the following measures to make
the promotion of adoption more comprehensive.
<P>
(1)  Protocol for counseling women in crisis pregnancies should
include presentation of the adoption choice and its manifold benefits.
 This protocol should be used by counselors regardless of their
place of employment, i.e., crisis pregnancy centers, public health
facilities, and abortion clinics.  Inherent in this recommendation
is the expectation that such counselors would be properly trained
and adequately informed about the adoption option.  Furthermore,
the development of maternity homes should also be encouraged as
a way to promote adoption, as such homes have higher rates of
relinquishment than do other facilities.
<P>
(2)  The Department of Health and Human Services should collect
data on all adoptions, both public and private.  Currently, the
federal government only tracks adoption through the public system,
and the data available on the private sector is both limited and
outdated.  Data collection would also be enhanced through the
use of uniform data collection measures in each of the states.
 In addition to tracking the number of adoptions, the federal
government should encourage social science research regarding
adoption's impact on adopted children, birthmothers, and adoptive
parents.  This would not only add to the slim body of knowledge
already existing, it would also heighten awareness of the adoption
choice.
<P>
(3)  Reduce the barriers for prospective parents to choose adoption.
 This would include removing the obstacles hindering transracial
adoptions, reforming the insurance code to guarantee coverage
for adopted special-needs children, and speeding up the process
by which foster children could be adopted.

<P>
The American Psychiatric Association is a leading private, clinical
professional organization.  Over the years, the APA increasingly
has promoted greater acceptance of homosexuality.  And now, some
APA members are trying to outlaw counseling to homosexuals who
desire to change their orientation.
<P>
The association's pro-homosexual position is not shared by some
of its own members, and it offends many people of faith.  For
example, APA member Dr. Roy H. Hart writes from a Jewish perspective
in <I>Psychiatric News</I> that organized psychiatry does not
choose to understand religion's aversion to homosexuality.  He
writes in the May 1994 edition, &quot;Americans have the highest
rate of church attendance and membership in the Christian world,
but psychiatrists contribute little to those statistics.  What
is ego-alien for the psychiatrist -- religion -- is the center
of existence for a vast segment of the population.&quot;[1]
<P>
APA President John McIntyre tried to bridge the chasm with religion
when, after a pilgrimage to the epicenter of Mormonism, Salt Lake
City, he commented on the &quot;improved dialogue between religion
and psychiatry.&quot;[2]
<P>
The bridge McIntyre began to build in 1994 is now crumbling with
the advent of the January 1995 issue of the <I>American Journal
of Psychiatry</I>, the APA's official publication.  That issue
contains an article by Franklin D. Jones and Ronald J. Koshes,
&quot;Homosexuality and the Military&quot; which adds salt to
an old wound.[3] The article is noteworthy for its poor review of
research.  Its quick initial turn-around along with its array
of revisions suggests that the <I>AJP</I> editorial staff ignored
normal review procedures in order to publish a politicized article.

<P>
<B>1. Underwent an unusual review process.</B>  The article
was received by the <I>AJP</I> staff on July 14, 1993.[4] It was
subsequently revised four times before it was accepted June 17,
1994.[5] The first revision was received within four months, a very
brief time for this internationally recognized journal.  Following
the initial review there were at least three more revisions, suggesting
an unusual review process -- more like a dialogue than a peer-review
process.  In typical peer review, one or at most two revisions
are allowed. 
<P>
<B>2. Misrepresents the history of the military's homosexual
policy.</B>  The authors claim that the Pentagon's policy was
first formalized in 1982, and that the ban dates back to World
War II.[6] But the policy was formalized by President Carter and
became effective on January 16, 1981.  It was revised and updated
January 28, 1982.
<P>
The military's homosexual policy dates back to the British Articles
of War in 1775.  An individual was drummed out of the Continental
Army for attempted sodomy in 1778.[7] Prior to WW II, the legal
construction of the Articles of War and Army regulations were
broader in nature than today's.  Homosexual misconduct was prosecuted
under the categories of &quot;conduct unbecoming an officer&quot;
or, for enlisted members, &quot;conduct to the prejudice of good
order and military discipline.&quot;  After 1900, individuals
were punished for committing homosexual acts, which were lumped
under the rubric of sodomy.[8]
<P>
A WW I War Department circular, signed by the Surgeon General
in 1917, listed homosexuality as cause for rejection under the
category of &quot;psychopathic&quot; characteristics.[9] The 1921
enlistment standards included an implied homosexual policy excluding
people thought to be homosexual.[10] The right to make decisions
concerning the retention of enlisted men was delegated to relatively
low levels.  Discharges for &quot;inaptness or undesirable habits
or traits of character&quot; were handled under Section 8, Army
Regulation 615-360.[11]
<P>
The War Department's 1941 policy, which was harsher than previous
ones, emphasized that homosexual &quot;sodomists&quot; would not
be discharged but court-martialed.[12] Despite this increased penalty,
during the war there was an unofficial toleration of some homosexuals
because replacements were not guaranteed.  The policy was revised
in May, 1947 and, again, in 1949 to mandate that &quot;[h]omosexual
personnel, irrespective of sex, should not be permitted to serve
in any branch of the Armed Forces in any capacity, and prompt
separation of known homosexuals from the Armed Forces is mandatory.&quot;[13]
<P>
This fundamental was added to the Uniform Code of Military Justice
in 1951 with Articles 125 (act of sodomy) and 134 (assault). 
In September, 1958, Class III homosexuals (those who had committed
no homosexual act while in the military service) were furnished
honorable or general discharges based on the character of their
service.[14]
<P>
In the late 1970s, the Report of the Joint Service Administrative
Discharge Study Group recommended that the military reaffirm the
longstanding ban (indeed, it was more than 200 years old) on homosexuals
by incorporating into the policy the principled phrase, &quot;homosexuality
is incompatible with military service.&quot;  It also called for
the phrase, &quot;processing (for separation) is mandatory unless...the
allegations are groundless,&quot; to be included in all subsequent
Department of Defense (DoD) directives.  It also recommended some
leniency in cases of &quot;unsuitability,&quot; i.e., those involved
in homosexual tendencies or acts between consenting adults would
be honorably discharged.[15]
<P>
The 1982 policy cited in the <I>AJP</I> article incorporates the
aforementioned recommendations but was first published during
the last days of President Carter's administration.  That policy
was replaced by a law signed by President Clinton on November
30, 1993.  The Pentagon published implementing regulations on
February 28, 1994.
<P>
<B>3. Misrepresents the homosexual discharge history</B>.
 The authors cite homosexual discharge numbers and costs from
a discredited 1992 General Accounting Office study.[16] Other studies
show that the GAO underestimated the scope of homosexual discharges
and overestimated the costs to the government.
<P>
The GAO report stated that it costs the government $27 million
annually to discharge homosexuals.  But that figure is misleading.
 The military has a fixed number of authorized personnel, established
by Congress.  The projected annual number of enlistments is directly
related to the projected number of losses to achieve the established
end strength.  The cost to train new service members and to separate
other members is determined from the projected number of enlistments
and losses.  Those are sunk costs tied to running the training
base and a change of a few percent is of no real financial consequence.
<P>
Given the size of the military, the number of homosexuals discharged
is small.  For example, from 1980 through 1991, a total of 8,427,872
people served in the military.  During that same period there
were 17,840 non-judicial administrative discharges for homosexuality
--  .0021 percent of all of those who served during that period.
 An unpublished Army study during the same period puts homosexual
discharges in perspective.  It found there were 3,153 administrative
discharges for homosexuality between 1983 and 1991 but five times
(13,655) more for alcohol abuse and four times (10,845) more for
personnel being overweight.
<P>
The article also fails to mention homosexual punitive separations
which were not included in the GAO report.  A study obtained from
the Pentagon under the Freedom of Information Act analyzed 100
Army cases from 1989 to 1992.  Forty-nine percent of those cases
involved children as victims.  Eighty-five percent involved victims
who had not consented, and five percent of the offenders were
HIV-positive.[17]
<P>
The same report summarized a 1992 incident at Fort Hood, Texas,
where 60 homosexual men [soldiers and civilians] met in a public
toilet next to a child care center.  The men cut holes in the
walls to permit sex between men in adjacent stalls.  The men also
installed a mirror to allow them to see the approach of intruders.
<P>
These homosexuals were indiscriminate in their choice of partners
and often engaged in sex within moments of entering the bathroom.
 Sexual acts included oral and anal sodomy, mutual masturbation,
and fondling of the buttocks.  All soldiers in this incident received
disciplinary discharges which would not have been measured by
the 1992 GAO study.  This information was neither cited by GAO
nor by the <I>AJP</I> review.
<P>
<B>4. Relies on debunked Kinsey research to distort the
estimate of homosexuals in the military.</B>  The authors state,
&quot;Most authors feel this [4 percent exclusively homosexual]
is too conservative and that about 7 percent to 10 percent are
primarily homosexual in orientation.  Kinsey et al. also found
that 37 percent of males between childhood and old age had experienced
homoerotic orgasm, and another 13 percent claimed to have had
homoerotic stimulation without overt contact.  If these epidemiological
data are reliable, the policy of the Department of Defense would
severely limit the induction and retention of service members...strict
adherence to the Kinsey data and the policy of the Department
of Defense would result in the elimination of every other soldier
(37 percent plus 13 percent) in today's military.&quot;[18]
<P>
Alfred C. Kinsey, an Indiana University zoologist, who authored
<I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</I> in 1948, based his research
on 12,000 interviews.  Kinsey relied heavily on data gleaned from
criminals and extrapolated his findings to the general population.
 Psychologist Abraham Maslow said that Kinsey's work, like all
sex surveys, had a high margin of &quot;volunteer&quot; error
because many people are not honest or willing to talk about their
most intimate sexual secrets.[19] 
<P>
No reputable survey has replicated Kinsey's findings, and a number
of recent studies suggest that the homosexual population is considerably
less than 10 percent of the U.S. population.  For example, a 1991
national survey of sexually active adults done by the National
Opinion Research Center shows that 98.4 percent of adults were
exclusively heterosexual that year.[20] A 1993 survey by the Battelle
Human Affairs Research Centers found that only 1.1 percent of
all Americans are exclusively homosexual.[21] A survey conducted
by the Alan Guttmacher Institute in 1993 found that one percent
of men consider themselves exclusively homosexual.[22] And a 1994
National Health and Social Life Survey at the University of Chicago
found that 2.8 percent of men and 1.4 percent of women identified
themselves as homosexual or bisexual.[23]
<P>
A March 1994 article in the <I>American Journal of Psychiatry</I>
cites several surveys of American men showing the prevalence of
homosexuality.  For example, the National Survey of Men found
that only 1.1 percent of men have been exclusively homosexual
during the preceding 10 years.  Another study found that 2.4 percent
of men are currently homosexual.[24]
<P>
<B>5. Relies on outdated polls to indicate that the public
supports lifting the ban. </B>The article cites two surveys done
before the national debate to suggest that Americans now favor
lifting the ban.[25]  It does not cite surveys with contradictory
findings nor does it discuss these contradictions.
<P>
Public support for lifting the ban eroded as the debate intensified
in 1993.  Midway through the debate, support for lifting the ban
was no more than 40 percent.[26] A national poll by Fabrizio, McLaughlin
&amp; Associates in March 1993 found that a decisive 54 percent
to 37 percent of voters disagreed that President Clinton should
overrule military leaders such as General Colin Powell and require
the military to accept homosexuals.[27]
<P>
Most military personnel support the ban.  A February 1993 <I>Los
Angeles Times</I> survey found that 40 percent of service members
disapprove, on moral grounds, of lifting the ban and 46 percent
said lifting the ban would enter into their reenlistment decisions.
 Another 11 percent said flatly that they would not reenlist because
of it.[28] A February 1993 CNN/Gallup Poll found that 74 percent
of men who had not attended college opposed lifting the ban. 
This is the prime recruiting population.
<P>
In essence, this review selectively cites survey data to support
its position, implying that no other dissimilar results have been
found.  
<P>
<B>6. Ignores the law and relies on Clinton's inconsistent
policy.</B>  The article makes no mention of the military's homosexual
law which was signed by President Clinton on November 30, 1993.
 The authors suggest that the regulations will &quot;generate
a series of court cases based on the freedom of speech and self-incrimination
statutes of the U.S. Constitution.&quot;[29]
<P>
No doubt the new regulations will be contested in the courts.
 The fact that the law and the new regulations are inconsistent,
however, is significant.  This fact was ignored by the authors.
 Consider some of the problems:
<P>
<LI>The Clinton Administration interpreted the law to permit so-called
&quot;celibate&quot; homosexuals to serve.  This view, i.e., that
&quot;celibate&quot; homosexuals even exist, contradicts past
legal rulings and will lead to more homosexuals serving and fewer
investigations of their likely misconduct.
<P>
<LI>The regulations dropped the critical statement that &quot;homosexuality
is incompatible with military service.&quot;  While Congress has
carried this principle forward in the law, Secretary of Defense
William Perry failed to include it in the regulations.[30]
<P>
<LI>The new policy potentially cripples military discipline by creating
a number of new obstacles before investigations can be started.
 Thus the regulations prevent commanders from investigating soldiers
for homosexuality without clear evidence that they have done something
criminally wrong.  According to Perry, attending gay pride parades,
frequenting gay bars, and possessing gay materials are not &quot;credible&quot;
evidence to initiate an investigation.[31]
<P>
<LI>The &quot;Perry rules&quot; also prevent criminal investigation
agencies from looking into most cases of adult, private, consensual
sexual misconduct, e.g., sodomy and adultery.[32]
<P>
<LI>Under the Perry rules, and directly contrary to more than 200
years of military practice, the DoD no longer considers homosexual
or bisexual behavior a marker for increased security risk.  Questions
about homosexuality were removed from security background investigations,
and information discovered during a security investigation cannot
be used for adverse action without high-level political permission.[33]
<P>
Clinton's Pentagon appointees are now pointing to the constant
number of homosexual discharges as proof that the policy is fine
as implemented.[34] This is misleading.  Most homosexuals facing
discharge do not challenge their separation.  However, it takes
just one advocate to exploit the weaknesses in the regulations
and then a court, deferring to the &quot;military's&quot; interpretation,
will strike down the statute as unconstitutional.   
<P>
Meanwhile, many soldiers are uncertain about Clinton's policy.
 In October 1994, military sociologist Charles Moskos conducted
an informal survey of soldiers in Haiti.  He found that 39 percent
thought the policy too lenient, 36 percent thought it to be a
good policy, and 22 percent were not sure.[35]  
<P>
<B>7. Attacks current policy requiring military psychiatrists
to report homosexual service members.</B>[36] The military does not
recognize absolute doctor-patient confidentiality.  A military
physician treating someone for a disorder that disqualifies the
member from continued service is bound by the regulation to report
the situation.  This is important for deployment and health readiness
purposes.
<P>
<B>8. Distorts facts about allied military experiences
with homosexuals.</B>  The article states, &quot;a survey of the
policies and practices of NATO armies revealed that only 24 percent
(4 of 17: New Zealand, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United
States) had exclusionary and separation policies.&quot;[37] The authors
ignore the June 1993 GAO report on &quot;Homosexuals in the Military:
 Policies and Practices of Foreign Countries.&quot;[38] This report
certainly could have been obtained and cited, given the number
of allowed revisions.  The GAO reviewed 25 countries and selected
four countries for detailed analysis.  The report states that
11 countries have policies that do not permit homosexuals to serve
in the military, 11 have policies that do.  Three of the latter
11 countries do not have any laws, regulations, or policies that
address this issue.  An unpublished Pentagon study conducted in
December 1992 found that some of those countries that permit homosexuals
to serve do so with strict guidelines. 
<P>
Testimony before the Senate and House Armed Services Committees
(SASC and HASC) in April and May 1993 illustrates the dramatic
differences between foreign militaries and our own.  For example,
the Netherlands started a homosexual military experiment in 1974.
 That nation has 65,000 service members, including 40,000 conscripts
who serve 14 months and who primarily commute from home each day.
 The U.S. has 2.5 million active and reserve service personnel
stationed in the U.S. and around the world at any given time.
 The German armed forces, which are included among those that
do <I>not</I> have an exclusionary policy, will not induct acknowledged
homosexual volunteers because they would &quot;undermine military
order and discipline.&quot;[39] Of the 476,300 members, 43 percent
are conscripts who, if identified as homosexual, may be required
to undergo psychological tests to determine their fitness.  The
German Federal Administrative Court declared in November 1990
that the military is justified in not allowing homosexuals to
serve in leadership and educational positions.
<P>
Foreign social experiences have little relevance for America's
military.  The U.S. is a superpower with urgent missions worldwide.
 America also has a radical homosexual community and a liberal
judicial system, a combination that guarantees a steady stream
of legal activism that is disruptive to military morale.
<P>
<B>9. Falsely claims that most societies approve of homosexuality.</B>
 The article states, &quot;Cultural studies....  In the early
1950s Ford and Beach studied 77 modern primitive societies concerning
attitudes toward homosexuality.  They found 28 condemned in which
it was condemned but 49, nearly two-thirds, in which it was approved
in more or less restricted forms.&quot;[40]
<P>
This observation is misleading.  Most modern societies consider
homosexuality a mental illness.  For example, a 1992 survey by
the APA's Office of International Affairs in conjunction with
the APA Committee of Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Psychiatrists
surveyed 125 psychiatric associations around the world.  It found
that all but three associations consider homosexuality a mental
illness or a sexual deviation.  U.S. psychiatrists are joined
only by Denmark and South Africa in their efforts to redefine
homosexuality and protect the &quot;right&quot; of homosexual
adults to conduct consensual sexual relations in private.[41]
<P>
<B>10. Misrepresents the pathological implications of
homosexuality.</B> The article cites a 1945 study of 183 former
college students known to be homosexual who served in the military
during World War II.  Sixty-four percent of these people &quot;served
with credible records.&quot;  The review also attributes the military's
decision no longer to view homosexuality as a mental illness to
the APA's 1973 decision to remove homosexuality from the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders-II.[42]
<P>
The article states that only 64 percent of homosexuals in their
study had credible service records.  Rather than being an indication
of success, this should be an argument for exclusion.  Better
than 90 percent of the 8.5 million World War II era veterans &quot;served
with credible records.&quot;  
<P>
The implication is that since 64 percent in a single study had
&quot;credible&quot; records, there is no justification for the
exclusion.  This proves nothing.  They were honored for their
&quot;credible&quot; service to their country, not their homosexual
behavior.  After all, the ban was in force, so homosexuals were
forced to curb their behavior. 
<P>
The history of the American Psychiatric Association's decision
to change the DSM-II is worth examining.  Specifically, the military's
World War II experience provided considerable insight into human
behavior.  Specialists in military medicine literally rewrote
the diagnostic codes and nomenclature for psychiatric disorders
which, ultimately, became the format used by the American Psychiatric
Association in the 1980s and 1990s.  In 1952 the APA Council approved
and published a new nomenclature for categorizing mental disorders
similar to those used by the military.  The nomenclature identified
homosexuality as a pathologic behavior, i.e., &quot;sexual deviation,&quot;
under the section on Sociopathic Personality Disturbances.[43]
<P>
The second edition of the DSM for Mental Disorders continued to
identify homosexuality as a &quot;sexual deviation&quot; disorder.
 And since 1945 the Army has consistently held that homosexuality
is a behavioral problem, not a mental disease.[44]
<P>
From 1969 to 1971, homosexual activists stormed the annual meetings
of the APA demanding the normalization of homosexual behavior.
 In 1971 homosexual activists invaded the annual meeting, screaming
and kicking, seizing microphones, and denouncing psychiatry as
&quot;the enemy incarnate.&quot;[45]
<P>
The DSM was challenged at the 1973 meeting of the New England
Psychiatric Society by homosexual activists.  They recommended
that the nomenclature's section on &quot;sexual deviation&quot;
be renamed &quot;sexual dysfunction.&quot;  Later that year APA
Trustees ruled that homosexuality would no longer be listed as
a &quot;mental disorder&quot; in its official nomenclature of
mental disorders and recommended that it be replaced by the term
&quot;sexual orientation disturbance.&quot;[46]
<P>
According to author Ronald Bayer in <I>Homosexuality and American
Psychiatry: The Politics of Diagnosis</I>, homosexual activists
used intimidation to force the APA to remove homosexuality as
a mental illness from the DSM of psychiatric disorders.  &quot;The
result was,&quot; explained Bayer, &quot;not a conclusion based
upon an approximation of the scientific truth as dictated by reason,
but was instead an action demanded by the ideological temper of
the times.&quot;[47]
<P>
Homosexuality was subsequently regarded as a variant of sexual
orientation disturbance.  The &quot;nomenclature revolution&quot;
continued and in 1986 the last remaining term, &quot;ego-dystonic
homosexuality,&quot; was removed from the DSM.  This was done
over the protest of many psychiatrists who preferred to label
it a long standing disturbance originating in the early years
of life.[48]
<P>
The membership of the American Medical Association disagreed with
the APA's decision.  A 1975 AMA membership survey found that 69
percent agreed that homosexuality is &quot;pathological.&quot;[49]
 Additionally, psychotherapists such as Elizabeth Moberly, Gerald
van den Aardweg, Joseph Nicolosi, Charles Socarides, and Masters
and Johnson have reported much success helping homosexuals to
recover, thereby proving the point that it is curable.[50]
<P>
<B>11. Claims military homosexuals would not contribute
to poor morale.</B>  The article proposes three points concerning
military morale.  First, it blames immature recruits for the anti-homosexual
policy but fails to cite supporting data.  &quot;Many recruits,
who may be insecure in their own sexual orientation, may react
with various forms of discomfort to the presence of an identified
homosexual person.&quot;[51] Second, it acknowledges that &quot;subcultures
in a military organization can disrupt functioning of the unit...since
the military copes with many subcultures, it remains for the military
to make a convincing case that this [homosexual] subculture is
substantially and essentially so much more damaging&quot; to justify
&quot;the costs of [the] current policy.&quot;[52] The military's
significant experience with drug and alcohol subcultures provides
ample experience with damaging categories of behavior.  Finally,
the authors state, &quot;We expect that acceptance of homosexuals
in the military will increase, negating the need for a walled-off
subculture and resulting in more respect for the homosexual soldier.&quot;[53]
 The authors provide no reason or basis for this supposition.
<P>
Morale is defined as &quot;a strong sense of enthusiasm and dedication
to a commonly shared goal that unifies a group.&quot;  Heterosexual
soldiers forced to live and work with avowed homosexuals cannot
be expected to do so with &quot;...a strong sense of enthusiasm.&quot;
<P>
Open homosexuals tend to bind their basic identity with their
sexual orientation and practice: &quot;I am a homosexual,&quot;
as opposed to the American soldier's basic identity: &quot;I am
a soldier.&quot;  The homosexual's preoccupation with individual
behavioral characteristics is incongruent with and detracts from
the commonly shared goal -- accomplishment of the mission -- which
unifies heterosexual soldiers and subordinates their individual
goals to that of the group.
<P>
The homosexual subculture is recognized as &quot;liberated&quot;
or, in a manner of speaking, undisciplined.  This is inherently
at odds with the 24-hour discipline system within which soldiers
must live and work.  Homosexuals are distinguished from other
subcultures by their behavior [sodomy].  Another group behavioral
characteristic is a very high rate of promiscuity.  Military records
indicate that homosexuals are statistically more likely to engage
in misconduct than heterosexuals.  They have a higher incidence
of drug and alcohol abuse than heterosexuals.  If these statistics
aren't enough, much-touted books such as Randy Shilts' <I>Conduct
Unbecoming</I> and Mary Ann Humphrey's <I>My Country, My Right
to Serve</I> provide, perhaps unwittingly, ample testimony to
the disruptive nature of homosexuals in military units.
<P>
The voice of experience also indicates that homosexuals jeopardize
military morale.  For example, a survey of active duty officers
conducted for the American Security Council Foundation found that
99.03 percent said homosexuals would undermine the cohesiveness
and readiness of combat units.[54] The Defense Readiness Council
compiled a survey of 2,800 retired flag and general officers.
 Nearly 90 percent said they believe homosexuals undermine morale.[55]
<P>
<B>12. Contends, against the evidence, that homosexuals
aren't a security risk</B>.  The article states that identifying
oneself as a homosexual is no more of a security risk than identifying
oneself as a heterosexual.  The authors call for the government
to show a &quot;nexus&quot; between the presence of homosexuals
and adverse impact on duty performance.[56]
<P>
This is a flawed argument.  Few people identify themselves as
heterosexual; that identity is assumed.  Homosexuals do, indeed,
identify themselves, however.
<P>
The article ignores the landmark research by Alan Bell and Martin
Weinberg, <I>Homosexualities: A Study of Diversity Among Men and
Women</I>, which found that a significant number of homosexuals
report that &quot;someone has threatened [them with] exposure
of homosexuality in order to get something of value.&quot;[57]
<P>
If the threat of blackmail was the only problem with homosexuals
in the military, then lifting the prohibition would be justified.
 However, for the many reasons cited in this analysis, homosexuals
should not serve openly and security investigations are a valid
mechanism for enforcing the ban.
<P>
<B>13. Contends, against overwhelming evidence, that homosexuals
are not a special health risk.</B>  The article virtually ignores
the documented health risks associated with the homosexual lifestyle,
citing only the military's HIV screening program.  &quot;By policy,&quot;
the authors explain, &quot;no one who tests positive for the HIV
virus is allowed to enter active duty.&quot;[58]
<P>
Admitting open homosexuals into the military violates the legal
principle of the assumption of risk.  This principle states that
if you know there is a risk and you assume it, then don't complain
when the risk materializes.  The review's authors denigrate a
very serious risk.
<P>
A recent report from the University of Michigan found that people
with HIV are more capable of spreading the virus during the first
60 days of infection, but that blood tests during this period
do not find the HIV.[59] This means that the military assumes the
risk, even though all personnel are initially tested, that soldiers
will not be infected.  This is why screening out high-risk groups
and not just those who test positive for HIV is smart.  Unfortunately,
the Clinton Administration no longer screens out homosexuals --
the highest-risk group for contracting HIV.
<P>
The Army's Surgeon General, Lieutenant General Alcide Lanoue,
addressed the health risks associated with homosexuals:[60]
<P>
&quot;The military setting provides unique requirements for
safety in executing the Army blood transfusion program and for
preventing the transmission of blood-borne pathogens (especially
HIV and hepatitis B) in the field setting.  Homosexual males would
comprise a pool of ineligible blood donors and as a group are
at high risk of infection by HIV and hepatitis B, both significant
blood-borne pathogens which can infect other soldiers through
exposure to blood in peace and war.&quot; [During Operation Desert
Storm, there were five documented instances where blood was drawn
from soldiers and transfused.  In Somalia, five units of blood
were drawn and directly transfused to Somalis.  The urgency of
such transfusions precludes testing for the AIDS virus.]
<P>
&quot;HIV and other Sexually Transmitted Disease rates will
increase to the extent that the proportion of homosexual males
in the Army increases because homosexual/bisexual men are allowed
to enter and remain in the Army.&quot;  [The CDC reports that
most of the AIDS patients in this country are homosexuals.[61] Homosexuals
account for a disproportionate number of America's most serious
STD's, including syphilis, gonorrhea, genital warts, and hepatitis
A and B.[62] Moreover, the 1994 homosexual sex survey in <I>The Advocate</I>,
a leading homosexual magazine, found that 13 percent of respondents
were HIV-positive and only 18 percent had taken all three shots
in the hepatitis B vaccine series.  <I>The Advocate</I> article
admits &quot;Gay men are one of the top risk groups for being
exposed to hepatitis B.&quot;[63] ]
<P>
&quot;A male homosexual soldier is significantly more likely
than a heterosexual soldier to be nondeployable for medical reasons
related to HIV infection.  If HIV-infected, the soldier will be
permanently nondeployable.  Male homosexuals are more likely to
acquire sexually transmitted diseases which can render them nondeployable,
such as gonorrhea, syphilis, and hepatitis B.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Readiness from a medical standpoint will suffer if the restriction
is lifted.  The impact would be felt at the unit level, when the
homosexual soldier cannot train and deploy for health reasons.
 Likewise, the impact would be felt Army-wide in terms of the
military blood program and of the burden placed on the Army health
care system.&quot;
<P>
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, homosexuals
are especially vulnerable to contracting HIV.  They are a high-risk
group because of co-factors associated with their lifestyle. 
These include recreational drug use, homosexual sex, malnutrition,
prior incidents of sexually transmitted diseases, and, most significantly,
sexual promiscuity.  
<P>
Homosexuals who participate in unsafe sex practices with multiple
partners and without taking precautions are at great risk of contracting
sexually transmitted diseases.  <I>The Advocate</I> survey found
that 72 percent of homosexual respondents engage in insertive
oral intercourse, 46 percent insertive anal intercourse, 45 percent
receptive anal-oral sex, 48 percent in three-way sex, 24 percent
in group sex (4 or more), and 10 percent in sadomasochism.[64] Most
of the homosexuals in the survey admitted to having had more than
30 sex partners over their lifetime, and about a third (35 percent)
report more than 100 partners.  The survey also found that homosexual
men use condoms only 1 time in 4.[65]
<P>
Heterosexuals have fewer sex partners than homosexuals.  A 1988-1990
General Social Survey found that 91 percent of men 25 to 29 years
of age are heterosexually active.  Nineteen percent of these men
have had only one lifetime sex partner, 55 percent have had 2
to 19 lifetime partners, and 25 percent have had 20 or more lifetime
partners.[66]
<P>
The University of Chicago published a national sex survey in October,
1994, which found that 20 percent of men have had only one sex
partner in their lifetime, 21 percent have had 2 to 4 partners,
17 percent had 5 to 10 partners, 16 percent had 11 to 20, and
17 percent report having had 21 or more sex partners.[67] However,
that survey excluded men over 59, who constitute one-sixth of
the population and who typically have more conservative sex lives.
 Thus the real figures probably are even lower for the population
of all men.[68]
<P>
Homosexuality also increases medical costs.  With the ban in place,
openly homosexual inductees are turned away.  However, with the
ban lifted, a homosexual recruit could contract HIV within days
or have early-stage HIV, test negative at first, and be accorded
full medical benefits for the rest of his life.  This is about
$120,000 in direct medical costs per AIDS patient.[69]
<P>
Dr. Edmund Tramont, Associate Director for retroviral research
at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, published a 10-year projection
for HIV costs at $1.7 to $1.9 billion.[70]  However, he warns that
this is in 1989 dollars, is based on the present rate of new cases,
and assumes that only 60 percent of health care beneficiaries
will use the military health care system.  The potential 10-year
cost could rise to $5 billion if these assumptions are incorrect.[71]
 The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services indicates that
the lifetime cost of treating a person with AIDS -- from diagnosis
until death -- is $102,000.[72] The American Medical Association
estimated the per-person AIDS patient cost would rise to $386,000
by the year 2000 and to $639,000 by the year 2008.[73]
<P>
As of April 1993 the military had dealt with 8,832 HIV-positive
service members.  Most have been separated from the service, but,
at that time, 1,580 were still on active duty.  Their status precluded
them from deploying overseas and necessitated special assignments
and special medical care.[74]
<P>
Homosexuals also have a much shorter life expectancy than heterosexuals,
as indicated by a study of more than 6,400 obituaries in 16 homosexual
newspapers.  The average age of homosexuals who died from AIDS
is 39; from all other causes it is 41.[75]
<P>
Substance addiction and abuse are called the second set of key
health problems after AIDS in the homosexual subculture (and violence
is third).[76]
<P>
Screening out homosexuals and discharging those discovered later
makes financial sense.  The 1992 GAO report states that the military
spent $26 million on homosexuals discharged.  The military spent
many times that figure treating homosexuals with AIDS -- people
who lied to enter the military and now receive full health and
pay benefits.  The cost-effective decision would be to minimize
the risk to the federal taxpayer by rejecting homosexuals before
they are recruited and discharging those later discovered.
<P>
<B>14. Cites legal challenges as indication that public
will soon favor homosexual service.</B>  The article briefly reviews
the current judicial climate regarding the military policy.  The
authors believe, &quot;With the increased public attention now
focused on the miliary policy, swift changes could sweep away
previous positions.&quot;[77]
<P>
The article cites two cases won by the government and the case
of Navy Petty Officer Keith Meinhold, who was discharged for saying
he was gay on national television.  Meinhold's case was labeled
&quot;the most recent legal case decided.&quot;[78]
<P>
Meinhold's case is not the most recent case decided.  The case
of former midshipman Joseph C. Steffan from the U.S. Naval Academy
was decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
on November 22, 1994.  The decision from the country's &quot;second
highest court&quot; declared the military's homosexual ban constitutional.[79]
<P>
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled August
31, 1994 that a statement of homosexuality alone is insufficient
reason to discharge Meinhold.  That decision was limited only
to sailor Meinhold and struck down the lower court's decision
to extend the ruling to the entire Defense Department.[80]
<P>
Although numerous cases of former service members discharged for
homosexuality are now in the judicial system, there is no indication
that &quot;swift changes&quot; will &quot;sweep away previous
positions.&quot;  On the contrary, it is expected that the 104th
Congress will force the Clinton Administration to enforce the
homosexual law despite rulings that are in conflict with the law.
<P>
The issue of homosexuals in the military was cited as one of the
pivotal issues that collapsed the Democratic Party's majority
in Congress.  The new majority should respond by reinstating the
full homosexual ban, i.e., require the Clinton Administration
to obey the new homosexual law and to reintroduce the questions
for recruits at induction.
<P>
<B>15. Concludes that the ban is based solely on bad attitudes.</B>
 The article states, &quot;The strongest argument for excluding
and separating homosexual persons from military service is 
not mental illness or security risks but the presence of social
strictures and adverse attitudes.&quot;[81]
<P>
The authors ignore a wealth of information that comes from Congress's
oversight hearings in 1993.  Reasons include combat readiness
(cohesion, deployability risk, family and community risks); manpower
(recruitment and retention risks); cost (medical, housing, claims
from soldiers previously discharged for homosexuality, quality
of force sustainment, and lost productivity); and political (military
used as laboratory for social experimentation to satisfy the political
views of a small minority).  The article completely ignores these
concerns.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
&quot;Homosexuality and the Military&quot; is an article that
was rushed to press, was poorly reviewed, and does little for
the academic credibility of the APA -- an organization that should
be promoting sound research, not a moral agenda that abuses and
neglects available research.  The article is evidence that the
APA is playing an ever greater role in the promotion of the homosexual
agenda.

<P>
In the welfare debate last year, President Clinton himself stated
that &quot;the real source of [the] problem is the inordinate
number of out-of-wedlock births in this country.&quot;[1]  He also
conceded that &quot;there's no question that [ending welfare for
unwed mothers] would work.  The question is... 'Is it morally
right?'&quot;[2]
<P>
While the President's proposed policies leave much to be desired,
he has formulated precisely the right question to frame the current
debate over welfare reform in general and illegitimacy in particular.
 There can be no more important policy objective than the preservation
-- or more properly in this day and age, the revitalization --
of our nation's moral capital.  As James Q. Wilson wrote in his
oft-cited article, &quot;The Rediscovery of Character: Private
Virtue and Public Policy&quot;:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The essential first step is to acknowledge that at root, in almost
every area of important public concern, we are seeking to induce
persons to act virtuously....  Not only is such conduct desirable
in its own right, it appears now to be necessary if large improvements
are to be made in those matters we consider problems.[3]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
There exists a striking public consensus that the welfare state's
practice of subsidizing illegitimacy is not only a massive problem,
but a moral problem at root.
<P>
Even so unlikely a source as Bruce Reed, President Clinton's leading
aide on welfare reform, acknowledges that the essential purpose
of reform must be to reverse the alarming rise in out-of-wedlock
births.[4]  If not driven exclusively by AFDC &quot;benefits,&quot;
the increase has at least been sustained and perpetuated by the
expansion of a system that pays recipients to bear illegitimate
children.  Current trends indicate that by the year 2015 -- some
studies project as early as 2000 -- one of every two American
babies will be born to a single mother, and illegitimacy will
surpass divorce as the main cause of fatherlessness.  If a job
program succeeds in putting more unmarried welfare mothers to
work (which is unlikely on a sufficiently grand scale, given budget
constraints), we will still be left with roughly the same number 
of fatherless children.  While
Great Britain has already succeeded in implementing reforms that
make work economically more attractive than welfare, the reforms
of the 1980s have only served to underscore in both Britain and
America the fact that little progress can be made without addressing
the collapse of the family.[5]
<P>
No moral judgment even need be adduced to acknowledge that intact
families bestow upon individuals and communities advantages that
simply come no other way.  Empirical evidence amassed by social
scientists in the last ten years (and chronicled for popular consumption
by Barbara Dafoe Whitehead in her April 1993 <I>Atlantic</I> article,
&quot;Dan Quayle Was Right&quot;) has confirmed in exquisite detail
what those who have lived in broken families already know.  A
single woman with children is not a viable economic unit for the
vast majority, but children need biological fathers for much more
than the extra dollars they add to the family budget.  As social
scientist Charles Murray has written, single parenthood is &quot;damaging
to children in so many ways that to list them individually would
be to trivialize them.&quot;[6]
<P>
Not surprisingly, Dr. Murray also concludes that &quot;illegitimacy
is the single most important social problem of our time...because
it drives everything else.&quot;[7]  More than 70 percent of all
juveniles in state reform institutions, for example, come from
fatherless homes; and the relationship between crime and one-parent
families is so powerful that controlling for family structure
erases the relationship between crime and race and between crime
and low income.  Illegitimacy feeds itself, too.  Young white
women who grow up without a father in the home are more than twice
as likely to bear children out-of-wedlock and to do so during
their teenage years when they are most likely to form long-term
attachments to AFDC.
<P>
If those on the welfare rolls have suffered most conspicuously,
it is also true that the welfare system has corrupted the ideals
and narrowed the vision of many who live well beyond the bounds
of the inner city -- even as it is now threatening our most cherished
civic institutions.  One obvious casualty is the weakening of
our conviction that the so-called &quot;bourgeois virtues&quot;
are available to all, regardless of race or class.  Early American
social workers, like Mary Ellen Richmond, understood the importance
of middle class norm-setting.  &quot;The way to reintegrate the
deviant into society, she argued, is to educate and indeed direct
them toward the shared values of the mainstream culture.&quot;[8]
<P>
The role of the traditional two-parent family is essential in
sustaining the institutions of a free society precisely because
it is the vehicle by which values are transmitted from generation
to generation.  If the family fails to impart virtues that temper
and restrain behavior, broad legal freedoms must give way.  So,
too, human dignity and equality, as the Founders understood them.
 Virtue, historian Gertrude Himmelfarb has said, is the only true
basis of equality and the only requisite for citizenship.[9]  As
Charles Murray made clear in his now famous op-ed &quot;The Coming
White Underclass,&quot; either we act now to reduce illegitimacy
and to reinfuse our public policy with a commitment to higher
and nobler things -- or we run the risk of sabotaging the entire
experiment in democratic self-government.
<P>
Or, as Michael Novak put it:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[T]he project of self-government depends on the capacity of citizens
to govern their own passions, urges, habits, and expectations.
 If they cannot govern their own lives individually, how can they
be successful in self-government as a republic?  The project of
self-government is moral -- or not at all.[10]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The Founding Fathers and many succeeding generations understood
that only a virtuous people can be free.  Do we?
<P>
Given the consequences for the individual child, the surrounding
community, and the national polity, bringing a baby into this
world without a sense of sacred responsibility cannot long be
regarded as a morally neutral act.  In a report issued in December
1994, the Progressive Policy Institute, policy arm of the Democratic
Leadership Council, joined others in acknowledging that &quot;it
is wrong -- not simply foolish or impractical -- for women and
men to make babies they cannot support emotionally and financially.&quot;[11]
 Donna Shalala made the same concession a year earlier, however
reluctantly, when she said in an interview, &quot;I don't like
to put this in moral terms, but I do believe that having children
out-of-wedlock is wrong.&quot;[12]
<P>
Congress should now recognize that it is also wrong to sanction
such activity by subsidizing it.  Republican strategist Bill Kristol
has said that &quot;neither our politics nor our sociology can
ultimately be neutral as to the content of the _laws of Nature
and Nature's God,_&quot;[13] chief among which is the fact that
we were made to live in families.  Charles Murray asks rhetorically:
 if &quot;a social policy that induces people to believe that
they are not responsible for their lives is one that inhibits
the pursuit of happiness and is to that extent immoral[,] [c]an
then a policy that <I>fails</I> to stigmatize be a moral one?&quot;[14]
<P>
Historical experience, related by Marvin Olasky and others, does
indeed demonstrate that the most effective social services have
been offered by private community groups, without any illusion
of moral neutrality.  In her seminal historical study <I>Poverty
and Compassion</I>, Gertrude Himmelfarb writes that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[a]fter making the most arduous attempt to objectify the problem
of poverty, to divorce poverty from any moral assumptions and
conditions, we are learning how inseparable the moral and material
dimensions of that problem are.  And after trying to devise social
policies that are scrupulously neutral and _value-free,_ we are
finding these policies fraught with moral implications that have
grave material and social consequences.[15]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
George Liebmann says, more simply, in a recent issue of <I>The
American Enterprise</I>, &quot;Rescuing an underclass is by definition
a highly moralistic undertaking.&quot;[16]  While controlling welfare
spending is a happy byproduct of terminating benefits to teen
mothers, even more promising is the opportunity to begin reversing
the message of the counterculture that has so eroded the character
of our people, in part by assaulting the family.
<P>
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan has used the phrase &quot;defining
deviancy down&quot; to describe Americans' tendency to ignore
excess levels of deviancy by normalizing what used to be considered
pathology.  Only by &quot;defining deviancy down&quot; have we
been able to ignore until now all the signs of impending disaster
that attend a burgeoning illegitimacy rate.  Barbara Whitehead's
1993 <I>Atlantic</I> article heralded a real and significant change
in the public mood, however; and the near-mythic ascendancy of
Charles Murray's &quot;Coming White Underclass&quot; piece the
same year seemed to confirm a general convergence of public opinion.
 In a recent Family Research Council survey of 1,000 Americans,
a substantial majority (81 percent) of respondents indicated that
&quot;women having babies out of wedlock that they can't support
financially&quot; is a serious problem.  The mounting public consensus
presents a unique opportunity to implement more than symbolic
change in the 104th Congress and to make sanctions against illegitimacy
the focus of that change.
<P>
In sending his welfare package to Congress more than 30 years
ago, President Kennedy articulated contemporary liberals' fundamental
misunderstanding of the causal role welfare plays in boosting
illegitimacy rates.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[W]elfare programs, [he said], must contribute to the attack
on . . . family breakdown [and] illegitimacy. . . .  Unless such
problems are dealt with effectively, they fester, and grow, sapping
the strength of society as a whole and extending their consequences
in troubled families from one generation to the next.[17]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Kennedy's insight about the consequences has proven historically
accurate; but his &quot;service&quot; approach to curbing illegitimacy
worked no better than the current President's will -- a fact which
an unnamed aide on the Clinton welfare task force acknowledged
last year.
<P>
While the President advocates a massive and expensive public relations
campaign against out-of-wedlock births, his aide confided to <I>Newsweek</I>
reporter Joe Klein: &quot;We looked at a hundred different programs
around the country that were trying to deal with this problem,
and not one of them moved the needle.  There just weren't any
results.&quot;[18]  Likewise, a formal study of the Teenage Parent
Demonstration, sponsored by the Department of Health and Human
Services in response to &quot;persistently high rates of teenage
pregnancies and births,&quot; found that &quot;[t]he program had
an unusual and disappointing pattern of impacts on pregnancy and
birth rates . . . despite . . . the substantial efforts of the
programs to empower [the] young mothers to take control of their
fertility.&quot;[19]
<P>
Charles Murray anticipated the problem in his 1988 book <I>In
Pursuit of Happiness and Good Government</I>.  &quot;The task,&quot;
he concludes, &quot;is not to devise a public relations campaign
to discourage single teenage girls from having babies, but to
neutralize whatever is impeding the age-old impulse of human beings
to form families.&quot;[20]  Eliminating grants to unwed teenage
mothers will be necessary, but not sufficient, to restore the
integrity of the family unit.
<P>
Only by historical accident were unwed mothers -- of any age --
ever included in the AFDC program.  Frances Perkins, President
Roosevelt's Secretary of Labor and chief architect of welfare
policy, opposed extending federal entitlements to unmarried mothers
because she foresaw that subsidizing illegitimacy would escalate
family breakdown.  It would be ironic at best if the current majority
in Congress were to find themselves to the left of the most liberal
member of the Roosevelt Administration because they rejected that
intuition, now confirmed by years of sad experience.  It is the
potential to reverse that sad experience that must define &quot;compassion&quot;
in the present debate.  As the one policy option that promises
to effect change in the current system, restrictions on benefits
by definition constitute the compassionate alternative.
<P>
Himmelfarb notes that the word &quot;compassion&quot; once described
&quot;a moral sentiment, not a political principle, a sentiment
evoked by _misery_ or _sorrow,_ not by poverty as such.&quot;[21]
 As political salvationism sought to preempt traditional morals
in the last 30 years, it was only natural that moral sentiments
should be confused with political principles.  Likewise, that
misery and sorrow should be equated with material poverty; for
the redefinition of compassion required a highly artificial view
of man as no more than a material being.
<P>
If compassion is once again properly understood, perhaps then
it will become more obvious that the object of our concern must
be &quot;misery&quot; and &quot;sorrow,&quot; not economic poverty,
and that the &quot;misery&quot; most evident today is the spiritual
and moral deprivation visited upon dependents of the welfare system.
 It is time that we stop suppressing the moral responsibilities
that make life precious for a resident of the inner city just
the same as for a middle-class suburbanite.  It is time, in short,
to secure equal access to the central satisfactions of family,
virtue, and freedom.

<P>
Again, in the course of the welfare debate, the abortion issue
has demonstrated its unique capacity to mobilize and divide.
<P>
Pro-life advocates who resist the so-called family cap, which
would freeze benefits to mothers who bear additional illegitimate
children while on welfare, fear with some justification that the
cap could promote an increase in abortions.  Pro-life advocates
who support the measure share both this concern and the long-term
goal of driving abortions to the point of zero.  Unlike the more
conventional conflict between pro-life and pro-choice groups,
pro-life differences over the family cap represent a dispute over
means, not ends, that is complicated by the absence of any hard
data from actual experimentation.
<P>
Such differences lend themselves to reasoned discussion and, ultimately,
resolution far more easily than the larger debate for and against
abortion rights, which Laurence Tribe has characterized as a &quot;clash
of absolutes.&quot;  While the choice between life and death cannot
be accurately described as a &quot;clash of absolutes,&quot; the
phrase does capture usefully the impossibility of winning adherents
to the pro-life cause without first changing hearts, one at a
time.  In other words, we should forfeit no battles, but neither
can we expect to win the war against abortion on demand without
a comprehensive, long-term strategy to develop and sustain a pro-life
consensus.
<P>
While a pro-life position must be part of the agenda for national
renewal, opposition to abortion must be only one plank of the
pro-life platform.  A crisis as broad and deep as abortion on
demand requires a transformation of the political and moral culture
as well as a reform of law.  Reducing illegitimacy is the <I>sine
qua non</I> of moral reconstruction; and right-to-life activists
should realize that, as one of the few weapons in the anti-illegitimacy
arsenal, the family cap not only serves their cause in the long-term
but deserves their active support in the short-term -- subject
to the critical qualification that there must be no attendant
funding for abortions.
<P>
No hard data are available to demonstrate that the family cap
stimulates the abortion rate.  And there is reason to think that
the family cap will <I>not</I> increase abortions, even in the
short-term.    
<P>
Feminists and welfare rights activists argue that the current
benefits level is already far too low to cover the costs associated
with a new baby.  If so, it is illogical to maintain that a cap
would have a sufficiently significant impact on the &quot;affordability&quot;
of another child to necessitate such a drastic measure as abortion.
<P>
The decision to abort, anyhow, is far more than an economic calculation.
 Twenty years of spiraling illegitimacy rates in the face of liberalized
abortion laws demonstrate that many individuals do not regard
abortion as a viable option.  Policy data collected by the Family
Research Council suggest that abortion is even less acceptable
to poor women;[1] and an article recently published in <I>Family
Planning Perspectives</I> found that abortion rates for teen welfare
mothers are <I>lower</I> than national averages for all teenage
girls.[2]
<P>
Those who are tempted to conclude that it is the availability
of welfare checks that reduces the abortion rate, relative to
the general population, should keep in mind the basis of comparison.
 That hypothesis -- that limited cash benefits suppress the abortion
rate -- would predict a <I>lower</I> rate of abortion in the general
population, relative to welfare mothers, because the average member
of the general population has more economic resources at her disposal.
 The empirical data, however, refute the hypothesis; and Douglas
Besharov of the American Enterprise Institute has commented that,
to the contrary, &quot;[k]ids who have less to lose . . . are
less likely to have an abortion.&quot;[3]       
<P>
The finding that abortion rates for teen welfare mothers are lower
than national averages for all teenage girls is a powerful suggestion
that non-economic factors determine the decision to carry a child
to term.  Other research supports the claim that, whether conception
was intended or not, most illegitimate births to underclass women
today are &quot;wanted.&quot;[4] Certainly, there is ample anecdotal
evidence to suggest that some girls have babies because they want
&quot;something to love&quot; -- or, worse yet, because their
peer group has perversely defined a baby as a status symbol.[5]
<P>
Others, including the young welfare mother who testified before
a recent congressional hearing on illegitimacy, simply believe
that abortion is wrong and choose not to compound their first
mistake by committing another.  While poverty dispirits some lives,
in others it serves to highlight the intangibles that make life
most sacred.  The point of decrying moral deterioration among
the underclass is to assert an easily forgotten truth: every person,
regardless of economic status, is capable of the very moral commitments
that argue most forcefully against abortion.
<P>
Even assuming that our ultimate objective is to save as many lives
as possible, it is by no means clear that the appropriate operational
measure of success in assessing the family cap would be the number
of lives saved in the short-term -- if such a number could be
approximated in the future as it cannot be now.  The question
itself is a red herring because it obscures the larger and more
important issue: &quot;What constitutes progress toward ending
altogether the culture that finds abortion acceptable?&quot;
<P>
Deciding on a rational means to maximize the total number of lives
saved in fact requires two sets of measures for maximizing that
good -- human lives saved in the short-term and human lives saved
over the course of several generations.  Since the policy changes
under consideration affect illegitimacy and the structure of the
welfare system, the number of lives saved in the long-run should
include both children who would have been aborted as well as the
children who would have fallen prey to the violent crime that
results from, as James Q. Wilson put it, &quot;neglecting the
processes by which the underclass reproduces itself.&quot;[6]
<P>
While there is no point at which the short-term perspective loses
relevance, few would dispute that there exists some point at which
the long-term implications demand consideration.  If it is true
that preserving the current benefits package will save lives,
presumably we could save even more lives by increasing the entitlements
tenfold.  Yet, most right-to-life activists intuitively understand
that there is an alternative good to be served by restricting
benefits that will in no way compromise our commitment to life.
<P>
Charles Murray wrote in his 1988 book <I>In Pursuit of Happiness
and Good Government</I>, in a passage that defined the parameters
and the language of the above analysis: &quot;It cannot be . .
. that the objective of a program is to save lives.  It may be
the <I>operational</I> measure of success, but it cannot be the
<I>construct</I> . . . because it has no discriminatory power.
. . .  One can too easily think of measures that will save lives
efficiently but are also totalitarian.&quot;[7]
<P>
The construct we are really interested in is &quot;advancing the
pro-life cause,&quot; which we may attempt to operationalize by
estimating the total number of lives saved now and later as a
result of the proposed policy change -- in this case, the family
cap.  And there is no question that reducing illegitimacy by imposing
restrictions on welfare benefits will serve the over-arching purpose
of the pro-life movement.
<P>
As Chuck Donovan explained in a paper published by the Family
Research Council, it is a basic statistical fact that marital
status and the abortion rate are inextricably linked.  The vast
majority of abortions are performed on unmarried women -- and
the proportion is growing.  To reduce abortions, therefore, we
should reduce the premarital sex and out-of-wedlock pregnancy
that create a perceived &quot;need&quot; for abortion.
<P>
Right-to-life activists who oppose measures to reduce illegitimacy
are helping to sustain the very system that encourages young women
to find themselves in the predicament that makes abortion seem
as attractive as it possibly could.  Opposition to the family
cap is a curiously negative way to affirm life.  Although it should
be noted that many pro-life advocates are the ones on the front
lines offering material assistance to unwed mothers who do decide
to keep their babies, it would be far more compassionate to try
to preclude the need for that help in the first place.
<P>
Glenn Loury and James Q. Wilson argued convincingly at recent
welfare hearings before the Human Resources subcommittee that
the problems of illegitimacy and abortion are moral -- not material
-- problems.  They require spiritual solutions which no government
can provide directly.  Yet, Loury writes, &quot;in every community
there are agencies of moral and cultural development that seek
to shape the ways in which individuals conceive of their duties
to themselves, of their obligations to each other, and of their
responsibilities before God.&quot;[8]
<P>
In many communities, right-to-life organizations are those very
agencies, and they deserve credit and gratitude they don't often
receive.  By gradually eliminating federal benefits, poor women
who are pregnant out of wedlock will be forced to turn to local
organizations, including right-to-life crisis pregnancy groups,
that will counsel against abortion and discourage further irresponsible
behavior.
<P>
Launching the arguments against illegitimacy in the context of
the current debate over those benefits will give new rhetorical
emphasis and more widespread attention to the arguments against
abortion; for, the two ills spring from the same misconception
that life is cheap and motherhood bears no sacred responsibility.
 Indeed, the bipartisan focus on illegitimacy is one of the most
golden opportunities we have had in quite some time to reverse
the message of the counterculture that has made abortion &quot;rights&quot;
seem palatable.
<P>
Yet, to increase the logic and appeal of pro-life arguments to
a significant number of people who do not now see the moral force
in such arguments, we must begin the task of rebuilding other
civic institutions that will nourish human souls and liberate
them to fulfill their full potential.  Such an ambitious project
will require a multifaceted strategy, and eliminating the welfare
benefits that encourage illegitimacy will be a key component of
that strategy.
<P>
The interconnections linking functioning communities with functioning
families are so rife and so apparent that even Democrats now concede
Dan Quayle was right.  Illegitimacy, by definition, is the failure
of families to form in the first place; and by driving a host
of social problems that corrode communities and erode the national
character, illegitimacy promotes the failing of family on a grand
scale.
<P>
Charles Murray writes that affiliation -- including family affiliation
-- is a means whereby people of common values are enabled to enact
those values.  A functioning community that promotes a wide array
of affiliations provides an extremely important venue both for
practicing virtue and for passing down to the next generation
the habit of virtue.[9] The pro-life movement is itself a classic
example of people expressing their interests and values through
affiliations that are sustained by a rich network of institutions
outside of -- and sometimes even in opposition to -- government.
<P>
Arguably, members of the underclass do not now have the same type
of privilege; but they should and could if we begin, in Michael
Joyce's words, &quot;the resuscitation of the civic sphere which
alone makes genuine citizenship possible.&quot;[10] Because civil
institutions are the very institutions that cultivate character,
that &quot;appeal to and sustain spirit and heart as much as mind,&quot;[11]
reconstructing them will engender a far more lasting commitment
to pro-life principles than obstruction of the family cap.  Michael
Joyce has explained eloquently: &quot;Through . . . countless,
subtle, daily interactions, our civil institutions give form and
substance to the everyday qualities and values without which life
itself would be impossible.&quot;[12]
<P>
Paradoxical as it may seem, reforming the culture will be the
most expedient complementary strategy for winning new and permanent
legal victories against abortion.  If any issue position depends
on one's idea of man, it is abortion.  And an individual's idea
of man is not something that gives way to clever arguments in
court or the Congress.  Instead, it is shaped and formed from
childhood by the quiet but pervasive messages of the surrounding
society in which children grow and develop into adults.
<P>
In addition to changing notions of the individual, we must also
change the related conception of government.  If we succeed in
restoring a commitment to limited government, the courts will
be under increasing pressure to reverse the abortion decisions
that have, in George Weigel and Bill Kristol's analysis, &quot;[reduced]
the actors in American society to the coercive state and the radically
autonomous individual, bereft of all social ties and responsibilities.&quot;[13]
 There is no better way to undermine this &quot;America of strangers,&quot;
to use Richard John Neuhaus' phrase, than to restore the civil
institutions that nurture the daily interactions and affiliations
that are anathema to the proponents of centralized government.
<P>
Right-to-life advocates give collective voice to a magnificent
idealism in our political discourse.  To them, it does not matter
that a decrease in abortions will mean a disproportionate increase
in minority babies born to low-income parents.  It does matter
that abortions end innocent lives because life is eminently sacred
and precious.
<P>
Thus, pro-lifers should understand more fully than anyone in the
debate over the family cap that abortion is not an issue that
can be nickel-and-dimed or reduced to a scientific calculation
of anticipated marginal changes in the abortion rate.  The very
attempt threatens, however unintentionally, to promote the same
thoroughly dehumanized and despiritualized view of life in which
pro-abortion forces indulge.
<P>
If our objective is to find a rational means to maximize the number
of lives saved over time, it bears repeating that, for Aristotle,
&quot;conformity with a rational principle&quot; meant something
far more humane than a cold mathematical calculation of odds.
 He distinguished between &quot;theoretical wisdom,&quot; which
is more akin to a scientific process, and &quot;practical wisdom,&quot;
defined as &quot;the capacity of deliberating well about what
is good and advantageous.&quot;  Aristotle knew that in making
decisions the best of statesmen would draw upon this more indefinable
wisdom that is an equal but different part of rationality.  So
should we draw upon the best part of our wisdom in evaluating
the costs and benefits of the proposed family cap.[14]
<P>
We should also bear in mind that what we think about the right
to life has an organic relationship with our vision of the kind
of society we should institute.  In the end, it really is not
possible to think about one in isolation from the other; or else
the arguments lose impetus, grow artificial and -- lifeless.
<P>
Not by coincidence, the Declaration speaks of &quot;life&quot;
in the same breath with &quot;liberty&quot; and &quot;the pursuit
of happiness,&quot; two conditions that speak directly to the
question of how best to organize society.  The Founders instituted
a limited government to secure natural rights, including the right
to life; but as George Will noted in a recent editorial, &quot;Our
creed of limited government . . . [has a] corollary vision of
human capacities and of the life worth living,&quot; captured
by the phrase &quot;pursuit of happiness.&quot;[15]
<P>
The Founders would have scoffed at the notion that the protection
of life and limb alone is an adequate notion of &quot;happiness,&quot;
and right-to-life activists forget that at their peril in the
present debate over the family cap.  By opposing the current system
of welfare benefits, we advocate a transformation of the political
and social culture that will sustain both &quot;happiness&quot;
and a more enduring pro-life consensus than even legal reform
can hope to accomplish.

<title>GOALS 2000: THE CASE FOR REPEAL</title>

<h2>GOALS 2000:<br>
THE CASE FOR REPEAL</h2>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>
To an ailing American education system, Goals 2000 offers further
centralization, added bureaucracy, and federal coercion -- and
calls it a prescription for local freedom.
<p>
But Americans have overwhelmingly objected to the &quot;government
knows best&quot; philosophy of which Goals 2000 is another manifestation.
If the 104th Congress intends to keep its campaign promises of
decentralizing authority, returning power to states and localities,
empowering American families, balancing the budget, and reducing
the deficit, then Goals 2000 must be repealed. It is an impediment
to these goals. Leaving intact the Goals 2000 formula for restructuring
American education will undo any education reform Congress hopes
to accomplish.
<p>
Goals 2000 (P.L. 103-227) is the Clinton Administration's plan
to drastically restructure the American education system. &quot;Goals
2000 establishes overall direction for a new local-state-federal
partnership in education,&quot; writes Gordon M. Ambach, executive
director of the Council of Chief State School Officers.[1] It increases
the federal role by imposing a congressional formula for reform
on any state, school district, or school that wishes to receive
funding under this act.
<p>
The priority of the restructuring agenda can be seen in the appropriations.
Less than half the funding for Goals 2000 will reach local schools
in this first year of its existence. Of the $105 million appropriated
for Goals 2000 in FY 94, $92.4 million (88 percent) is targeted
toward state grants. Stipulations in the law require that only
45 percent of each state's grant be filtered down to individual
schools.[2] That means only $42 million, or 40 percent of the original
appropriation, will ever reach the schools. The other 60 percent
constitutes the bureaucratic skim that is being used at each level
to create the new framework for the educational system.
<p>
The danger of the Goals 2000 restructuring agenda is that all
future federal experimentation with education will be easily inculcated
into the new network. Local schools will be extremely vulnerable
to manipulation and have little, if any, autonomy.
<p>
The bureaucratic waste and ominous restructuring agenda of Goals
2000 are just the beginning of the argument against this legislation
that will radically change American education. Its ten titles
contain dozens of problem areas that warrant the repeal of Goals
2000.
<p>
<center><h3>TITLE I -- NATIONAL EDUCATION GOALS</h3></center>
<p>
This title codifies eight national education goals. Six were agreed
to in 1990 by governors and President Bush following the Charlottesville
education summit. The other two goals, parental participation
and teacher education, were added as bait to sell the Goals 2000
legislation to interest groups, such as teacher unions and the
PTA, which supposedly represent the views of teachers and parents.
<p><ul>
<li>The concept of national education goals is based on faulty
logic. If the federal government is setting goals, that presupposes
that it has the authority and ability to ensure the accomplishment
of the goals. Reaching national education goals will require an
unprecedented federal intrusion in schools.
<p>
<li>Had the goals been popularly developed and had Americans
asked for federal supervision in achieving them, Goals 2000 might
be procedurally, if not philosophically, a legitimate plan. They
did not and it is not. Secretary Riley reveals this as he retells
the history of the Goals 2000 legislation:
<p><ul>
In the first place, educators had not been in on the ground floor
when the National Education Goals were developed in 1989 and 1990.
The goals were viewed by many as a classic example of a top-down
reform imposed on localities.... Nor had parents, citizens, or
the business community been brought into the picture in a meaningful
way.... Finally, neither members of Congress nor state legislators
had a hand in crafting the goals.... The truth was that the reform
movement at the national level had absolutely no statutory basis....
The National Education Goals, three years after their announcement,
had no legal standing of any kind.[3]
</ul><p>
<li>National education goals cannot be reached through a <I>voluntary</I>
program. If the Clinton Education Department intends to reach
these goals, they certainly cannot believe that Goals 2000 is
voluntary, or at least they do not intend that it will be optional
for long. The goals are stated in section 102 using all-inclusive
language: &quot;all students will leave grades 4, 8, and 12 having
demonstrated competency over challenging subject matter...,&quot;
and &quot;every school in the United States will be free of drugs....&quot;
These goals absolutely cannot be accomplished through a voluntary
program. The crafters of this legislation were either deceived
or deceptive when they touted Goals 2000 as voluntary.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE II -- NATIONAL EDUCATION REFORM LEADERSHIP,<br>
STANDARDS AND ASSESSMENTS</h3></center>
<p>
Understanding title II is key to understanding the significance
and danger of the Goals 2000 legislation. This title is the heart
of the restructuring agenda. It creates two new national bureaucracies:
the National Education Goals Panel (NEGP) and the National Education
Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC).
<p>
The driving force of the Goals 2000 reform plan lies in title
II: <I>standards</I>. Three types of national standards are defined:
content standards, performance standards and opportunity-to-learn
standards. In order to apply for a grant under Goals 2000, each
state must develop its own content, performance and opportunity-to-learn
standards, or adopt the national standards in each of the three
areas (see title III).
<p>
Title II is very problematic for anyone who believes in a decentralized
system of education:
<p><ul>
<li>Clearly, adding bureaucracy is contrary to the goals of
this Congress. It will not lead to better education, only waste.
<p>
<li>Goals 2000 called for the creation of the National Education
Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC) within 120 days of the
law's enactment (March 31, 1994) [Sec. 212(e)]. The council was
not named during that time, nor has it been since then, yet in
FY 94 $2 million was appropriated for its use. To what end were these
funds used?
<p>
<li>NESIC was to &quot;identify areas in which voluntary national
content standards need to be developed&quot; [Sec. 213(a)(1)(A)].
Since NESIC has not been formed it obviously has not performed
this function. Which bureaucrat decided what standards projects
would be funded? With such anonymity there is no accountability.
<p>
<li>The content standards are being presented to school personnel
and the general public as though they have been officially and
legally approved. Neither of these can happen because the body
set up by law to certify the standards -- NESIC -- does not exist.
It is misleading to present these as <I>the</I> &quot;national
standards&quot; when they have been neither federally nor popularly
approved.
</ul><p>
The <I>National Standards for United States History,</I> produced
by the Center for History in the Schools, are a case in point.
A politically correct account of American history, these standards
are being presented to history teachers as <I>the national standards</I>.
While Congress may believe it has addressed the issue with the
Senate's 99 to 1 vote to reject the U.S. history standards, this
non-binding resolution was merely symbolic. In Goals 2000, Congress
gave authority over the standards to NESIC. That makes the Senate's
resolution only a good gesture. Congress should follow this vote
to reject the history standards with a vote of much greater significance:
the repeal of the entire Goals 2000 legislation, which calls for
national standards and has the potential to produce more material
like the U.S. history standards.
<p><ul>
<li>The federal government should not be involved in the creation
of standards. Government-endorsed standards are by nature coercive,
not voluntary, and will create a body of &quot;official knowledge.&quot;
This is contrary to the American tradition of freedom of thought.
Furthermore, content standards deal with curriculum, an area which
the federal Department of Education was expressly forbidden to
enter when it was created in 1979. The creation, critique and
usage of standards must remain a community endeavor. No further
federal money should be spent on standards projects, and there
should be no federal certification or endorsement of existing
standards. Political involvement results in politically-charged
standards. Imagine the reaction of those unoffended by the original
history standards if new standards were developed under the leadership
of Sen. Jesse Helms or Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</ul><p>
Opportunity-to-learn (OTL) standards are an especially troublesome
element of title II:
<p><ul>
<li>These standards shift the focus of reform back to increasing
inputs into education, a tried-and-failed method. OTL standards
chosen by states and school districts will require schools to
provide adequate resources -- including such things as gender-equitable
materials, curriculum aligned with national content standards,
and anything else NESIC deems appropriate.
<p>
<li>OTL standards are measuring sticks for schools and teachers,
not for students. They are not a reliable method for improving
student achievement. Indeed, numerous studies linking dramatically
increased spending and declining test scores indicate that spending
does not drive academic success.[4]
<p>
<li>OTL standards invite further federal intrusion in American
education. Diane Ravitch, an assistant secretary of education
in the Bush administration, wrote, &quot;[T]he new standards,
euphemistically called 'opportunity-to-learn' standards, would
permit Federal regulation of curriculum, textbooks, facilities
and instructional methods....The bill describes the Federal 'opportunity-to-learn'
standards as 'voluntary,' but litigation would quickly turn them
into mandates.&quot;[5]
</ul><p>
The idea of lawsuits and mandates is not an alarmist fabrication;
an Alabama state court recently declared the state school system
unconstitutional for not providing adequate education to its students.
The judge's 125-page opinion imposes OTL-type standards on the
state's schools.[6]
<p>
<center><h3>TITLE III -- STATE AND LOCAL EDUCATION<br>
SYSTEMIC IMPROVEMENT</h3></center>
<p>
This title authorizes block grants to states and subgrants to
local school boards [Sec. 309(a)].
<p><ul>
<li>In order to receive a grant under Goals 2000, a state is
obligated to adhere to the federal outline for reform: opportunity-to-learn
standards, content and performance standards, assessments, etc.
State improvement plans must be approved by the Secretary of Education.
Never before have states had to submit such lesson plans to the
federal government for approval. Contrary to the rhetoric of Goals
2000, this is not a formula for local authority over school reform;
it makes the word <I>voluntary</I> moot.
<p>
<li>In its grant application, a state must include &quot;an
assurance that State law provides adequate authority to carry
out each component of the State's improvement plan...&quot; [Sec.
305(a)(2)(B)]. In other words, the state must explain how it will
impose the Goals 2000 agenda on each of its school districts,
voiding the voluntary option for them as well.
<p>
<li>The Goals 2000 prescription for reform encourages states
to include plans to transform schools into &quot;one-stop shopping&quot;
centers which offer a variety of social services, including health
care and child care [Sec. 306(f)(2)]. This coordination of services
tends toward a collectivism which is contrary to our nation's
history as a free society. Concentrating the services in one place
and on one group of people may lead to a sense of dependency.
<p>
<li>Advancing social services, health care and related services
likely includes the promotion of school-based clinics (SBC). The
term &quot;coordinated services&quot; has been used by proponents
to refer to school-based clinics. These clinics commonly distribute
contraceptives and, when these measures fail, the clinics refer
for abortion.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE IV -- PARENTAL ASSISTANCE</h3></center>
<p>
This title provides for parental information and resource centers
and describes parental involvement in education. Laudable as it
sounds, this title is problematic:
<p><ul>
<li>Goal 8 (parental participation) and title IV (Parental
Assistance) assume that schools and parents have equal authority
over and responsibility for children. The legislation denies the
fact that parents' authority over their children is intrinsic
and that schools have only a delegated authority.
<p>
<li>To improve family life and help parents, Goals 2000 suggests
more programming, more meetings, more time at school and with
school personnel, and more home visits from professionals. All
of this leaves less time for parents and children to spend together.
<p>
<li>With their Goals 2000 grants, states must spend money on
&quot;parent education.&quot; Parents as Teachers (PAT), which
advocates home visits by counselors beginning at birth, is one
of the programs specifically endorsed by the law. Not only are
states encouraged to use their &quot;parent education&quot; money
to fund PAT programs, but the objectionable organization was directly
appropriated $10 million under Goals 2000 for FY 1995. The House
Education, Labor, HHS Subcommittee for Appropriations is to be
commended for targeting this program for termination. Its rationale
for proposing cuts to parent education programs is that &quot;these
are the very paternalistic and 'government knows best' programs
that the American people rejected last year.&quot;
<p>
<li>Publicly-funded institutions like PAT are not equipped
to improve families because they cannot speak to the values issues
inherent in the breakdown of families. Private voluntary associations
and individuals must take responsibility in this arena.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE V -- NATIONAL SKILL STANDARDS BOARD</h3></center>
<p>
Title V is devoted to linking education to business and industry.
It authorizes the creation of another national bureaucracy: the
National Skill Standards Board (NSSB). NSSB will establish business-education
partnerships and oversee development of skill standards and assessments.
<p><ul>
<li>The $3 million spent in 1994 to develop skill standards
is another misguided appropriation of funds. It also calls for
the development of national assessments to certify achievement
of the skill standards. These additions, however, will not produce
better candidates for business. According to a <I>Chicago Tribune</I>
article, employers seek critical thinking and creativity, but
when it comes to promoting those skills, &quot;most of the visible
school reform efforts, such as uniform national testing schemes,
head 180 degrees in the wrong direction.&quot;[7]
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE VI -- INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION PROGRAM</h3></center>
<p>
Title VI calls for evaluation of foreign education systems. It
also sets up a program of education personnel exchange with central
and eastern European countries and any country formerly a part
of the Soviet Union.
<p><ul>
<li>The United States does not have the resources to &quot;provide
Department of Education personnel and technical experts to assist
eligible countries to establish and implement a database or other
effective methods to improve educational delivery systems, structure
and organization&quot; [Sec. 601(c)(5)]. Moreover, U.S. envoys
should not be pushing the Goals 2000 agenda, unproven in our own
country, on eastern European countries.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE VII -- SAFE SCHOOLS</h3></center>
<p>
This title provides grants to local school districts to achieve
safe and drug-free schools. Section 705 describes types of programs
to be implemented to prevent violence.
<p><ul>
<li>Conflict resolution, anger management, and peer mediation
are cited as &quot;programs of demonstrated effectiveness in addressing
violence&quot; (Sec. 705). In reality, experts are skeptical of
these soft-approach violence prevention programs.[8]
<p>
<li>We cannot afford to spend millions on a violence prevention
strategy that includes programs of no proven effectiveness. Serious
efforts must be made to curb violence, but conflict resolution
and peer mediation will not get to the real solution: changed
lives and families.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE VIII -- MINORITY-FOCUSED CIVICS EDUCATION</h3></center>
<p>
This title provides grants for teacher seminars on minority-focused
civics and government.
<p><ul>
<li>Minority-focused courses will likely promote versions of
history similar to that produced by the Center for History in
the Schools in its <I>National Standards for United States History.
</I>Such politicization of history will not produce acculturation
but cultural friction and fragmentation.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE IX -- EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH AND IMPROVEMENT</h3></center>
<p>
Title IX makes organizational changes in the Department of Education's
Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI); prescribes
OERI's functions in relation to Goals 2000; establishes within
OERI a National Educational Research Policy and Priorities Board,
five National Research Institutes, and a National Education Dissemination
System linking federal and local agencies. It also authorizes
expansion of research grants for comprehensive school health education
(Sec. 971).
<p><ul>
<li>Once again, Goals 2000 aims to improve education by adding
and reshuffling bureaucracy.
<p>
<li>Health education, which includes sex education, has already
been a major source of grief to parents. Advancing these programs
will undoubtedly lead to an increase in challenges to parental
authority.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE X -- MISCELLANEOUS</h3></center>
<p>
This catch-all title contains a gun-free school act, a non-smoking
policy for children's services in schools, a policy for distribution
of contraceptive devices, and authorization of grants for Midnight
Basketball programs.
<p><ul>
<li>The Goals 2000 policy on contraceptive devices further
marginalizes parents. Section 1018 states that &quot;all federally
funded programs which provide for the distribution of contraceptive
devices to unemancipated minors [shall] develop procedures to
encourage, <B>to the extent practical</B>, family participation
in such programs&quot; (emphasis added). How unlikely is it that
a school administrator will find it impractical to listen to parental
objections to a condom distribution policy?
<p>
<li>Midnight Basketball was originally a private sector plan.
There is no need for government to get involved in these charitable
efforts and regulate them to death.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>
<p>
The Goals 2000 restructuring agenda will continue to spread like
kudzu throughout America as long as states receive Goals 2000
grants requiring them to submit their standards and assessments
for federal approval. Furthermore, zero-funding the Goals 2000
programs individually leaves open the possibility of future funding.
Complete repeal of Goals 2000 is the only solution.
<p>
Education reform calls for a reduction in the role of the federal
government in the system and a return to the traditional role
of school: teaching students basics like reading, writing, and
arithmetic. A decisive first step will be the repeal of Goals
2000, which subverts education reform with more federal regulation
and spending.

THROWING FIRST COURT<BR>
TEST OF MILITARY'S HOMOSEXUAL<BR>
LAW?</H2>

<CENTER>
<I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Lt. Col. Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.)</I></CENTER>
<P>
The Justice Department appears to be throwing a key military homosexual
case by not calling expert witnesses to rebut the half-truths
presented by pro-homosexual witnesses like former Assistant Secretary
of Defense Lawrence J. Korb.
<P>
Six avowed homosexuals are contesting the military's homosexual
law in a Brooklyn federal district court case, <I>Abel et al.
v. William Perry</I>.  This is the first federal case challenging
the military's new law.  Plaintiffs allege that the military ban
violates equal protection and free speech rights and imposes punitive
rules unrelated to fitness and ability to serve.[1]
<P>
Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund and the American Civil
Liberties Union are representing the homosexual servicemembers.
 They called six &quot;expert&quot; witnesses to refute the military's
constitutional right to exclude homosexuals.  Not one of those
witnesses was countered by expert defenders of the ban.[2]
<P>
The law is on solid constitutional ground.  Congress has the constitutional
responsibility for writing personnel laws for the military: Article
I, Section 8.  Congress conducted extensive hearings in both the
Senate and the House in 1993.  It then codified the military's
policy banning homosexuals, and President Clinton signed it into
law on November 30, 1993.  The law took effect on February 28,
1994.
<P>
Mr. Korb, who testified on March 16, is an apologist for homosexual
causes who now works for the Brookings Institute.  In the past,
he frequently has relied on a discredited study from the Defense
Personnel Security Research and Education Center (PERSEREC), which
contains much sloppy research and misinformation.
<P>
Some of Korb's statements on the topic deserve closer examination:
<P>
<LI><I>Army Times</I>, February 17, 1992.  Korb states: &quot; [PERSEREC]
 completed two 
studies that concluded: <I>Homosexuals are better prospective
military members than heterosexuals</I>; the Pentagon should engage
in empirical research to see if they can function appropriately
in military units; and the Pentagon should make judgments about
individuals based on conduct, not sexual orientation.&quot;
There is no evidence that &quot;homosexuals are better&quot; soldiers,
and the Pentagon's 1993 studies found conclusively that homosexuals
are a high-risk category of potential recruits. 
<P>
<LI><I>CNN</I>, &quot;Larry King Live,&quot; July 27, 1993.  Korb
said, &quot;[A]ccording to the Pentagon's own studies done out
in Monterey, <I>approximately 200,000 people in the military are
homosexuals.  So you're talking about 10 percent of the force</I>.&quot;
<P>
The cited &quot;studies&quot; relied on the discredited work of
sex researcher Alfred C. Kinsey.  They exaggerate Kinsey's already
overblown findings of sexual deviance in the general population,
including the now-refuted 10 percent myth for homosexuality. 
Even Planned Parenthood, <I>The New Republic</I> and <I>Newsweek</I>
concede as much.  More reliable surveys indicate that the homosexual
population in America is less than two percent.
<P>
<LI> Testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, March
31, 1993.  Korb testified, &quot;Professor Theodore Sarbin, co-author
of a 1991 PERSEREC study for the U.S. military, has stated that
<I>there is no data linking gays to lower morale or cohesion</I>.
 Rather he (Sarbin) noted that where there's good leadership,
there's high morale.&quot;
<P>
This statement is without foundation.  PERSEREC omits any reference
to any scientific study of military unit cohesion and discipline
and their effect on combat readiness.  
<P>
The Pentagon's 1993 task force that studied the issue of homosexuals
in the military found hundreds of cases where servicemembers discovered
to be homosexual were very disruptive.  Mr. Korb's anecdotal account
is disputed by these cases.
<P>
A survey by the American Security Council Foundation found that
99 percent of active duty officers said homosexuals would undermine
the cohesiveness and readiness of combat units.[3] The Defense Readiness
Council compiled a survey of 2,800 retired flag and general officers.
 Nearly 90 percent said they believe homosexuals undermine morale.[4]
<P>
<LI>Testimony in the 1994 case of <I>Margarethe Cammermeyer v. Les
Aspin</I>.  Korb told that court: &quot;The policy was never intended
to authorize the military to discharge someone simply based on
his or her status -- absent any evidence of conduct.  To the contrary,
conduct was the real focus of the policy....A servicemember's
own admission of being gay -- absent any indication of her propensity
to engage in homosexual conduct -- is simply not sufficient grounds
for discharging her under the existing policy....The policy I
authorized should not be construed as authorizing such an irrational
outcome.&quot;[5]
<P>
The military's pre-1993 ban was based on the principle that, &quot;Homosexuality is incompatible with military service.&quot;  Decades of court
rulings have affirmed the military's position that declaring oneself
a homosexual implies the person has or will engage in illegal
homosexual behavior.  
<P>
<LI>Testimony in the 1995 case of <I>Abel et al. v. William Perry</I>.
 Korb told the court, &quot;We were losing a lot of very good
people in whom the government had invested a lot of money.&quot;
 He also compared the homosexual exclusion with women in the military.
&quot;I can't over-emphasize the great opposition from military
leaders to ending the draft and bringing women into the services.&quot;
 Korb said he once shared a room with a homosexual without any
problem.
<P>
The military releases three times as many people each year for
drug abuse than it does for homosexuality.  And homosexuals in
the military have a bad record: as a group, they have a high ratio
of discipline problems and account for most of the AIDS cases.
<P>
Homosexual activists often try to compare their agenda with the
integration of blacks into the military.  Former chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff General Colin Powell does not agree:  &quot;Skin
color is a benign, nonbehavioral characteristic.  Sexual orientation
is perhaps the most profound of human behavioral characteristics.
 Comparison of the two is a convenient but invalid argument.&quot;[6]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Justice Department and the Pentagon have many witnesses (active
duty and retired officers and civilians) who would refute the
half-truths presented by the pro-homosexual witnesses.  It is
inexplicable that in a politicized case like <I>Abel v. William
Perry,</I> the Justice Department failed to call experts to challenge
the misinformation promoted by homosexual groups.
<P>
The 104th Congress must demand that the Justice Department represent
the military's interests.  The evidence supports the military
homosexual law, but if the government is silent about the facts,
cases like this will be lost, and the destruction of military
morale will proceed unchecked.

<TITLE>CLINTON ADMINISTRATION SCUTTLES FIRST COURT TEST OF MILITARY'S HOMOSEXUAL LAW</TITLE>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/insight/insight.gif">
<P>
<H2>CLINTON ADMINISTRATION<BR>
SCUTTLES FIRST COURT TEST OF<BR>
MILITARY'S HOMOSEXUAL LAW</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER><I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Lt. Col. Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.)</I></CENTER>
<P>
In a lackluster performance, the Clinton Administration failed
to use key arguments and called no witnesses in the first court
test of the military's new homosexual law.  
<P>
On March 30, 1995, Judge Eugene Nickerson of the Eastern District
of New York struck down parts of the military's new homosexual
law and the Pentagon's implementing directives in the case of
<I>Lieutenant Colonel Jane Able, et al. v. United States of America</I>.[1]
<P>
Judge Nickerson ruled that six service members' First and Fifth
Amendment rights were violated when the military sought to discharge
them solely based on their admissions of homosexuality.  He enjoined
the Pentagon from discharging the six, and the Justice Department
is expected to appeal the case to the Second Circuit Court of
Appeals.
<P>
This case follows a pattern seen in the Steffan, Meinhold, and
Cammermeyer cases whereby the government ignores key arguments
for prohibiting service by avowed homosexuals.  These cases demonstrate
fundamental differences between the law, which was signed by President
Clinton on November 30, 1993, and the Pentagon's implementing
directions, which took effect February 28, 1994.
<P>
Specifically, the Justice Department failed to:
<P><UL>
<LI>Call witnesses to represent the government's interest.  The
plaintiffs called six &quot;expert&quot; witnesses to dispute
long-held &quot;myths&quot; about homosexuals. 
<P>
<LI>Present well documented arguments for denying homosexual service
based on physical and psychological problems.
<P>
<LI>Demonstrate that the policy is conduct-based rather than status-based
as the plaintiffs argued.
<P>
<LI>Show that homosexual &quot;lifestyles&quot; and &quot;values&quot;
are contrary to the best interests of the armed services and present
serious morale and unit cohesion problems.
<P>
<LI>Refute a flawed study cited by the plaintiffs as evidence that
homosexuals will not damage morale and unit cohesion.
<P>
<LI>Demonstrate that homosexuals present a risk to the military
and therefore the military's ban is justified.  
</UL>
The judge noted key differences between the law and the directives:
<P><UL>
<LI>Although the law permits asking about homosexual acts and orientation
at the point of admission, the Clinton Administration has rejected
the questions.  The judge labeled this as unusual.  On one hand
the Pentagon encourages homosexuals to join (by not making homosexuality
part of a pre-induction litmus test) and then insists that the
homosexual remain secretive about his &quot;status.&quot;
<P>
<LI>The law denies service to homosexuals, but the directives permit
service to admitted homosexuals who can rebut the presumption
that they will engage in homosexual misconduct.  This creates
a status/conduct dichotomy.  The judge labels the rebuttable presumption
as &quot;Orwellian.&quot;
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>FIRST AMENDMENT ARGUMENT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The plaintiffs complain that the government violated their First
Amendment rights when it tried to discharge them for stating that
they are homosexual.  
<P>
The military law [10 U.S.C. 654(b)(2)] permits discharge when
&quot;the member has stated that he or she is a homosexual or
bisexual, or words to that effect, unless there is a further finding,
made and approved in accordance with procedures set forth in the
regulations, that the member has demonstrated that he or she is
not a person who engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity
to engage in, or intends to engage in homosexual acts.&quot; 
The Pentagon's directives which implement this law [DoD Directive
1332.14 and 1332.30] have the same litmus test.
<P>
The government argued that this is not a First Amendment issue
because the law and the directives are directed solely at the
prohibition of acts and give members the opportunity to rebut
the presumption of misconduct.  However, the government failed
to show a nexus between a declaration of homosexuality and homosexual
misconduct.  In fact, government lawyers labeled much of the available
evidence as &quot;myths,&quot; thus aiding the plaintiffs.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3> GOVERNMENT FAILED TO EXPLAIN RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH HOMOSEXUALS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The judge noted that the government made no argument to exclude
homosexuals based on &quot;mental illness,&quot; security or infectious
diseases.  In fact, Justice Department lawyers dismissed these
well-founded arguments as &quot;myths.&quot;  Consider the facts.
<P>
<B>Homosexuals as a category present unacceptable risks.</B>
Research shows that homosexuals tend to be extremely promiscuous
and tend to have high incidences of sexually transmitted diseases,
especially the deadly AIDS virus.
<P>
Admitting homosexuals into the military violates the legal principle
of the assumption of risk.  This principle states that if you
know there is a risk and you assume it, then don't complain when
the risk materializes.  
<P>
A recent study from the University of Michigan found that people
with HIV are more capable of spreading the virus during the first
60 days of infection but that blood tests during this period do
not find the HIV antibodies.[2] This means that the military assumes
some risk, even though all personnel are initially tested, that
soldiers are not infected.  This is why screening out high-risk
groups and not just those who test positive for HIV is appropriate.
 Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration no longer screens out
homosexuals -- by far the highest risk group for contracting HIV.
<P>
The Army's Surgeon General, Lieutenant General Alcide Lanoue,
has addressed the health risks associated with homosexuals:[3]
<P><UL>
<LI>&quot;The military setting provides unique requirements for
safety in executing the Army blood transfusion program and for
preventing the transmission of blood-borne pathogens (especially
HIV and hepatitis B) in the field setting.  Homosexual males would
comprise a pool of ineligible blood donors and as a group are
at high risk of infection by HIV and hepatitis B, both significant
blood-borne pathogens which can infect other soldiers through
exposure to blood in peace and war.&quot; [During Operation Desert
Storm, there were five documented instances where blood was drawn
directly from soldiers and transfused.  In Somalia, five units
of blood were drawn from soldiers and directly transfused to Somalis.
 The urgency of such transfusions precludes testing for the AIDS
virus.]
<P>
<LI>&quot;HIV and other Sexually Transmitted Disease rates will
increase to the extent that the proportion of homosexual males
in the Army increases because homosexual/bisexual men are allowed
to enter and remain in the Army.&quot; [The CDC reports that most
of the AIDS patients in this country are homosexuals.[4] Homosexuals
account for a disproportionate number of America's most serious
STD's, including syphilis, gonorrhea, genital warts, and hepatitis
A and B.[5] Moreover, the 1994 homosexual sex survey in <I>The Advocate</I>,
a mainstream homosexual magazine, found that 13 percent of respondents
were HIV-positive and only 18 percent had taken all three shots
in the hepatitis B vaccine series.  <I>The Advocate</I> article
admits that, &quot;Gay men are one of the top risk groups for
being exposed to hepatitis B.[6]
<P>
<LI> &quot;A male homosexual soldier is significantly more likely
than a heterosexual soldier to be nondeployable for medical reasons
related to HIV infection.  If HIV-infected, the soldier will be
permanently nondeployable.  Male homosexuals are more likely to
acquire sexually transmitted diseases which can render them nondeployable,
such as gonorrhea, syphilis, and hepatitis B.
</UL>
&quot;Readiness from a medical standpoint will suffer if the restriction
is lifted.  The impact would be felt at the unit level, when the
homosexual soldier cannot train and deploy for health reasons.
 Likewise, the impact would be felt Army-wide in terms of the
military blood program and of the burden placed on the Army health
care system.&quot;
<P>
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, homosexuals
are especially vulnerable to contracting HIV.  They are a high-risk
group because of co-factors associated with their lifestyle. 
These include recreational drug use, homosexual sex, malnutrition,
prior incidents of sexually transmitted diseases, and, most significantly,
sexual promiscuity.  
<P>
Homosexuals who participate in unsafe sex practices with multiple
partners and without taking precautions are at great risk of contracting
sexually transmitted diseases.  <I>The Advocate</I> survey found
that 72 percent of homosexual respondents engage in insertive
oral intercourse, 46 percent insertive anal intercourse, 45 percent
receptive anal-oral sex, 48 percent in three-way sex, 24 percent
in group sex (4 or more), and 10 percent in sadomasochism.[7] Most
of the homosexuals in the survey admitted to having had more than
30 sex partners over their lifetime, and more than a third (35%)
report more than 100 partners.  The survey also found that only
one time in four do homosexual men use condoms.[8]
<P>
Heterosexuals have fewer sex partners than homosexuals.  A 1988-1990
General Social Survey found that 91 percent of men 25 to 29 years
of age are heterosexually active.  Nineteen percent of these men
have had only one sex partner, 55 percent have had two to 19 partners,
and 25 percent have had 20 or more partners.[9]
<P>
The University of Chicago published a national sex survey in October,
1994, which found that 20 percent of men have had only one sex
partner in their lifetime, 21 percent have had two to four partners,
17 percent 5 to 10 partners, 16 percent 11 to 20 and 17 percent
report having had 21 or more sex partners.[10] However, that survey
excluded men over 59, who constitute one-sixth of the population
and who typically have had more conservative sex lives.  Thus
the real figures probably are even lower for the population of
all men.[11]
<P>
Homosexuality also increases medical costs.  With the ban in place,
openly homosexual inductees are turned away.  However, with the
ban lifted, a homosexual recruit could contract HIV within days
of induction or have early-stage HIV and not test positive and
be accorded full medical benefits for the rest of his life.  This
is about $120,000 in direct medical costs per AIDS patient.[12]
<P>
Dr. Edmund Tramont, Associate Director for retroviral research
at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, published a 10-year projection
for HIV costs at $1.7 to $1.9 billion.[13] He warns that this is
in 1989 dollars, is based on the present rate of new cases and
assumes that only 60 percent of health care beneficiaries will
use the military health care system.  The potential 10-year cost
could rise to $5 billion if these assumptions are incorrect.[14]
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services indicates that
the lifetime cost of treating a person with AIDS -- from diagnosis
until death -- is $102,000.[15] The American Medical Association
estimated the per-person AIDS patient cost would rise to $386,000
by the year 2000 and $639,000 by the year 2008.[16]
<P>
As of April 1993 the military had dealt with 8,832 HIV-positive
service members.  Most have been separated, but at that time 1,580
were still on active duty.  Their status precluded them from deploying
overseas and necessitated special assignments and special medical
care.[17]
<P>
Homosexuals also have much shorter life expectancy than heterosexuals
as indicated by a study of more than 6,737 obituaries published
in <I>Omega: Journal of Death and Dying</I>.  The average age
of homosexuals who died from AIDS is 39; from all other causes
it is 42.[18]
<P>
Substance addiction and abuse represent the second key health
problems after AIDS in the homosexual subculture (with violence
the third).[19] A report by the National Lesbian-Gay Health Foundation
found that homosexuals -- men and women -- are about three times
as likely as heterosexuals to have an alcohol or drug abuse problem.[20]
<P>
While the 1992 GAO report states that the military spent $26 million
on homosexuals discharged,  it spent many times that figure treating
homosexuals with AIDS -- people who lied to enter the military
and now receive full health and pay benefits.  The cost-effective
decision would be to minimize the risk to the federal taxpayer
by rejecting homosexuals before they are recruited and discharging
those later discovered.
<P>
The 1992 GAO report also found that women are discharged for homosexuality
four times as often as men.  They are much more likely to be processed
under administrative discharge procedures than men.
<P>
Lesbians are also disruptive to unit morale and cohesion.  Pentagon
records include vignettes[21] such as the case of a female sergeant
who drank too much.  She approached four different women at a
base social club making sexually explicit remarks and grabbing
one woman's buttocks.  She was arrested on charges of indecent
assault.
<P>
A female veteran told her account of another female soldier who
made sexual advances in a barracks.  &quot;I was stuck in the
same barracks with that person for three months.  I had to get
up and look at that person every day.  She [the homosexual] insisted
on trying to find a mate in the barracks, and by the end of the
training, everyone has [sic] lost morale.&quot;
<P>
A female basic training soldier complained to her drill sergeant
that other female trainees were &quot;making out&quot; in a common
area.  The sergeant subsequently found seven female soldiers partially
dressed, embracing each other, holding hands, and kissing.  The
seven admitted they were lesbians and said that they were consenting
adults.  They stated they had not engaged in sexual activities,
and their lifestyle had nothing to do with being a good soldier.
<P>
A female air force veteran was assigned a lesbian roommate.  She
made strong sexual advances to the straight airwoman, so much
so that the airwoman left her room and slept on the floor in a
friend's barracks.
<P>
<B>The Justice Department ignored evidence showing that homosexuality
is a pathology.</B>  
<P>
Rather, contrary to long-established military precedence, the
government embraced the concept that homosexuality is normal or
at least of little consequence.  Labeling homosexuality as other
than a pathology is a serious mistake.
<P>
The military's World War II experience provided considerable insight
into human behavior.  Specialists in military medicine literally
rewrote the diagnostic codes and nomenclature for psychiatric
disorders.  Since 1945, the Army has consistently held that homosexuality
is a behavioral problem, not a mental disease.[22]
<P>
In 1952, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) Council approved
and published a new nomenclature for categorizing mental disorders
similar to those used by the military.[23] In the more than 40 years
since that time, the APA, under pressure from militant homosexual
groups, has progressively changed the nomenclature so as to remove
the negative connotations implicit in the terms &quot;sexual deviation&quot;
or &quot;pathology.&quot;
<P>
During its annual meetings from 1969 through 1971, the APA was
besieged by activists demanding the recognition of homosexual
behavior as normal.  In 1971, homosexual activists invaded the
annual meeting and denounced psychiatry as &quot;the enemy incarnate.&quot;[24]
<P>
In 1973, activists challenged the New England Psychiatric Society
to rename the section on &quot;sexual deviation&quot; to &quot;sexual
dysfunction.&quot;  Later that year, APA trustees ruled that homosexuality
would no longer be listed in its official nomenclature of mental
disorders but, rather, would be referred to as &quot;sexual orientation
disturbance.&quot;[25]
<P>
The revision of nomenclature continued when, in 1986, the last
remaining term, &quot;ego-dystonic homosexuality,&quot; was removed
from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders.
 This was done over the strong protest of many psychiatrists who
preferred to label homosexuality a long standing disturbance originating
in the early years of life.[26]
<P>
A survey of the American Medical Association membership in 1975
found that 69 percent agreed that homosexuality is &quot;pathological.&quot;[27]
 An argument used by those who promote homosexuality is that this
proclivity is inborn and irreversible.  Numerous psychotherapists,
including Elizabeth Moberly, Gerald van den Aardweg, Joseph Nicolosi,
Charles Socarides, and Masters and Johnson have reported significant
success in helping homosexuals to recover, thereby proving it
is a curable pathology.[28]
<P>
Despite considerable evidence of success in gender reparative
therapy, the APA, under pressure from gay activists, voted to
stop recommending efforts to turn unhappy homosexuals into heterosexuals.
 In December 1994, AMA's governing House of Delegates called for
a &quot;nonjudgmental recognition of sexual orientation by physicians.&quot;[29]
<P>
<B>The government ignored evidence that homosexuals are a security
risk by relying on a debunked government report which suggests
that homosexuals are no more at risk of blackmail than heterosexuals.</B>
<P>
The primary study comes from the Defense Personnel Security Research
and Education Center (PERSEREC), an agency of the Department of
Defense.[30] Although the report contains much sloppy research and
misinformation, it is frequently cited by one of the plaintiffs'
key witnesses in this case, former Assistant Secretary of Defense
Lawrence J. Korb.
<P>
Few people identify themselves as heterosexual; that identity
is assumed.  Homosexuals do, indeed, identify themselves, however.
<P>
Landmark research by Alan Bell and Martin Weinberg, <I>Homosexualities:
A Study of Diversity Among Men and Women</I>, found that a significant
number of homosexuals report that &quot;someone has threatened
[them with] exposure of homosexuality in order to get something
of value.&quot;[31]
<P>
If the threat of blackmail were the only problem with homosexuals
in the military, then lifting the prohibition might be justified.
 However, homosexuals should not serve for many reasons, and security
investigations are a valid mechanism for enforcing the law.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>JUDGE SEES A STATUS V. CONDUCT DICHOTOMY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The legal fiction that an admission of homosexuality is not a
valid presumption of misconduct has long been dismissed by the
courts.  For many years, the military has won homosexual cases
because the courts recognize that people don't label themselves
homosexuals without some experience or intent to engage in the
defining behavior.  The Clinton Administration tried to finesse
this point in court but failed to persuade the judge, who labeled
the government's arguments as &quot;Orwellian.&quot;
<P>
Because the government failed to show a connection between a declaration
of homosexuality and misconduct, the judge understandably concluded
&quot;that the admission of homosexuals did not pose an uncontrollable
risk that they would commit acts inherently dangerous to morale,
good order, and discipline....&quot;
<P>
<CENTER><H3>JUDGE RELIES ON DEBUNKED STUDY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The government argued that homosexuals create sexual tension in
single-gender organizations.  This tension undermines morale and
cohesion which are key to military readiness.
<P>
The plaintiffs dismiss this argument by citing a Rand Corporation
study which concludes &quot;although some disruptions might result
from having acknowledged homosexuals serving in the military....the
experience of analogous [non-military] organizations...suggests
that any increase is likely to be quite small.&quot;
<P>
In 1993, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin commissioned the Rand
Corporation to study lifting the military's homosexual ban.  The
Rand study cost $1.3 million and contains inaccurate or misleading
information and inappropriate parallels.
<P><UL>
<LI>Judge Nickerson cites Rand's report on other countries, &quot;[N]o
serious problems were reported concerning the presence of homosexuals
in the force.&quot;
<P>
Rand ignored the June 1993 GAO report on &quot;Homosexuals in
the Military: Policies and Practices of Foreign Countries.&quot;[32]
 The GAO reviewed 25 countries and selected four countries for
detailed analysis.  The report states that 11 countries have policies
that do not permit homosexuals to serve in the military, 11 have
policies that do.  Three of the latter 11 countries do not have
any laws, regulations, or policies that address this issue.  An
unpublished Pentagon study conducted in December 1992 found that
some of those countries that permit homosexuals to serve do so
with strict limitations. 
<P>
Testimony before the Senate and House Armed Services Committees
(SASC and HASC) in April and May 1993 illustrates the dramatic
differences between foreign militaries and our own.  For example,
the Netherlands started a homosexual military experiment in 1974.
 That nation has 65,000 service members, including 40,000 conscripts
who serve 14 months and who primarily commute from home each day.
 The U.S. has 2.5 million active and reserve service personnel
stationed in the U.S. and around the world at any given time.
 The U.S. routinely participates in combat operations, something
the Dutch have not done for 50 years.      
The German armed forces, which are included among those that do
<I>not</I> have an exclusionary policy, will not induct acknowledged
homosexual volunteers because they would &quot;undermine military
order and discipline.&quot;[33] Of the 476,300 members, 43 percent
are conscripts who, if identified as homosexual, may be required
to undergo psychological tests to determine their fitness.  The
German Federal Administrative Court declared in November 1990
that the military is justified in not allowing homosexuals to
serve in leadership and educational positions.
<P>
Foreign social experiences have little relevance for America's
military.  The U.S. is a superpower with urgent missions worldwide.
 America also has a radical homosexual community and a liberal
judicial system, a combination that guarantees a steady stream
of legal activism that is disruptive to military morale.
<P>
<LI>Judge Nickerson cites the 1992 GAO study on analogous organizations
which &quot;accepted homosexuals into their ranks...[and] have
generally not reported adverse impacts.&quot;
<P>
Rand's &quot;analogous organizations&quot; are fire and police
departments.  Researchers visited six cities and concluded that
homosexuals were integrated through clear and simple policies,
aggressive leadership and adherence to strict standards of conduct.
 The report prescribes the same approach for the military.
<P>
Rand ignores the important lessons from San Francisco Chief of
Police Anthony D. Ribera, who told the HASC on May 7, 1993 that
his department experiences a &quot;significantly higher&quot;
number of AIDS deaths among homosexual officers.  His department
routinely tests for Hepatitis B -- as demanded by the policemen's
union.  And they rely on local hospitals rather than other officers
for emergency blood.
<P>
San Francisco's officers also go home evenings or, as in the Seattle
Fire Department, occupy private cubicles when required to stay
overnight.  Additionally, homosexual officers serve primarily
in homosexual districts and, as in New York City, no one is forced
to pair up with a homosexual.  Chief Ribera concludes, &quot;Our
experience is remotely parallel to the military.&quot;
<P>
Sgt. Edward Striedinger of the Seattle Police Department told
the HASC about female officers who complained about advances from
lesbian officers.  These women refused to file formal complaints,
citing fear of reprisals. 
<P>
The parallels between paramilitary and military organizations
are mostly cosmetic, such as wearing side-arms and uniforms. 
The differences are pronounced but ignored in Rand's briefing.
<P>
<LI>Judge Nickerson cites Rand's study on racial integration of
the services stating, integration &quot;did not 'destroy' unit
cohesion and military effectiveness.&quot;
<P>
Rand equates the evolving &quot;discriminatory&quot; homosexual
policy with the integration of blacks into the military.  General
Colin Powell has rejected the linkage: &quot;Skin color is [a]
benign, nonbehavioral characteristic.  Sexual orientation is perhaps
the most profound of human behavioral characteristics.  Comparison
of the two is a convenient but invalid argument.&quot;[34]
<P>
The Council of 100 (a national organization of African-American
Republicans founded in 1974) points out differences in the moral
and social climate in 1948 (when President Truman directed the
military to integrate), and the fact that blacks had honorably
and openly served since the Revolutionary War.  The Council said
that the homosexual discrimination argument is &quot;a disingenuous
strategy to divert attention from the real issues&quot; of readiness
and cohesion.[35]
<P>
The integration of avowed homosexuals brings into the military
services individuals whose behavior violates federal law.  The
integration of black Americans involved no behavioral assumptions.
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>FIFTH AMENDMENT ARGUMENT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The government argued that heterosexual service members &quot;will
be upset by a co-worker's mere statement of homosexuality&quot;
and as a result refuse to work cooperatively.  The judge labels
this unjustified discrimination.
<P>
The government once again failed to present compelling evidence
that homosexual &quot;lifestyles&quot; and &quot;values&quot;
are incompatible with military service.
<P>
Consider the implications of homosexual service for military morale.
<P>
Morale means &quot;a strong sense of enthusiasm and dedication
to a commonly shared goal that unifies a group.&quot;  Heterosexual
soldiers forced to live and work with avowed homosexuals cannot
be expected to submit to sexual tension with &quot;...a strong
sense of enthusiasm.&quot;  
<P>
Open homosexuals tend to derive their basic identity from their
sexual orientation and practice: &quot;I am a homosexual,&quot;
as opposed to the American soldier's basic identity: &quot;I am
a soldier.&quot;  The homosexual's preoccupation with individual
behavioral characteristics is incongruent with and detracts from
the commonly shared goal -- accomplishment of the mission -- which
unifies heterosexual soldiers and subordinates their individual
goals to that of the group.
<P>
The homosexual subculture is recognized as &quot;liberated,&quot;
or in a manner of speaking, undisciplined.  This is inherently
at odds with the 24-hour discipline system within which soldiers
must live and work.  Homosexuals are distinguished from other
subcultures by their behavior [sodomy].  One group behavioral
characteristic is a very high rate of promiscuity.  Military records
indicate that homosexuals are statistically more likely to engage
in misconduct than heterosexuals.  They have a higher incidence
of drug and alcohol abuse than heterosexuals.  If these aren't
enough, much-touted books such as Randy Shilts' <I>Conduct Unbecoming</I>
and Mary Ann Humphrey's <I>My Country, My Right to Serve</I> provide,
perhaps unwittingly, ample testimony to the disruptive nature
of homosexuals in military units.[36]
<P>
The voice of experience indicates that homosexuals jeopardize
military morale.  For example, a survey of active duty officers
conducted for the American Security Council Foundation found that
99.03 percent said homosexuals would undermine the cohesiveness
and readiness of combat units.[37] The Defense Readiness Council
compiled a survey of 2,800 retired flag and general officers.
 Nearly 90 percent said they believe homosexuals undermine morale.[38]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>JUDGE MAKES NO MORAL DECISION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Judge Nickerson explained that his task &quot;is to determine
the constitutionality of the policy adopted by Congress, not its
morality.&quot;  He argues that everyone is &quot;entitled to
think it demeaning and unworthy of a great nation to base a policy
on pretense rather than on truth.&quot;
<P>
The judge suggests that constitutionality and morality may not
agree in this case, but many soldiers think this is clearly a
morality issue.  And requiring soldiers to &quot;tolerate&quot;
homosexuality will lead to recruitment and retention problems.
 The <I>Los Angeles Times</I> survey found that 46 percent of
soldiers said lifting the ban would enter into their reenlistment
decision and 11 percent would not reenlist because of it.  A February
1993 <I>CNN/Gallup Poll</I> found that, among men who had not
attended college, the prime recruiting population, 74 percent
opposed lifting the ban.  
<P>
The judge's labeling this a &quot;pretense&quot; is based on the
Clinton Administration's decision to stop asking recruits whether
they are homosexual.  Asking the question keeps honest homosexuals
out and sends a clear message that to serve, others must keep
their homosexuality a secret.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
It is expected that the Supreme Court will hear this case by 1997.
 As long as the government permits homosexuals to serve and as
long as the Clinton Administration's implementing directives flout
the law, however, the outcome is in doubt.
<P>
The 104th Congress must take legislative action to stop the evasion
of reality.  The Clinton Administration should be required to
abide by the law and the Justice Department must defend the law
using longstanding and successful arguments.

<TITLE>ACCREDITATION COUNCIL MANDATES ABORTION TRAINING </TITLE>

MANDATES ABORTION TRAINING</H2>

<P>
On February 14, 1995, the 23-member Accreditation Council for
Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) voted unanimously to pass new
regulations mandating that all medical residents specializing
in obstetrics and gynecology be trained to perform elective abortions.
 Individual residents expressing moral or religious objections
would be able to opt out of the abortion training.  However, medical
institutions opposed to abortion, such as Catholic hospitals,
would still be required -- in order to maintain their accredited
status -- to provide their students with abortion training by
arranging for their students to receive such training at another
location.
<P>
The wording of the new requirement is as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;Experience with induced abortion must be part of residency
education, except for residents with moral or religious objections.
 This education can be provided outside the institution.  Experience
with management of complications of abortion must be provided
to all residents.  If a residency program has a religious, moral
or legal restriction which prohibits the residents from performing
abortions within the institution, the program must ensure that
the residents receive a satisfactory education and experience
managing the complications of abortion.  Furthermore, such residency
programs must have mechanisms which ensure that residents in their
program who do not have a religious or moral objection receive
education and experience in performing abortion at another institution.&quot;[1]
<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
Programs which fail to comply with the new regulations risk losing
their accreditation.  Accreditation status qualifies teaching
hospitals to receive federal reimbursement for services which
medical residents provide to patients.  Moreover, doctors must
ordinarily graduate from accredited training programs to get certified
as competent in their specialties.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>DECLINE IN ABORTION PROVIDERS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Over the last twenty years, the number of medical schools offering
elective abortion training to their residents has declined.  In
1976, 92.5 percent of U.S. 
medical schools offered first-trimester abortion training, either
on a routine (26.3 percent) or optional basis (66.2 percent).
 This contrasts with 1991 figures in which 68.8 percent of medical
schools offered first-trimester abortion training -- 12.4 percent
on a routine basis, 56.4 percent on an optional basis.[2] Second-trimester
abortion training is only slightly less common than first-trimester
training programs (65.4 percent vs. 68.8 percent respectively),
but fewer medical schools routinely offer second-trimester abortion
training (6.7 percent); more provide optional training (58.7 percent).[3]
<P>
About one third of medical schools refuse to provide abortion
training due to moral and/or legal reasons.  For example, Catholic-affiliated
hospitals -- which make up about 20 percent of all U.S. hospitals
-- do not perform elective abortions because of religious and
moral beliefs.[4] Other hospitals, such as the publicly financed
Truman Medical Center in Missouri, are legally prohibited from
performing abortions because laws in several states -- including
Missouri -- bar the use of taxpayer money to fund abortions.[5]
<P>
In addition to the declining number of medical schools which provide
abortion training, fewer physicians are willing to perform abortions.
 A Columbia University survey found that nearly half of the ob/gyn
chief residents graduating each year have never performed a first-trimester
abortion.[6]
<P>
Overall, the Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI) reports that the
number of hospitals, clinics, and physicians' offices that provide
abortions -- 2,380 in 1992 -- has been declining at a rate of
about 65 a year.  Most of the decline can be attributed to hospitals;
the number of hospitals providing abortions decreased by 18 percent
between 1988 and 1992.[7]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>ENSURING THAT WOMEN HAVE A CHOICE?</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Proponents of ACGME's new regulations such as the National Abortion
Federation, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the
Feminist Majority Foundation, the Center for Reproductive Law
and Policy, and the current leadership of the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) point to the decline
in abortion providers as justification for the mandate.  They
emphasize that unless the procedure is required, many ob/gyn students
will choose to opt out of abortion training, thereby decreasing
access to abortion.
<P>
Abortion advocacy groups hope the ACGME mandate will help bring
abortion back into the &quot;mainstream&quot; of ob/gyn practice.
 Currently, the vast majority of abortions are performed in clinics,
isolating abortion from the general practice of medicine.  Abortionists
also say they frequently feel less respected by their colleagues
and society in general.  By including abortion as a necessary
ob/gyn service, abortion proponents hope to remove the taint associated
with abortion and also reduce the targeting of clinics by abortion
protesters.
<P>
Finally, the ACGME cited patient safety as a reason to require
abortion training.  Dr. John C. Gienapp, Ph.D., executive director
of ACGME, said, &quot;Those physicians who choose to develop appropriate
medical skills in the area of abortion must be trained adequately.&quot;[8]
 The American Medical Association agreed, saying in a statement,
&quot;For the safety of patients, it is essential that physicians
providing abortion services are trained and competent.&quot;[9]
<P>
While the new regulations will not go into effect until January
1, 1996, abortion advocacy groups as well as several medical societies
-- including ACOG -- have lobbied the ACGME for over a year to
adopt such a policy change.[10]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>OR REMOVING CHOICE FROM OB/GYN PHYSICIANS?</H3></CENTER>
<P>
ACGME's new abortion mandate has received considerable opposition
-- from pro-life groups to many within the medical establishment.
 &quot;Pro-choice&quot; physician James Schreiber, M.D., chief
of obstetrics and gynecology at Washington University Medical
Center in St. Louis, denounced the new policy as coercive and
&quot;anti-choice,&quot; saying that institutions with moral objections
were &quot;being forced into an untenable position.&quot;[11]
<P>
Richard T. F. Schmidt, M.D., a former ACOG president (1977-1978)
and residency review committee member, also questions the rationale
behind the abortion training mandate.  In a letter to ACGME's
ob/gyn residency review committee, Dr. Schmidt wrote, &quot;Is
there a demonstrated lack of knowledge or technical competence
among program graduates?  Or is the purpose to make more residents
comfortable with the <I>idea</I> of elective abortion and its
performance?&quot;  Commenting on the diminishing number of programs
offering elective abortion training, Dr. Schmidt said that given
a choice, faculty and residents &quot;voted very clearly with
their feet.&quot;[12]
<P>
The Christian Medical and Dental Society (CMDS), the American
Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops, and other pro-life and pro-family
groups have also registered their strong opposition to the new
mandate.  These groups argue that requiring residents to undergo
abortion training will have the effect of dissuading many pro-life
medical students from choosing to specialize in ob/gyn.  These
groups also believe that residents will receive intense pressure
from within the medical school to undergo abortion training due
to the accreditation requirement.[13]
<P>
The fears these groups express may well be justified.  An editorial
published in the <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I> indicates
that ob/gyn residents will receive considerable pressure to undergo
elective abortion training.  The author of the editorial, an advocate
of the new ACGME requirements, writes that &quot;[r]esidents who
wish to opt out of abortion training should be required to explain
why in a way that satisfies <I>stringent</I> and <I>explicit</I>
criteria&quot; (emphasis added).[14]  Furthermore, two years ago the
University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill
found that greater numbers of residents were refusing to perform
abortions even though the school provided training.  As a result,
the school sent a letter to all prospective residents in the summer
of 1993 saying that it would accept only candidates who agreed
to perform abortions.  The policy was rescinded after threats
of a class-action lawsuit.[15]
<P>
The North Carolina scenario demonstrates that ACGME's new policies
were not passed in response to ob/gyn residents who wanted to
receive abortion training but were unable to receive it.  Such
a conclusion is also supported by a recently released survey by
the American Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a
recognized special interest group within the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG).  With almost 25 percent
of the 36,000 ACOG members responding, the survey found that 59
percent of respondents felt that abortion training should <U>not</U>
be required in residency programs.[16]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>IMPACTS OF THE ABORTION TRAINING MANDATE</H3></CENTER>
<P>
ACGME's new requirements seem to be implicitly directed at teaching
residents to perform second- and third-trimester abortions.  As
Congressman and family physician/obstetrician Tom Coburn (R-OK)
has testified, medical residents already receive training in handling
spontaneous abortions (miscarriages) through dilation and curettage
(D &amp; C), which is the usual technique used for first-trimester
abortions.  Only later-term abortions require additional training
in special techniques to &quot;terminate the pregnancy.&quot;[17]
<P>
The new policy would also require teaching hospitals to provide
or obtain additional facilities, equipment, and faculty (or contract
with other institutions to do so).  Furthermore, hospitals which
have not historically referred patients for abortions because
of moral reasons and which refuse to provide abortion training
on-site would nonetheless be forced to violate their fundamental
beliefs and directly collaborate with abortion providers.  The
mandate also violates laws in roughly half the states that exempt
hospitals from referring for abortion, contraception, or sterilization
when the hospital is conscientiously opposed.
<P>
Because the abortion training mandate does conflict with several
states' laws, it can also be reasonably expected that Planned
Parenthood and other abortion providers will file lawsuits to
change the laws which (1) exempt hospitals from referring for
abortion, and (2) explicitly ban the use of taxpayer monies to
fund abortions in publicly-funded hospitals.

<I>Lt. Col. Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.)</I></CENTER>
<P>
The forced feminization of the Navy is undermining combat readiness
and Congress must exercise its Constitutional responsibility to
examine these politically motivated changes before more damage
is done.
<P>
Defense Secretary William Perry promised, &quot;Our over-arching
goal is to maintain a high-quality, ready and effective force.
 By increasing the numbers of units and positions to which women
can be assigned, the military services gain greater flexibility
in the development and use of human resources.&quot;[1] 
<P>
Unfortunately, Mr. Perry has set a course to feminize the Navy
without regard for military necessity.  Today, 94 percent of Navy
billets, including previously exempt combat positions, are open
to women.  Secretary Perry promotes these changes as &quot;equal
opportunity.&quot;[2]
<P>
Consider factors that seriously impair Navy readiness.
<P><UL>
<LI>A Navy study found that women are NOT physically equipped to
perform most at-sea emergency tasks.
<P>
<LI>A 1995 Navy policy embraces pregnancy as an acceptable readiness
problem in spite of the fact that almost half of pregnant sailors
never return to their crews after delivery.
<P>
<LI>Fraternization is a growing problem among crew members aboard
mixed-gender ships and this contributes to serious morale and
cohesion problems at sea.  It also has a negative effect on the
well-being of military spouses back home.
<P>
<LI>The Navy has ignored longstanding screening standards in order
to accelerate less qualified women into positions, thus bypassing
more experienced men.
<P>
<LI>Sexual harassment charges are a favorite tool of some women
who manipulate Navy leaders to promote personal agendas.
<P>
<LI>The Defense Department has promised to raise the percentage
of female servicemembers to perhaps 25 percent of the total force.[3]
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>STUDY SAYS WOMEN ARE DIFFERENT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Navy has ignored key findings which demonstrate that women
are less equipped physically to perform assignments aboard combat ships.
 The Navy Personnel Research and Development Center in San Diego,
California, conducted a comprehensive study of 350 men and 195
women to determine what effect training had on their physical
performances.  The study measured performance on five basic damage
control tasks: carrying litters on level surfaces and up and down
ladders, moving and starting emergency pumps, turning engine bolts,
and directing fire hose streams.  Virtually all male recruits
were able to perform all of the tasks before training, while women
could perform only one of the tasks to a satisfactory standard.[4]
<P>
Even after significant training, women showed no appreciable improvement.
 The study found that the differences between the sexes on measures
of lifting strength and aerobic capacity are dramatic.  
<P>
All naval crewmembers must be prepared to perform damage control
assignments.  Lack of physical strength among female sailors can
decrease survivability.  For example, had more women been aboard
the <I>USS Stark</I>, crippled by an Iraqi missile in the Persian
Gulf, the loss of life and property would very likely have been
greater.
<P>
Analogous organization experiences show similar trends.  Civilian
fire departments have reported disproportionate differences between
the sexes in injury rates when women are expected to perform like
men.  They suffer up to three times as many disabling back injuries
as men.[5] Women suffer more injuries because to lift the same load
as men, they must operate near their maximum lifting capacity,
e.g., a male medic carrying a litter uses on the average half
of his lifting power, but a woman uses on average her full lifting
capacity.
<P>
The 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in
the Armed Forces found that women's aerobic capacity is significantly
lower, meaning they cannot carry as much as far as fast as men.
 Despite the existence of an exceedingly small number of Amazonian
women who resemble men in muscular mass, on average, women are
shorter, have less muscle mass and weigh less than men.  This
puts them at a distinct disadvantage when performing tasks requiring
a high level of muscular strength and aerobic capacity.[6]
<P>
The Commission also found that women are at a higher risk for
exercise-induced injuries than men, with 2.13 times greater risk
for lower extremity injuries, and 4.71 times greater risk for
stress fractures.[7]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>PREGNANCY POLICY HURTS READINESS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Navy's 1995 pregnancy policy ignores readiness while favoring
protection of individuals' rights.  As the number of women in
the Navy increases, pregnancy becomes a serious readiness issue.
<P>
At any given time, up to 18 percent of Navy women are pregnant
and a study of two ships showed a pregnancy rate as high as one
in three.[8] That's nearly 8,423 women or enough to crew almost
two aircraft carriers.  During Desert Storm 1,145 women on ships
needed to be reassigned because of pregnancies, at an average
of 95 per month.[9]
<P>
According to the policy, a woman may serve aboard ship until she
is 20 weeks pregnant.  While aboard ship, she must never be more
than six hours from emergency OB/GYN care.  Perhaps this provision
exists because at least five babies have been born on Navy ships,
one of which died shortly after birth.  Obviously, this policy
limits the pregnant sailor's deployability and her job performance
is frequently limited.
<P>
On average, each pregnancy taken to term removes a female sailor
from her ship for at least six months.  Once the child is born,
the sailor receives six weeks of convalescent leave and is not
required to re-deploy for four months.  That period can be extended
by the attending physician.  Many women never return to their
ship after giving birth.  According to Navy records, 35 percent
leave the Navy and eight percent remain on shore.    
<P>
Those who do return are unable to devote full time to their infant,
often creating an unhealthy reliance on child care at an extremely
impressionable age for the child.  Extended care for children
during frequent deployments denies the child the nurturing that
is key to a balanced emotional composition.   
<P>
According to Jay Belsky writing in the <I>Journal of Marriage
and the Family</I>, children left in child care while mothers
work &quot;scored more poorly on a composite measure of adjustment
than did children whose mothers were not employed during their
first three years....[and they] were significantly more noncompliant
than agemates without such early experience.&quot;[10]  These problems
are made worse as the mother-child separations are longer and
more frequent.
<P>
According to the Defense Manpower Data Center, two thirds of all
uniformed female mothers of one child have never married.  There
are never-married servicemembers with as many as nine dependents.
 Today, there are 84,831 never-married female active duty members
from all services with at least one child.[11]
<P>
Unmarried female servicemembers with at-home dependents are eligible
for benefits identical to married members.  For example, they
receive larger government quarters (more children means more bedrooms),
larger allowances driven by family size (such as cost of living
allowances), government-subsidized child care and medical care.
 During each pregnancy the servicemember is provided all pay and
allowances, time off and free medical benefits.
<P>
If a pregnant sailor wants an abortion she must be transported
off the ship to a location near an abortion clinic.  Before this
happens Navy personnel must counsel her about her options.  If
she chooses abortion, she is given, at government expense, a complete
blood count (CBC) to determine whether to administer Rhogam to
prevent an immune reaction.  After the abortion, the Navy provides
medical attention for problems arising from the procedure, like
clinical depression or an incomplete abortion.  The costs for
this treatment are borne by the Navy.
<P>
Navy policy prohibits supervisors from taking action against a
woman who becomes pregnant during a deployment, and there is no
requirement for women to use birth control during deployments.
 One command did, however, send a message to all ship captains
directing them to counsel their female sailors about the advantages
of NORPLANT, the under-the-skin birth control device.[12] 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>SEX TAKES PLACE AFLOAT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Two sailors aboard the <I>USS Eisenhower</I> were recently punished
for having sex, videotaping the event and then showing it to fellow
sailors.  The sailors were charged with adultery, since each of
them was married to someone else.  The incident shows that mixing
men and women in close quarters for extended periods can lead
to misconduct, and it has serious implications for morale.
<P>
The number of pregnancies aboard the USS Eisenhower, the first
combat vessel with female crewmembers, grew from five to 39 in
a couple months.  In all, 13 percent of the female crew became
pregnant.  By comparison, less than four percent of the male crewmembers
left the <I>Eisenhower</I> for medical reasons since April 1994.[13]
<P>
An active duty Naval officer with recent at-sea experience supervising
female sailors claims that every ship has &quot;large numbers
of pregnancies.&quot;  This officer alleges that advancement in
the Navy depends on supporting the &quot;vital program of women
at sea&quot; and he is &quot;not sure the Navy [has] thought through
the pregnancy issue.&quot;[14]
<P>
A seasoned chief petty officer who recently supervised women aboard
ship alleges that many women &quot;get pregnant to avoid deployment.&quot;
 He believes that many &quot;Generation X&quot; women are in the
Navy for financial gain, the education and to find a husband.
 Sex aboard ship is common.  As a supervisor who wouldn't tolerate
sexual liaisons among crewmembers,  he claims that his disapproving
female subordinates were very uncooperative with him due to his
lack of tolerance of their fraternization.
<P>
The chief alleges that many of his female subordinates were untrained
prior to a recent deployment because they had only been recently
reassigned to the crew.  They were replacing other females who
&quot;got pregnant at the last minute.&quot;  It is difficult
to replace women with men, because ships are now configured to
accommodate a specified number of billets for each sex. 
<P>
Apart from the immediate shipboard impact, the policy hurts family
members who stay ashore and worry about the sexual climate to
which their spouses are being subjected.  An officer's wife recently
wrote about sexual tensions in Haiti.  Two men shared a tent with
a female officer who &quot;made it known that she was open to
intimate relationships.&quot;  The male officer indicated the
situation made him &quot;uncomfortable and awkward&quot; and it
&quot;was to him professionally and personally&quot; distressing.
 He had recently married and his wife was pregnant with their
first child.[15] Military wives often worry about the prospects that
their husbands might be sexually preyed upon by women willing
to use sex for personal gain.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>AFFIRMATIVE ACTION COMES ABOARD</H3></CENTER>
<P>
There is growing anecdotal evidence that shows that female sailors
get special treatment.  Consider several incidents.
<P>
A female sailor aboard the <I>USS Eisenhower</I> was disciplined
for &quot;falling in love.&quot;  Her punishment was three days
on bread and water in a Navy brig.  Since the carrier has no female
jail, she was sent ashore to Rota, Spain via an Italian island,
Italy, Germany and finally Spain.  En route to Rota, she and her
two escorts shopped and dined their way for five days, all at
government expense.  She told the <I>Norfolk Virginian-Pilot and
Ledger-Star</I>, &quot;I was free to go.  We went out to eat,
to the shopping malls in Italy and we stayed in hotels.  It had
to be a huge expense.&quot;[16] Some &quot;punishment.&quot;
<P>
The 19-year-old claims she was the only female crewmember disciplined
for breaking the captain's no-dating policy and alleges other
women were found &quot;with their boyfriends kissing in closets
and other hideaways aboard ship.&quot;[17]
<P>
Tragedies which involve Navy women have also been handled in an
unusual fashion.  The fatal crash of an F-14A Tomcat fighter on
October 25, 1994 is revealing.  In an unprecedented move, the
Navy released Lieutenant Kara S. Hultgreen's training records
to the media and her mother, Sally Spears.  It also went to great
lengths to recover the aircraft from the ocean floor.  Finally,
it released a video showing Hultgreen's last carrier approach.
<P>
Although initial reports blamed a failed engine for the crash,
on March 14, 1995, the Mishap Investigation Report (MIR) contained
&quot;...repeated instances of pilot error.  It notes the role
of engine trouble but concludes that Hultgreen's flight-control
mistakes were the most critical factors [in the accident].&quot;[18]
 The MIR, written to exacting standards, is classified as &quot;privileged&quot;
and is used for improving the safety of future flights.
<P>
On March 7, 1995 a female Navy pilot called a live national radio
show from the deck of the <I>USS Abraham Lincoln</I>, the same
carrier to which Hultgreen was assigned.  This F-18 pilot called
to promote women in combat aircraft.  She explained that the &quot;women
in the military&quot; debate is about &quot;equal opportunity&quot;
and as far as she is concerned there is &quot;no problem.&quot;[19]
<P>
In August 1994, a male Navy pilot told his boss that he objected
to women serving in combat, but would follow orders.  He now faces
dismissal for failing to &quot;demonstrate leadership&quot; despite
having received outstanding efficiency reports.[20]
<P>
Another male officer alleges that women are receiving preferential
treatment for command and promotions.  One female officer was
selected to become a ship's executive officer after only three
years of sea duty.  The more seasoned male officer explained that
the standard has long been no less than six to eight years of
sea duty before eligibility for this coveted assignment.  He also
cited the example of a female commander who was excused for hitting
a sea buoy, an act which is normally a career killer.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CHARGES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The 1991 Tailhook convention branded the Navy as a haven of sexual
harassers.  Even though much of the evidence is contradictory,
the Navy has suffered serious public relations damage.
<P>
In the wake of Tailhook, several key senior Navy leaders have
taken direct hits from women alleging sexual harassment.  Admiral
Stanley Arthur decided to drop a female lieutenant with poor flying
skills from helicopter aviation training.  The lieutenant claimed
that she had been eliminated from flight school because of &quot;retaliation&quot;
for filing a successful sexual harassment complaint.  The man
involved in the harassment charge was punished for making inappropriate
comments and has since left the Navy.
<P>
Adm. Arthur reviewed the lieutenant's record and found evidence
of poor aptitude and performance both before and after the harassment
incident.  He wrote: &quot;From this review I do not have sufficient
confidence that [the lieutenant] could safely and successfully
operate an aircraft in a dangerous and unforgiving operational
environment....I do not desire to see her or perhaps others die
because she could not perform at a level consistent with our standards.&quot;[21]
<P>
The admiral had been nominated to become Commander in Chief of
Naval Forces in the Pacific (CINCPAC).  After his decision, his
confirmation was procedurally shelved possibly because of threats
from congresswomen like Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-CO) who fought
the retirement status of outgoing Chief of Naval Operations Frank
B. Kelso II, who oversaw the Tailhook investigation.  The Navy
withdrew the Arthur nomination.
<P>
Tragically, Coast Guard Captain Ernest J. Blanchard IV took his
own life after learning of an investigation into remarks he allegedly
made at a dinner at the Coast Guard Academy on January 10, 1995.
 An officer who attended the dinner said, &quot;I heard the remark
that some of the things the speaker said would have been OK maybe
20 years ago....I guess they were jokes, off-color remarks, not
politically correct.  Some women in the humanities department
apparently complained about the comments.&quot;[22]
<P>
Blanchard, considered a rising star in the Coast Guard, wrote
a formal letter of apology to the &quot;offended&quot; woman,
but it was not accepted.  The female officer pressed her allegations.
 Blanchard offered to retire but permission was denied.  Friends
believe that he felt that his character was being assailed and
that he was being treated as an example by the Coast Guard.
<P>
In other instances, remarks by junior officers have met with charges
of sexual harassment.  For example, when a petty officer reported
that two of his subordinates were having a lesbian relationship,
the women responded by alleging sexual harassment.  The senior
chief was removed from the ship.
<P>
Another officer was removed for being a &quot;gender offender.&quot;
 The first words out of his boss's mouth were: &quot;You're guilty
of sexual harassment,&quot; a clear violation of the long tradition
of being held innocent until proven guilty.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Clinton Administration's decision to scuttle exemptions for
women and to embrace the feminization of the Navy has seriously
damaged readiness.  The 104th Congress should reverse the current
trend before irreparable harm is done to the U.S. Navy and the
defense posture of the nation.

<TITLE>THE FACTS ABOUT WELFARE AND ABORTION IN NEW JERSEY</TITLE>

WELFARE AND ABORTION<BR>

<I>Jennifer E. Marshall</I></CENTER>
<P>
John Cardinal O'Connor of New York has defined two conditions
-- and two conditions only -- that justify opposing the anti-illegitimacy
measures recently adopted by the House.  His opposition hinges,
first, on the &quot;virtual inevitability&quot; that a freeze
on benefits &quot;amounts to a programmed 'short-term' increase
in abortions&quot; and, second, on the lack of &quot;any hard
evidence&quot; to support the contention that reducing illegitimacy
will reduce abortions.[1]
<P>
The Cardinal's principled objections deserve an answer, and all
people of faith should be relieved by the fact that we do have
hard evidence to allay both of his concerns.  Given the weight
of evidence suggesting that abortions will not increase in the
short term and will in fact decrease in the long term, those who
defend the status quo on moral or empirical grounds must now bear
the burden of proof.  And those who have been both puzzled and
troubled by the rift in the pro-life ranks over this issue must
understand that the division springs not from a different understanding
of our moral responsibilities, but from a different degree of
reliance on the actual empirical record.
<P>
While it is far too premature to draw any decisive conclusions
from the welfare experiment in New Jersey, there is absolutely
no statistical indication as of yet that an increase in abortions
has occurred since the state's family cap took effect August 1,
1993.  In fact, the total number of Medicaid-funded abortions
in New Jersey declined from 13,629 in 1993 to 13,424 in 1994.[2]
<P>
Because Medicaid data is collected by date of payment, rather
than procurement, the raw numbers do contain some distortion.
 Yet any Medicaid-funded abortion occurring within approximately
the first year after implementation of the cap is included in
the current data set.  While the 1994 numbers are still subject
to some adjustment to reflect the most recent abortions for which
no claim has yet been filed, the existing margin between the totals
for 1993 and 1994 can accommodate the anticipated inflation without
threatening the indication that abortions have not surged upward
as feared.
<P>
Likewise, the number of privately funded abortions performed on
welfare mothers
 is expected to be too negligible to affect the finding that abortions
have not significantly increased (especially since the average
cost of an abortion in New Jersey in 1993 was equal to eight times
the $64 amount by which the new policy reduces the benefits package
each month).  Although no hard data is available to address the
question, Susan Tew of the Alan Guttmacher Institute commented
that &quot;it logically does not make sense to suggest that women
who are in severe financial straits and are eligible for a publicly
funded abortion would forgo those Medicaid dollars in lieu of
scarce private resources.&quot;  No data is available, she noted,
precisely because the possibility that welfare women forgo available
public funding for the abortions they choose to have is too remote
to merit the expenditure of research dollars.[3] 
<P>
The only other significant objection to the use of Medicaid data
-- the only data we have at present -- is that the population
includes approximately 57,000 women (ages 16-45) who are eligible
for Medicaid, but are not subject to the Family Development Program
(FDP) in New Jersey that included the family cap.  The presence
of such a sizeable group of women who are not subject to the new
welfare policy could conceivably mask an increase in abortions;
but the fact that the non-FDP population remained virtually unchanged
between 1993 and 1994 suggests that there is no hidden increase
lurking in the short-run data.
<P>
Anita Leone, executive director of an association that represents
all the publicly-funded abortion clinics in New Jersey, confirmed
in a recent interview: &quot;We know that abortions in New Jersey
are currently decreasing.  We just don't know why.&quot;  Since
the decline in the birth rate among welfare mothers in New Jersey
has been rather substantial since implementation of the family
cap (estimates range at least as high as 11.4 percent[4]), the fact
that an increase in abortions is not yet indicated is significant.
<P>
The anecdotal evidence collected by those who are on the frontlines
of welfare reform in New Jersey confirms the general pattern that
is beginning to emerge from the data.  Richard Traynor of the
Legal Center for Defense of Life in New Jersey and David Sciarra
of New Jersey Legal Services, who together filed a class-action
suit over the New Jersey family cap, both commented in telephone
interviews that the class was certified to include welfare mothers
who had aborted their babies -- but that neither one could locate
a woman who had actually aborted in the wake of the cap.
<P>
Instead, the only plaintiffs who mention abortion in their affidavits
explain that they consciously decided on moral grounds not to
terminate their pregnancies, despite increased economic pressures.
 One woman testified that she made an appointment at an abortion
clinic but ultimately &quot;became very upset about having an
abortion and decided that [she] could not go through with it.&quot;
 Another woman who already had two children and was carrying triplets
-- three times the pressure -- never even considered abortion.[5]
<P>
The decision to abort, the evidence suggests, is uniquely invulnerable
to rational economic incentives.  And welfare mothers are apparently
more inclined to consider &quot;non-rational&quot; factors than
any other population group.  Public opinion data collected by
the Family Research Council suggest that abortion is even more
morally repugnant to poor women;[6] and the fact that abortion rates
for teen welfare mothers are <I>lower</I> than national averages
for all teenage girls is a powerful indication that non-economic
factors determine the decision to carry a child to term.[7]
<P>
Many who now argue otherwise are precisely the ones who maintain
that the current benefits level is already far too low to cover
the costs associated with a new baby.  If so, it is illogical
to predict that a cap would have a sufficiently significant impact
on the &quot;affordability&quot; of another child to trigger such
a drastic measure as abortion.
<P>
State-by-state data from the 1980s demonstrates that small changes
in welfare payouts do not affect abortion rates in the short term;[8]
and Michael Schwartz of Life Advocacy Alliance has found in analyzing
more recent data that states with the highest average monthly
benefit for a family of three also tend to have the highest ratio
of abortions to live births.[9]
<P>
Not surprisingly, then, the only &quot;evidence&quot; the plaintiffs
could offer in the New Jersey suit was 55 letters from pro-life
activists expressing concern that freezing benefits might increase
abortions.  As of yet, there is nothing more concrete than their
concern itself to corroborate their claims; and pro-lifers who
are unconvinced by the hearsay -- including John Tomicki, past
president of New Jersey Right to Life -- have concluded that welfare
reform itself is a pro-life cause.
<P>
Contrary to Cardinal O'Connor's assertion, we do have compelling
statistical evidence to suggest that reducing illegitimacy will
reduce abortions.  Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation has
found an astronomically high correlation between abortion and
illegitimacy in a state-by-state analysis.  His study shows that
an increase of 100 in the number of illegitimate births per 10,000
women, in fact, results in an increase of 200 in the number of
abortions per 10,000 women.[10]
<P>
The vast majority of abortions are performed on unmarried women
-- and the proportion is growing.  To reduce abortions, we must
reduce the premarital sex and out-of-wedlock pregnancy that create
a perceived &quot;need&quot; for abortion.  Marriage affords the
best protection -- indeed, the only real hope -- for the children
of the poor.
<P>
In deference to that fact, John Paul II wrote in his most recent
encyclical <I>Evangelium Vitae</I> that &quot;[a] general <I>and
no less serious </I>responsibility [for abortion] lies with those
who have encouraged the spread of an attitude of sexual permissiveness
and a lack of esteem for motherhood, and with those who should
have ensured -- but did not -- effective family and social policies
in support of families.&quot;[11]
<P>
The Pope's teaching leaves ample room for inferring that a program
that undermines families and promotes sexual immorality as effectively
as our current welfare system does is equally responsible for
abortion as permissive abortion laws.  Those who countenance the
status quo in welfare countenance a system rife with abortion.
 And those who fight for welfare reform wage a war against abortion
that is no less morally valid than peaceful sit-ins, prayer vigils,
and reform of law.

<P>
Evelyn Hooker has been among the most influential figures in the
highly successful movement to convince the American people that
homosexuality is a &quot;normal variant&quot; of human sexual
behavior.  Her 1957 study, &quot;The Adjustment of the Male Overt
Homosexual&quot; (<I>Journal of Projective Techniques,</I> 1957,
21, 18-31) is the most frequently cited scientific source for
the argument that homosexuality is not a pathology, that homosexuals
are as free from mental disorder as heterosexuals.  
<P>
Such assertions have not only found their way into standard psychology
textbooks but have also provided a scientific basis for decisions
in major court cases involving the legality of state sodomy laws
and prohibitions against homosexual employment in certain state
and local agencies (e.g., schools, police departments).  Indeed,
when the American Psychiatric Association debated the issue of
homosexuality in 1973, Evelyn Hooker's work was Exhibit A for
those who wanted to remove homosexuality from the group's list
of mental disorders. 
<P>
For many commentators and activists, the Hooker study effectively
ended the debate over whether or not homosexuals were in any way
abnormal in their relationships with each other and with the community
at large.  Today many Americans have accepted the idea that homosexuality
is &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;healthy&quot; without realizing
that such an opinion is derived in large measure from a single
study -- one conducted by a UCLA professor whose previous laboratory
subjects had been rats.  
<P>
In all this extravagant homage to Hooker and her study, several
points have escaped her admirers, to say nothing of the federal
courts: 
<P>
1. In her 1957 report, Evelyn Hooker did not use a random sample
to test the stability of homosexuals, but allowed gay rights activists
to recruit those homosexuals most likely to illustrate her thesis
that homosexuality is not a pathology.  Individuals who proved
unstable were deleted from the final sample.
<P>
2. Hooker's published account of how she recruited heterosexual
subjects is not consistent with a more detailed later account.
<P>
3. Six subjects in her study, three from each group, had engaged
in both homosexual and heterosexual behavior beyond adolescence.
<P>
4. Hooker made several errors in her mathematical calculations
that raise doubts about her care and competence as a researcher.
<P>
5. Hooker did not attempt to prove that homosexuals were normal
in every way, nor does her study support the idea that homosexuals
as a group are just as stable as heterosexuals.
<P>
6. Hooker was relatively inexperienced in administering the Rorschach
test, and this inexperience may have led to mistakes in the administration
and evaluation of the Rorschach.
<P>
7. On the Thematic Apperception Test and the Make-A-Picture-Story
test -- which require subjects to make up fictional narratives
about depicted scenes -- the homosexuals could not refrain from
including homosexual fantasies in their imaginary accounts.  For
that reason, Hooker altered the nature of the study by no longer
asking the judges to use the TAT and MAPS in an attempt to determine
the sexual orientation of each of the 60 subjects, since the differences
were apparent from the narratives.
<P>
In order to understand fully the nature of the controversy over
Hooker's study, it is helpful to review its history.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>THE HISTORY OF THE HOOKER STUDY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Evelyn Hooker did not begin her research on homosexuals as a logical
development in her career as a psychologist or even out of a dispassionate
scientific curiosity. From all indications, she undertook the
study to prove that homosexuals could function as normal human
beings.  As she herself said, &quot;How could my hypothesis have
been anything else?  I'd seen these men and saw nothing psychopathological
in their behavior.&quot;[1]
<P>
&quot;These men&quot; were the many friends she'd made in the
Los Angeles homosexual community -- one of whom, Sam From, persuaded
her to undertake the investigation.  &quot;Now we have let you
see us as we are,&quot; he said to the UCLA professor.  &quot;It
is your scientific duty to do a study of people like us.&quot;[2]
 Despite the fact that she was a &quot;rat runner&quot; -- with
no clinical experience in the area of human behavior, she undertook
her study, which would become, along with the Kinsey report, a
prime weapon in the hands of the gay rights movement.
<P>
It is important to examine carefully the manner in which Hooker
planned and executed her research, which was funded by the federal
government's National Institute of Mental Health.  A number of
commentators have failed to read Hooker's own report carefully
or else have deliberately distorted her methods and findings for
their own purposes.  Here is just how she proceeded and what she
found.         
<P>
<CENTER><H3>SELECTION OF SUBJECTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
First, to find her homosexual subjects, she enlisted the early
gay rights group Mattachine Society, which, as she put it in her
published report, &quot;has as its stated purpose the development
of a homosexual ethic....&quot;[3] Members of the Mattachine Society
volunteered for the study and also recruited their friends.  Hooker,
herself, created a &quot;control group&quot; of heterosexuals
for the experiment, despite the fact that on the standardized
tests she intended to use, norms had already been established.
<P>
In her 1957 report, Hooker offers this somewhat cryptic explanation
of heterosexual recruitment:
<P>
Because the heterosexuals were, for the most part, obtained from
community organizations which must remain anonymous, I cannot
describe further the way in which they were obtained.[4]
<P>
Years later, a <I>Los Angeles Times</I> reporter elicited from
Hooker a somewhat different explanation, one that is fairly explicit
in detail:
<P>
She canvassed the education secretaries of labor unions, thinking
that they would have liberal attitudes.  &quot;I was wrong,&quot;
she says; as soon as she explained the nature of the study, no
one wanted to participate...So Hooker took to collaring candidates
wherever she could find them, including a fireman who showed up
to inspect her home.  &quot;No man is safe on Saltair Street,&quot;
joked her husband.[5] 
<P>
She did not insist on a random sampling.  In fact, she deliberately
sought out only those subjects who seemed stable and &quot;normal&quot;
-- at least in their ability to adjust to their social environment.
 She defined the criteria for membership in the groups as follows:
<P>
In both groups subjects were eliminated who were in therapy at
the time.  If, in the preliminary screening, evidence of considerable
disturbance appeared, the individual was eliminated (5 heterosexuals;
5 homosexuals).[6]
<P>
As for the sexual proclivities of the participants, Hooker says
the following in her report:
<P>
I attempted to secure homosexuals who would be pure for homosexuality;
that is, without heterosexual experience.  With three exceptions
this is so.  These three subjects had not had more than three
heterosexual experiences, and they identified themselves as homosexual
in their patterns of desire and behavior.  The heterosexual group
is exclusively heterosexual beyond the adolescent period, with
three exceptions; these three had had a single homosexual experience
each.[7]
<P>
Originally, she chose 40 homosexual subjects and matched them
as closely as possible by age, IQ, and education with 40 heterosexual
subjects.  At some point, as noted parenthetically above, she
found five from each group too unbalanced to include in her study,
so apparently she dropped these ten and their matches in the opposite
groups -- for a total of 20 eliminated.  This winnowing process
reduced the size of the total pool from 80 to 60.
<P>
It is instructive to read her summary of these matchings and then
compare that summary to the chart containing the same information.
<P>
The homosexuals, and thus the heterosexuals, ranged in age from
25 to 50, with an average age of 34.5 for the homosexual group
and 36.6 for the heterosexual group.  The IQ range, as measured
by the Otis Self-Administering Tests of Mental Ability, was from
90 to 135, with an average for the homosexual group of 115.4 and
for the heterosexual group of 116.2.  In education the range was
from completion of grammar school to the equivalent of a master's
degree, with an average for the homosexual group of 13.9 years
and for the heterosexual group of 14.3.[8]
<P>
Turning to the table upon which she lists the age, IQ scores,
and education of all 60 subjects, a careful reader finds that
the figures neatly arranged in columns <I>contradict her summary</I>.
 While she says the age range for all subjects is 25-50, the chart
indicates that the youngest subject is 26 and the oldest 57. 
The figures on the table indicate an average age of 35 for the
homosexuals and 37 for the heterosexuals -- different averages
than the ones Hooker gives.
<P>
In her summary, she says the range of IQ scores is 90-135, but
the lowest IQ score on her chart is 91.  Despite this error, however,
her averages for both homosexuals and heterosexuals are consistent
with the chart.
<P>
On average years of education, she gives as a range the completion
of grammar school to the equivalent of a masters degree.  Here
her summary is at best imprecise, since the least amount of education
is 9 years -- past the junior high level and three years beyond
elementary school.  The highest educational level indicated on
the chart is 18 years, which is a year beyond the course requirement
for most master's programs.  Also, her average education for homosexuals,
based on the chart, should be 14.0 rather than 13.9.
<P>
These mathematical discrepancies are minor but disturbing.  If
all the averages had been incorrect, a generous reader might have
concluded that somehow she had printed the wrong chart -- a single
careless error.  But given the accuracy of <I>some</I> of her
calculations, it seems more likely she made several careless errors.
 A footnote on the first page of the Hooker report suggests that
the materials were rushed into print -- that, though she hesitated
to publish her paper, &quot;[i]n view of the importance of her
findings it seemed desirable to the editors that they be made
public....&quot;[9]  (In other words, she was saying something that
well-placed members of the profession wanted to hear.)      
<P>
To be sure, these figures are largely irrelevant to the final
conclusions of her study.  The averages of ages, IQ scores, and
amount of education lend only marginal credibility to the selection
process.  Yet the inaccuracies tell us something important about
Hooker's reliability as a researcher, the degree to which we can
trust her methodology.  As noted below, Hooker scored the Rorschach
test herself, despite the fact that she had had little previous
experience in this area.  Add to this inexperience a lack of mathematical
precision, and the study begins to pose genuine problems. 
<P>
At this point, two observations are in order concerning Hooker's
overall method of selecting her subjects.  First, in choosing
a small sample that is anything but random, Hooker has declined
to test the proposition that homosexuals and heterosexuals in
society are equally likely to be normal, well-adjusted human beings.
 As she, herself, says in the report, she is only interested in
&quot;whether homosexuality is <I>necessarily</I> [emphasis added]
a symptom of pathology.&quot;  To answer that question, she maintains,
&quot;All we need is a single case in which the answer is negative.&quot;[10]
 In other words, in this study she is concerned with finding at
least one homosexual who, after testing, doesn't fall into the
category of &quot;pathological.&quot;  This is why she has focused
on the healthiest possible cohort.    
<P>
But the limited scope of her study cuts two ways.  Knowing the
nature of the sample, no one could reasonably conclude from her
findings that homosexuals as a group are no more likely to be
mentally disturbed than heterosexuals.  Yet this is precisely
what many have concluded.  If one accepts the study as valid and
definitive, one can only conclude that some homosexuals are not
pathological <I>in their dealings with the world at large.</I>
  As Hooker herself observes, there is no evidence to conclude
that homosexuals are not pathological in their sexual activities.
<P>
A second point to note about Hooker's selection process is her
ease in recruiting homosexual subjects and her difficulty in recruiting
heterosexual subjects.  Indeed, her account in the study report
is evasive; and her later recollections suggest that she may have
shaded the truth initially in order to cover up problems she encountered
in recruiting the control group.         
<P>
This question becomes more pressing when one reads that in her
group of 30 heterosexual men, she still must include three who
have had homosexual experiences <I>in their adult lives</I> --
by no means a &quot;pure&quot; sample -- and we don't know how
many more had had homosexual experiences in adolescence.  No one
-- not even Kinsey -- would call this an unambiguously heterosexual
group.
<P>
From Hooker's own report -- and from a follow-up interview in
later years -- we see that homosexuals were not only eager to
participate, but indeed were the instigators of the study.  They
hoped that it would prove they were &quot;normal&quot; human beings;
so they scoured their own community to find just the right volunteers
to prove her limited hypothesis.  When analyzing the results of
the Hooker study, it's very important to remember who instigated
the project and the fact that the subjects were well aware of
its ultimate goal.  (In light of this fact, the performance of
homosexuals on two of the three tests, as discussed below, may
well indicate that homosexuality generates social behavior that
is obsessive, indeed all but uncontrollable -- certainly one indication
of pathology.) 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>THE TESTING OF THE SUBJECTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
To prove her thesis, Hooker administered three standardized tests
to her 60 subjects -- the Rorschach Test, the Thematic Apperception
Test (TAT), and the Make-A-Picture-Story test (MAPS).  The Rorschach
test, as most people know, consists of a series of ink blots that
subjects are asked to interpret.  The Thematic Apperception Test
requires subjects to describe and make up stories about pictures
of people in various settings.  The MAPS test requires subjects
to arrange cut-out pictures and then make up a story about their
arrangement.   
<P>
Despite her lack of clinical experience in what is called &quot;projective
techniques,&quot; according to Hooker, she administered and scored
the Rorschach test herself.  After scoring the test and constructing
profiles, she placed the results in random order and passed them
along to two experts in Rorschach analysis.  Thus we have Hooker's
scored results analyzed by Drs. Klopfer and Meyer, with two tasks
in mind: first, to rate the subjects on &quot;overall adjustment&quot;
and second, to see if they could determine which were the homosexuals
and which were the heterosexuals.
<P>
On the task of determining overall adjustment (i.e., social stability),
the judges differed sharply in some respects but agreed in others.
 For example, Judge &quot;A&quot; rated 15 of the 60 as &quot;top&quot;
in stability, while Judge &quot;B&quot; rated only 4 as &quot;top.&quot;
 The other ratings revealed greater agreement. However, more homosexuals
than heterosexuals ranked in the two &quot;top&quot; groupings
and more heterosexuals than homosexuals ranked in the two &quot;bottom&quot;
groupings.
<P>
When assigned the task of choosing between the homosexual and
heterosexual subjects, Judge &quot;A&quot; correctly identified
17 of the 30 pairs and Judge &quot;B&quot; 18 of the 30.  An ideal
random selection would have identified 15 out of 30, though Hooker
is technically correct in saying that, in such a small sample,
the results indicate that &quot;neither judge was able to do better
than chance.&quot;[11]
<P>
Critics of Hooker's Rorschach results make at least two points.
 First, they question her ability to administer and score the
test.  As an animal researcher until the time she undertook this
project, she obviously had logged comparatively little experience
in administering Rorschachs, a delicate and highly complicated
task in which the clinician gently and obliquely elicits spontaneous
responses.  Some authorities in the field maintain that, under
ideal circumstances, a more qualified expert would have explored
many avenues Hooker failed to note and would have found out many
things Hooker missed -- including indications of the pathology
of the homosexuals.
<P>
A second criticism of her methodology is the lack of &quot;blindness&quot;
in the administration of the Rorschach.  Ideally, given the nature
of the results sought, the test should have been administered
under circumstances in which both interviewer and subject were
unaware of the purpose of the test.  In the case of the Hooker
study, both she and her subjects knew what she was striving to
prove -- and both she and the homosexuals had a vested interest
in proving the hypothesis that homosexuals were not necessarily
pathological.
<P>
Can Rorschach subjects tailor their answers to desired ends? 
Absolutely, say some Rorschach experts.  One example of such a
phenomenon in &quot;projective techniques&quot; is called the
&quot;Rosenthal Effect,&quot; in which a subject generates the
results he or she believes the researcher wants.  In this particular
case, both the researcher (Hooker) and her homosexual subjects
had a compelling reason to produce these results.
<P>
Perhaps the most significant implications of Hooker's study came
from the MAPS and TAT results, which were analyzed by a single
judge.  Here is Hooker's own account:
<P>
The problem of identifying the homosexual protocol from this
material was essentially a much easier one than that encountered
with the Rorschach, since few homosexuals failed to give open
[sic] homosexual stories on at least one picture.  The second
task given the Rorschach judges, of distinguishing the homosexual
from the heterosexual records when they were presented in matched
pairs, was therefore omitted.[12]
<P>
Note that the identity of the homosexuals was so obvious in these
tests that Hooker did not even ask the judge to distinguish between
homosexual and heterosexual.  Simply put, the homosexuals gave
themselves away on tests less dependent than the Rorschach on
the training and experience of the examiner.  Despite the fact
that they knew the purpose of this test was to prove their own
stability, normalcy, and lack of differentiation from heterosexuals,
they still did not refrain from indulging themselves in homosexual
fantasies, thereby exposing their sexual appetites.  It is difficult
not to conclude that in verbalizing such fantasies, they were
exhibiting the obsessive nature of homosexuality, the difficulty
of homosexuals to control their desire, even when their reputation
in the psychiatric community was at stake.
<P>
As one research analyst puts it:
<P>
So Hooker's study suggests that sexual fantasies among homosexuals
are irrepressible, so much so that such people cannot always see
ordinary situations and relations as devoid of sexual content,
but must, on occasion, interject sexual significance where it
does not exist or, at the very least, need not exist.  Following
the logical conclusions of this experiment, we are compelled to
conclude that there is something substantively different about
the way homosexuals and heterosexuals look at the world.[13]
<P>
In evaluating the MAPS and TAT results for stability, the single
judge assigned &quot;top&quot; scores to no one; 9 homosexuals
and 7 heterosexuals were rated &quot;next to top&quot;; 15 homosexuals
and 19 heterosexuals were ranked &quot;average&quot;; 6 homosexuals
and 3 heterosexuals were rated &quot;next to bottom&quot;; and
no homosexuals and 1 heterosexual were ranked at the &quot;bottom.&quot;
 (Again, critics say that the absence of &quot;blindness&quot;
raises the possibility that the Rosenthal Effect was again operative
in the evaluation process, since the judge knew what Hooker was
seeking.)
<P>
<CENTER><H3>SUMMARY OF RESULTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The remainder of her study is a highly selective summary of comments
by judges, all of which support her thesis that the two groups
are, in effect, indistinguishable in terms of &quot;overall adjustment.&quot;
 In her own evaluation of the results, Hooker -- aware of the
degree to which she is challenging leading authorities in the
field -- offers a set of &quot;admissions&quot; about the limitations
of her study.  In this section she concedes the possibility that
homosexuals are indeed pathological, a point overlooked by most
of her admirers.
<P><UL>
<LI>She speculates that the psychological defect of homosexuals
may lie &quot;in a weakness of ego-function and control and that
this cannot be adequately diagnosed from projective test protocols.
 As one psychiatrist puts it, the material produced in the Rorschach
is like that produced on the analytic couch.  Two men may produce
very similar material on the couch, but the difference between
them is that one -- the normal -- gets up at the end of the hour
and resumes his normal functioning, while the other does not.&quot;[14]
<P>
<LI>She also admits that the pathology of homosexuality may only
occur &quot;in an erotic situation and that the homosexual can
function well in non-erotic situations such as the Rorschach,
TAT, and MAPS.  Thus, one could defend the hypothesis that homosexuality
is symptomatic of pathology, but that the pathology is confined
to one sector of behavior, namely, the sexual.&quot;[15] (She seems
to have disproved this proposition by her own study, since the
homosexuals were unable to control their sexual fantasies, even
in a &quot;non-erotic situation&quot; such as taking the MAPS
and TAT.)
<P>
<LI>During Hooker's research, she took the life histories of her
subjects; and though she didn't include an analysis of these materials
in her study, she did indicate that when she eventually published
her results, &quot;the life history data from the two groups will
differ:  namely, in the love relationships.  Comparisons between
the number and duration of love relationships, cruising patterns,
and degree of satisfaction with sexual pattern and the love partner
will certainly show clear-cut differences.&quot;[16]
</UL>
Hooker never published the summary of these histories, though
in a fairly recent interview with writer-researcher Edward Eichel,
she said she still hoped to do so after 35 years.  However, she
undoubtedly found in these personal histories what most other
researchers have found:  a substantially greater number of sexual
partners among homosexuals than heterosexuals and a significantly
shorter duration in relationships.  These findings, if published,
could well have cast further doubts on the stability and normalcy
of homosexuals.
<P>
It is significant to note that Hooker's stated reservations seldom,
if ever, find their way into the summaries of her work -- summaries
that are now <I>de rigeur</I> in legal and scholarly discussions
of homosexuality.  Her 1957 report has, like a folk tale, become
simpler and purer in the constant retelling.  Instead of a complicated
account filled with the predictable complexity of life, we now
have only Beauty and the Beast.     
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CITATIONS AND  USES OF THE HOOKER STUDY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Perhaps as important as the Hooker 1957 research itself is the
use that others have made of her findings.  Not only has this
single study with only 60 subjects been cited repeatedly by prominent
psychiatrists, social critics, and gay activists; but such summaries
have also been accepted as part of the expert testimony in high-profile
court cases nationwide.
<P>
Curiously, many of those who cite the study not only incorrectly
summarize its content but do so in remarkably similar fashion.
 It's as if one commentator misread Hooker and all the rest derived
their knowledge from that single erroneous commentary.  Here are
several examples:     
<P><UL>
<LI>In the <I>Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry</I>, Dr. Judd
Marmor, a driving force in the American Psychiatric Association's
decision to drop homosexuality from its manual of disorders, has
written this summary of Hooker's research: &quot;Hooker (1957)
conducted a cooperative study of 30 male homosexuals and 30 male
heterosexuals who were matched for age, I.Q., and education. 
The homosexuals were all rated 6 and the heterosexuals 0 on the
Kinsey scale.  None of the subjects was in therapy.  Two judges
independently, without prior knowledge of which subjects were
which, reviewed the Rorschach protocols, Thematic Apperception
Tests, and Make-a-Picture-Story responses, and tried to distinguish
the homosexuals from the heterosexuals, but they were unable to
do so.&quot;[17]
<P><UL>
<LI>Marmor repeated this very passage when he submitted an affidavit
in <I>Morales v. Texas</I>, a case heard before a state court
in Texas.
<P>
<LI>Dr. Gregory Herek supported Marmor's testimony in <I>Morales
v. Texas</I>, saying under oath: &quot;The classic study in this
case was conducted by Hooker (1957).  She administered the Rorschach,
Thematic Apperception Test, and Make-A-Picture-Story Test...When
asked to assess which protocols were obtained from homosexuals,
the experts were unable to distinguish respondents' sexual orientation
at a level better than chance.&quot;[18]
<P>
<LI>In a 1990 article on Hooker, <I>Los Angeles Times</I> reporter
Bruce Shenitz described the experiment in precisely the same way:
 &quot;On all three tests, two-thirds of the heterosexuals and
homosexuals were assigned a rating of 3 (average) or better. 
Next, the judges were presented with pairs of tests and asked
to distinguish between heterosexuals and homosexual.  They were
able to do so no more accurately than if they were flipping a
coin.&quot;[19]
</UL></UL>
This striking agreement among scientific experts and the working
press is remarkable, especially when one realizes that all of
these accounts <I>are untrue</I>.  Marmor's version is particularly
faulty.  Indeed, the brief passage quoted above contains five
demonstrable errors of fact.
<P>
1.  &quot;The homosexuals were all rated 6 and the heterosexuals
0 on the Kinsey scale.&quot;  In the first place, in her report
Hooker makes no reference whatsoever to the Kinsey scale.  In
the second place, she gives evidence in her narrative to contradict
Marmor's generalization.  Three heterosexuals reported homosexual
contact after adolescence and three homosexuals reported heterosexual
behavior.  Kinsey described his &quot;0&quot; rating as &quot;[e]xclusively
heterosexual with no homosexual&quot; and his &quot;6&quot; rating
as &quot;[e]xclusively homosexual.&quot;
<P>
2. There were three judges involved rather than two, as Marmor
reports.
<P>
3. Dr. Marmor reports that the judges reviewed all three tests
when, in fact, two judges reviewed the Rorschach and one judge
reviewed the MAPS and TAT.
<P>
4. Dr. Marmor states that the judges reviewed the MAPS and the
TAT, as well as the Rorschach, in an attempt to distinguish between
heterosexual and homosexual subjects when, in fact, no judge was
asked to make this distinction for the MAPS and TAT because Hooker
knew the homosexuals had &quot;outed&quot; themselves.  
<P>
5. Contrary to what Marmor states, the MAPS and TAT did indeed
reveal the sexual orientation of the homosexuals.  
<P>
Both Herek and Shenitz make some of the same errors Marmor makes.
<P>
1. They suggest that more than one judge reviewed all test results.
<P>
2. They also state that after looking at the results of all three
tests, the &quot;experts&quot; or &quot;judges&quot; were unable
to distinguish between homosexual and heterosexual subjects.
<P>
Shenitz is no more than a newspaper reporter, but in <I>Morales
v. Texas</I>, Marmor and Herek were testifying as expert scientific
witnesses before a judge -- Marmor as former president of the
American Psychiatric Association.  It is ironic that while the
Morales judge accepted the testimony of Marmor and Herek without
question, he ignored the research of Paul Cameron, who gives a
careful and precise summary of the Hooker study in his volume
<I>The Gay Nineties: What the Empirical Evidence Reveals About
Homosexuality</I>.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
This unquestioning acceptance of &quot;authorities&quot; on the
basis of professional reputation or political correctness threatens
the integrity of our legal system.  Judges must take greater responsibility
for assessing the soundness and accuracy of testimony by so-called
experts; yet, paradoxically, such a task is manifestly beyond
the competence of the court.  This dilemma is the consequence
of the politicizing of the scientific community over the past
several decades, particularly in questions of sexuality.  The
recent exposure of Kinsey's errors indicates just how long researchers
have been careless or deliberately misleading in approaching sexual
questions.  And the widespread acclamation of recent, flawed studies
&quot;proving&quot; that homosexuality is inherited genetically
is evidence that the problem has only worsened over the years.

<P>
The 1995 federal appropriation bills which were approved by the
last Congress are filled with duplication, political favoritism,
social agendas, and questionable grants.  The alarming misuse
of taxpayer money should encourage citizens to demand more accountability.
<P>
Consider some government spending already approved for 1995:
<P>
<UL><LI> The Corporation for Public Broadcasting may pay a single individual
$438,000 for a once-a-week, 30-minute TV appearance.[1]
<P>
<LI>Federally financed Howard University gets $5.5 million to prepare
practicing attorneys to do pro bono work in Washington, DC.
<P>
<LI>NIH will spend $2.5 million to build playgrounds for monkeys.
<P>
<LI>DOT will spend $400,000 to help Russians build roads.
<P>
<LI>The Pentagon will spend $18 million for new homes at an Army
base that is losing one third of its existing personnel.
<P>
<LI>The State Department will give Russians $15 million for &quot;family
planning.&quot;
<P>
<LI>The State Department will spend $750,000 to study tropical bird
migration.
<P>
<LI>The EPA will spend $250,000 to control zebra mussels in the
City of Chicago.
<P>
<LI>The EPA will spend $70,000 to study a European fish in Lake
Superior.
<P>
<LI>HUD will spend $53 million for a sewage plant in Mexico.
<P>
<LI>The Forest Service will spend $635,000 to build a visitor center
on a remote and inaccessible by road peninsula on Alaska's panhandle.
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>DETAILS FROM 13 APPROPRIATION BILLS</h3></CENTER>
<P>
<B>1. Foreign aid in non-foreign bills</B>:  The appropriations
bill for &quot;The ForeignOperations, Export Financing, and Related Programs for the Fiscal
Year Ending September 30, 1995&quot; includes funding for most
foreign aid programs.  Foreign aid, however, can be found in other
bills.  
<P><UL>
<LI>The Federal Highway Administration was given $400,000 to provide
technical assistance to Russia.[2] 
<P>
<LI>The Department for Housing and Urban Development (HUD) was given
$52.5 million to finance the construction of a waste treatment
plant in Tijuana, Mexico.[3]  HUD is funding a second wastewater
facility near Micicali, Mexico for $47.5 million.[4] (Congress also
appropriated $1 million through the International Boundary and
Water Commission to reimburse the City of San Diego for treatment
of Tijuana sewage.[5]) 
<P>
<LI>Funding for the Smithsonian Institution includes a $50,000 grant
to the Mpala Center, Kenya for facility and equipment purchases.[6]
</UL>
<B>2. Suspect foreign aid</B>.  
<P><UL>
<LI>The State Department will provide $15 million for &quot;family
planning&quot; to Russia in 1995.[7]
<P>
<LI>It will give $50 million to the United Nation Population Fund
(UNPF) with the intention that none of this money will be used
to fund abortions in China.[8] The UNPF is expected to give $7 million
for &quot;voluntary family planning programs&quot; in China.[9]
<P>
<LI>The State Department will grant $750,000 to the Fish and Wildlife
Foundation to study neotropical migratory bird conservation.[10]
</UL>
<B>3. Duplication of programs</B>.  Our government should
look to eliminate redundancy.  Consider:
<P><UL>
<LI>The Treasury Department's plan to build a training facility
near Tuscon, Arizona.  There will be a dormitory, a dining facility
and $2.9 million in firearm ranges.[11] Just outside of Tuscon is
the Army's Fort Huachuca, which has many modern firearm ranges.
 Treasury should arrange with the Army to use existing ranges
rather than building duplicate firing facilities.  After all,
the FBI Academy's entire campus is located on Quantico Marine
Base in Virginia where it has joint use of all ranges.
<P>
<LI>The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) was appropriated
$175,000 for a special purpose grant to be given to Domestic Violence
Prevention, Inc. in Bowie County, Texas.[12] Why is housing money
used for this project when the 1994 crime bill authorizes $324
million for the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act?[13]
The crime bill also has $10 million for nonprofit organizations
to establish projects that coordinate intervention and prevention
of domestic violence, and authorizes $30 million for rural domestic
violence and child abuse enforcement.
<P>
<LI>The Department of Interior received $800,000 to monitor salmon
on Alaska's Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers.[14] The National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will spend another $700,000
to collect information on salmon in the Yukon River as well.[15]
NOAA collects information on salmon at other locations as well.
<P>
<LI>The Small Business Administration is directed to grant $3.25
million for three incubator facilities.[16]
<P>
<LI>The Justice Department is appropriated $29 million for &quot;Drug
Courts&quot; which is a program that provides drug treatment during
and after incarceration for non-violent offenders.[17] This replicates
ongoing programs both inside prisons and in many communities.
<P>
<LI>The National Science Foundation was appropriated $2 million
to establish in 1995 an interdisciplinary center to support research
on violence.[18] The 1994 crime bill authorizes many programs to
research violence:[19]
<P><UL>
<LI>Title IV-Violence Against Women Act of 1994 requires the Attorney
General to study campus sexual assaults, the &quot;battered women's
syndrome,&quot; the abusive spouse, and domestic violence.[20]
<P>
<LI>Title III-Crime Prevention includes research grants to investigate
juvenile violence, drug use, and gang violence.[21]
<P>
<LI>Virtually every section of the crime bill requires at least
one federal agency to either study or research special aspects
of violence.[22]
</UL><P>
<LI>HUD will award housing money for six substance abuse programs
and eight crime prevention programs.[23] The 1994 crime bill includes
duplicate grant programs.
<P>
<LI>Congress has already appropriated $20.4 million for federal
support of the 1995 Special Olympics in New Haven, Connecticut
and both the XXVI Olympiad and the X Paralympiad in Atlanta in
1996.[24] The GSA and HUD will contribute $3 million to the X Paralympiad.
 (The Paralympiad was established in 1960 to create awareness
of athletes with physical disabilities.)  The X Paralympiad will
take place in Atlanta August 16-17, just after the Olympic Games.
 Some 4,000 athletes representing 110 countries are expected to
participate.  HUD's contribution goes to assist disabled veterans
to participate.
<P>
<LI>Congress appropriated $5.6 million for the taxpayer funded District
of Columbia School of Law ignoring Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly's
recommendation to close the school.  Two of the best law schools
in the nation are in Washington, D.C. - Georgetown University
and American University and another is in nearby Baltimore.  Additionally,
the appropriation bill lists the other reasons to close the school:
it must dramatically expand its library before it can earn full
accreditation; it must increase faculty salaries and other staff
and student services; and the school needs a permanent facility
of at least 125,000 square feet.[25]
</UL>
<B>4. Spending to remember former Congressional Leaders.</B>
<P><UL>
<LI>The National Historical Publications and Records Commission
is giving $2 million to the Thomas P. &quot;Tip&quot; O'Neill,
Jr. Library at Boston College.[26] The money will be used to organize
Mr. O'Neill's personal papers.  
<P>
<LI>Two million dollars was also granted to the Robert H. and Corinne
W. Michel Congressional Education Fund.[27]  Michel was for many years
the House minority leader.  
<P>
<LI>The Merit Systems Protection Board granted $10 million to the
Morris K. Udall Scholarship and Excellence in National Environmental
Policy Foundation.[28] Udall was a liberal congressman and environmentalist
from Arizona.
</UL>
<B>5. Other questionable expenditures.</B>  
<P><UL>
<LI>The Army recently announced that the 1st Infantry Division headquartered
at Fort Riley, Kansas will be removed from the force.  This means
approximately 5,600 soldiers or a third of the post's population
will leave.  Meanwhile, Congress has appropriated $12.6 million
to build 126 new homes at Fort Riley.[29]
<P>
<LI>The 6th Infantry Division headquartered at Fort Wainwright,
Alaska was deactivated in July, 1994.  Cuts in the Army's presence
in Alaska will be felt at both Fort Wainwright and Fort Richardson
which is near Anchorage.  Yet, Congress appropriated $5 million
to build 72 new homes at Fort Richardson and $66 million to replace
the nearby and jointly used Elmendorf Air Force Base hospital.[30]
<P>
<LI>The Department of Agriculture's Forest Service will spend $635,000
to build a visitor center at Ketchikan, Alaska.  Ketchikan is
located on a remote peninsula reachable only by boat and small
plane.  Ketchikan county has a population of 14,000 inhabitants
scattered among numerous small villages.  The Department also
gave $500,000 to Alaska because &quot;many timber mills have closed.&quot;[31]
<P>
<LI>The National Institutes of Health, National Center for Research
Resources, was directed by the conference committee to reserve
$2.5 million for playgrounds for monkeys used in research.[32]
<P>
<LI>The federal government helps to fund Washington, D.C.'s Howard
University.  Part of the University's 1995 appropriations ($5.5
million) are for the creation of a Law School Clinical Center
to provide legal assistance to supplement the Legal Services Corporation
and to conduct training for practicing attorneys to perform pro
bono (free) services.[33]
</UL>
<B>6. Did you know?</B>  Here are some of the various
and sundry federal spending programs.
<P><UL>
<LI>$46 million to build and operate military child development
centers, including one in Germany and one in Great Britain.[34] These
federally subsidized centers are part of a growing network of
child care facilities that include every military activity worldwide.
<P>
<LI>$45 million will be spent by the Library of Congress for books
for blind and physically handicapped people.[35]
<P>
<LI>The Department of Transportation will give $26 million for employee
bonuses and cash awards.[36]
<P>
<LI>$2.7 million to the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation.[37]
 This 34 person organization oversees construction projects along
Washington's Pennsylvania Avenue.
<P>
<LI>$27 million annual operating expenses for the U.S. Holocaust
Memorial Council, which is a private organization that oversees
the Holocaust Museum.[38] This relatively small but popular museum
was first opened to the public two years ago.  It was built with
$168 million in private donations raised in just four years.[39]
The Council continues to receive donations from many national
and local organizations.
<P>
<LI>Child Nutrition Programs include $500,000 in state grants for
special dietary needs of children with disabilities.[40]
<P>
<LI>$7 million for the private organization American Printing House
for the Blind.[41]
<P>
<LI>The State Department oversees a $533 million United Nations
peacekeeping appropriation.  This money can be spent with one
stipulation: that American manufacturers and suppliers are given
an &quot;equal&quot; opportunity to provide equipment, services,
and materials to the United Nations peacekeepers.[42] The Senate
amended this appropriation to transfer $350 million to unspecified
&quot;International Organizations&quot; for peacekeeping activities.[43]
<P>
<LI>HUD will grant the City of Chicago $250,000 to control zebra
mussels which originally came from the Black Sea area of Europe.[44]
 The Department of Interior will continue to study zebra mussels
at St. Croix, Virgin Islands.[45] The National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration was appropriated $3.7 million to research zebra
mussels.[46] If the zebra mussel is truly endangering our oceans
and lakes, then a more focused effort should be undertaken.
</UL>
<B>7. Legislating inside appropriation bills.</B>  Five
appropriation bills contain social legislation.  
<P><UL>
<LI>The Architect of the Capitol is directed to hire a &quot;diverse
labor force.&quot;[47] This means hiring quotas.
<P>
<LI>The National Science Foundation is directed to award at least
20 percent of all grants to small colleges and universities that
consist of &quot;predominantly underrepresented groups&quot; in
science and technology.[48]
<P>
<LI>When hiring investigators the John F. Kennedy Assassination
Records Review Board is directed to give preferential treatment
to former Office of Personnel Management employees.[49]
<P>
<LI>The Office of Personnel Management is encouraged to promote
&quot;diversity.&quot;  OPM's definition of &quot;diversity&quot;
includes people of different sexual orientation.[50]
<P>
<LI>The appropriation bill for the Department of Agriculture deletes
Senate language aimed at ending the use of taxpayer funds to promote
homosexuality.[51]
<P>
<LI>Health and Human Services is directed to increase quotas for
black nurses nationally.[52]
<P>
<LI>The Federal Bureau of Investigation was appropriated funds to
restore special agents &quot;eliminated in prior years associated
with background investigations.&quot;[53] A former marker for elimination
based on a background investigation was identifying the candidate
as a homosexual.  The FBI Academy has started training for homosexuals
previously rejected.
</UL>
<B>8. Please explain these appropriations.</B>  Many programs
are funded without adequate explanation.  
<P><UL>
<LI>The Department of Education is awarding $4 million to the Mary
McLeod Bethune Memorial Fine Arts Center on the campus of Bethune
Cookman College in Daytona Beach, Florida.[54] The facility will
allow students to be trained for the fields of entertainment and
hotel management.[55]
<P>
<LI>The U.S. Institute of Peace gets $11.5 million.[56] The ten year
old institute has received $76 million in federal grants.  In
1991 it shifted from discussing peace to teaching conflict resolution
in America's classrooms.  There are more than 300 violence-prevention
programs and 100 conflict resolution curricula available to America's
28,000 high schools and 78,000 grade schools.[57] The 1994 crime
bill contains many grants for anti-violence programs.  
<P>
<LI>The Bureau of Mines is directed to do &quot;essential Arctic
research&quot; in Anchorage, Alaska.[58]  Anchorage is 400 miles south
of the Arctic Circle and has no arctic characteristics like permafrost.
 Why not conduct the research nearer the Arctic Circle, perhaps
at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks?
<P>
<LI>The National Telecommunications and Information Administration
is appropriated $1.5 million for the Pan-Pacific Educational and
Cultural Experiments by Satellite Program.[59]
<P>
<LI>Washington, D.C. received $720 million from the federal government
for public education.  The appropriation bill states, &quot;the
Board of Education has overspent its appropriation for personal
services by millions of dollars while underspending its appropriation
for other-than-personal-services by an equal amount.  The chronic
recurrence of such an imbalance suggests that the Board of Education
habitually submits budgets to the Congress that the Board knows
to be unrealistic and that the Board intends to disregard.&quot;[60]
<P>
<LI>The Department of Housing and Urban Development will award 261
special purpose grants worth $291 million.[61] These include:
<P><UL>
<LI>$450,000 to construct the Center for Political Participation
at the University of Maryland.[62] The Center &quot;is the first
academically-sanctioned program in the country to support young
leaders seeking elective office.&quot;[63] The advisory board includes
actress Morgan Fairchild, Congressman Steny Hoyer, Congresswoman
Connie Morella, <I>ABC News'</I> Sheila Kast, and the wife of
Maryland governor Parris Glendening.[64]
<P>
<LI>$500,000 to the Maine College of Art for renovations to a Portland
building.[65]
<P>
<LI>$1 million to develop the Center for Pacific Rim Studies in
San Francisco.[66] The Center will do research on competition and
offer training for professionals.  It is focused on trade development,
including foreign language and culture, legal systems, commercial
practices and data links.[67]
<P>
<LI>$6.5 million for the Points of Light Foundation.[68] The <I>Los
Angeles Times</I> found that the Foundation in its first four
years spent $22 million on administrative expenses and $4 million
on grants to service organizations.  Expenses included $1.4 million
for a kickoff celebration and more than $108,000 paid to the Hill
and Knowlton public relations firm to promote the party, as well
as a $160,000 salary for its top executive.  In the first four
years, it received $26 million from the government.[69]
<P>
<LI>$500,000 for the National Invention Resource Center in the
City of Akron, Ohio.[70] The Center is part of the nonprofit Inventure
Place which opens July, 1995.
<P>
<LI>$70,000 to study the European Ruffe in Lake Superior.[71] The
Ruffe was introduced in 1986 to Duluth Harbor which is on Lake
Superior.  The Ruffe now makes up 65 percent of the harbor's fish
population.  Why is federal housing money being used to study
the spread of this fish?  Possibly some of the $450,000 appropriated
for the Great Lakes Fishery Commission could be used to study
the Ruffe.[72]
<P>
<LI>$750,000 for a center to coordinate academic training for physical
therapists at the Veterans' Administration hospitals in Brooklyn,
NY.[73]
<P>
<LI>$2.5 million for Project Social Care MB, Inc. to serve elderly
Holocaust survivors in Brooklyn, NY.[74] There are about 2,000 Holocaust
survivors in the greater New York metro area.  Another organization,
Selfhelp Community Services, has a $51 million annual budget and
has the prime focus on helping survivors.[75]
<P>
<LI>$250,000 for port modernization at Davisville, Rhode Island.[76]
<P>
<LI>$300,000 to expand the science and mathematics complex at the
University of South Carolina.[77]
<P>
<LI>$1.2 million for the Fire Safe Cigarette Act.[78] These funds
go to the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the National
Institute of Standards and Technology to measure the cigarette's
ignition propensity.[79]
<P>
<LI>HUD special purpose grants also fund: 5 child care centers,
the restoration of 5 theaters/museums, restoring or building 5
libraries, running a summer camp program, and building a bicentennial
and media activities center for a city.[80]
</UL></UL>
<B>9. AIDS money scattered among bills.</B>  Most AIDS
money is found in the appropriations for HHS, but AIDS money is
in other bills as well.
<P><UL>
<LI>The Department of Agriculture will grant Indiana $250,000 to
study HIV/STD prevention in rural areas.[81]
<P>
<LI>The Pentagon is being given $33 million to study AIDS.[82]
<P>
<LI>HUD is appropriated $186 million for housing people with AIDS.[83]
 HUD also is awarding special purpose grants worth $4.3 million
for other HIV housing facilities.[84]
</UL>
<B>10. Politics and agriculture appropriations.</B>  The
1995 agriculture appropriations appear to be based more on politics
than merit.  The top three states to receive agriculture grants
earmarked by state were Arkansas, Iowa and Mississippi.[85] Arkansas
received $17.7 million, Iowa received $11.9 million, and Mississippi
received $10.45 million.
<P>
Senators from these states were on the conference committee for
appropriations.  Additionally, President Clinton is from Arkansas
and former Secretary of Agriculture Mike Epsy is from Mississippi.
<P>
The U.S. Department of Commerce reports that the highest net farm
income for 1991 came from California which ranked seventh in discretionary
agriculture grants.  Mississippi ranked 21 in net income and Arkansas
was ninth.[86] But Arkansas received almost 300 percent more discretionary
grant money than California, the highest farm income state.  Arkansas
grants included:
<P><UL>
<LI>$462,000 for a National Center for Agricultural Law Research
and Information at the Leflar School of Law in Fayetteville, Arkansas.[87]
<P>
<LI>$1.2 million for a new agriculture building and $946,000 for
an Alternative Pest Control Center at the University of Arkansas.[88]
<P>
<LI>$4.8 million for the Rice Germplasm Center, Stuttgard, Arkansas.[89]
<P>
<LI>$1.1 million for the Arkansas Children's Hospital.[90]
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Taxpayers should demand that the 104th Congress review and rescind
appropriations that waste money or promote a political agenda.

<P>
Thirty years ago this March, Daniel Patrick Moynihan issued his
famous warning about the breakdown of the black family.  At the
time, liberal intellectuals and civil rights activists excoriated
him for &quot;defending middle-class values.&quot;  &quot;What
may seem to be a disease to the white middle class may be a healthy
adaptation to the Negro lower class,&quot;[1] Bayard Rustin intoned.
<P>
Today, however, overwhelming empirical evidence demonstrates that
there is nothing at all &quot;healthy&quot; about the decay of
families and that not all personal choices are equal in terms
of their impact on children, families, and communities.  The evidence
itself has propelled illegitimacy to the forefront of the current
national debate over welfare reform.
<P>
While a burgeoning white illegitimacy rate has helped strip the
debate of racial overtones, a black Democrat named Wayne Bryant
has pioneered in the state of New Jersey one of the key anti-illegitimacy
provisions recently adopted by the U.S. House.  The so-called
&quot;family cap&quot; would deny benefit increases to mothers
who bear additional illegitimate children while on welfare.
<P>
The essential purpose of the reform, according to Bryant, is to
restore healthy families.  &quot;Until the needs and the problems
of the family are confronted in a comprehensive way, welfare will
continue its course of entrapping one generation after the next
in a modern form of slavery,&quot;[2] he wrote in a paper describing
his proposal.
<P>
By incorporating the family cap, Senator Bryant intended, not
to constrict reproductive choices or to reduce births per se,
but to promote a sense of responsibility by insisting that families
on welfare live by the same values and confront exactly the same
choices as the general population.  He explained the rationale
for the cap in a series of newspaper interviews:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
These welfare reform measures are not so much about capping family
size as they are about giving recipients a chance to make choices.
 Under our conventional welfare system, 
welfare mothers are effectively shielded from confronting the
difficult questions that other American parents face when considering
additional children.... I never pretended or intended to have
the law bring about a dramatic increase in births.  It was a responsibility
issue.... Why should people on welfare be guaranteed a 'raise'
when they have additional children?  If a person wants to enlarge
their family while on welfare, they should go to work to support
the additional children like any other working family....No one
is saying welfare mothers can't have families.  We're just saying
the state won't pay for it....If the kids are suffering because
parents are irresponsible in having children they cannot afford,
they'll still suffer if we give them the money because the parents
will still be irresponsible....The battle is dissolving the wall
that separates welfare families from the mainstream population
-- and the cap is an important part of that effort.[3]
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Echoing Senator Bryant's most popular argument, California's welfare
commissioner Eloise Anderson is even more blunt: &quot;Working
women do not get automatic raises when they have children.  Why
should our expectations of a woman on AFDC be any different than
any other woman?  Do we think they're stupider or less capable
of being rational?&quot;[4] New Jersey's human services commissioner,
William Waldman, agrees: &quot;A lot of what we do [in the name
of welfare] is very patronizing.&quot;[5]
<P>
Since the family cap took effect in New Jersey in August of 1993,
the birth rate among welfare mothers in the state has dropped
substantially -- powerful proof that women on welfare are indeed
capable of governing their own decisions.  Robert Rector of the
Heritage Foundation estimates a decrease greater than 20 percent;[6]
but like Wayne Bryant, he too emphasizes that even if the birthrate
had not fallen the policy would be justified.  &quot;I support
the family cap simply because it's morally correct,&quot;[7] Rector
says.
<P>
Even the more conservative estimate of the birthrate decrease
reported by the New Jersey Department of Human Services (11.4
percent)[8] vindicates the two fundamental principles underlying
the current national debate: that economic incentives do influence
out-of-wedlock childbearing and that subsidizing irresponsible
sexual behavior has accelerated the moral and cultural decline
beyond what even Moynihan envisioned.
<P>
While Charles Murray notes that much of the force of noneconomic
social stigma was underwritten by economics in the past, he argues
that contemporary &quot;[w]elfare will not be abolished [despite
the potential economic savings to communities] until the moral
sanctions against illegitimacy have also gained great strength.&quot;[9]
 The seeming paradox highlights the difficulty of defining precisely
how government can promote character formation.
<P>
James Q. Wilson answers that &quot;[t]he essential first step
is to acknowledge that at root, in almost every area of important
public concern, we are seeking to induce persons to act virtuously&quot;[10]
-- a statement that has grown less controversial in the 30 years
since the Moynihan Report met with violent protest from moral
relativists who denied the existence of an absolute standard of
virtue.  Today, there is a mounting public consensus that bearing
children out of wedlock is wrong and that the perverse incentives
of the welfare system share much of the blame.
<P>
In a continuation of the same passage, Professor Wilson explains
the moral implications of economic incentives: &quot;Virtue is
not learned by precept...; it is learned by the regular repetition
of right actions.... Seen this way, there is no conflict between
economic thought and moral philosophy: The latter simply supplies
a fuller statement of the uses to which the former can and should
be put.  We...induce habits of right conduct...by arranging the
incentives confronting youngsters in the ordinary aspects of their
daily lives so that right action routinely occurs.&quot;[11]
<P>
Yet, morality is not merely a product of rational choices in response
to economic incentives.  If man is more than a material being,
then it is not unreasonable to expect some individual moral decisions
to override the economic incentives that run against the grain
of virtue.  Nor is it implausible to suggest that, of all the
choices an individual mother must make, the decision to abort
her child -- the most galvanizing moral issue of our day -- is
the one least likely to respond to policy variables.  
<P>
Precisely because human behavior is governed by a unique complex
of moral instinct and rational choice, the elimination of additional
cash benefits in New Jersey has decreased the birthrate without
causing an upsurge in the abortion rate.  While it is far too
premature to draw any decisive conclusions, there is absolutely
no statistical confirmation as of yet that an increase in abortions
has occurred since the New Jersey family cap took effect August
1, 1993.In fact, the total number of Medicaid-funded abortions in New Jersey
declined from 13,629 in 1993 to 13,424 in 1994.[12]
<P>
In fact, Anita Leone, executive director of an association that
represents all the publicly-funded abortion clinics in New Jersey,
asserted in a recent interview: &quot;We know that abortions in
New Jersey are currently <I>decreasing</I>.  We just don't know
why.&quot;[13] Because the decline in the birth rate among welfare
mothers in New Jersey has been rather substantial since the implementation
of the family cap, the fact that an increase in abortions is not
evident is particularly significant.
<P>
The anecdotal evidence collected by those who are on the front-lines
of welfare reform in New Jersey confirms the general pattern that
is beginning to emerge from the data.  Richard Traynor of the
Legal Center for Defense of Life in New Jersey and David Sciarra
of New Jersey Legal Services, who together filed a class-action
suit over the New Jersey family cap, both commented in telephone
interviews that the class was certified to include welfare mothers
who had aborted their babies -- but that neither one could locate
a woman who had actually aborted in the wake of the cap.
<P>
Instead, the only plaintiffs who mention abortion in their affidavits
explain that they consciously decided on moral grounds <I>not</I>
to terminate their pregnancies, despite increased economic pressures.
One woman testified that she made an appointment at an abortion
clinic but ultimately &quot;became very upset about having an
abortion and decided that [she] could not go through with it.&quot;
 Another woman who already had two children and was carrying triplets
-- three times the pressure -- never even considered abortion.[14]
<P>
Women interviewed at Chelton Terrace in New Jersey said &quot;they
didn't see the cap forcing women into abortion clinics.  'It's
not going to make them get any more abortions than what they've
been getting,' one woman said.  'If you want to have that baby,
you will.'&quot;[15] Another woman in Camden, New Jersey said that
she knew about the cap but decided to have her baby anyway.  &quot;Abortion
is against my faith,&quot;[16] she explained.
<P>
A church pastor in the same town related a telling story.  A young
welfare mother had come to the church grieving over a miscarriage.
 Another pastor gently reminded her that she really had no way
of providing for a second child and that the state would not increase
her grant.  &quot;But it just didn't make sense to her,&quot;[17]
the pastor concluded, because mothers do not tend to subject their
relationships with their children to a strict cost-benefit analysis.
 Only the most callous of mothers places a price tag on her baby's
head.
<P>
One welfare mother recently quoted in <i>The New York Times</i>
said it perhaps most eloquently: &quot;[My fourth child] wasn't
planned, but I wasn't going to abort her.  Sixty-four dollars
is not going to change my love for my child, and if I would have
aborted her, it wouldn't have comforted my soul.... You just learn
that a pound of ground beef is overrated.&quot;[18]
<P>
Michelle Scholz of the Northwest Pregnancy Center in Washington,
D.C. explains that in her experience a mother decides first whether
or not to keep her baby and, then, how to pay for the child's
care.[19] Sister Connie Driscoll, founder of St. Martin de Porres
House of Hope in Chicago, testifies that over 9,000 destitute
women have passed through her shelter in the last 12 years.  Not
one of those women has opted for an abortion.[20]
<P>
The decision to abort, the evidence suggests, is uniquely invulnerable
to rational economic incentives.  And welfare mothers are apparently
more inclined to consider &quot;non-rational&quot; factors than
any other population group.  Public opinion data collected by
the Family Research Council suggest that abortion is even more
morally repugnant to poor women;[21] and the fact that abortion rates
for teen welfare mothers are <i>lower</i> than national averages
for all teenage girls is a powerful indication that non-economic
factors determine the decision to carry a child to term.[22]
<P>
Many who now argue otherwise are precisely the ones who maintain
that the current benefits level is already far too low to cover
the costs associated with a new baby.  If so, it is illogical
to predict that a cap would have a sufficiently significant impact
on the &quot;affordability&quot; of another child to trigger such
a drastic measure as abortion.
<P>
State-by-state data from the 1980s demonstrate that small changes
in welfare payouts do not affect abortion rates in the short term;
and Michael Schwartz of Life Advocacy Alliance has found in analyzing
more recent data that states with the highest average monthly
benefit for a family of three also tend to have the highest ratio
of abortions to live births.[23]
<P>
Not surprisingly, then, the only &quot;evidence&quot; the plaintiffs
could offer in the New Jersey suit was 55 letters from pro-life
activists expressing concern that freezing benefits might increase
abortions.  As of yet, there is nothing more concrete than their
concern itself to corroborate their claims; and pro-lifers who
are unconvinced by the hearsay -- including John Tomicki, past
president of New Jersey Right to Life -- have concluded that welfare
reform itself is a pro-life cause.
<P>
The findings in New Jersey are striking evidence of the latent
moral potential in welfare mothers that is begging to be cultivated,
rather than frustrated by the perpetuation of policies that subsidize
immorality.  Remedial policies should reconcile the current tension
between moral knowledge and the economic incentives of the welfare
system -- before moral knowledge is altogether gone from the inner
city.
<P>
Charles Murray explains that, when illegitimacy reaches a critical
mass, the neighborhood effects create problems that extend far
beyond the recipients of welfare.  Community values and the norms
for male behavior are changed, and with them the behavior of young
men and women who never touch an AFDC check.  Thus, the effect
of those checks springs not only from discrete changes in economic
incentives but from a larger, more pervasive effect on the formation
of character among poor young people.[24]
<P>
Yet, conservatives must acknowledge that government cannot be
an effective moral teacher.  Public policy can undermine, but
never instill, virtue.
<P>
Rather than attempting to devise the perfect bundle of carrots
and sticks, we must eliminate altogether the government subsidies
that skew welfare recipients' decisions by shielding them from
the natural economic consequences.  Michael Tanner of the Cato
Institute writes: &quot;We could reasonably expect that people,
faced with the consequences of their actions, would change their
behavior.  Such an approach would avoid coercion and the conceit
that government knows best.&quot;[25]
<P>
Getting government out of the way, of course, is the theme that
unites social conservatives and economic libertarians.  In <i>The
Road to Serfdom</i>, F. A. Hayek emphasized the symbiotic relationship
between morality and freedom from government intervention:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Freedom to order our own conduct in the sphere where material
circumstances force a choice upon us, and responsibility for the
arrangement of our own life according to our own conscience, is
the air in which alone moral sense grows and in which moral values
are daily re-created in the free decision of the individual.[26]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
It is the intrinsic truth of Hayek's observation that motivated
Wayne Bryant to institute the family cap in New Jersey -- a cap
he himself describes as a mechanism to reduce government constriction
of personal choices.[27]
<P>
Government must instead cede ground to the character-forming institutions
that are found in every community -- families, churches, schools,
charities, and other traditional arrangements that have been supplanted
by public authorities.  Rather than merely ending government programs,
conservatives intend to <I>replace</I> government welfare by advancing
proposals like a tax credit for charitable contributions that
will help to strengthen civil institutions.
<P>
Unless those institutions are reinvigorated and social functions
are restored to neighborhoods and communities, the behavioral
problems Daniel Patrick Moynihan described 30 years ago will only
continue to grow more acute, jeopardizing personal freedoms and
ultimately the survival of the republic itself.  If it is true
that moral values do not have concrete meaning in the absence
of freedom, it is also true that the preservation of political
liberty depends upon the cultivation 
of virtue in the people.

American families must balance expenses with income.  When this
fails, they delay clothing purchases or visits to the dentist.
  Such decisions are difficult,  but the alternative of  mounting
debt is too risky.  These hard-working taxpayers likewise expect
the federal government to keep its fiscal house in order by balancing
expenses with income.
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives Budget Committee is beginning
the process of balancing  the national budget.  The Committee
proposes a balanced budget by the year 2002, but to get there
will require a lot of  belt tightening.   
<P>
Their proposed budget includes many needed cuts.  They propose
to terminate, privatize, or convert to block grants three Cabinet
departments, 284 programs, 69 commissions, 13 agencies, and three
commercial activities.[1]

<CENTER><H3>DEPARTMENTS TO BE ELIMINATED (3)</CENTER></H3>
<P>
The Department of Energy was created in 1977 by President Jimmy
Carter in response to the energy crisis of the early 1970s.  
The 20,213-employee agency promotes energy conservation, controls
federal supplies of power, and develops alternative sources of
energy.   However, 85 percent of DoE's budget is spent on activities
that are not energy related.[2]
<P>
The Department of Education was established in 1979 by President
Carter to expand the federal role in education.  The Department's
budget has doubled while student performance has declined.   According
to former Secretary of Education William Bennett, more than 90
percent of the students entering U.S. colleges today would not
be admitted to post-secondary education anywhere else in the world.[3]
 In fact, only a small part of federal education spending reaches
American classrooms.  Most of the Department's current functions
of technical assistance and information can be transferred to
the states or other federal agencies.
<P>
The Department of Commerce was created in 1903 and spends $3.6
billion per year on more than 100 programs of which three-fourths
are duplicated by other federal agencies.  More than half of the
Department's budget and a third of its employees staff the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.[4] This organization would
become an independent agency.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>AGENCIES TO BE ELIMINATED (3)</CENTER></H3>
<P>
Just as America's taxpayers can do without the three cabinet-level
departments targeted for elimination in the House GOP Budget,
they can surely get along without the 13 agencies the House GOP
Budget would eliminate.  For example:
<UL>
<LI>The U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration was created in
1981 and spends $17 million per year promoting tourism and recreation
activities by conducting surveys, distributing promotional material,
and running regional marketing shows.  There is no reason for
the federal government to be involved in an activity that is already
handled by a prosperous private industry.[5]
<P>
<LI>The Minority Business Development Agency was created in 1971
to promote the development of minority-owned businesses and to
steer these businesses toward government contracts.  It was appropriated
$44 million in fiscal 1996 even though it duplicates a  loan program
run by the Small Business Administration.[6] 
<P>
<LI>The Maritime Administration was created in 1950 to tap the
domestic maritime fleet in case of national emergency.  Unfortunately,
the government-owned &quot;Ready Reserve Force&quot; was not seaworthy
during the Persian Gulf call-up.   The Maritime Administration
is part of the Department of Transportation and primarily acts
as a custodian of federal subsidies used to shield U.S. vessels
from foreign competition.[7]  But most (96 percent) of all waterborne
cargo entering or leaving the U.S. is on American vessels.
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>PROGRAMS ELIMINATED (284)</CENTER></H3>
<P>
Likewise, most taxpayers aren't likely to miss the 284 programs
eliminated by the House GOP Budget.  These programs include:
<UL>
<LI>The Federal Helium Reserve and Processing Facility will cost
$26 million over the next five years.  It was established in 1925
to insure a constant supply of helium for military blimps and
observation balloons which are no longer used.  The United States
produces most of the world's helium, exporting 5.5 times as much
helium as is produced worldwide.  But the government stays in
the helium business because of a federal ban prohibiting NASA
and the Pentagon from purchasing privately produced helium.[8]
<P>
<LI>The Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, which will
spend $2.7 million in 1995, was established in 1972 to oversee
the &quot;Avenue's revitalization.&quot;  The corporation is governed
by a 23-member board which oversees joint ventures with the private
sector, sponsors festivals, cultural performances, and athletic
events on Washington's Pennsylvania Avenue.[9]
<P>
<LI>The Points of Light Foundation in its first four years spent
$22 million on administrative expenses and $4 million on grants
to service organizations.  Expenses included $1.4 million for
a kickoff celebration and more than $108,000 paid to a public
relations firm to promote the party, as well as a $160,000 salary
for its top executive.[10]
<P>
<LI>The National Rail Passenger Corporation (AMTRAK) was created
in 1970 to take over the nation's ailing private passenger rail
service.  It has cost the taxpayer $17 billion but carries less
than one-half of one percent of America's inter-city passengers
or about 22 million passengers a year, a quarter of the entire
rail passenger service.[11]
<P>
<LI>The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) was established
in 1968 and now sponsors more than 600 National Public Radio (NPR)
stations and 340 Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) television
stations.  PBS and NPR are primarily (80 percent) funded through
private and non-federal public donations, but the federal share
provided by CPB for fiscal year 1996  is $286 million.[12]
<P>
<LI>The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) was created in 1974 to
provide low-income individuals with legal representation. LSC
will spend part of this year's $415 million budget to fund lobbying
or campaigning for local political initiatives.  The agency, a
piggybank for left-wing causes, has fought reforms designed to
reduce out-of-wedlock births; filed suit against a nonprofit homeless
shelter; and tried to create a &quot;constitutional right&quot;
to federal welfare.[13]
<P>
<LI>The AmeriCorps program, created by President Clinton, funds
community-based organizations &quot;to address problems they identify
by using the skills of individuals serving in National Service
positions.&quot;  Participants are given a stipend, an educational
award or credit toward student loan repayment, medical benefits,
and free child care for volunteer work.  The taxpayer cost for
each &quot;volunteer&quot; exceeds $30,000 or more than $3 billion
over the next five years.[14]
<P>
<LI>The National Endowment for the Arts has been a platform for
attacks on religion, traditional art forms, traditional families
and traditional values, and a forum for the promotion of homosexuality.
 NEA grants greatly influence what is presented in museums and
theaters and what private donors feel is worthy of support.  As
former NEA Chairman John Frohnmayer noted: &quot;Our grantees
state unequivocally that fund-raising is substantially easier
because of an Endowment grant.  It is an endorsement-a mark of
quality and achievement.&quot;[15] In 1994, the private sector donated
more than $9.6 billion to the arts.
<P>
<LI>The Mary McLeod Bethune Memorial Fine Arts Center located
on the Campus of Bethune Cookman College in Daytona Beach, Florida
received a grant of $4 million from the Department of Education.
 The facility will allow students to be trained for the fields
of entertainment and hotel management, fields adequately covered
by the private sector.[16]
<P>
<LI>The Essential Air Service Program (EASP) was created in 1978
to continue air service to small communities.  EASP will spend
$28 million in 1996 subsidizing commuter service to 80 communities.
 It was initially authorized for a ten-year period.  The subsidies
that these airlines receive from taxpayers range from $5 to $320
per passenger.[17]
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>BOARDS, COMMISSIONS, AUTHORITIES TO BE ELIMINATED (269)</CENTER></H3>
<P>
Similarly, it is difficult to justify deficit spending to support
many federal boards, commissions, and authorities.  Among those
the House GOP wants to delete are:
<UL>
<LI>The Interstate Commerce Commission was created in 1887 to
oversee the rail industry.  It now oversees rail traffic, trucking,
barges, buses, freight forwarders and express companies.   Legislation
that deregulated transportation has increased competition and
made the ICC largely obsolete.[18]
<P>
<LI>The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) was created in 1965
to fight poverty.  It is one of 62 federal economic development
programs under 18 federal departments and agencies.  ARC is currently
funded at $200 million.[19]
<P>
<LI>The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was created in 1933 to
generate and distribute electric power for the Tennessee Valley.
 Today, TVA manages locks, dams and recreation areas, operates
a research center, and funds economic development.
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES TO BE PRIVATIZED (3)</CENTER></H3>
<P>
Rather than believing worthwhile public functions must be performed
by government, the House GOP Budget plan recognizes that commercial
activities ought to be privatized.  Specifically:
<UL>
<LI>The Department of Energy operates five Power Marketing Administrations
which sell electricity from 131 dams.  In 1994, the PMA's sold
$3 billion worth of electric power.  The Budget Committee recommends
selling four of the PMA's, which are not a profitable investment
for the taxpayer.[20] 
<P>
<LI>The Naval Petroleum Reserves were established in 1912 by Presidents
William Howard Taft and Woodwork Wilson to assure fuel for the
Navy.  The project oversees two commercial oil fields and an oil-shale
reserve.  Studies show that these facilities operate far less
efficiently than comparable privately-owned fields.[21]
<P>
<LI>The United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC)  produces
and markets uranium enrichment services to private utilities in
the U.S. and abroad.  USEC advertises that it serves &quot;approximately
90 percent of the domestic market and about 40 percent of the
world market.&quot;[22] This taxpayer- financed commercial enterprise
could be sold for profit and operated more efficiently through
privatization.
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Individually, these programmatic cuts may not amount to much;
 but collectively these changes translate into hundreds of billions
of taxpayer savings and a balanced federal budget by 2002.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>The rates in columns 2 and 3 are defined as abortions per
1,000 females on AFDC.  The twelve months prior to implementation
of the cap are August 1992 through July 1993.  The cap took effect
August of 1993, and the most recent monthly data available are
March 1994 because of a time lag in reporting.</FONT>
<P>
<HR><P>
Together with all who decry abortion, the Family Research Council
reacted with concern to press reports Tuesday that New Jersey
experienced a &quot;slight increase in the abortion rate among
women on welfare during the first eight months since implementation
of the family cap.&quot;[1]
<P>
We were relieved to discover for ourselves and are now eager
to reassure fellow pro-life advocates that the data released do
not support the conclusion that the family cap has increased abortions.
<P>
Of course, no one can ascribe causality to the family cap, no
matter how the abortion rate appears to have changed.  Officials
from the New Jersey Department of Human Services themselves stress
emphatically that &quot;additional data and analysis are required
before any link can be made between the family cap and the abortion
rate.&quot;[2]
<P>
The much more immediate problem, however, is that the numbers
just released do not describe a consistent upward trend in abortions
as the accompanying press release suggested -- and the newspapers
then hastened to report.  Instead, the raw numbers indicate that
there is no real change in the rates, other than the normal month-to-month
fluctuation that would be expected regardless of the cap.   
<P>
Jacqueline Tencza, spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of
Human Services, herself cautioned that &quot;the department does
not believe that the [perceived] increase is statistically significant
[i.e., other than a normal distribution of values] because it
is based on a short period of time and compared with only one
previous year.&quot;[3]
<P>
Upon closer scrutiny, the alleged &quot;increase in the abortion
rate&quot; is strictly a function of the particular eight-month
time period isolated for analysis.
<P>
The abortion rate for the month of March 1994 (or March 1993)
is noticeably and significantly greater than any other rate included
in the chart, in part because the month of March contains 23 weekdays
as opposed to the average 21.7 days.  Excluding that one anomalous
rate yields a total monthly average of 9.44 for the period following
implementation of the cap -- which is virtually equal to the pre-cap
average monthly abortion rate of 9.43.
<P>
Examining the pre-cap and post-cap numbers month by month helps
underscore the fact that a straightforward comparison of the two
8-month averages listed in the chart is meaningless.  Three of
the eight months before implementation of the cap in fact posted
a higher abortion rate than the corresponding months in the year
after the cap took effect.
<P>
The waters grow considerably murkier, moreover, when calculations
of average monthly abortion rates include the rates for the four
pre-implementation months in 1993 not included in the chart released
Tuesday.  When the rates for these months (10.96 in April 1993;
9.33 in May 1993; 10.9 in June 1993; and 10.34 in July 1993)[4] are
included, the average monthly abortion rate for the entire year
before implementation of the cap is 9.75 -- again, virtually equal
to the average rate for the eight months since the cap (the only
post-cap months for which data are currently available).  It is
possible, in fact, to isolate a different eight-month period prior
to the cap for which the average monthly abortion rate is higher
than the average calculated for the eight months post-cap.[5]
<P>
It would, of course, be foolish to jump to the conclusion that
abortions must have declined in New Jersey since implementation
of the cap -- but no more foolish than it is to conclude that
abortions have definitely increased in New Jersey, based on the
comparison of two 8-month averages.  It is worthwhile to note
in passing that to date the numbers do not exclude the possibility
that abortions have declined slightly since the cap took effect.
<P>
Given what limited data we have, however, it appears most probable
that the New Jersey family cap is essentially abortion-neutral.
 And we can assert with a large measure of confidence that the
fears of a large upsurge in the short-term abortion rate are unfounded.
<P>
But we repeat again, as we have carefully stated in all previous
comments on the family cap:  It is far too premature to draw any
decisive conclusions from the welfare reform experiment in New
Jersey.  Indeed, it would be a travesty for the national debate
over an issue as critical as welfare reform to rise or fall on
the basis of preliminary returns from one state.
<P>
New Jersey, of course, is a worst-case scenario for the family
cap because it is one of the few states that provides public funding
for abortion.  Failure to demonstrate a consistent, upward trend
in the abortion rate in New Jersey in particular confirms that
it is perfectly appropriate for the debate over the family cap
to go forward.  Given the pathologies of our current welfare system,
the debate <I>must</I> go forward.
<P>
Even with the release of the most recent data, there is still
every reason to theorize that the family cap may be functioning
as a new safeguard for the lives of the unborn.  To know whether
the net effect of the family cap is an increase or a decrease
in the abortion rate, we must know the number of abortions performed
on women who have left the state's welfare rolls.  If the cap
encouraged them to become self-sufficient or to seek alternative
means of support for their babies -- as the framers of the policy
intended -- the abortion rate for former welfare mothers may very
well have decreased.  And the total number of abortions in New
Jersey may have declined.  If that proves to be the case, in a
state that provides public funding for abortions, we will have
powerful evidence to predict that the family cap will be actively
anti-abortion in a state that does not fund or otherwise encourage
abortion.    
<P>
Family Research Council, however,  has never maintained that the
legitimacy of the family cap depends on its capacity to reduce
abortions over the short-term.  The current welfare system is
indelibly anti-marital and anti-natal -- peacefully coexisting
with the world's highest abortion rates outside the Eastern Bloc.
 Long-term change may entail some risk of short-term harm, but
the cost of reform must be weighed against the moral cost of perpetuating
a system that destroys the lives of both the born and yet unborn.
<P>
The family cap is the only welfare reform initiative in the Senate
debate that will directly reduce out-of-wedlock pregnancy, which
is strongly correlated with abortion.  Ardent support for the
family cap <I>is</I> the pro-life position because marriage is
the best protection for children both before and after birth.
 Paying women not to have abortions, by contrast, is morally corrupt.

<P>
A set of male fruit flies, the study reports, formed mating chains
with each other after their body chemistry was altered.  But a
close look at the study reveals that the most reasonable conclusions
from the evidence are that male and female sex drives are quite
different, and that frenzied males, under certain conditions,
will mate with anything, even other males. 
<P>
Writing in the June 1995 <I>Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences</I>, Shang-Ding Zhang and Ward F. Odenwald of the
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke division
of the National Institutes of Health report a heightening of the
sexual activities of fruit flies that had been heat-treated to
reduce levels of the chemical serotonin.[1] Reduction of serotonin
has been linked in other studies to an increase in sexual activity
and same-sex coupling among some animals (rats, cats, and rabbits).[2]

<P>
Media reports, predictably, have exaggerated the actual findings
of the research.  <I>Time,</I> for instance, reported that the
new study &quot;adds to the mounting evidence that homosexuality
has genetic origins....&quot;[3]
<P>
The <I>Time</I> article and other media reports ignore or underreport
key elements of the study that work against the claim that homosexuality
may be hereditary or even partly hereditary.  One finding was
that altered females, the study notes, were not affected in any
discernible way.  
<P>
Another finding -- that normal males resisted sexual advances
by the altered males for up to two hours and then succumbed to
same-sex activity -- indicates strongly that homosexual behavior
is environmentally induced. 
<P>
From the study:
<P>
&quot;At the beginning of chaining periods, in bottles containing
[more than] 80 percent transformants [treated flies], nontransformant
males were observed only at 
the head of fast moving chains where they repeatedly displayed
repelling signals to advancing suitors -- i.e. wing-flicking,
face-kicking, and/or running away....After a 2-hr. exposure to
vigorous transformant courtship, many, if not all, of the nontransformants
were observed courting and inducing courtship.&quot;[4]
<P>
In bottles in which females were present, the females formed defensive
clusters, impeding males' efforts to mate with them.  In one jar
pictured in the article, the females were huddled at the very
bottom while the males formed long lines of sexual activity in
the rest of the jar.  Some of the males did mate with the females,
but the females offered resistance.  
<P>
As the study explains: 
<P>
&quot;Lead males would typically break off their heterosexual
advances after experiencing one or more of her repelling signals...such
as kicking his face and/or running or flying away.  During vigorous
chaining periods, females predominantly grouped together in tight
clusters; however, no female-female courtship was observed in
or outside of these dense packs.&quot;[5]
<P>
The male &quot;homosexual&quot; activity might have had little
to do with preference and merely involve frenzied mating with
the nearest available partner.
<P>
But listen to how <I>Time</I> magazine summarizes the participation
by the &quot;straight&quot; males:
<P>
&quot;While the gays formed their conga lines, the straights stayed
to the side -- but only temporarily.  After a few hours, the straights
joined in and, for the time being, acted gay.&quot;[6]
<P>
No mention is made by <I>Time</I> of the struggle by the &quot;straight&quot;
flies to ward off the hypersexual males.  And the use of the word
&quot;gay&quot; to describe the flies gives them anthropomorphic
overtones; that is, the writer attributes human characteristics
to a non-human rather than vice-versa.  But the notion of being
&quot;gay&quot; is a calculated construct of self-identification
for political purposes.  Many people struggling with homosexuality
reject the idea that their defining characteristic is to be &quot;gay.&quot;[7]
 The <I>Time</I> article does concede that &quot;[t]he type of
gene they've been studying in fruit flies could not begin to account
for the complex variations in human homosexual behavior.  For
one thing, the gene does not cause flies to renounce heterosexuality
altogether.  If a 'gay' fly is surrounded by females instead of
males, he'll fertilize the lady flies.&quot;[8]
<P>
Another culturally significant fact from the study is that when
non-treated male flies constituted 50 percent or more of the population
in a bottle, the researchers found that &quot;little or no chaining
was detected and nontransformant participation was rarely observed.&quot;[9]
<P>
In other words, when the bottle's &quot;culture&quot; was at least
half normal, the male-to-male sex occurred not at all or rarely.
 But when the normal flies were surrounded by &quot;homosexual&quot;
flies and attacked repeatedly, they finally gave in to the behavior.
 Again, it is perilous to extrapolate insect studies to humans,
but this sounds much like experiences reported among convicts.
 Otherwise sexually normal prison inmates sometimes indulge in
homosexual behavior, not because of genetics but because of the
immediate environment (coercion, lack of opposite-sex partners,
peer acceptance of the behavior).  According to psychiatrist and
author Jeffrey B. Satinover, &quot;It is common knowledge that
when some heterosexual men are placed in isolation for long periods
of time with each other that they will engage in homosexual behavior.
 But, once released, they will resume their heterosexual behavior.&quot;[10]
<P>
The social sciences are increasingly looking to animals or insects
for clues to human behavior, even though human sexuality is quite
different.  But if any lessons are to be drawn for human purposes,
they might be these:
<P>
<LI>  The sexes are quite different in their sexual needs, drives
and reactions to particular stimulants.
<P>
<LI>  A culture that hopes to maintain its sexual norms is at risk
when a critical mass of deviant behavior occurs.
<P>
 <LI> Homosexual behavior is learned, and occurs among those who are
vulnerable to the environmental factors that tend to produce homosexual
behavior. 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
As with other studies purporting to show a genetic link to homosexuality,
the NIH study is being hailed by homosexual activists, who are
trying to equate homosexuality with an immutable characteristic
such as skin color or ethnic origin in their drive to create support
for an entirely new category of behavior-based special civil rights.
<P>
The actual research often reveals something entirely different
from what is claimed.  Researchers Zhang and Odenwald summarize
that &quot;both genetic and environmental factors play a role
in male sexual behavior[11]....elements of the basic machinery controlling
male sexual behavior may be highly conserved between taxonomically
distinct organisms.&quot;[12] They call for more research on the
topic to &quot;enhance our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms
controlling sexual behavior.&quot;[13]
<P>
The study is interesting.  But it gives no hard evidence of anything
other than the fact that male fruit flies subjected to a sexual
stimulant may mate with anything in sight.  In March 1993, two
Columbia University psychiatrists examined the various studies
purporting to find a homosexual biologic component.   They concluded
that &quot;there is no evidence at present to substantiate a biologic
theory...the appeal of current biologic explanations for sexual
orientation may derive more from dissatisfaction with the present
status of psychosocial explanations than from a substantiating
body of experimental data.&quot;[14]
<P>
In other words, politics, not science, is driving the debate.
 An honest look at the evidence of 70 years of psychology, therapeutic
research, the history of the entire human race, and the moral
codes of all the great civilizations tells us that homosexuality
is not only universally discouraged as learned behavior but can
also be temporary, controlled, or even changed.
<P>
Given the well-documented, socially and medically destructive
effects of homosexual behavior on individuals, families and communities,
compassion and prudence should lead us to discourage any cultural
promotion of homosexuality as a moral and normal activity.  Media
reports indicate that homosexual experimentation among high schoolers
has increased considerably in recent years as schools have presented
homosexual activity as normal, desirable and even &quot;cool.&quot;[15]
 Sexually vulnerable young people are being steered onto a behavioral
path that they and their families will sorely regret and which
will even cost some of them their lives at an early age.
<P>
Homosexual behavior, like other destructive vices, can be learned
-- and unlearned.  Under no circumstances should it be promoted,
particularly through misrepresentation of scientific studies.

<P>
Federal arts funding, much like the welfare system, has created
a class of beneficiaries who are hostile to conservative, pro-family
causes.  Recipients of federal aid all too often become cheerleaders
for big government, the family's natural enemy.  Big government
strips families of their incomes through confiscatory taxation
and diminishes their autonomy through intrusive social welfare
and educational programs designed to wean children from their
parents (and parental values) at earlier and earlier ages. 
<P>
The same taxpayers who suffer the indignity of seeing their own
earnings used by bureaucrats to undermine their families also
pay for a federally-subsidized artistic and media elite to cheer
on their tormentors: the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,
the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment
for the Humanities.
<P>
It is long past time that the federal arts and humanities endowments
be de-authorized and de-funded.  Spawned during the 1960s' Great
Society years, these agencies, despite whatever good they have
done, have damaged American culture, ripped off the taxpayer,
waged war on the family and religion, and politicized the academy
and the arts.   
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CURRENT PROPOSALS TO TRIM THE ENDOWMENTS ARE ILL-ADVISED AND
COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Merely cutting the budgets and stretching out the life of the
agencies will cause more mischief.  When Proposition 13 was enacted
into law in California, hostile government officials began cutting
back on essentials, such as police and fire departments, leaving
the waste and fat untouched.  The object lesson to the voters
was that challenging government growth meant the onset of anarchy.
 Similarly, if the federal budgets for public broadcasting and
the arts and humanities are merely reduced, the truly offensive
offerings will be the last to be de-funded.  Vengeful bureaucrats
will trim where it will cause the most pain and where patrons
would complain most loudly.  A couple of years ago, when Congress
stalled in passing an appropriations bill for the federal government,
the Smithsonian closed its 
doors, as did some national parklands, enraging taxpaying visitors.
 But the long-obsolete federal Helium Reserve suffered no loss
of gas.  Again, the message to the voters was:  we will punish
you if you don't lobby your elected representatives to reinstate
our funding -- with increases. 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>SOME POLITICIANS THINK THEY CAN BUY PEACE BY APPEASING THEIR
OPPONENT. INSTEAD, THEY CREATE A HARDENED ENEMY.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
In terms of the federal endowments, the political price is actually
higher for merely cutting instead of eliminating them.  Recipients
of federal aid are the natural foes of budget cutters and will
continue to use their taxpayer-provided subsidies to wage political
war on them.  Hundreds of arts organizations are being lobbied
to bring pressure on individual members of Congress to preserve
art pork in their own districts.
<P>
A case in point is a letter from Independent Television Service
Executive Director James Yee to public broadcasting advocates.
 The taxpayer-supported (and, therefore, in no way independent)
ITVS was created in 1988 to provide new programming for public
broadcasting.  Yee urges his &quot;independent colleagues&quot;
to &quot;become involved in future efforts to drum up support
for public broadcasting, especially with your local and national
elected officials....&quot;  Yee warns that &quot;an extensive
informational outreach campaign will have to be waged.&quot; 
Such campaigns cost money, but are easier to mount when federal
subsidies pour in to handle other costs.  
<P>
The current House plan to phase out the endowments serves only
to give welfare artists some time to restore their subsidies.
 Indeed, subsidy supporters have acknowledged, through their accord,
that the phase-out plan is their best hope for saving the agencies
and returning to business as usual.[1] 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CUTTING BACK THE ENDOWMENTS WILL NOT LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT REFORM.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Congress repeatedly has slapped NEA on the wrist, and still the
NEA sends money to The Kitchen, Franklin Furnace and other centers
of blatantly offensive &quot;performance&quot; art that denigrates
religion, families and traditional morality.  Indeed, a <I>Washington
Post</I> critic observed recently that the 1993 Biennial Exhibition
at the NEA-funded Whitney Museum was &quot;one long whinging [sic]
whine of political correctness, suggesting as it did that the
only art that counts is art produced by lesbians, inhabitants
of barrios, sufferers of AIDS and others on the margin.&quot;
 Two years later, at the 1995 Biennial, &quot;[h]omosexuality's
still hot, especially the kinds involving punctures of the flesh,
accessories of leather, bondage and cross-dressing, but so too
are the subtlest of painterly abstraction.  Nuances and nipple-rings
are both themes of this exhibit, if it can be said to have any
themes at all.&quot;[2]
<P>
NEA chairwoman Jane Alexander has boasted of using the endowment
to promote homosexual themes[3] and has even defended a public bloodletting
by an HIV-infected  performer at an NEA-subsidized venue.[4]  Despite
many assurances by past and present NEA officials that excellence
and artistic merit are the criteria for grant allocation, this
is clearly not the case.  More than $9 billion in private giving
sustains arts in communities all over America.[5] The NEA's $175
million is important more for its symbolism than for the actual
dollars involved.  An NEA grant validates an artist, and the government
should not be putting its imprimatur on much of the anti-family,
anti-religious propaganda that counter-culture activists brazenly
categorize as art.  The entertainment industry has revenues in
the tens of billions of dollars  each year.  Time-Warner alone
took in $15.9 billion during 1994.  Clearly, Hollywood is in a
better position to subsidize the endowments for arts and humanities
than US taxpayers who struggling to get out from under $200 billion
in annual deficits.
<P>
<CENTER><H3> CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
In 1967, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting
Act creating CPB.  The agency oversees the Public Broadcasting
Service, which was formed in 1969, a year before the creation
of National Public Radio.  CPB's total appropriation in fiscal
1969 was $5 million.  In 1992, Congress re-authorized CPB with
a three-year, $1.1 billion appropriation.  By 1993, CPB's annual
federal appropriation was $318.6 million, which rose to $386 million
for fiscal 1995.  There are 349 public TV stations and 200 TV
grantees receiving CPB funding.[6]  PBS claims to reach 1.8 million
teachers and 29.5 million students through educational programming
and services, and 97 million Americans overall each week with
some PBS programming.[7] National Public Radio is carried on 595
stations, and CPB awards money to 391 public radio grantees. 
<P>
The basis for CPB's existence has always been an anti-free market
philosophy.   Proponents have said that the market is incapable
of providing good programming, so the government must step in
and do it, to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars annually.[8]
 Yet the shows that register high ratings on PBS turn out to be
the very programs that the public perceives to be excellent: <I>Sesame
Street</I>, <I>Barney and Friends</I>, <I>The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour</I>,
and <I>Masterpiece Theatre</I>, for example.  All of these shows
are generating more than sufficient revenue from sponsors, donors,
grants and product marketing.  They do not need taxpayer subsidies.
<P>
But there is other CPB programming that probably would fail to
attract a sufficient viewing/listening audience or donor support.
 These programs are so bad that their creators must dig into the
public purse.  Subsidizing bad art is a donor's prerogative, of
course -- unless the &quot;donor&quot; is the taxpayer, who has
no choice.  (For detailed examples, see FRC's Policy paper entitled
&quot;Public Broadcasting?  Let's Free Big Bird.&quot;)
<P>
<CENTER><H3> NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
NEA was established in 1965 when President Johnson signed the
National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act, which also
created the National Endowment for the Humanities.  NEA's initial
budget was $2.5 million, but grew over the years to about $175
million annually (fiscal 1995 appropriation is $167.7 million).
 A fiscal 1995 rescission bill, HR 1158, would reduce 1995 funding
to $162.5 million.[9] All told, NEA has spent more than $3 billion
of tax money in its 30-year history.   
<P>
The plan approved by the House Economic and Educational Opportunities
Committee on May 10, 1995 would reauthorize NEA through fiscal
1998 but eliminate funding in fiscal 1999.  Funding would be reduced
by 40 percent in fiscal 1996, another 40 percent in fiscal 1997
and by 20 percent in fiscal 1998. The NEA would get no money in
fiscal 1999.[10]
<P>
NEA would also face a $5 million cap on administrative expenses,
which would entail an 80 percent reduction in budget for staff.
 Currently, NEA spends $24 million annually on administration.[11]
<P>
Beginning in 1996, grants to individuals would be eliminated,
with all grants going to institutions.  Eighty percent of annual
appropriations to the state art councils would be in the form
of block grants.[12]
<P>
A Senate bill (S 856) introduced by James Jeffords (R-VT) and
co-sponsored by Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS), Alan Simpson (R-WY), Edward
Kennedy (D-MA) and Claiborne Pell (D-RI) would reauthorize NEA
for five years (FY 1996-2000) at gradually reduced funding levels.
 Forty percent of the NEA's program budget would go to &quot;partnership&quot;
grants with the states, local and regional groups; 40% more would
go toward organizations of &quot;national significance;&quot;
a final 20% would go to direct grants to organizations, such as
theaters or museums, and to individual artists. 
<P>
Most significantly, the bill keeps intact much of the current
peer review system, in which panelists award federal tax dollars
to their friends and associates.  It also locks in place the conditions
under which the NEA would reject a grant over &quot;obscenity.&quot;
 An artwork would have to be found legally obscene in a court
of law before the NEA could move to recover funds.  Given that
a grant from the NEA automatically gives an artwork &quot;artistic&quot;
significance no matter how offensive, the provision is meaningless
in terms of curbing abuses of taxpayer funding.  
<P>
The bill also directs the current NEA director to give &quot;Distinguished
Lifetime Service for the Arts&quot; awards to &quot;each of the
former Chairpersons of the Endowment.&quot;  This means that federal
taxpayers would honor, among others, John Frohnmayer, the NEA
chief whose tenure ended when he was forced by President Bush
to resign over NEA's continued funding of anti-Christian and pornographic
works. 
<P>
Finally, the bill creates an entirely new federal agency to nationalize
standards for all public libraries and museums.  The &quot;Institute
for Museum and Library Services&quot; would be authorized for
five years, beginning with a budget of $75 million in fiscal 1996
&quot;and such sums as may be necessary for each of the 4 succeeding
fiscal years,&quot; and would have grant-making authority.  This
is a potentially lucrative source to be abused by well-connected
left-wing groups like the American Library Association, would
give the federal government potential control over the nation's
local public libraries, and would do to libraries and museums
what the NEA has done to art -- redefine it using federal tax
dollars to further a radical cultural and political agenda. 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES</H3></CENTER>
<P>
NEH was established at the same time NEA was born, in 1965.  The
fiscal year 1966 budget was $5.9 million, and the agency had a
staff of 13.[13] The agency expanded over the years until it reached
a budget of $177 million in fiscal 1995.  
<P>
Officials at the NEH are hardly contrite for sponsoring a widely-denounced
set of national history standards that, among other things, emphasize
the role of the Ku Klux Klan (17 references) and exalt Soviet
advances in space while ignoring Albert Einstein, the Wright Brothers,
Paul Revere, Robert E. Lee and the American moon landing.[14] The
NEH also specializes in promoting cultural relativism, feminist
studies and other Marxist and neo-Marxist theoretical quagmires
on the nation's campuses.[15]
<P>
The current plan approved by the House Economic and Educational
Opportunities Committee would reauthorize NEH with an annual 20
percent funding reduction through fiscal 1998 starting with the
1995 appropriation of $172 million (which includes a recent House-approved
$5 million rescission).  No funding would be allocated to NEH
in 1999.  The 5 percent cap for administrative expenses would
also apply to NEH, as well as the termination of direct federal
grants to individuals (scholars would continue to receive grants
through recipient organizations such as universities).  Eighty
percent of appropriations would go to state humanities councils
in the form of block grants.  Senate bill S 856 would reauthorize
NEH for five years at gradually reduced funding levels, beginning
with $168.6 million in fiscal year 1996.  Each state would get
a minimum of $200,000 in funding each fiscal year.  Grants would
continue to be made to &quot;groups, individuals, and State agencies
or entities.&quot;  
<P>
<CENTER><H3>SUMMARY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Attempts to curry favor with the welfare broadcast media and arts
groups are useless and only embolden the political enemies of
budget cutters.  So, we must ask budget-cutting Members of Congress:
why give the very people who will never love you enough subsidies
to stay in business so they can continue taking shots at you?
 The federal arts subsidies must end once and for all.

SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT TAKES ON THE FAMILY</h2>

What follows is a commentary on the &quot;Draft Declaration and
Draft Programme of Action&quot; prepared by United Nations staff
for the &quot;World Summit for Social Development&quot; scheduled to
occur in Copenhagen March 6-12, 1995.  This commentary is indicative
of problems found in the document, which runs some 55 pages in
typescript, and which addresses, in generally broad language,
a wide range of social issues and concerns in member countries
of the United Nations.  This commentary will be updated after
Copenhagen to discuss the final language of the Declaration and
Programme of Action.    
<P>
<center><h3>INTRODUCTION</h3></center>
<P>
Following the United Nations and its swamp of commissions, declarations,
and conferences can be a debilitating experience.  The situation
is compounded by the rapidly growing basket of UN documents and
observances devoted to such topics as the family (International
Year of the Family, 1994), population and development (International
Conference on Population and Development, 1994), social development
(World Summit for Social Development, 1995), and women (Fourth
World Conference on Women, 1995).    
<P>
Thematically and administratively separate, these observances
and conferences tend to overlap in subject matter.  This is due
in part to the ambiguity of mission in many UN agencies and documents,
and the tendency of recent UN meetings to produce &quot;smorgasbord&quot;
documents that say in 1,000 words what more succinct documents
(like those of the American founding) say in 10.  Thus, for example,
the bitter dispute over abortion at the ICPD in Cairo in 1994
is likely to be reprised at the Beijing women's conference and
its preliminary meetings.              
<P>
An additional factor promoting these disputes is the continued
presence and agitation within the UN structure of international
lobbies (some with economic ties to the UN, and others privately
funded) devoted to particular agendas.  The United Nations Charter
(for example, Chapter X, Article 71, relating to the Economic
and  Social Council) makes specific provision for consultation
by the UN and its constituent councils and agencies &quot;with
nongovernmental organizations [NGOs] which are concerned with
matters within its competence.&quot;  
<P>
The Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) is responsible for conducting
all events in connection with the World Summit for Social Development.
<P>
NGOs vary in the amount and type of energy they devote to UN activities.
 Essentially, they  are private, charitable (i.e., tax exempt)
or advocacy organizations that are accredited by the UN  to lobby
at particular conferences and the preparatory meetings leading
up to them.  In the context of Cairo and Beijing, NGOs such as
the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF)  and the
Women's Environmental and Developmental Organization (WEDO) have
exerted continuous pressure, with considerable internal UN support,
for the drafting of documents that  strongly endorse abortion,
the redefinition of the family, and other radical causes.    
<P>
Preparatory meetings leading up to designated international conferences
are called, in UN lingo, &quot;prepcoms.&quot;  Major prepcoms
for both the Cairo population conference and the Beijing women's
summit have been held months in advance at the United Nations
headquarters in New York.  The prepcoms are run by &quot;Preparatory
Committees,&quot; composed of representatives of member nations
of the UN.  In between sessions of the prepcom, the Committee
chairman, with  the assistance of the UN Secretariat, may be tasked
with such responsibilities as the drafting of  declarations and
programmes of action.  The periods between prepcoms are invaluable,
especially to New Yorkbased NGOs, as opportunities to lobby UN
officials and to influence the development of conference documents.
<P>
With respect to the World Summit for Social Development, a second
session of the prepcom  was held in New York from August 22 to
September 2, 1994.  At that session, the committee  tasked its
chairman to prepare a declaration for consideration in Copenhagen.
 The UN Secretariat was charged by the committee to prepare a
programme of action for Copenhagen.  The analysis that follows
discusses the draft declaration and programme of action of November
22, 1994, as prepared by the chairman and the Secretariat.  As
of this writing, a final draft is in the process of  being completed
for submission to the summit in Copenhagen.    
<P>
That the United Nations is an incessant document mill has become
increasingly obvious.  The  November 22 draft, as discussed below,
incorporates a wealth of vague and contradictory ideas,  not the
least of which is the situational irony of a massive United Nations
bureaucracy proclaiming itself the savior of decentralized government.
 But, the question may be asked, are not most UN documents merely
recommendations, without the force of law?  Indeed, the design
of the  Economic and Social Council announced in the UN Charter
is precisely that of a body constituted to hold meetings and make
recommendations.  Article 62 defines the powers of ECOSOC as 
follows:                 
<P>
1.  The Economic and Social Council may make or initiate studies
and reports with respect to international economic, social, cultural,
educational, health, and related matters and may make recommendations
with respect to any such matters to the General Assembly, to the
Members of the United Nations, and to the specialized (UN) agencies
concerned.                  
<P>
2.  [ECOSOC] may make recommendations for the purpose of promoting
respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms
for all.                  
<P>
3.  [ECOSOC] may prepare draft conventions for submission to the
General Assembly ...      
<P>
4.  [ECOSOC] may call, in accordance with rules prescribed by
the United Nations, international conferences on matters falling
within its competence.  This brief Article summarizes the activity
of the ECOSOC with respect to the World Summit  for Social Development
 with one exception.  That is, none of the documents of the Summit
 amount to a convention, a legal instrument that requires the
approval of the General Assembly  and the submission to members
states for ratification.  Examples of such conventions are the
Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention for the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.  It
is important to realize that the language developed at Copenhagen
for its nonbinding declaration and programme of action will thereby
acquire momentum within the UN system, and perhaps form the basis
for future conventions with potentially legally binding force.
<P>
<center><h3>WEDO AND THE GLEN COVE CONCLAVE</h3></center>
<P>
It is this possibility that motivates the activities of the most
intensely involved NGOs, such as  the Women's Environmental and
Development Organization (WEDO).  Former Democratic Congresswoman
Bella Abzug, a privatecitizen member of the US delegation to the
Cairo population conference, is the leader of WEDO.  An uncompromising
feminist and abortion advocate, Abzug  represented WEDO at a November
29 to December 2, 1994 planning meeting for the Beijing women's
conference.  This global strategy meeting was held in Glen Cove,
New York.  While  focused primarily on Beijing, the meeting included
working groups focused on devising strategies and language for
the whole basket of UN conferences and documents in progress.
 In that context, many of its recommendations are instructive.
<P>
The Glen Cove working group on the Copenhagen document criticized
it for its focus &quot;on the  family as the basic unit&quot;
of society, and for overlooking &quot;the changing configuration
of the  family.&quot;  The working group called for women's housework
to be remunerated, for a &quot;universal  adequate annual guaranteed
income,&quot; and &quot;payment for childcare.&quot;  It also
called for the adoption of a tax on &quot;international financial
transactions&quot; and &quot;taxation of transnational corporations&quot;
to  finance social development, presumably under UN auspices.
 (In this regard, the November 22 Copenhagen draft recommends
that the General Assembly task the ECOSOC to study such  proposals.)
<P>
The working group proposed a number of changes to the Copenhagen
draft (See full text of  the November 22 draft in the Appendix).
 The changes include a subtle call for changes in electoral systems
to establish a &quot;mechanism for women's ... equitable representation
at all levels of  the political process.&quot;  Other language
developed at Glen Cove suggests this &quot;mechanism&quot; would
 include gender quotas for public office.  In addition, the working
group proposed that the  Copenhagen document ensure &quot;that
effective laws and agencies exist to prevent and eliminate  discrimination
on the basis of gender [and] sexual orientation ...&quot;; &quot;that
women and adolescents  have access to good quality, comprehensive
health care, including the full range of reproductive  and sexual
health care services, including access to safe abortion ...&quot;;
and that the draft's  language regarding &quot;family as the basic
unit of society&quot; be replaced with references to &quot;households
and families&quot; as &quot;important economic units.&quot;  
<P>
The Glen Cove working group recommendations for Beijing are also
revealing.  The group  called for the &quot;recognition of sexual
orientation as a fundamental human right within the context  of
the expanding definition of the family.&quot;  It also called
for &quot;sexual and reproductive education to [sic] boys and
girls&quot;; affirmative action to assure that &quot;governments
... achieve 50% representation in elected and appointed office
by women by the year 2005,&quot; to be achieved by &quot;setting
 targets or quota systems&quot;; and encouraging &quot;activities
aimed at changing traditional decisionmaking roles in the family.&quot;
 One specific action recommended by the working group is that
the UN Secretariat prepare a &quot;gender balance rating card&quot;
to be published at the beginning of each session of the General
Assembly &quot;rating and ranking Member States on the basis of
numbers, positions, titles, race and ethnicity of women participating
in their Missions to [the] UN ...&quot;      
<P>
Other working groups dealt with the aftermath of the Cairo population
conference and discussed ways to expand the advances made in promoting
the notion of &quot;reproductive health and  decisionmaking&quot;
as aspects of fundamental human rights, including possibly adolescents
and  single people.  The goal remains to assure that abortion
is included in future UN documents &quot;as a  basic method of
fertility regulation and as an essential part of reproductive
health services and  rights.&quot;    
<P>
Finally, Working Group 2 at Glen Cove developed a program of lobbying
and other activities  to be undertaken between the Copenhagen
and Beijing meetings.  The program is entitled the  &quot;Women's
Global Campaign, 180 Days, 180 Ways.&quot;  The campaign's goal
is to extend the statements of belief and programs of action of
the Glen Cove coalition to a wider network of women,  NGOs and
&quot;disenfranchised people.&quot;  Expanded usage of online
computer networks is  envisioned.  All of this is in keeping with
a recognition that the topdown organization of social  movements
by such bodies as the United Nations are doomed to failure if
it cannot enlist the  support of a grassroots movement in member
nations.                                      
<P>
The Glen Cove conclave amounted to a gathering of radical feminists
rebuffed politically in the  United States but rewarded in the
closed environment of New York and the United Nations,  funded
and supported by a variety of such populist funding sources as
the Ford, and Rockefeller  Foundations, and abetted by the swelling
throng of UN and Clinton Administration bureaucrats  dedicated
to adopting the sexual revolution on a global scale.  With each
new UN conference and  document, they have another opportunity
to move the international clock in the direction of their  Brave
New World.    
<P>
<center><h3>ANALYSIS OF NOVEMBER 22 COPENHAGEN DRAFT</h3></center>
<P>
All page numbers refer to the November 22, 1994 draft declaration
and &quot;programme of  action.&quot;  The actual text of the
draft declaration reviewed begins on page 3 and concludes at page
 55.  Most paragraphs in the declaration are identifiable by numbers
or letter designations in the  text, and these designations are
used in this commentary.  Language that is objectionable is  indicated
by brackets [ ].  Language to be added or substituted for objectionable
language is indicated in bold.    
<P>
Suggested modifications follow.    
<P>
Page 3, paragraph 2.  Modify line two to read &quot;profound social
problems specially poverty,  unemployment, family breakup and
social exclusion.&quot;  The phenomenon of family dissolution
is  a virtually universal concomitant of development; indeed,
it is especially pronounced in the most highly developed nations
as individuals tend to supplant family (agrarian) units as the
primary  sources of production.  Asserting the problem of family
breakup at the outset of the document  will serve to buttress
family preservation as an essential component of development throughout
 the declaration.    
<P>
Page 3, paragraph 4.  &quot;Peace and security&quot; are insufficient
descriptors of national aspirations.   This paragraph should be
modified to read &quot;the achievement and maintenance of conditions
of  freedom, peace and security with and between ... cannot be
attained in the absence of conditions of freedom, peace and security.&quot;
 This language is needed to express the basic condition  of political
freedom as the key to economic and human progress.  Conditions
of &quot;peace and  security,&quot; at least in the military sense,
prevailed in Soviet Russia and numerous authoritarian  regimes
of East Asia, Africa, and the Americas.  Peace and security alone
are insufficient conditions for human wellbeing and development.
<P>
Page 4, paragraph 11, line 2.  The word &quot;contradiction&quot;
should be modified to read &quot;contrast.&quot;  This distinction
may not carry over well in other languages besides English, but
it is important that the document not be read to assert that in
every case the expansion of prosperity occurs for some at the
expense of the poverty of others.   All wealth is not the product
of exploitation.  Were it so, development by definition would
be a zero sum game in which no real improvement in overall global
living standards is possible.  The declaration must reject this
notion in principle. &quot;Contrast&quot; better suggests the
morally troubling existence of stark inequities in the distribution
of the world's basic resources.    
<P>
Page 4, paragraph 12, line 3,  The word &quot;people&quot; or
&quot;peoples&quot; appears to be missing after  &quot;Globalization
also permits.&quot;    
<P>
Page 4, paragraph 14, subparagraph a, line 2, add the following
language:  &quot;the gap between rich and poor, aggravated by
cultural factors and social mores, has increased.&quot;  This
addition recognizes that the economic gap between rich and poor
is not purely an economic phenomenon. In the United States, for
example, families headed by a single parent are five times more
likely to be poor than are families headed by two parents.  Casual
attitudes regarding divorce and sexual activity outside of marriage
have fueled these inequities.    
<P>
Page 6, paragraph (h).  Language is needed here to suggest, as
economically as possible, that &quot;family,&quot; while expressed
in different cultural and legal terms in many countries, nonetheless
has an archetypal and crosscultural meaning.  If we can speak
of &quot;equity and equality&quot; between men and women at various
points in the document, we can also make clear that the family
is an archetypal arrangement of man and woman, and their offspring,
and others related to them by  blood, marriage and adoption. 
<P>
Page 7, paragraph 21.  This paragraph needs to be strengthened
to include recognition of due  principles of subsidiarity and
of the possibility that government, even when wellmeaning, may
 overreach and become the principal obstacle to the attainment
of development.  Thus, language  should be added which states:
 We acknowledge the [primary] special responsibility of  governments,
particularly those units of government closest to and most accountable
to the  people, to attain these goals.  We also acknowledge that
they cannot be achieved by government  alone, and that, indeed,
governments may hinder development by overinvolvement in and 
disruption of healthy social and economic activity.    
<P>
Page 8, commitment 2, subparagraph b.  Modify to read:  &quot;the
provision of primary health care  and the promotion of reproductive
health and voluntary and informed family planning for  married
couples, reinforcement of the social and legal significance of
the archetypal family unit, safe drinking water ...&quot;  Addition
of &quot;voluntary&quot; is necessary to affirm the right of couples
to reject the &quot;provision&quot; of family planning; reference
to the marital couple is a natural correlative  of the term &quot;family&quot;
in family planning.  The role of the dissolution of the family
in fostering  intractable poverty is described above.    
<P>
Page 8, commitment 2, subparagraph c.  &quot;access to land, credit&quot;
should be modified to read  &quot;opportunity to acquire land,
credit ...&quot;  The emphasis must be on expanded opportunities,
and  the United Nations should make clear that it is not endorsing
policies of expropriation and confiscation of lawfully acquired
and owned resources.                                        
<P>
Page 9, commitment 4, subparagraph a.  &quot;Promote basic values
of respect for pluralism and  diversity, tolerance and responsibility,
political and personal freedom, nonviolence and solidarity ...&quot;
<P>
Page 10, commitment 4, subparagraph e:  &quot;central role of
the archetypal family.&quot; 
<P>
Page 10, commitment 5, subparagraph b:  &quot;Establish policies
[objectives and measurable goals] to  enhance gender balance.&quot;
 This language clearly stipulates the formulation of quotas for
political representation of women, presumably created and enforced
by the United Nations and its instrumentalities.  As such, this
language is at war with the declaration's expressed commitment
to respect for national sovereignty and decentralization of developmental
initiatives.  Moreover, it is  false in principle.  The key to
equity and equality is opportunity.  Government policies should
 indeed guarantee such opportunities, and those governments that
do so will reap the richest rewards in diverse and freely chosen
representation.  Republican forms of government are incompatible
with quotas, and republican forms are precisely those that have
proven most resilient in  expanding political participation by
all citizens.    
<P>
Page 10, commitment 5, subparagraph c.  In this context, there
is no reason to exclude men from protections against &quot;exploitation,
abuse and violence.&quot;  Violence against entrepreneurs in the
 United States, for example, frequently takes the form of attacks
upon disfavored ethnic groups  engaged in lawful business activity
in the cities.  Prejudice and violence against citizens of foreign
extraction is also common in many countries.  Both of these types
of phenomena are severe hindrances to the development of small
enterprises in economically depressed communities.  The selective
nature of much of this violence against men certifies it as an
issue of equity and equality.  Therefore, the subparagraph should
read:  &quot;Take effective measures to eliminate all kinds of
 exploitation, abuse and violence against men and women, with
particular attention to  immigrants, [women] refugees, and [women]
noncombatants in situations of armed conflict.&quot;    
<P>
Page 10, commitment 5, subparagraph d.  &quot;Encourage the ratification,
[removal of reservations,]  and implementation of all provisions
...&quot;  The United Nations is to be expected to encourage the
 ratification of international instruments approved by the General
Assembly.  Reservations, however, are a critical mechanism by
which sovereign nations adduce understandings that protect  important
cultural and legal values and policies.  In this particular regard,
reservations in many  nations preserve understandings regarding
special protections for women and mothers, and for  their offspring,
born and unborn.  The language as written is once again at war
with the declaration's commitment to respect national sovereignty.
 It is intrusive and should be modified as noted.    
<P>
Page 11, subparagraph d.  &quot;Increase official development
assistance, both in total and for social  programs, without coercion
or reducing the resources allocated to other sectors.&quot;  This
language is needed to address the continuing problem of assistance
linkage:  the withholding or threatened withholding of assistance
funds from nations which do not conform national policies to donor
nation's preferences in such areas as population control.  Addition
of coercion or reinforces the declaration's commitment to national
sovereignty.    
<P>
Page 11, commitment 7, subparagraph a.  &quot;Protect basic social
programs and expenditures, in  particular, those affecting the
weakest and most vulnerable segments of society, from acrosstheboard
budget reductions, while eliminating inefficient spending and
perverse incentives against work and family formation, and increasing
the quality of social expenditures.&quot;    
<P>
Page 12, commitment 8, subparagraph d.  &quot;Ensure that taxation
systems are fair, [and] economically efficient, and nonpunitive,&quot;
<P>
Page 16, paragraph 4.  &quot;Social development is also clearly
linked to the development of peace, freedom, stability and security
...  to promote social development requires a reorientation of
values, objectives, and priorities, in order to strengthen or
reform existing institutions and  policies.  Human dignity, [equity]
equal opportunity, freedom  and social justice must be ...&quot;
 The rationale for each of these suggested changes is outlined
in similar contexts above.  Note that the strengthening of all
existing institutions should clearly not be the objective of the
United  Nations in this declaration.  Many national institutions,
both private and public are, in fact,  destructive of human wellbeing.
 The declaration itself calls for reform of multilateral lending
 policies to the most debtridden nations.  No one, for example,
should support strengthening of  the UNFPA, which has exhibited
warm relations with national governments employing population
policies deeply destructive of human life and human freedom. 
<P>
Page 16, paragraph 5.  &quot;This same global community is threatened
by environmental degradation, epidemics, various forms of intolerance,
attacks and stresses upon the archetypal family unit, sexual exploitation
and the drug trade, violence and criminality . . . &quot;    
<P>
Page 16, paragraph 7.  &quot;Gender equity and equality of opportunity
[and the full participation of  women] in all economic, social
and political activities is essential.&quot;  Besides being redundant
as  written, this phrase could be abused to discourage governmental
policies that protect full or parttime homemakers and that permit
them to freely choose the terms of their participation in  economic
and other activities.  The right of families to establish their
own patterns of workfamily  involvement must be affirmed.  Another
alternative here is to change the word &quot;full&quot; to &quot;open.&quot;
  Ask yourself this question:  which nation of the world has the
fullest participation of women in  economic activities?  Clearly,
it is the People's Republic of China, with its cadres and worker
 brigades.  Free nations typically exhibit much more diverse and
complex arrangements, with equality of opportunity guaranteed
and norms of participation left to individual and family choice
and capability.  This is the more socially just and free condition.
<P>
Page 17, bulleted items:  Add &quot;a strengthened role for the
archetypal family, churches and  private associations for selfbetterment;&quot;
and &quot;public policies that discourage illegal and/or  selfdestructive
behaviors that shorten lifespan and/or reduce productivity.&quot;
 The latter  language should be unexceptionable; it is aimed at
such practices as smoking, drug abuse, and  activities that transmit
HIV and other diseases.  The impact of these factors on human
lifespan, productivity, and development is clearly massive.  
 
<P>
Page 18, paragraph 11, add a subparagraph e:  Promoting the expansion
of political freedom in the context of transitions to market economies,
and directing development assistance to smallscale and private
ventures that maximize individual creativity and initiative. 
<P>
Page 19, paragraph 13, subparagraph e:  &quot;... and ensuring
that subsidy systems benefit people in  poverty, avoid incentives
to nonproductive lifestyles and family breakup, and reduce disparities.&quot;
As noted above, family breakup is a key determinant and perpetuator
of poverty; subsidy  (welfare) programs should avoid designs that
punish intact families and reward illegitimacy.    
<P>
Page 19, paragraph 13, subparagraph g:  &quot;Assisting developing
canters and countries in transition to establish efficient, nonpunitive
and fair tax collection systems.&quot;    
<P>
Page 20, paragraph 14, subparagraph a:  &quot;Ensuring that institutions
 public, private, and  natural, including the family unit  and
agencies responsible for the design and implementation ...&quot;
 This language eliminates any possible bias toward governmental
institutions as  opposed to private and natural institutions engaged
in critical social development, primarily the family, business,
and religious denominations.    
<P>
Page 20, paragraph 14, subparagraph b:  The phrase &quot;full
transparency ... for all ... private  institutions&quot; raises
important questions for private associations, including churches,
which are  generally accorded far more freedom of action than
governmental and quasigovernmental  institutions that operate
with public funds.  This subparagraph should be amended to include
 language respecting the privacy rights of voluntary and religious
institutions except insofar as  necessary to meet generally accepted
standards of accountability under the laws of each nation.   Without
such language, private institutions are vulnerable to treatment
as publicly owned entities.  Therefore, add &quot;Nothing in this
subparagraph shall be construed to diminish the right of  voluntary
and religious institutions to appropriate privacy protections
consistent with generally accepted standards of accountability
under the law.&quot;    
<P>
Page 20, paragraph 14, subparagraph c:  Throughout the document,
no attempt is made to define  &quot;discrimination&quot; or to
limit in any way its application to only those characteristics
of persons  rightly regarded as &quot;neutral&quot;   ethnicity,
national origin, creed, gender, disability, etc.  It may be  better
to leave this term undefined, on the presumption that prevailing
national policies, which  generally protect only neutral characteristics,
are what is meant.  Nonetheless, the recent action in the European
Parliament to protect homosexual partnerships, and US initiatives
to expand &quot;domestic partnership&quot; legislation offer some
argument for defining &quot;discrimination&quot; here to mean
only the protection of neutral characteristics.  Possible language:
 &quot;Eliminating de jure  discrimination, while [ developing]
encouraging educational programmes and media campaigns  aimed
at eliminating de facto discrimination against persons based on
race, sex, national  origin, religion, political affiliation,
disability, or other characteristics unrelated to character or
performance.    
<P>
Page 20, paragraph 14, subparagraph d:  [reflect better]  better
reflects    
<P>
Page 20, paragraph 14, subparagraph f:  &quot;Making political
and social processes inclusive of all  lawabiding members of society
...&quot;  Many nationstates exclude criminals from access to
certain political and social processes.  The phrase as written,
like much of the declaration, is  susceptible of widely varying
interpretation, but as written it appears open to abuse.  The
best course of action may be to delete the phrase &quot;inclusive
of all members of society and&quot;, since &quot;respecting political
pluralism and cultural diversity&quot; sufficiently describes
an open political  system.    
<P>
Page 20, paragraph 15, subparagraph c:  &quot;ensuring that all
obstacles to full equity and equality  between women and men are
removed in all private and public institutions of society.&quot;
 The  dangers in this language are obvious.  The United Nations
is hereby committing itself to eliminating anything it regards
as inequities between men and women in private institutions. 
If  churches and parachurch organizations are excepted from this
proscription, that fact is not  mentioned.  These issues have
created tremendous friction and debate in the United States and
 elsewhere in the developed world.  Most US &quot;equal rights&quot;
statutes have been limited in their  application to &quot;public
accommodations,&quot; a term which embraces many private institutions
that  hold themselves forward as open to the public, but excludes
those, such as churches and other  religiously affiliated institutions,
which impose membership requirements based on creed.  Most US
statutes, with one or two exceptions, also exempt private, nonpublicly
supported clubs and  associations (e.g., the Boy Scouts, the YMCA).
 This principle should be protected here.  &quot;Public accommodations&quot;
is not a term common to UN documents.  I recommend revision to
read &quot;all  [private and] public and publicly accessible institutions
of society&quot;.    
<P>
Page 21, paragraph 16, subparagraph a:  The language as written
suggests governmental  interference with the media to ensure socially
constructive attitudes.  The goal is laudable, but its implementation
by government is violative of free speech standards and guarantees.
 The purposes  of government in this regard are better served
by policies that encourage the development of a diverse body of
mass media.  Increasing the body of media voices, not stifling
an errant few, is a proper sphere for government action.  It is
akin to averting the growth of monopolies in the economic sphere.
 If language stating this objective cannot be obtained, change
&quot;Ensuring&quot; to  &quot;Encouraging&quot; to leave this
objective in the realm of the bully pulpit.    
<P>
Page 21, paragraph 16, subparagraph c:  &quot;including on gender,
family and cultural issues ...&quot;  The paragraph as written
is narrow and excludes needed improvements in data collection
on  issues of family structure and culture.  For example, international
data preliminarily examined by scholars at the American Enterprise
Institute suggests a close linkage between infant mortality and
 family structure.  Gender analysis is one of only many relevant
possible areas for improvement.    
<P>
Page 21, paragraph 17, subparagraph d:  &quot;... policies to
combat terrorism, organized crime,  sexual exploitation and drug
trafficking.&quot;  This additional language gives higher visibility
and  priority to efforts to combat the exploitation of minors
in South Asia and elsewhere around the  world where the international
sex and pornography trade are officially ignored or inadequately
 resisted.    
<P>
Page 22, paragraph 20:  The personal dimension of poverty is excluded
from this analysis of the  origins of poverty.  It is most easily
addressed by modifying the first sentence of the paragraph to
read &quot;and cultural and personal values.&quot;  Without more,
however, this entire section focuses too  heavily on &quot;political
and economic structures&quot; and too lightly on personality structures
such as  selfdiscipline, deferral of gratification, honesty and
hard work.  To address this problem, add  after &quot;those who
cannot support themselves&quot; the following: &quot;to foster
personal qualities of selfdiscipline, honesty, hard work, and
the deferral of gratification;&quot;    
<P>
Page 24, paragraph 26, subparagraph a:  The most important indicator
of poverty is family  structure.  This indicator must be added
to the litany of poverty and vulnerability indicators.    
<P>
Page 26, paragraph 29, subparagraph a:  Language should be added
to the phrase &quot;redistributing  land&quot; to bar expropriation
and confiscation of lawfully owned and managed property.  The
US  Constitution includes a &quot;takings clause,&quot; which
obliges government to compensate owners for  lawfully expropriated
or attached property.  Even in developed countries, this principle
is  irregularly and inadequately followed.  This paragraph should
read:  &quot;encouraging the  redistribution of [redistributing]
land where necessary to foster a return to productive use  and
where full compensation and other due process of law is guaranteed
to lawful owners.&quot;    
<P>
Page 26, paragraph 30, subparagraph a:  &quot;access of people
living in poverty to responsible levels  of credit ...&quot; 
The United Nations should not require any lending institution
to make irresponsible  loans.  In fact, the declaration's clear
and repeated call for debt restructuring and forgiveness for 
developing nations dramatizes the fact that irresponsible lending
that ignores economic viability damages both the lending institution
and the dependent party.  This experience must be applied to micro
as well as macroeconomics.    
<P>
Page 26, paragraph 30, subparagraph c:  &quot;Providing incentives
for [, earmarking percentages of  the lending base].  In line
with the criticism noted above, lending institutions must retain,
for the sake of their depositors as well as the wellbeing of borrowers,
reasonable standards of viability and repayability for all loans
in their portfolio.  Encouraging lenders to provide responsible
levels  of credit to impoverished persons for socially valuable
purposes is a laudable aim, but setasides  and quotas can only
encourage distortions in the loan market and the placement of
irresponsible  loans.  This will not alleviate poverty and may,
in fact, hinder normal patterns of development.    
<P>
Page 27, paragraph 32, subparagraph b:  The phrase &quot;full
and equal access&quot; to health services  suggests that the same
standards of service that apply to women should apply to girls.
 The  implication is that services to be provided are identical
irrespective of maturity, marital status, or other factors.  Add
at the end of this sentence, &quot;with due regard for the responsibility
of  government to protect the vulnerability of the immature and
the sanctuary of the family.&quot;    
<P>
Page 28, paragraph 33, add a new subparagraph i, and adjust the
following subparagraph accordangle:  &quot;Encouraging the formation
and retention of stable family units, as a shield against poverty,
the appropriate locus for sexual expression, childbearing and
childrearing, and the essential factor in successful education
and the creation of productive and responsible  citizens.&quot;
<P>
Page 28, paragraph 34, subparagraph c:  The antagonism, in some
nations, between formal and  nonformal education for preschoolers
should be acknowledged.  To some extent, these objectives can
be mutually exclusive.  Numerous education experts believe that
nonformal education  within the family is significantly healthier
and more effective than early formal education before a child
is emotionally or psychologically ready to learn.  The best way
to address this concern is to add the word voluntary before &quot;preschool
education&quot; to assure that mandates do not drive out parental
education of young children in the home. 
<P>
Page 29, paragraph 34, subparagraph d:  Same changes as recommended
for Page 8, commitment 2, subparagraph b.    
<P>
Page 29, paragraph 34, subparagraph e:  Removing objectionable
language in this context may  prove impossible.  I recommend instead
that language be added to encourage the provision of  health care
to expectant mothers and the children they carry that will enable
them to carry those  children successfully to term.  &quot;Safe
motherhood&quot; must be made to be synonymous with safety for
 both mother and child  this is logical because, without the child,
it is not motherhood at all. The strategy of proabortion organizations
at Cairo was to move away from an individual conception  of maternal
health that focuses on the health of every motherandchild in utero
toward a collective, public healthoriented concept that denies
the need to protect the health of mother and child in all circumstances.
 This is one occasion where the faulty language in the declaration
can be improved by making it truly universal, i.e., protective
of all mothers and children.  Amend this language to read &quot;full
access to such services, including voluntary and informed reproductive
health/family planning care for married couples [and], education
on safe motherhood, and  supportive services for all expectant
mothers and the children they carry, [and prenatal and postnatal
care] both prenatally and postnatally.    
<P>
Page 29, paragraph 35, subparagraph e.  &quot;Expanding and strengthening
social insurance   programmes and tax policies to protect working
people ...&quot;  Burdensome taxation can subject  working families
to poverty.  Recently the United States reformed a program called
the Earned  Income Tax Credit to provide additional income to
lift working families above the poverty line.   Broadly considered,
this is a &quot;social insurance&quot; programme, but the key
is that it is based on an  alleviation of taxation on the working
family, not the direct imposition of a tax on families or  other
entities.   
<P>
Page 30, paragraph 36, subparagraph d:  &quot;Improving the status
of the single parent in society&quot; is  opposed to policies
that responsibly discourage the deliberate choice of single parenthood
or  sexual irresponsibility.  Assisting single parents to care
for their child is generally sound policy,  but even here society
gains nothing by refusing to recognize that promotion of adoption
is the  better alternative for many single mothers.  To avoid
these notional difficulties, amend this  subparagraph to read:
[&quot;Improving the status of the single parent in society and]
Ensuring that  singleparent families receive the social support
they need, include support for adequate housing and the child
care of their choice, with special emphasis on incentives for
marriage and  strengthening extended family networks.&quot;  
<P>
Page 32, paragraph 43, bullet one:  The &quot;full participation
of employers and trade unions&quot;  excludes the vast majority
of the world's workers.  Add &quot;nonunionized workers&quot;
to this phrase.    
<P>
Page 34, paragraph 46, add a subparagraph g:  &quot;Establishing
policies to encourage invention and entrepreneurship, to protect
the products of invention and entrepreneurship from  misappropriation,
and to provide inventors and entrepreneurs with access to capital
and  economic rewards sufficient to encourage the development
and introduction of new technologies and methods.&quot;  Much
technological development takes place outside &quot;national and
local technology institutions; indeed, the home computer revolution
was largely sparked by the  technical wizardry of two Americans
working out of a garage.  Assurance of economic rewards,  protection
of copyrights and patents, and access to capital are as or more
critical than support for technology institutions as a means to
promote employmentintensive growth.  Experience demonstrates that
governments cannot always predict, produce, or judge which technologies
will have the most profound impact in promoting economic growth
and human betterment.    
<P>
Page 34, paragraph 47, subparagraph d:  Revise to read &quot;increasing
family benefits and social  support such as equitable and substantial
financial support for all forms of child care, including care
at home.       
<P>
Page 38, paragraph 55, subparagraph d.  This paragraph is a glaring
demonstration of the  irreconcilability of the declaration's claimed
dedication to sovereignty and its clear commitment to utilize
United Nations instrumentalities to change attitudes toward the
division of paid labor and housework!  Many families around the
world obviously do not wish their attitudes to be changed.  They
believe explicitly in the social and childrearing advantages of
a single wageearner  structure.  They have no wish to impose those
structure on all peoples and families around the globe.  They
adopt such patterns as sequencing in which a primary caregiver,
usually the mother, leaves the paid labor force to devote herself
fulltime to the care of her family, only to return to paid labor
as the children enter formal schooling or are fully grown.  That
the United Nations would seek to use its resources to foster the
destruction of such patterns is reprehensible, but it will also
ultimately be futile.  This language is a retreaded version of
the most doctrinaire  feminism that is losing popularity even
in the most advanced nations.  If language of any kind is  needed,
it should state only &quot;Devising public policies that support
maximum family choice and empowerment over questions of parental
division of labor.&quot;  The reference to &quot;child care  facilities&quot;
appears to favor the least popular form of child care in the United
States, i.e.,  institutional child care.  This phrase should be
modified to read, as above, support for all forms  of child care,
including home care and family care.  The phrase profamily tax
relief should  also be added to this litany of workfamily policies,
as this issue transcends all the others in  promoting family freedom.
 Other objections could be raised to this paragraph, but these
are the  major ones.    
<P>
Page 38, paragraph 55, subparagraph e.  On the scale of public
values, encouraging fathers and  mothers to stay together is far
more important than using atomic scales to measure gender  equality
in diaperchanging and other domestic duties.  Nearly all studies
of child care issues point out that most parents would prefer
to have one or both working parents spend more time with their
children, if loss of income were not an issue.  The point is that
all of these subparagraphs ignore parental choice and parental
preferences and subordinate them to the goal of encouraging women
to take paid employment.  Other than ideology, it is not clear
why this should be so.  This  paragraph should be replaced with
one that reads:  Encouraging governments to recognize the unique
contributions of families with children and to adopt policies
that maximize parental time spent in childrearing activities and
minimize the need for families to spend inordinate time in paid
labor activities at the expense of overall family wellbeing. 
The goal here is to encourage at least some form of a family wage
system that leaves each parent's role as the parents mutually
agree.  Parttime, flexible, and home working schedules promote
this result, as well.    
<P>
Page 41, paragraph 64, add to the last bullet item listed:  &quot;violence,
crime, drug abuse and  trafficking, sexual exploitation, and other
behaviors that diminish productivity, shorten lifespan and spread
disease.  This language is needed to assure that &quot;respect
for diversity&quot; does not  include respect for actions that
involve a dimension of personal immorality.  &quot;Diversity&quot;
properly means neutral differences, not moral disputes about issues
of character.    
<P>
Page 41, paragraph 66, subparagraph c:  Revise to read &quot;Giving
community organizations,  private associations and natural institutions
like the family greater control . . .&quot;                  
<P>
Page 42, paragraph 67, subparagraph a:  The phrase &quot;as appropriate&quot;
may suffice to address  concern about the overextension of prohibitions
on discrimination to distinctly moral categories. Marriage laws
currently &quot;discriminate&quot; against samegender pairs. 
Enacting legislation to  reverse this situation would be inappropriate,
but it may be wiser to nail this down with some  effort to define
unacceptable discrimination.  Note the language at page 40, paragraph
59 that  comes close to defining the scope of acceptable prohibitions
on discrimination:  &quot;different groups which are defined by
language, ethnicity, religion, geography or class.&quot;  This
internal definition  may offer a route to an acceptably limited
definition of discrimination, with the addition of gender and
disability.    
<P>
Page 42, paragraph 67, subparagraph b:  [removal of reservations],
for the reasons noted above.    
<P>
Page 45, paragraph 71, subparagraph a:  In many places in the
declaration, the emphasis on the  elimination of violence against
certain groups in society (armed conflict, for example) is culturally
true and entirely appropriate.  Here it is mystifying.  Young
males are disproportionately the victims of homicide (at the hands
of other young males, in most cases) in developed countries, including
the United States.  On the general issue of social violence, thereis
absolutely no need for gender oneupmanship.  The United Nations
should never jettison concern for violence against young men,
who are among the most pathetic victims of family breakup in advanced
societies.  I recommend ending the first sentence of this paragraph
as follows, &quot;with particular attention to vulnerable persons
who are the most frequent victims of violent acts.&quot;  Crime
and violence are pervasive enough that they should never be turned
into mere group politics.    
<P>
Page 47.  Nearly every word on this page illustrates the tension
in this document between its  repeated pledges to respect and
promote &quot;decentralization,&quot; government &quot;closest
to the people,&quot;  &quot;national sovereignty,&quot; &quot;small
business entrepreneurs&quot; and &quot;grassroots/community organizations.&quot;
   As national strategies are here designed, &quot;priorities
and time frames&quot; are the responsibility of national governments.
 &quot;Massive political will to invest in people&quot; is required
to achieve these goals.  All of this is &quot;primarily the responsibility
of national Governments.&quot;  The declaration does not strive
to reconcile these contradictory themes and objectives.  In small
nationstates, national Governments may in fact be close to the
people.  In large nations, they are remote, and the general direction
of policy reform is running counter to central government solutions.
 The declaration's only attempt to resolve this problem is to
include language at various points that expresses all points of
view.  The irony of the United nations amassing resources and
summoning political will to promote local solutions ought not
to miss anyone's attention.  There are far too many problems with
this page to fix it, but it is probably the clearest expression
yet of the authors' actual intent in devising the programme of
action.    
<P>
Page 48, paragraph 75, prologue:  Include family counseling and
assistance among the spheres  of work done by NGOs.          
<P>
Page 49, paragraph 76, subparagraph f:  This paragraph includes
the first reference in the  document to &quot;debate&quot; about
the direction of social policy.  The rest of the declaration could
be  improved by correcting this omission and recognizing that
the most progressive nations are those that have the most debate
about all of the issues covered by the document.    
<P>
Page 50, paragraph 77, subparagraph a:  add nonpunitive before
&quot;taxes&quot;; add at the end or that  provide incentives
for selfdefeating and selfdestructive behaviors.    
<P>
Page 52, paragraph 82.  This paragraph broaches the possibility
of vesting the United Nations  with taxing authority.  This idea
is only surfaced here, but its philosophical implications are
 profound.  It raises the possibility that the United Nations
Economic and Social Council will take on the characteristics of
an extralateral, rather than multilateral institution.  Such a
mechanism  would inevitably diminish individual nations' role
in managing and overseeing the development of  United Nations
policy.  This paragraph deserves wide publicity and debate now.
 Similar concerns are raised by the references to international
taxation and involuntary financing of the United  Nations at paragraphs
85 b and 86 g.

<p>
The Clinton Administration's women-in-combat policy has created
an atmosphere which may make it difficult for officers to comply
with combat-related military service.  The recent case of Navy
helicopter pilot Lieutenant Commander Ken Carkhuff illustrates
the unfortunate turn that the pursuit of a gender-blind military
may be taking for the US Navy and for those who object to the
policy. 
<P>
On August 24, 1994, Carkhuff told his executive officer, &quot;I
cannot take this detachment to sea.&quot;  The detachment included
two female pilots, and Carkhuff later explained, &quot;I could
not appear to endorse a policy [the women-in-combat policy] that
I didn't agree with.&quot; Carkhuff's statement disqualified him
from leading his detachment. His commander relieved him of his
duties and two officer boards have concluded that Carkhuff should
be honorably discharged from the service.[1]
<P>
Carkhuff told the &quot;show cause&quot; board on May 18, 1995,
&quot;I think that we should not be subjecting... women to violence,
and there is no more extreme violence that a human can be involved
in than in combat.&quot;[2]  He said that he was not anxious to confront
the policy and stated that he had no objection to women serving
in the Navy.[3]
<P>
Carkhuff had, in fact, just completed a year at the Naval War
College where the issue of women in combat was debated extensively.
 He had strong and religiously-based views on this issue.  The
day he privately stated his view to his boss corresponded to the
birth of his fifth child, a daughter.  Carkhuff feared that leading
women into a possible combat situation [the US invasion of Haiti
was weeks away] would incrementally lead to expanded combat roles
for women and perhaps his own daughter's forced combat role in
the future.
<P>
Commander Carkhuff did state at the hearing that &quot;if ordered
to execute that policy, I will do it.&quot;[4]  Nevertheless, the
Navy stood by its decision to discharge him honorably.
<P>
This case raises questions about a double standard at work in
the Navy on the issue of voicing personal opinions about women
in combat.  In 1992, uniformed female Navy officers gathered on
Capitol Hill to lobby against the female combat 
ban, labeling it an &quot;equal opportunity issue.&quot;  The
Navy ignored regulations which restrict uniformed sailors from
personal lobbying and did not discipline these officers.  However,
Carkhuff's private protest resulted in an honorable discharge.
 This would demonstrate that violations committed while protesting
in support of women in combat are ignored, while those protests
against the policy of women in combat are punished.
<P>
More importantly, this case raises questions about whether the
Navy is in danger of losing good men due to its women-in-combat
policy.  Carkhuff was a proven officer with consistently high
performance ratings.  Assuming there are other exemplary men who,
because of such policies, will cut short their military careers,
the military does not profit.  Nor does it profit from the fact
that this policy may discourage some would-be &quot;top guns&quot;
from responding to recruitment appeals to pursue a military career.
<P>
The Clinton Administration has erased more than 250,000 combat
exemptions for women.  Today, women can be assigned to 95 percent
of all Navy billets.  Feminists say this is progress, but combat
veterans and our combat-hardened allies know this portends disaster.
 In fact, the Navy's policy of women in combat is contrary to
the findings of the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment
of Women in the Armed Forces.
<P>
The board reviewing Carkhuff did not find that Carkhuff lacked
the ability to perform.  According to Navy documents, he is being
honorably separated for disagreeing with a politically sensitive
policy, and for refusing to perform a duty.
<P>
When officers so strongly protest, it is time for the Pentagon
and Congress to reconsider the wisdom of policies that increase
the combat role of women.  Men like Carkhuff deserve the opportunity
to honorably serve, rather than have their careers cut short by
an unfortunate and dangerous policy.

<h2>MARRIAGE PROTECTS WOMEN<br>
FROM VIOLENCE</h2>

<p>
Studies and pronouncements about violence against women continue
to make headlines.  Recently, the Justice Department announced
that a redesigned national survey found that violence against
women is much higher than previously reported.  The survey also
reveals that marriage often shields women from violence.  
<P>
Any violence against women should be strongly condemned, and offenders
should be punished to the full extent of the law.   But some feminists
exaggerate the real scope of this tragic problem using unvetted
advocacy research.   Consider some advocacy reporting:
<UL>
<LI>&quot;There are three to four million women beaten by husbands
or lovers every year; that's one every 15 seconds.&quot;  (<I>Chicago
Tribune</I>, February 10, 1992)
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>&quot;Four million to six million women are beaten [each year].
 That means once every five seconds...a woman is punched or kicked...or
held down and pummeled.&quot;  (Associated Press)[1]
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Miami talk-show host Pat Stevens told a <I>Crossfire</I> audience
that 60 million women are abused every year.[2]
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>Ms</I>. magazine's &quot;Campus Project on Sexual Assault&quot;
claims that 15.4 percent of college women are raped and 12.1 percent
experience an attempted rape each year.[3]
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>When President Clinton named Bonnie Campbell to head the &quot;Violence
Against Women&quot; office at the Justice Department, he said
there are 700,000 rapes or attempted rapes every year.[4]
</UL>
<P>
<P>
The bases for these &quot;facts&quot; are seldom given and they
should be suspect.  After all, there are 31,536,000 seconds in
a year.  If an American woman is victimized every 15 seconds,
then there are in reality 2,124,000 incidents.  Five million violent
female victimizations would be one every 6.3 seconds.
<P>
The August, 1995 Bureau of Justice Statistics study, &quot;Violence
Against Women: Estimates from the Redesigned Survey,&quot; provides
a different, although, sobering picture.[5]
Men are far more likely to be victims of crime (64.9 v. 43.7 per
1,000 persons) than women.[6]   But women are nine times more likely
than men to become rape/sexual assault victims.[7]   That figure
is higher than previously reported.
<P>
The new survey estimates there are 500,200 female victimizations
each year which includes 172,400 completed rapes and 141,200 attempted
rapes.[8]  In comparison, the FBI previously reported 109,062 forcible
rapes for 1992, which was a 38.2 percent rise in the total number
of reported rapes and a 27 percent rate increase since 1973.[9]
<P>
The study is based on the redesigned National Crime Victimization
Survey (NCVS) which is a continuous nationally representative
sample of 50,000 households.  The latest report includes the years
1992-1993 and with revised questions it found that the average
annual rate of violent victimization per 1,000 women rose from
5.4 in 1987-91 to 9.4.[10]
<P>
The woman's relationship to the offender is a key variable.  The
1995 study found that a woman is three times more likely to be
raped or sexually assaulted by a boyfriend and 10 times more likely
to be raped or sexually assaulted by an acquaintance thanby a
spouse.  Single women are just as likely to be raped or sexually
assaulted by a stranger as they are by a boyfriend.[11]
<P>
When all acts of violence against women are considered, married
or widowed women are 30 times less likely than separated women
to become violence victims.  Married women are at least four times
less likely than never-married women to be crime victims.[12]
<P>
The study also found that women aged 19-29 are the most likely
violence victims.  They are twice as likely to become victims
as 30 to 45 year old women and 12 to 18 year old girls.[13]  Although
the Justice Department report does not explain the difference,
U.S. Census Bureau statistics show that the older female cohort
tends to be married and the younger cohort is more likely to live
in homes where there is a protecting father.[14]
<P>
Family income also makes a big difference.  Women from middle
income families tend to be four times safer than those from families
with incomes under $10,000.  Education, ethnicity and race are
not major violence discriminators.[15]
<P>
<center><h3>CONCLUSIONS ABOUT VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN</h3></center>
<P>
Incidents of rape and sexual assault are officially higher than
previously reported but do not come close to the figures offered
by some advocacy researchers.  Based on the new survey it's too
early to determine whether violence against women is rising. 
But it's clear that the offender/victim relationship is key and
deserves more attention.
<P>
Young women (19-29 years old), who have never married (or are
separated) and have low incomes are most vulnerable to violence.
 Their offenders are more likely to be known to them, and crime
by non-strangers usually occurs at or near the woman's home. 
<P>
The survey shows that marriage protects all female cohorts from
every type of violence.  Married women are safer than single,
separated, divorced and never-married women.    
<P>
Marriage also reduces violent crime incidents among men.  It helps
to channel male aggression toward positive goals.  Never-married
men are more likely to commit assault and they suffer most (58.9
percent) assaults.[16]  They are also five times more likely to rape
and commit other violent crime than married men.[17]
<P>
The Justice Department's latest report should encourage government
to harness marriage as a shield against violence.  The report
also tells American women and girls that the safest place today
is living in homes with their husbands and fathers.

<h2>THE STRAIGHT STORY<br>
ON NEW JERSEY:<br>
BIRTHS, ABORTIONS, AND THE FAMILY CAP</h2>

<p>
In August of 1993, the first &quot;family cap&quot; in the nation
took effect in the state of New Jersey as part of a larger package
of reforms known as the Family Development Program.  The family
cap provision stipulates that a mother who has already received
welfare benefits for at least 10 months and who bears an additional
child will receive no increase in her basic monthly AFDC benefit.
 The provision affects only the monthly <I>cash</I> benefit, however.
 Health benefits and food stamps continue to increase with family
size.
<P>
The raw numbers of births and abortions in New Jersey since the
cap took effect strongly suggest that the policy has reduced the
number of births to AFDC mothers without affecting the abortion
rate.
<P>
Raw data for the 20-month period from August 1992 to March 1994
appears in Table 1:

<P>
The total number of abortions in the year before the policy took
effect was 11,817, yielding a monthly average of 984.75.  In the
eight months after the policy took effect (including March 1994,
which had a far higher total of abortions than any other month
on record), the total number of abortions was 7,932, yielding
a monthly average of 991.5.  The difference (0.7%) is trivial
and well within the expected range of random fluctuation.  If
the anomalous month of March were excluded from the analysis,
the average would be just 953 abortions per month after the introduction
of the family cap -- a 3% decline from the previous year's average,
but also trivial enough to be within the range of random fluctuation.
<P>
A more comprehensive look at the data reduces the significance
of the difference even further.  The average monthly caseload
in the year before the family cap was enacted was 121,479.  In
the eight months post-cap, the average monthly caseload was 122,679
-- a difference of less than 1%.  But the monthly abortion rate
(number of abortions per 1,000 AFDC cases) was 8.11 in the year
prior to enactment of the family cap and only 8.08 in the eight
months post-enactment.  The difference is too small to be statistically
significant, but it is worth noting that the total number of abortions
in the period after implementation of the cap was three <I>fewer</I>
than predicted by the rate before enactment of the policy.
<P>
Using the entire preceding year as the baseline, however, tends
to distort the real effect of the family cap because the abortion
rate was very low in the period ranging from August to November
1992.  During the eight months immediately preceding the introduction
of the cap (December 1992 to July 1993), New Jersey welfare mothers
underwent 8,144 abortions -- 212 <I>more</I> than in the eight
months after the cap took effect.  If the post-cap data did not
include the month of March 1994, moreover, the post-cap abortion
average would have been 8% less than the average for the previous
seven months.
<P>
No responsible statistician would therefore conclude that the
family cap must reduce abortions.  But an honest evaluation of
the available data strongly argues that, contrary to the fears
expressed by many in the pro-life community, the family cap has
had no impact on the number or rate of abortions among New Jersey's
AFDC recipients.  The monthly abortion totals fluctuated with
no apparent pattern, but were always within the expected range.
 The total number of abortions in the eight months post-cap was
almost exactly what would have been projected if there had been
no change in the state's welfare policy.
<P>
The birth rate among AFDC recipients, on the other hand, was significantly
lower after introduction of the family cap.  In the year prior
to the cap, the total number of births to welfare mothers in New
Jersey was 15,972, yielding a monthly average of 1,331 births
and a monthly rate of 10.96 births per thousand AFDC recipients.
 In the eight months post-cap, there were 9,519 births, yielding
a monthly average of 1,190 births and a monthly rate of 9.70 births
per thousand AFDC recipients.  The difference is consistent, substantial,
and statistically significant.
<P>
In all eight months after the introduction of the cap, the birth
totals were below the previous year's average and lower than the
total for the corresponding month in the previous year.  The monthly
abortion totals after implementation of the cap show a more random
pattern.  In six of the eight months, there were fewer abortions
than the previous year's average, but in only three of those months
was the abortion total lower than the total for the corresponding
month the year before.
<P>
When the entire 20-month period is divided into 4-month increments
(see Table 2), the change in the average number of births is obvious.
 The family cap has produced a significant reduction in the number
of births and pregnancies, but has had no discernible impact on
the number of abortions.

<HR>
<P>
<P>
The only way to calculate a higher abortion rate for the post-cap
period is to suppress the data from April to July 1993 -- the
period immediately prior to implementation of the new policy --
and compare the abortion totals from the post-cap period with
the totals from the corresponding months of the previous year.
 <I>Unless the April to July 1993 data is suppressed, </I>the
abortion rate after implementation of the family cap appears to
be either the same as or lower than the abortion rate before the
cap.
<P>
There are only two hypotheses that could justify suppressing the
April to July 1993 data and preserve the finding that the abortion
rate has increased since implementation of the cap.
<P>
First, it is possible that the abortion rate follows an annual
cyclical pattern and that the monthly abortion totals from April
to July 1994 will show the same inflation as in 1993.  But a close
examination of the month-by-month totals suggests that the high
months and low months in the two years do not correspond with
enough consistency to indicate a seasonal cycle.  In 1992-1993,
the months with high abortion totals were October, January, and
March, while August, November, and December registered low totals.
 In 1993-1994, August and March were the months with a high number
of abortions, and the September total was relatively low.
<P>
The second hypothesis is that welfare mothers may have staged
an &quot;abortion rush&quot; prior to implementation of the family
cap, thereby generating unusually high abortion totals in the
months immediately preceding the change in policy.  But the single
month in which an &quot;abortion rush&quot; would have been most
visible, July 1993, had a lower abortion total than either June
1993 or August 1993.  The number of abortions declined between
June and July and increased between July and August.  The time
period with the highest number of abortions spanned six months,
from March to August -- straddling the enactment date -- and then
was followed by six months of low abortion totals after implementation
of the family cap.
<P>
While it is still premature to draw any decisive conclusions from
the welfare reform experiment in New Jersey, it is becoming increasingly
fantastic to claim that the state has experienced an upsurge in
abortions since the family cap took effect.  The reported &quot;increase&quot;
in abortions rests on a statistical illusion created by suppressing
data from the four-month period immediately preceding the policy
change -- which includes the highest abortion totals recorded
in the data under study.
<P>
Those who would hold welfare reform hostage in the name of saving
lives bear a significant burden of proof in maintaining that more
lives will be saved by preserving the current welfare system.
 The consistent, strong correlation between increased welfare
spending and increased abortions should be far more troublesome
data to pro-lifers than the most recent numbers from New Jersey.

<h2>RENEWING THE AMERICAN DREAM<br>
FOR EDUCATION</h2>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<i>Jennifer A. Marshall</i></center>
<p>
High-profile advocates of public education lack an inspiring vision
for the educational renewal of America.  President Bill Clinton,
Secretary of Education Richard Riley, Congress, teacher union
bosses -- all alternately cheerlead and criticize, but their discussions
usually degenerate into bickering over funding, equity, and the
competitiveness of the American economy.  Ultimately, they are
concerned about the educational <I>system</I> and its place in
the larger context of American society and the national economy.
Little of what they have to say deals with the real stuff of
education.
<p>
Dorothy Sayers, an author and a contemporary of C.S. Lewis, articulated
half a century ago the foolishness of focusing on the system and
thereby missing the whole aim of education:
<p><blockquote>
What use is it to pile task on task and prolong the days of labor,
if at the close the chief object is left unattained?  It is not
the fault of the teachers -- they work only too hard already.
 The combined folly of a civilization that has forgotten its own
roots is forcing them to shore up the tottering weight of an educational
structure that is built upon sand....  For the sole true end of
education is simply this:  to teach men how to learn for themselves;
and whatever instruction fails to do this is effort spent in vain.[1]
</blockquote><p>
Sayers clearly had a vision of what education ought to be.
<p>
Today, once again, those with the academic zeal that rallies others
to renew education have a vision that goes beyond the realities
of the public school system.  Their common sense, optimistic ideas
are not constrained by the inadequacies of a federally run education
bureaucracy.  As Frenchman Alexis de Tocqueville remarked in 1835,
such freedom from bureaucracy is -- or at least once was -- distinctively
American:  &quot;Uniformity or permanence of design, the minute
arrangement of details, and the perfection of administrative system
must not be sought for in the United States; what we find there
is the presence of a power which, if it is somewhat wild, is at
least robust....&quot;[2] Homeschooling and classical education
exemplify this genius and vibrancy of the American people.
<p>
<center><h3>SCHOOLING BY THE TRUE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</h3></center>
<p>
We have long known that the &quot;true department of education,&quot;
as author Douglas Wilson refers to the family, is the institution
behind the success of the homeschool movement.[3] Recent scholarship,
however, shows the role of the family in the academic success
of children in all settings. Because parents are vested with the
authority and responsibility to oversee their children's upbringing,
especially their education, homeschooling ought not to be considered
the method of last resort, but a first option.  Recent scholarship
demonstrates that, no matter what the school setting, family is
the key factor in the academic success of children.[4]
<p>
Critics may view homeschoolers as somewhat reclusive, but the
flourishing movement contributes to society much more than they
recognize.  Increased interaction within the family counters the
individualism and the &quot;generation gaps&quot; created by the
secular culture.  With some 400,000 families currently homeschooling,
the movement has also become a gathering point for inter-family
relations.  Networks and support groups abound (see the addendum
for a sample listing).  Though the homeschooling movement takes
a back-to-basics approach to academics, it is thoroughly progressive
when it comes to using the latest technology.  CompuServe and
America Online forums provide helpful hints on raising kids, curriculum
tips, homework help, and an ongoing discussion of a new ideal
for education.
<p>
Homeschoolers are some of the most politically involved private
citizens in America.  Politicians have learned not to trifle with
the &quot;stay-at-home mom&quot; with a phone tree, a fax machine,
and a firm devotion to raising well-grounded children.  Initially
a measure for self-defense, homeschoolers' lobbying efforts have
strengthened the platform for all families in America.   Nationwide
homeschool networks have proven to be very effective avenues of
communication.  The Home School Legal Defense Association, located
outside of Washington, D.C., disseminates regular alerts calling
homeschoolers to action when threats to their -- and everyone's
-- freedom arise.
<p>
Bill and Mary Pride and their nine children are the epitome of
a fully engaged homeschooling family.  Ranging from toddlers to
teens, the kids are all taught at home and always have been. 
The Pride children's educational package takes advantage of everything
from traditional material to on-line computer classes.  To share
their good news in education, the Prides publish a quarterly magazine
called <i>Practical Homeschooling</i> with 96 pages of suggestions
for networking, critiques of curriculum and software, discussions
of educational theories and lighthearted openness about the joys
and trials of the homeschooling life.  Mary does much of the writing
herself and also gathers articles from some of the most staunchly
conservative education thinkers in the nation, including Samuel
Blumenfeld and Doug Wilson.  <I>Practical Homeschooling</I> now
has an on-line site of its own which includes forums for Q &amp;
A on homeschooling pragmatics and on-line chats with contributing
authors.
<p>
<center><h3>THE RETURN OF CLASSICAL EDUCATION</h3></center>
<p>
Truly a timeless educational philosophy, classical education has
now hit cyberspace and become the subject of much chatting in
homeschool online forums.  The resurgence of this medieval model
of education is due in large part to Douglas Wilson, author of
<I>Recovering the Lost Tools of Learning.</I>  His title refers
to the essay which inspired his efforts, entitled, &quot;The Lost
Tools of Learning,&quot; by Dorothy Sayers.  Miss Sayers' 1947
critique of education stall efforts in an apt commentary on America's
system of public education in the '90s:
<p><blockquote>
We dole out lip-service to the importance of education -- lip-service
and, just occasionally, a little grant of money; we postpone the
school-leaving age, and plan to build bigger and better schools;
the teachers slave conscientiously in and out of school hours;
and yet, as I believe, all this devoted effort is largely frustrated,
because we have lost the tools of learning, and in their absence
can only make a botched and piecemeal job of it.[5]
</blockquote><p>
What she goes on to describe as &quot;the lost tools of learning&quot;
are the disciplines of Grammar, Logic, and Rhetoric.  These are
the tools with which students must be equipped, she argues, in
order to tackle the content of any subject.  Sayers considers
Latin an important learning tool as well.  As the key to so many
languages, to the vocabulary of science, and to historical documents,
she estimates that in most subject areas, a knowledge of Latin
would cut learning time by half.  The study of Latin, and not
the &quot;dumbing down&quot; of the test, may prove to be the
surest way to recoup lost ground on the verbal section of the
SAT.
<p>
The contemporary relevance of Miss Sayers' insights is astonishing.
 While federal bureaucrats set a National Education Goal that
all our children will start school ready to learn, Sayers points
out that children are by nature sponges ready to absorb information.
 For those who disparage memorization and the accumulation of
factual knowledge, she points out that young children love litanies
of information.  She gives a whole new meaning to age appropriateness,
a topic of great discussion in the teaching colleges, by tying
Grammar, Logic, and Rhetoric to a child's stages of mental development.
 And how about Latin, as Sayers suggests, for early childhood
education?  &quot;The Lost Tools of Learning&quot; ought to be
required reading in every teacher education class; it cuts through
the confusion and inconsistencies of modern educational theory.
 Sayers' vision is idealistic yet practical; it has the power
to inspire and the wisdom to work.
<p>
Doug Wilson has demonstrated that effectiveness.  Fourteen years
ago he founded Logos School, a distinctively Christian school
based on the Sayers' model of classical education.  Today there
are some thirty member schools in his Association of Classical
and Christian Schools (ACCS).   &quot;These schools are engaged
in what might be one of the most important educational reforms
of our time,&quot; writes Dr. Gene Veith, Dean of Arts and Sciences
at Concordia University.[6] Dr. Veith is in the midst of a year-long
study of classical education.  While modern education disintegrates,
notes Dr. Veith, these classical schools are &quot;recovering
the very approach to education that gave birth to Western civilization
and has continually brought that civilization to renewal.&quot;
 The re-popularization of classical education is timely indeed.
<p>
<center><h3>THE GREAT BOOKS</h3></center>
<p>
While equipping students with grammar, logic, and rhetoric, classical
education focuses on the great literary works of Western civilization,
something modern schools do less and less as contemporary books
replace the old.  The neglect of great books in the schools is
a symptom of a wider cultural trend, as evidenced by the disappearance
of classics from many libraries across the nation.  The Family
Research Council study, &quot;Discarded Images:  Selected Classics
and American Libraries,&quot; by Charles Donovan and William Spont,
documents this phenomenon.
<p>
Large tomes of collected works with ancient bindings may intimidate
the modern reader, but C.S. Lewis argues that old books are not
merely for the expert, but especially for the ordinary reader:
<p><blockquote>
[I]f the average student wants to find out something about Platonism,
the very last thing he thinks of doing is to take a translation
of Plato off the library shelf and read the <I>Symposium</I>.
 He would rather read some dreary modern book ten times as long,
all about 'isms' and influences and only once in twelve pages
telling him what Plato actually said....  But if he only knew,
the great man, just because of his greatness, is much more intelligible
than this modern commentator....  It has always therefore been
one of my main endeavours as a teacher to persuade the young that
first-hand knowledge is not only more worth acquiring than second-hand
knowledge, but is usually much easier and more delightful to acquire.[7]
</blockquote><p>
In contrast, Lewis advises the ordinary reader to take up the
old books &quot;precisely because he is an amateur and therefore
much less protected than the expert against the dangers of an
exclusive contemporary diet.  A new book is still on its trial
and the amateur is not in a position to judge it.&quot;[8] Classical
education has taken the precaution of going back to the revered
classics.
<p>
<center><h3>NEW CONCLUSIONS FROM OLD PRINCIPLES</h3></center>
<p>
While homeschool and classical education may be perceived as eccentric,
esoteric, and even impractical because of their intense pursuit
of &quot;intellectualism,&quot; they are actually thoroughly pragmatic.
 Both models guide students through the learning process efficiently
and deliberately.  The educational sequence is logical and meaningful.
 Meanwhile, we continue to fund a modern public school system
that measures hours spent in school (&quot;seat time&quot;), where
the curriculum is so disjointed that classroom teachers are hard
pressed to answer students' question, &quot;Why do we have to
learn this?&quot;  Convoluted attempts to standardize and individualize
simultaneously have resulted in a dysfunctional system.
<p>
The traditional methods espoused by homeschooling and classical
education strike just the balance the public school system lacks.
 They hold a universally high standard of excellence, and an inherent
standardization which comes from keeping educationally on-task.
 Yet the homeschool and classical models are also much more individualized
than the public school classroom, not only on the basis of size,
but also in personal attention to the development of each child's
mind.  While in the modern system the outcome is paramount, in
classical education and homeschooling the process is just as important
as the end.
<p>
Classical education and homeschooling recognize that different
students have varying strengths, and that each student should
be strengthened in all domains.  Where public education has gradually
excluded certain subjects (art, music, logic, etc.) from the core
curriculum and advised teachers to cater to all learning styles
in the remaining subjects, homeschool and classical education
have embraced the classical liberal arts which train students
in the whole spectrum of knowledge.  A student may excel in one
area and struggle in another, but he will grow in all.
<p>
Leaders of public education would do well to take cues from their
competitors.  Commitment to the system, however, continues to
prevent many from recognizing potentials for renewal. Consequently,
significant overhaul of the public school system may be the only
remedy.  As Doug Wilson notes, this is exactly what William Bennett,
former Secretary of Education, suggested after the Governors'
education summit in 1989, which initiated the America 2000/Goals
2000 agenda:
<p><blockquote>
I'd give the education reform movement another five years.  If
we're not able to get our schools back to where they were in 1963,
after spending 40 percent more, then maybe we should just declare
bankruptcy, give the people back their money, and let them start
their own schools.  That would be a radical way to have accountability.[9]
</blockquote><p>
Time's up.   The people have started their own schools and they
have already outdone the public school system.   We want our money
back.

<title>MEDICAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS</title>

<h2>MEDICAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS:<br>
GOOD FOR HEALTH CARE REFORM,<br>
GOOD FOR FAMILIES</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%>
<p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Catherine A. Deeds</i></center>
<p>
<center><h3>CURRENT HEALTH CARE SITUATION</h3></center>
<p>
Last year's historic health care debate proved -- to the surprise
of no one but the Clinton Administration -- that American families
will not tolerate federal bureaucrats or &quot;gatekeepers&quot;
in Washington dictating their medical services and choice of doctors.
  A government-run, &quot;one size <I>must </I>fit all&quot; health
policy violates Americans' fundamental principles of freedom.
<p>
An overwhelming majority (roughly 85 percent) of small businesses
provide health insurance for their employees but they should not
be <I>forced</I> to pay for them through a federal mandate, as
Clinton's plan would have required.  A government mandate costs
wages and jobs in the long run and is not the way to reform health
care or help the uninsured population. 
<p>
While employer-provided health benefits may address the problem
of health care &quot;access,&quot;  they do not address the problem
of rising health care costs, which everyone agrees needs to be
addressed.  The national debate on health care reform debunked
the &quot;Washington knows best&quot; philosophy in favor of innovative
state and free-market health care initiatives.  At the forefront
of free-market reform is the concept of medical savings accounts
(also known as MSAs, Medisave accounts, or Medical IRAs).  They
are the centerpiece of the Republicans' health care plan and have
proved popular with the 2,000 private companies that now have
them.  The basic premise is that MSAs empower consumers to make
their own decisions about spending on routine health care, choose
their own doctors, and save unspent account funds from year to
year to pay for future health or retirement needs.  By contrast,
the present &quot;third-party payer&quot; system offers no incentive
to spend wisely because someone else -- the government or private
insurance --  is paying the bill. 
<p>
This year, a bipartisan Congressional proposal to make MSAs tax
free (like traditional health insurance) has 130 cosponsors and
prospects for passage are good.  Congressional Republicans have
advocated MSAs as a potential cost-saving measure for Medicare
recipients as well.
<p>
<I>This year $1 trillion was spent on health care, accounting
for one-seventh of the nation's entire economy</I>.  As costs
rise, consumers pay higher premiums for their health insurance.
 For the most part, consumers are spending the money of a third
party -- the insurance company or government.  When this is the
case, common sense shows that consumers will not spend frugally
or wisely.  Why should they?   Former Surgeon General C. Everett
Koop likened the present third-party payer system to this:  The
government invites people to pick out a new car, charge it to
a card they issue, and then pays the bill.  The problem with this
system is that no one buys a Hyundai.  They all buy Cadillacs
and BMWs.
<p>
Our present health care system discourages competition and cost-consciousness
because, unlike car insurance, the consumer does not see the bill
or, for the most part, use his own money to pay for services.
 Therefore, there is no incentive to shop for lower-cost medical
care.  The administrative costs of processing insurance claims
for the majority of employers account for up to 35 percent of
total premium costs, and average 25 percent of premium costs for
the majority of employers.
<p>
This is the case because traditional indemnity/health insurance
plans tend to stipulate a low-deductible (out-of-pocket) amount
of $100-$250.  In other words, once the consumer has paid the
first $250 out of pocket for his family's medical care, the insurance
begins to pay.  That seems like a good deal but it is very expensive
in the long run because of high administrative costs and the lack
of cost-consciousness that the third-party payment system instills.
<p>
It would make better economic sense for businesses or individuals
to purchase a &quot;high-deductible&quot; health insurance plan
(which costs less in monthly premiums), combined with an MSA for
health care expenses below the deductible level.  (This type of
arrangement, however, does not enjoy equitable tax treatment under
current law.)  The Business Coalition for Affordable Health Care
estimates that approximately 10 percent of Americans spend <I>more
than</I> $2,000 per year on medical expenses.  A March/April 1994
<I>Journal of American Health Policy</I> study (using 1994 dollars)
of one million Americans showed that one-third of the population
filed no claims in 1989; 73 percent filed $500 or less in claims;
82 percent filed  $1,000 or less; and 89 percent filed $2,000
or less.  &quot;In other words, if this group had a $2,000 deductible
MSA, only 11 percent would have reached the deductible,&quot;
the editors noted.  An MSA empowers consumers to pay for routine
medical expenses from their account and to keep the unspent funds
for future health care needs, thus creating incentives for shopping
around and wise spending.  Medical expenditures from the MSAs
are applied against the deductible until the deductible (out-of-pocket
expense) is met, at which point the insurance coverage begins.
<p>
<center><h3>PRIVATE COMPANIES UTILIZE MSAs</h3></center>
<p>
Because of these positive features, more than 2,000 large and
small companies have begun offering MSAs to their employees, with
great success, even though current federal law does not exempt
contributions to such accounts.   Interestingly, seven states
have achieved tax fairness in their state income tax codes by
exempting contributions to MSAs.
<p>
A March 1995 Cato Institute study analyzed several companies and
states that provide MSAs, noting dramatic cost-savings and improvement
in customer satisfaction.  Consider these two examples:
<p><blockquote>
Dramatic savings from using MSAs have also been achieved at Windham
Hospital in Willimantic, Conn., with 1,000 employees.  In 1993
the hospital switched from a pure first-dollar coverage plan with
no deductible or co-payments to a plan with a $500 deductible.
 It also contributes $10 per week, or $520 per year, to an MSA
for each worker.  In addition, the hospital negotiated discounts
for its employees when they pay for health services with MSA funds.
 The hospital itself offers discounts of 30 percent, area doctors
offer price reductions of 20 percent, and drugstores cut prices
by 10 percent.
<p>
Under the old plan, the hospital's employees used medical services
35 percent more than the community average.  After one year under
the new plan, however, the entire 35 percent excess was eliminated.
 Moreover, projected health costs for the hospital employees were
reduced by about 50 percent.
<p></blockquote>
The study even cites the case of The United Mine Workers Union
that successfully negotiated for MSAs in their contract. 
<p><blockquote>
Under an agreement with the Bituminous Coal Operators Association,
covering about 15,000 employees, coal mine operators now provide
workers insurance with a $1,000 deductible replacing a zero deductible
under the old health plan.  The employees are each provided a
$1,000 cash bonus at the beginning of the year that they can use
for health care expenses below the deductible.  At the end of
the year, workers can keep for any use whatsoever any portion
of the bonus they do not use for health care.
<p></blockquote>
<center><h3>HELP FOR LOWER-INCOME FAMILIES</h3></center>
<p>
Companies that have MSAs have found they are most popular among
lower-income employees.  Under conventional insurance plans, low-income
employees would have to meet their $250 or $500 deductible with
after-tax dollars before they could access their insurance.  A
single mother earning $14,000 or $15,000 a year may find it difficult
to meet the deductible when rent, transportation, taxes, grocery
bills and other needs for her children are pressing.  An MSA allows
these low-income earners first dollar coverage, permitting them
to get medical care when they or their children need it.  This
feature alone could significantly reduce the level of emergency
room utilization for non-emergency care.  Low-income wage earners
would have, in effect, first-dollar coverage for medical care
up to the amount in their MSA.
<p>
<center><h3>LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS IN CONGRESS</h3></center>
<p>
Congress has proposed several variations of MSA legislation, but
generally this legislation has been designed to end the current
tax discrimination against MSAs.  MSAs are flexible and would
operate as a <I>tax-free</I>, portable account which can be used
to pay medical bills (including those for eyeglasses and dental
care), in conjunction with a high-deductible (or &quot;catastrophic&quot;)
health insurance plan.  Contributions made by employers, the self-employed
or individuals would be tax-free.  If one needs to withdraw money
for non-medical expenses, the funds are taxed and a 10 percent
penalty applies.
<p>
MSA proposals have gained bipartisan support but have never passed
in Congress.  Now, the 104th Congress has the chance to pass an
MSA bill, such as the Family Medical Savings and Investment Act
of 1995, H.R. 1818, introduced by Reps. Bill Archer (R-Texas)
and Andrew Jacobs (D-Ind.).  This bill allows contributions made
to MSAs by employers, the self-employed, and individuals to be
tax-deductible.  Through tax fairness, the bill also helps the
uninsured, future senior citizens, and employed mothers, who will
no longer be forced to accept full-time employment to receive
tax-deductible health coverage.  The estimated cost of H.R. 1818
is $1.77 billion over seven years, according to the Joint Committee
on Taxation.  Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) recently introduced
a virtually  identical MSA proposal in the Senate, S. 1247. 
<p>
Under H.R. 1818 and S. 1247, there are annual limits on the amount
of money that can be placed in such accounts ($2,500 for an individual
or $5,000 for a family).  A 10 percent penalty is levied if the
money is withdrawn for non-medical expenses.  In addition, money
for non-medical expenses is also taxed as income, since the money
was deposited tax free.  As in the case of IRAs, a 10 percent
penalty would encourage savings and discourage frivolous non-medical
spending. 
<p>
The MSA is essentially a trust created exclusively for the purpose
of paying qualified medical expenses (QME) of the account holder
and his or her family.   Distributions for QMEs are excluded from
gross income.  QMEs are defined by section 213 (d) of the IRS
code, except that MSA expenses for insurance premiums other than
catastrophic plans or long-term care insurance premiums would
not be included.
<p>
H.R. 1818 has passed the House Ways and Means Committee and will
be included in the budget reconciliation package for consideration
under &quot;closed rules&quot; on the House floor.  That means
no amendments may be offered.  The reconciliation bill is an omnibus
&quot;must-pass&quot; budget package slated for a vote in October.

this policy.
</pre><p>
<ul>
<li>In  S. 1247, the amount of deposit is limited to the deductible
amount of the insurance policy or $2,500 for an individual or
$5,000 for a family.
<p>
<li>If this is used up in a year, the traditional or catastrophic
insurance plan kicks in. 
<p>
<li>If this is not used up in a year, the remainder can be retained
in the MSA to be used for next year's health expenses, or future
retirement (IRA) needs.
<p>
<li>Long-term care insurance policies can be purchased from the
MSA account.
<p>
<li>People laid-off or unemployed can use MSA funds to continue
to purchase high-deductible private health insurance.
</ul><p>
Let's say an employer, for example, will spend $4,000 per year
on health insurance for an individual.  The employer decides to
use that $4,000 for an MSA for his employee.  The employer purchases
a high-deductible insurance policy which costs $2,000 per year.
 The policy has a deductible of $2,500.  The employer then deposits
$2,000 into the MSA, from which the employee draws to meet routine
medical expenses.  Therefore, as an equation, the example above
would look like this: 
<p>
<center>
$4,000  =  $2,000 in premium costs for a health insurance policy<br>
with a $2,500 deductible  +  $2,000 deposited in the MSA
</center><p>
Next year, the employer deposits another $2,000 (usually in monthly
allotments) in the employee's MSA.  If the employee only spent
$1,000 the first year, then the employee would have $1,000 left
in the MSA at the beginning of the second year, when that year's
$2,000 would be deposited.  Therefore, the employee would have
$3,000 in the MSA at the beginning of the second year.  
<p>
Once initially set up, an MSA is useful in times of temporary
unemployment or in-between jobs.  The same <I>Journal of American
Health Policy</I> (cited above) reports that &quot;41 percent
of persons losing private health insurance have an uninsured spell
that ends within one to three months, and 71 percent have a dry
spell that ends within four months.&quot;   The &quot;portable&quot;
feature of  MSAs can prevent &quot;job lock&quot; - that is, a
situation in which someone feels &quot;forced&quot; to remain
in a job because of fear of losing good health benefits.   Those
unfortunate families who are chronically unemployed or earning
wages below the poverty level, will still be eligible for public
health programs, such as Medicaid and SSI, which will continue
to provide aid to the working poor.
<p>
<center><h3>TYPICAL FEATURES OF  H.R. 1818/S. 1247:</h3></center>
<p><ul>
<I>* tax free account, similar to IRA, for medical expenses</I><br>
<I>* employer or individual makes contribution (limit $)</I><br>
<I>* choose own doctor</I><br>
<I>* portable </I><br>
<I>* money in account rolls over year to year </I><br>
<I>* no claims, no new government bureaucracy or administrative
costs</I><br>
<I>* can withdraw savings for retirement at 59 1/2 years old</I><br>
<I>* 10 percent penalty for withdrawal for non-medical use</I><br>
<p></ul>
<center><h3>MEDICARE</h3></center>
<p>
As one possible alternative to Medicare, both House and Senate
committees have proposed  tax-free &quot;Medisave&quot; accounts,
similar to those proposed for working families, as a potential
option for seniors.  In the future, these Medisave accounts have
the potential to save seniors and the health care system money
by allowing personal account funds to be used to pay for expenses
not covered by the traditional health insurance plan, such as
prescription drugs or long-term care insurance premiums.   If
the money is spent wisely, there will be money left in the account
for next year's health expenses or for non-medical expenses (with
a small penalty).  This will help give the elderly and their families
an opportunity to best use the money.  It takes decisions away
from the Washington bureaucrats.  The House Ways and Means and
Senate Finance Committees have approved a medical savings account
option that combines a high-deductible insurance policy with a
Medicare MSA.   
<p>
<center><h3>SUMMARY</h3></center>
<p>
FRC believes Medical Savings Accounts are family-friendly health
care reform.  Ultimately, all health care reform legislation should
be judged within the following family-based guidelines:  
<p><ul>
<li>Fosters Genuine Compassion
<li>Makes Prudence Pay
<li>Promotes Family Autonomy
<li>Recognizes the Family's Contribution to Good Health
<li>Empowers Families to Act

<h2>YOUTH GANGS: OUT OF<br>
CONTROL AND GETTING<br>
WORSE</h2>

<p>
A recent decline in violent crime appears to be more a result
of fewer teenagers than better law enforcement.  When the current
bumper crop of elementary-age children become adolescents, the
violent crime rate is likely to explode.
<p>
A growing chorus of experts warn of the impending youth crime
crisis.  Reggie Walton, a Washington, D.C. Superior Court judge
who handles juvenile cases, blames it on the disappearance of
fathers.  Walton says fathers leave children to be raised by young
mothers who themselves are often struggling with mental or emotional
problems, limited education, poverty and addiction.  Walton labels
these children &quot;walking time bombs.&quot;[1]
<p>
This time bomb has been in the making for some time.  Youth violent
crime has been rising dramatically for more than a decade.  Today,
and historically, young males commit far more crimes than other
age groups.
<p>
The volatile mix of more chronic juvenile delinquents and an upward
surge in youthful perpetrators of violence is complemented by
an unprecedented growth in youth living with little or no adult
supervision.  Consider some recent examples.
<p><ul>
<li>A Los Angeles family takes a wrong turn into gang territory
and is fired upon.  A 3-year-old is killed and her 2-year-old
brother wounded.
<p><li>A Chinese immigrant in Brooklyn is kidnapped by a Chinatown
gang which demands ransom payments from her family.  She is murdered
when the family fails to pay.
<p><li>Two FBI agents and a police sergeant are murdered inside the
Washington, D.C. police headquarters by a gang member.
<p><li>A Pittsburgh police sergeant walking home with his daughter
is killed with his own gun after he stops and confronts a gang
spraying graffiti on a street.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>WALKING TIME BOMBS</h3></center>
<p>
Vice President Albert Gore recently told the White House press
corps, &quot;Gangs have been a major cause of the growth in violent
crime in the past decade.&quot;[2] He cited a Treasury Department
report that found the presence of rival gangs, the Bloods and
the Crips, in 35 states and 58 cities across the country.
<p>
At the same press conference, Attorney General Janet Reno cited
the impact of disabling one gang in New Haven, Connecticut.  Eighteen
members of the &quot;Jungleboy&quot; street gang were put in jail,
and, according to Reno, New Haven's murder rate fell by one-third
in 1993.[3]
<p>
Given that youth gangs account for a disproportionate share of
youth violence, their potential for contributing to a future crime
wave is enormous.
<p>
At the current growth rate, there will be nearly half-a-million
more adolescent boys in the year 2010 than today.  That means
if current trends continue, we will have perhaps 30,000 more chronic
juvenile delinquents by the year 2010 than today.  Chronic youth
offenders comprise 7 percent of all male teenagers and they commit
70 percent of all serious crime for their age group.[4]
<p>
If history is any predictor, these adolescents will be more violent
than the current delinquents.  According to the Department of
Justice, today's youth are extremely violent.  Firearms are now
used by three-fourths of all juvenile homicide offenders and 
one-third of all reported violent crime offenders are less than
21 years old.  Juvenile arrests for all violent crime have increased
from 1983 to 1992 in spite of the decline in the overall number
of teenagers in the U.S. population.  The government estimates
that the juvenile arrest rate for major violent crime will more
than double by the year 2010.[5]
<p>
This ticking youth time bomb is evident everywhere.  California
authorities report that incarcerations of violent youth increased
from 44 percent of the prison population in 1987 to 61 percent
in 1992[6]. There is no sign of a turnaround.  Officials in the
upscale Washington, D.C. suburb of Fairfax, Virginia, report that
the number of juveniles arrested for violent crimes has climbed
61 percent since 1991.  The number of youth arrested with weapons
has risen 118 percent since 1989.[7]
<p>
A 1993 report by the Washington State Department of Community
Development states, &quot;Our state and nation are awash in a
tidal wave of violence, violence that has reached epidemic proportions
especially among our youngest generation.&quot;[8]
<p>
Professor Dean Rojek, a sociologist at the University of Georgia,
says, &quot;For decades violent crime was driven mostly by adults,
with kids involved mostly in property crime....What's been changing is 
that you have juveniles becoming much more involved in violent offenses, 
with the use of weapons. If we add to this more babies, you could have a 
multiplier effect...a mini explosion [in violent crime by youth].&quot;[9]
<p>
Attorney General Janet Reno agrees.  &quot;Unless we act now,&quot;
says Reno, &quot;to stop young people from choosing a life of
violence and crime, the beginning of the 21st century could bring
levels of violent crime to our community that far exceed what
we have experienced.&quot;[10]
<p>
<center><h3>GANGS EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM</h3></center>
<p>
The bomb's fuse is shortened by the youth gang phenomenon.  California
authorities describe the youth gang as a &quot;violent and insidious
new form of organized crime.  Heavily armed with sophisticated
weapons, (gangs) are involved in drug trafficking, witness intimidation,
extortion, and bloody territorial wars.  In some cases they are
traveling out of state to spread their violence and crime.&quot;[11]
<p>
According to the FBI,  &quot;The fastest growing murder circumstance
is juvenile gang killings.&quot;[12] Almost one-third of Los Angeles'
homicides are gang related.[13] Nationwide, the rate of violent offenses
by gang members is three times as high as for non-gang delinquents.[14]
<p>
There's something about young males belonging to a gang that makes
them more violent.
<p><ul>
<li>Orange County, California probation statistics indicate that
gang-related youth had significantly higher law-violation rates (55.1 percent) 
than non-gang affiliated youth (26.4 percent).[15] A study of 20 years of 
data collected by Philadelphia's police gang unit shows that &quot;gangs
engage in more violent behavior than do delinquent non-gang groups.&quot;[16]
<p>
<li>Metropolitan Life surveyed schools about gang violence.  It
found that more than half (59 percent) of law enforcement and one-third (34 
percent) of students and teachers say gang or group membership is a major
cause of violence in schools.[17]
<p>
<li>A study in Wisconsin found that most violent crimes by youths
were committed by groups of three or more.  This &quot;pack&quot; behavior, 
not surprisingly, seems to be at the core of much of the rise in youth
crime.[18]
<p>
<li>A study of New York City teenage gunshot victims found that
40 percent were shot during school hours.  Another study found that of 
children and teenagers wounded in drive-by shootings in Los Angeles, 71 
percent were &quot;documented members of street gangs.&quot;[19]
<p></ul>
Not only do gang members tend to be more violent than non-gang
members, but gang membership appears to prolong one's criminal
career.  One study found that a &quot;large portion of persistent
and dangerous juvenile gang offenders become even more serious
adult offenders.&quot;[20] Another study in California found that
previously-incarcerated gang members continued their lives of
crime after being released.[21]
<p>
<center><h3>GANGS - AN AMERICAN PHENOMENON?</h3></center>
<p>
As early as the 1600s, London was &quot;terrorized by a series
of organized gangs...[who] fought pitched battles among themselves
dressed with colored ribbons to distinguish the different factions.&quot;[22]
 Gang problems have been reported in most of Europe, the former
Soviet Union, Africa, South America, Mexico, New Zealand and Japan.
<p>
One of the first reports of youth gangs in America comes from
Philadelphia.  In 1791, that city's leaders convened a conference
to decide how to deal with bands of disruptive youth.[23]
<p>
New York City had a similar problem in the 19th century.  New
York's gangs tended to be political agents for the Know Nothing
or Native American Party.  During the early Civil War years there
were draft riots which may have been started by Irish street gangs.[24]
<p>
The classic movie, <I>West Side Story</I>, is stereotypical of
20th century gang life.  The Sharks and the Jets are territorial
gangs protecting their neighborhoods.  Until recently, however,
gangs like these were not considered a threat to the general population.
<p>
Neither a 1967 presidential commission on law enforcement nor
the 1976 National Advisory Committee on Criminal Standards and
Goals foresaw today's gang problem. They concluded, &quot;Youth
gangs are not now or [sic] should not become a major object of
concern....Youth gang violence is not a major problem in the United
States....What gang violence does exist can fairly readily be
diverted into 'constructive' channels, especially through the
provision of services by community agencies.&quot;[25]
<p>
<center><h3>WHY ARE GANGS SPREADING?</h3></center>
<p>
Gangs are spreading across the country and are not just limited
to major cities.  Bernard Friedlander, a University of Hartford psychology 
professor and a violence expert, says, &quot;This is an American problem, 
not an inner-city problem....It's spreading slowly....On one level it's 
simple fad imitation...but on another level the
isolation of youth is just as profound in some of the more stable
areas as in the inner city.&quot;[26]
<p>
Ed Edelman, a Los Angeles supervisor, said, &quot;Gangs are very
mobile today.  They don't just stay in one area.  They are not just limited 
to poor areas of the country.  They are all over the place.&quot;[27]
<p>
The spread of gangs can be attributed to at least three factors.
 First, parents, desiring to protect their gang-culture-saturated
children from the hometown gang's influence, send them to relatives
across the country.  Sometimes this strategy works.  But many
times it merely helps transplant the gang culture into a new community.
<p>
The drug trade has created entrepreneurial gangs which fan out
across the country to ply their trade and expand their markets.
 Franchises of the Bloods and the Crips are now in most metropolitan
centers.  With their expansion, they have introduced collateral,
gang-like violence.
<p>
Finally, the entertainment industry contributes to the spread
of gangs.  The gang culture, value system and mentality are sprinkled
across the country through movies, &quot;gangsta&quot; rap music
and now comic books.  These cultural amplifiers educate young
audiences to gang values and attitudes.  They denigrate women,
promote exaggerated manhood or  &quot;machismo,&quot; and glorify
violence.  They also pass on gang language, symbols, activities,
and traditions.[28]
<p>
<center><h3>GANG NUMBERS, LOCATION AND TYPES</h3></center>
<p>
According to Justice Department estimates, the United States has
some 1,436 gangs and 120,636 gang members.  They exist in large,
mid-sized and small communities and in suburban areas.[29]
<p>
The Justice Department figures are disputed by the National School
Safety Center, which in 1993 estimated that the Los Angeles area
alone has at least 959 gangs with approximately 125,000 gang members.[30]
 Another report states that more than 350,000 gang members reside
along the West Coast.[31] To further confuse the issue, a 1975 study
found a total of 760 to 2,700 gangs in the nation's eight largest
cities.[32]
<p>
There are many types of gangs.  Some are black, white, Asian,
Hispanic or other ethnic-centered gangs.  Others are structured
around territory, commercial activities, corporate businesses,
political agendas, religion, music and special types of crime.
<p><ul>
<li><B>Race/ethnic-based gangs</B>:  Larry Rawles, deputy director
of Philadelphia's Crisis Intervention Network, says, &quot;When any ethnic 
group was at the bottom, they formed gangs -- the Jews, the Irish, the 
Italians.&quot;[33] Gangs offered status, a sense of self-worth, 
and protection.  Today, most gangs are racially segregated (54.6
percent are African American and 32.6 percent are Hispanic).  Blacks and 
Hispanics constitute the largest numbers of youths arrested for gang 
offenses today.[34]
<p>
The all-black rival gangs, the Crips and the Bloods, have an estimated
70,000 members in Los Angeles County alone.[35] They have franchises
in most states and metropolitan communities where they tend to
dominate the crack cocaine trade.
<p>
Darlyne Pettinicchio, a probation officer in Orange County, California,
says, &quot;(White gangs are) punk rockers and heavy metalers
(who) come from all socio-economic classes.  They're of average
intelligence and they're capable youngsters.  They have very little
parental authority.  They're usually angry.  Their dance is violent.
 Their music is violent.  Their behavior is violent.  They're
into anarchy.&quot;[36]
<p>
There are numerous Hispanic, Satanic cult, Asian, and Stoner (punk
rock and heavy metal) gangs.  Each has a subculture and each tends
to be very violent and involved in the use and or distribution
of illicit drugs.
<p>
<li><B>Economic-based gangs</B>:  Some gangs are organized around
a commercial activity. Members may be all from a single race or the same 
neighborhood or they may be very diverse.  The glue that holds them together
is making money.
<p>
They often see themselves as Robin Hoods or Bonnie-and-Clyde types
who practice their own version of free enterprise.  A close cousin
is the corporate gang, which selects a type of industry or business
and dominates the field through intimidation and violence.   For
example, there was a Miami-based gang called the &quot;Mazda boys&quot;
who specialized in stealing Mazda cars.
<p>
<li><B>Territorial gangs</B>:  Territorial gangs can be from any
race or ethnic background. They lay claim to a particular territory. They 
typically &quot;tag&quot; their territory with gang graffiti and are 
willing to defend their turf to the death. When their territory is invaded 
the gang provides &quot;warriors.&quot;
<p></ul>
<center><h3>WHO JOINS A GANG?</h3></center>
<p>
No matter the type of gang, most gang members are male.  A Chicago
study of four police districts found that only 2 to 5 percent
of gang arrestees were female.[37] These females are typically auxiliary
gang members.
<p>
Gang members range in age from 8 to 22 years old, but there are
exceptions where tenure is often well beyond 22 to perhaps more
than 40 years old.[38] A counselor in a juvenile detention facility
in California said: &quot;(If) you find a gang member who comes
from a complete nuclear family, a kid who has never been exposed
to any kind of abuse, I'd like to meet him....a real 'gangbanger'
who comes from a happy, balanced home, who's got a good opinion
of himself.  I don't think that kid exists.&quot;[39]
<p>
Sydney Harris, a nationally syndicated columnist, said, &quot;Gang
members tend to be chronic losers, who can accomplish nothing
individually, or who live in so depressed an environment that
only by banding together can they exercise any influence over
their lives.  In both cases, they are as much to be pitied as
condemned.&quot;[40]
<p>
Allen Frazier, superintendent of schools for Plymouth, Connecticut,
blames economic problems.  &quot;As people have more economic
problems in the adult world,&quot; says Frazier, &quot;it transfers
to the young people as well....[The children] don't seem to have
a place where they are comfortable.  In order to seek that, sometimes
they end up with the security of a gang....It becomes an extended
family which they may not have.&quot;[41]
<p>
A gang researcher says, &quot;These gang kids have nothing to
do that they perceive as useful.  They are the disconnected, alienated
ones.  They identify with whatever is trendy in terms of music,
clothes, and in terms of behavior.  They are living entirely on
the surface of life.&quot;[42]
<p>
Prisons are often referred to as gang training schools.  Often
gangs are formed in prison and then emigrate to the streets. 
The cohesion associated with jail time amplifies gang loyalty.
<p>
Fred Williams, the executive director for Common Ground Foundation,
a Watts [Los Angeles, California] nonprofit organization that
works with gang youth, says, &quot;Prison doesn't scare them.
 It's a home away from home.&quot;[43]
<p>
<center><h3>GANG CULTURE</h3></center>
<p>
Professor Cornel West, a Princeton University social scholar,
says in his book <I>Race Matters</I> that the nihilistic thinking
of the inner city black community sets the stage for gang formation.
 West says, &quot;The frightening result is a numbing detachment
from others and a self-destructive disposition toward the world.
 Life without meaning, hope, and love breeds a cold-hearted, mean-spirited
outlook that destroys both the individual and others.&quot;[44]
<p>
The youth gang satisfies a void.  It provides the child a sense
of identity, belonging, power, and protection.  The gang satisfies
the child's desire to feel secure.  Living in a high-risk environment
without paternal protection, the young gangster satisfies his
insecurities by aligning himself with a gang, his surrogate family.
 The gang provides a protective barrier against the outside forces.
<p>
One gang member says, &quot;Being in a gang means if I didn't
have no family, I think that's where I'll be.  If I didn't have
no job that's where I'd be.  To me it's community help without
all the community.  They'll understand better than my mother and
father.&quot;[45]
<p>
His new &quot;family&quot; has a distinct set of values that affect
every aspect of his life.  According to the Los Angeles District
Attorney, the gang culture is radically different from the mainline
culture.  &quot;It confronts and confounds adult authority on
every level -- sex, work, power, love, education, language, dress,
music, drugs, alcohol, violence.  As icons of popular culture,
gangs not only represent a powerful group identity utterly inaccessible
to adults, they are surrounded with an appealing aura of outlaw
danger.&quot;[46]
<p>
Visible manifestations of the gang culture include colors, signs,
symbols, graffiti, and tattoos.  Gang colors, different types
of clothing and head covering help distinguish one gang from another.
 Even some National Football League players who are connected
to gangs wear gang-colored bandanas.
<p>
Gangs often have their peculiar vocabulary.  Many black street
gangs address each other as &quot;cuz&quot; for cousin.  They
often have code words and many speak like &quot;rappers.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Tagging&quot; their territory with gang graffiti is common.
 It proclaims the presence of the gang and offers a challenge
to rivals.  It may claim credit for a crime.  The denser the graffiti,
the closer one is to the gang's core territory.  The Crips often
mark &quot;B/K&quot; for &quot;Bloods killers.&quot;
<p>
Gang behavior is characterized by extreme loyalty.  Members never
inform on &quot;homeboys,&quot; even if faced with death.  Once
in a gang, the member faces long odds of ever leaving alive.
<p>
Captain Russell Holyfield of the Hartford Police Department describes
gang protocol.  &quot;You give someone a dirty look,&quot; says
Holyfield, &quot;or say something about their girlfriend and later
on that day, you're a target.&quot;[47]
<p>
A Los Angeles District Attorney gang study describes the macho-psychology
of the gang culture.  &quot;The gang's ideal man is virtually
identical to the romantic myth of the gunfighter of the Old West
-- a two-fisted, hard-drinking, dangerous man who is quick to
avenge any insult; he lives and dies by violence, with his exploits
rousing fear and respect in the hearts of men, and in the hearts
of women, fear and desire.&quot;[48]
<p>
&quot;Gangsta&quot; rap is filled with messages that glorify violence,
extreme abuse of women and disrespect for authority.  The rapper's
lyrics paint a realistic picture of daily gangster activity.
<p>
Despite this, some gangs have an odd sense of civility.  A Los
Angeles Hispanic gang member says, &quot;When I'm out on the streets,
I know I'm safe if I'm with my mom.  You don't disrespect anybody
if they are with their mom.&quot;[49]
<p>
Partying and fighting, the core activities of a gang, are what
draw many young males.  According to the Los Angeles District
Attorney's report, &quot;These are the things that build and define
group loyalties.  Even criminality, which is probably the public's
main perception of what gangs are about, is less a core value
of the gang than a byproduct of the emphasis on partying and fighting.&quot;[50]
<p>
Sergeant Joe Guzman with the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department
explains prison's influence on the gang culture:  &quot;One prison
gang member might see that another gang member had something he
wanted.  If he was larger, more powerful or had more back-up from
his 'homeboys' than the other inmate, he literally just took the
item he wanted.  If he was angered in one fashion or another he
retaliated with deadly vengeance and commanded the presence of
his entire gang to back him up.&quot;[51]
<p>
<center><h3>GANG ORGANIZATION</h3></center>
<p>
Gangs are loosely organized.  Some are part of larger structures
known as &quot;nations,&quot; which are networked nationwide.
 But most are loosely knit groups with several leaders.
<p>
The 1960 New York City Youth Board proposed a theory of gang structure,
stating gangs are structured both vertically and horizontally.
 The vertical gang is structured along age lines and draws members
from local neighborhoods.  The horizontal gang has older members
who are drawn from a larger area.[52] This type of gang tends to
evolve into coalitions, supergangs and nations.  The term &quot;supergang&quot;
was coined in Chicago in the late 1960s to describe a gang with
thousands of members.[53]
<p>
Virtually every gang is built from groups called &quot;cliques.&quot;
 One gang researcher called the clique a &quot;spontaneous interest
group usually of the conflict type which forms itself within some
larger social structure such as a gang.&quot;[54] Members of cliques
tend to be similar in age.
<p>
Gang leaders are chosen by natural selection based on the person's
age, physical stature, arrest record and behavior.  Like any organization,
according to one researcher, the &quot;ability to get along with
people is one of the basic skills associated with gang leadership.&quot;[55]
<p>
Some gangs have formal leaders known as king, prince, prime minister,
general, don, or chief .  Others are informal, known as &quot;shot
callers&quot; or &quot;shooters.&quot;   Leadership responsibilities
may be shared and based upon a &quot;collection of functions that
may be undertaken at various times by a number of members.&quot;[56]
<p>
<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>
<p>
&quot;We've got so many kids out there who've lost hope, who believe
in only living for today,&quot; says John Turner, chief of police
for the city of Mountlake Terrace, Washington. &quot;They join
a gang and get involved in criminal activity because there aren't
any people taking them by the hand in simple terms and pointing
them in the right direction, giving them self-esteem and positive
feedback.&quot;[57]
<p>
Perhaps gangs exist because modern society has failed to harness
the male hunter/predator instinct and converted those energies
to familial provider/protector efforts.  Delinquent young people
lacking values, conscience or a sense of remorse can easily find
themselves drawn to the gang lifestyle.
<p>
Noted author James Q. Wilson writes in <I>The Moral Sense</I>
that modern society with its &quot;rapid technological change,
intense division of labor, and ambiguous allocation of social
roles, frequently leaves some men out, with their aggressive predispositions
either uncontrolled or undirected.  Gangs are one result.&quot;[58]
<p>
Wilson says the profits from illegal drug sales provide gang members
economic opportunities which combine with their uncontrolled aggression
to develop a &quot;warrior culture that underinvests in family
life.&quot;
<p>
Converting male energy to familial provider/protector efforts
has always been the task of the intact family.  But the nuclear
family is declining, especially in predominantly black inner cities
where gangs dominate life and rain violent crime.  Many of these
children join gangs to find purpose, security, and self-esteem.
 The gang culture gives them a sense of belonging and remakes
their value system.  Partying, fighting, and vicious gang loyalty
become their primary values, thus pushing aside virtues that favor
family life.  This is a vicious cycle and it must be broken.
<p>
Defusing the youth crime bomb must include a strategy to dismantle
the growing youth gang movement.  Gangs are the powder magazine
-- they must be dealt with before the bomb goes off.

<title>CONGRESS MAY FORM A COMMISSION TO STUDY LEGALIZED GAMBLING</title>
<body>

<p>
<h2>CONGRESS MAY FORM A<br>
COMMISSION TO STUDY<br>
LEGALIZED GAMBLING</h2>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>
<p>
America is experiencing a wave of legalized gambling. Some consider
government-sponsored betting a financial godsend, but for others
it is a social and economic disaster that will stop only when
the public says enough is enough.
<p>
Gambling has grown in an ad hoc manner with states and cities
emulating others that appear to be successful. Officials look
with envy as citizens go to other states and cities to wager.
But as one politician who led the battle to legalize gambling
in Atlantic City warned, &quot;Casino gambling is not a 'try it
and see' experiment. Once the casino opens and the dice begin
to roll, gambling creates an instant constituency. People depend
on it for jobs. Governments depend on it for revenues.&quot;[1]
<p>
Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.) has introduced legislation intended to
discover the true nature of gambling. Wolf's bill, the National
Gambling Impact and Policy Commission Act, calls for the creation
of a two-year commission to study gambling. The Act was approved
by voice vote November 8, 1995, by the House Judiciary Committee
and is expected to see House floor debate in 1996.[2]
<p>
A similar bill has been introduced in the Senate by Paul Simon
(D-Ill.) and Richard Lugar (R-Ind.).[3] The proposed commission will
examine policies and practices with respect to legalization or
prohibition of gambling and make recommendations for legislation
and administrative action.
<p>
This legislation is considered necessary because of the gradual
creation of 37 state lotteries and the expansion of casino gambling
to 23 states (prompted in part by the Indian Gaming Regulatory
Act of 1988) as well as an avalanche of gaming promoters selling
government officials on the economic benefits of legalization.
These sponsors sell legalization as an economic boon and a harmless
recreational pastime, but there is considerable evidence that
this rush to easy money actually costs the taxpayer more than
it harvests.
<p>
Columnist William Safire speaks for many when he labels gambling
&quot;a $40-billion-a-year industry that is inherently immoral,
corrupting public officials, enriching criminals, addicting and
impoverishing the young and the vulnerable.&quot;[4] He supports
the legislation now pending in the 104th Congress.
<p>
According to Congressman Wolf's bill, the proposed federal commission
would consider 11 broad areas. The following summarizes what is
already known about some of these areas.
<p>
<center><h3>ECONOMIC IMPACT</h3></center>
<p>
Tunica County, Mississippi was known as the poorest county in
the country. In January 1992, it had an unemployment rate of 26.2
percent and a per capita income of $11,865. More than half of
its citizens were on food stamps.[5]
<p>
Since legalized gambling came to Tunica County, land values have
skyrocketed from $250 to $25,000 per acre. Over a billion dollars
in building permits have been granted. The nine area casinos each
average 1,000 employees, bringing unemployment down to 4.9 percent.
Child support collections have doubled, welfare benefits have
been nearly halved, food stamp recipients have decreased and property
taxes have been cut one-third.[6]
<p>
Webster Franklin, executive director of the Tunica County chamber
of commerce, is a gambling fan. He told a House committee in September
1995 that gambling is the best thing to happen to his county.
<p>
Such reports cause officials of money-strapped government agencies
to salivate. Detroit, for example, equates casinos with economic
salvation. For years, gambling citizens have crossed the Detroit
River to make wagers in Canada.
<p>
John Kelly, a lawyer and former Michigan state senator who opposed
gambling when he was in the legislature, now works for a local
investment group. He said the presence of Canadian casinos across
the river has been persuasive to him. He wants Detroit to reap
some of the profit from gambling rather than watch locals cross
the border to wager. Michigan Governor John Engler has appointed
an 11-member commission to study whether an Indian-run casino
would benefit the city.[7]
<p>
The story in Mobile, Alabama, is quite different. Mayor Mike Dow
believed that $63 million was spent by Alabama residents at nearby
Gulfport, Mississippi gambling casinos. When Mayor Dow investigated
bringing casinos to his city, he found the price was too high.
<p>
Forty-one of Mobile's social service agency CEO's were tasked
to determine the probable effects of introducing casinos. The
five-month study found that introducing casinos would cost the
city $15 million more each year in increased social service costs.
<p>
Charles White, CEO, Franklin Memorial Health Care Center of Mobile,
said, &quot;Our social service staff is already seeing an impact
from casinos in Mississippi....We see families selling their food
stamps and WIC vouchers for gambling money, and we are aware of
one family who lost its home.&quot;[8]
<p>
Joyce Collier, executive director of Mobile's Family Counseling
Center, states: &quot;[in the Biloxi/Gulfport area] families have
lost everything that they have worked for in terms of physical
holdings....Some clients have pawned car titles and lost transportation....Our
family counselors report increased alcohol and drug abuse and
spouse abuse.&quot;[9]
<p>
In 1994, Florida governor Lawton Chiles sponsored an economic
impact study of gambling. He found that Florida could anticipate
gambling revenues ranging from $324 to $469 million each year,
but that collateral costs outstripped the gain. Sales tax revenues
would drop $84.7 million, and crime and social costs attributable
to casinos were estimated to reach between $2.16 and $3.8 billion
annually.[10]
<p>
University of Nevada professor of public administration William
Thompson explained Florida's dilemma. Casinos generate significant
new tax revenues &quot;only if they can export their product.
The local economy doesn't benefit if only local people are gambling.&quot;[11]
Florida's geography is unlike Atlantic City and Las Vegas, which
draw gamblers from other states and send them packing with the
residue of gambling pathologies. That tab is absorbed by the gamblers'
home states. But Florida believes most of its potential gamblers
would be residents and not out-of-state tourists.
<p>
National gambling expert Robert Goodman studied the industry's
claims of economic benefits for the Ford Foundation and the Aspen
Institute. He says there is a critical lack of objective knowledge
and research about the real economic and social costs and benefits
of legalizing gambling. He warns that the research often used
by public officials tends to be unbalanced because it has been
provided by the gambling industry.[12]
<p>
Goodman's 1994 study analyzed 14 gambling industry studies concluding
that &quot;hiding the costs&quot; of gambling was widespread and
gambling acted as &quot;economic cannibalism&quot; on pre-existing
economies and other businesses.[13]
<p>
John Kindt, a professor of commerce at the University of Illinois,
has estimated that for every dollar that states take in from gambling
they pay three dollars to social agencies and crime fighting.
A problem gambler costs the state an average of $13,000 a year
in social impact.[14]
<p>
<center><h3>IMPACT ON BUSINESS</h3></center>
<p>
Louisiana gambled and is now paying the price. That state legalized
riverboat gambling and a few land-based casinos several years
ago. Recent events show the error of that decision.
<p>
Mike Foster, a Republican who ran on an anti-gambling platform,
was recently elected governor. He promises a state referendum
on gambling's future within a year.[15]
<p>
Additionally, on November 22, 1995 Harrah's Jazz Company, a consortium
that was building a 200,000-square-foot casino on New Orleans's
Canal Street, filed for protection under chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy law. This action caused the layoff of 3,500 workers
and a net loss of $23.6 million each year for the city. Why? Because
the temporary casino was doing poorly. Gambling investors miscalculated
the appeal of gambling.[16]
<p>
Gambling is leading many communities into economic distress. Atlantic
City has created 43,000 jobs over 10 years, but now the city has
only one business -- gambling. When casinos first came to Atlantic
City, there were 2,100 thriving small businesses. Today the number
is near 1,100 and falling. According to a New Jersey commission
report, &quot;It is clear that retail business and retail employment
in Atlantic City have continued to decline despite the presence
of gambling, and that rampant speculation has rendered the development
of vast parts of Atlantic City difficult if not impossible.&quot;[17]
<p>
In Illinois it was hoped that an economic facelift would result
when riverboats were introduced. But Earl L. Grinols, a University
of Illinois economist, examined the economic data in April 1994.
He found that &quot;riverboat gambling did not create the jobs
that were promised and had very little effect on reducing unemployment.&quot;[18]
He concluded, &quot;Economically speaking, it appears that riverboat
casinos shift jobs as opposed to creating jobs. For example, the
number of independent restaurants drops when a casino opens up.
Car sales have been known to go down with the onset of gambling.&quot;[19]
<p>
A survey by Chicago's Better Government Association (BGA) of 324
business owners in Illinois' riverboat towns found that a majority
said the floating casinos had no effect or a negative effect on
their businesses. BGA director J. Terrence Brunner said, &quot;Clearly,
riverboat gambling has not met the criteria set forth by Illinois
legislators when they sold this to the citizens of Illinois. The
economic development we found was marginal at best. It has not
spurred economic development. It has not created jobs. It has
not boosted tourism, and it certainly has not brought new life
to Illinois rivers or beautified their banks.&quot;[20]
<p>
Jeffrey Bloomberg, state's attorney, Lawrence County, South Dakota,
told the House Committee on Small Business on September 21, 1995,
that since 1988 when casino gambling was legalized for Deadwood,
South Dakota, life has been a nightmare. Real estate values have
skyrocketed, taxes have risen and gaming revenues have been eaten
up by increased administrative, law enforcement and infrastructure
costs.[21]
<p>
When casino gambling swept into three Colorado towns, it radically
changed life for the worse. According to a 1992 <I>Wall Street
Journal</I> article, &quot;[I]nstead of a few slot machines, full-blown
casinos owned by Las Vegas veterans and real-estate developers
have swept in, swallowing many mom-and-pop businesses along the
way. Water, sewer and traffic systems have been overwhelmed, crime
has increased, non-casino businesses face huge tax increases and
the relative calm of local politics has been shattered.&quot;[22]
<p>
Many communities with gambling experience are discovering the
hollow promises of the sponsors of this get-rich-quick industry.
Gambling creates many low paying jobs, diverts consumer dollars
into gambling, cannibalizes small businesses, and saddles those
that remain with burdensome tax liabilities. Gambling has a cumulative
negative economic impact.[23]
<p>
<center><h3>POLITICS AND PUBLIC POLICY IMPACT</h3></center>
<p>
The gambling industry is sophisticated when it comes to getting
what it wants. Consider the Mashantucket Pequot Indians' gambling
operations in Connecticut.
<p>
Today, the 370-member Pequot tribe operates a 17-story, 1,229-room
hotel and casino facility that draws 50,000 visitors a day. The
facility is managed by Gerald Michael Brown, a former New Jersey
deputy attorney general. Brown recently failed to win state support
to expand Pequot gambling to Bridgeport, a New York City suburb,
but it wasn't for lack of trying.[24]
<p>
Brown hired a law firm for $100,000 a month to prowl the halls
of Connecticut's capitol to sway lawmakers. The Pequot tribe ran
television commercials and sent out direct mail appeals touting
the financial benefits for the taxpayer. The cumulative effort
cost the tribe $13 million over four years. The fact is that the
Pequots contribute more to the state coffers than any single organization.[25]
But in November 1995, the state senate, by a majority of 24-10,
shot down the proposal. Count on a comeback.
<p>
The Pequots are generous on the national scene as well. In 1994,
the tribe contributed $215,000 in soft money to the Democratic
party and $465,000 to the Republicans. The industry's total public
contributions for 1993-1994 were $1,642,229.[26] But that doesn't
account for all contributions.
<p>
In June 1995, Steve Wynn, chairman of Mirage Resorts Inc., hosted
a fund-raiser for Senator Robert Dole (R-Kan.) that took in $477,450.
GOP chairman Haley Barbour isn't embarrassed by gambling money.
He said, &quot;It's not my place to be judgmental about issues
when it comes to allowing people to support us...you don't have
to agree with the Republican party on every issue to support us.&quot;[27]
<p>
Wynn is the genius behind the gaming industry's growth explosion,
according to John L. Smith, who writes in<I> Running Scared</I>
that Wynn has &quot;been accused of shadow-waltzing precariously
close to the wise-guy world.&quot; He dealt with a front man for
the Genovese crime family, and one of his associates was a point
man for Chicago mob lieutenant Johnny Rosselli, according to Smith,
who says Wynn was also associated with convicted junk bond felon
Michael Milken.[28]
<p>
The gambling industry understands the importance of politics.
That's why it hired Frank Fahrenkopf, a Nevada lawyer and former
Republican National Committee chairman. He now heads a $4 million
trade group, the American Gambling Association. This group, financed
by the gambling industry, promotes on Capitol Hill the positive
economic benefits of gambling.[29]
<p>
Gambling money and its agents have often been associated with
political corruption. Federal agents are investigating possible
political corruption in Louisiana. In 1995, senior state legislators
allegedly were caught discussing taking bribes from video-poker
lobbyists. Louisiana State Senator Jay Darnemme states, &quot;Greed,
arrogance, money and power -- it's all there....we went into this
very recklessly. Any states considering gambling ought not use
our formula as a model.&quot;[30]
<p>
The speaker of Missouri's House of Representatives resigned under
a cloud of gambling-related political corruption. In August 1991, FBI agents
in Columbia, South Carolina, wrapped up &quot;Operation Lost Trust,&quot;
which resulted in the bribery-related conviction of numerous legislators
and lobbyists.[31]
<p>
Six Arizona legislators pleaded guilty in 1990 to accepting gambling
bribes and that same year seven Kentucky officials were found
guilty of accepting bribes and making false statements. In 1994,
the West Virginia lottery director was sentenced to federal prison
for rigging a video lottery contract.[32]
<p>
The Clinton Administration has been cozy with the Seminole Tribe
of Florida. Clinton's Solicitor General, Drew Days, filed a last
minute, friend-of-the-court brief in the U.S. Supreme Court siding
with the Seminole Indians' case against the state of Florida.
The Seminoles want casino gambling and say Florida has not been
faithful to the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.
<p>
President Clinton's outsider support of the Seminoles waves a
red flag in the face of anti-gambling forces. A check of Florida-based
gaming contributors to the 1996 Clinton/Gore Primary Committee
Inc. found only $6,000, however.[33]
<p>
With annual wagers nationwide now topping half-a-trillion dollars
and gambling profits over $40 billion, there is great opportunity
for corruption.
<p>
<center><h3>GAMBLING AND CRIME</h3></center>
<p>
On October 16, 1995, Joseph Curran, Jr., Maryland's attorney general,
published that state's analysis of the link between gambling and
crime. Curran said, &quot;Casinos would bring a substantial increase
in crime to our state.&quot;[34]
<p>
The Maryland report reflects what virtually every government that
has experienced gambling has found. Jeffrey Bloomberg said, when
casinos came to remote Deadwood, &quot;We have seen individuals
who, prior to their exposure to gambling, had no criminal history,
who were not junkies or alcoholics, many of whom had good jobs,
who became hooked on slot machines and, after losing all their
assets and running all credit resources to their maximum, began
committing some type of crime to support their addiction.&quot;[35]
<p>
Crime on Mississippi's gulf coast increased in every category
after legalization of gambling. Gulfport's chief of police found
overall crime increased more than 100 percent, juvenile crime
shot up 65 percent and alcohol-related accidents increased 101
percent.[36]
<p>
In the first three years after casinos came to Atlantic City,
it went from 50th to first in the nation in per capita crime.
In the first 15 years Atlantic City had casinos, violent crime
skyrocketed almost 500 percent. This was in spite of a 20 percent
population decrease.[37]
<p>
Crime rose 262 percent in Deadwood and police calls in Black Hawk,
Colorado increased from 25 per year before gaming, to as many
as 20,000 today.[38]
<p>
Congressman Wolf testified on September 29, 1995, &quot;Evidence
shows that pathological gamblers engage in forgery, theft, embezzlement,
drug dealing and property crimes to pay off gambling debts. Various
studies indicate that the mean gambling-related debt of people
in compulsive gambling therapy ranged from about $53,000 to $92,000.&quot;[39]
<p>
Durand F. Jacobs, a professor of psychiatry at California's Loma
Linda University and a gambling industry consultant, says that
most people who commit crimes to support their gambling had no
prior criminal records.[40]
<p>
Florida's Department of Law Enforcement studied the probable crime
impact of legalizing gambling and concluded it would cause an
increase in many crime categories. They include: robberies, rape,
theft, drug abuse, aggravated assault, counterfeiting, profit-skimming,
prostitution, credit card scams, loan sharking, and card cheats.[41]
<p>
Given the huge number of dollars involved, gambling legalization
attracts organized crime. Jim Moody, chief of the FBI'S Organized
Crime Section, told <I>60 Minutes</I>, &quot;Gambling itself --
is probably the biggest producer of money for the American La
Cosa Nostra [that] there is.&quot;[42] A former Chicago mobster told
a congressional committee, the introduction of legalized gaming
into Illinois &quot;created a brand new market for us.&quot;[43]
<p>
In 1995, 18 men linked to the Genovese and Gambino crime families
in New York and the Marcello crime family in New Orleans were
convicted of secretly trying to operate a video-poker company
in New Orleans.[44]
<p>
For these reasons Maryland's attorney general Curran warned, &quot;Whatever
dubious financial benefits might flow from casino gaming are outweighed
by the tremendous social costs. Casinos would forever damage the
quality of Maryland life. I urge the task force and the people
of this state to resist the temptation of money that would benefit
too few at the cost of too many.&quot;[45]
<p>
<center><h3>SOCIAL IMPACT</h3></center>
<p>
Americans make more trips to casinos than to major league ballparks,
making gambling the new national pastime. This is evidenced by
the creation of casinos in 23 states and a projection that, by
the year 2000, most Americans will be within a four-hour drive
of a casino.[46]
<p>
This phenomenon is not without social consequences. The American
Psychiatric Association says that gambling addiction parallels
the devastation of alcohol and drug addictions.[47] Although less
than 1 percent of the population have been identified as gambling
addicts, the legalization of gambling could cause that number
to grow to 5 percent, and that includes teenagers.[48]
<p>
Tom Fennelly, a counselor with Gamblers Anonymous, says people
with gambling problems wait to get help until they do something
that bothers their conscience. He told of one woman who became
a prostitute to pay for gambling.[49]
<p>
Robert Goodman reports in the United States Gambling Study that
there are 9.3 million adults and 1.3 million adolescents with
a gambling problem. These are often lower-income residents, and
problem behaviors are worst among the poor and minorities.[50]
<p>
Gambling has caused increased family breakup, suicide, crime,
and massive personal debt. Jason Berg, a 19-year-old from a small
Iowa town, committed suicide after running up gambling debts.
He left a note: &quot;I'm out of control.&quot; Howard Russell,
a 41-year-old salesman, shot himself outside an Illinois casino
after losing more than $50,000.[51] <I>The Kansas City Star</I> reported
the tragic story of a mother who killed herself because she gambled
away the family savings at a casino riverboat.[52]
<p>
The social costs from pathological gambling are high. Peter Reuter,
executive director of the Maryland Task Force on Casino Gambling,
states, there is &quot;no convincing estimate of the average social
costs of an individual becoming a pathological gambler,&quot;
but the &quot;annual costs of $100 million or more in Maryland&quot;
is reasonable.[53]
<p>
Professor Kindt told the House Committee on the Judiciary on September
29, 1995, that the &quot;average socio-economic cost per compulsive
gambler per year has been calculated at $53,000.&quot;[54]
<p>
<center><h3>THE GAMBLER</h3></center>
<p>
Where do gamblers come from? Many gaming supporters count on diverting
funds from other states. They were surprised when a survey by
the Wisconsin Policy Institute of automobile license tags and
the patrons at a Wisconsin-based Indian tribe casino revealed
that nearly 80 percent were local people.[55]
<p>
Paul Dworn, the former editor of a leading gambling trade journal,
argued that most people go to casinos to be entertained: &quot;They
do not go because they have or want to win money.&quot;[56] But gaming
is not like going to Disneyworld or a ball game. It attracts people
who often can't afford the consequences, and it has proven to
be addictive.
<p>
The Wisconsin Policy Institute found that the typical casino gambler
is between 50 and 70 years old and has either retired or has a
blue-collar job. He or she wagers about $101 and loses about half
that amount during each visit.[57]
<p>
A 1995 survey done for the Iowa Department of Human Services found
that the availability of legalized gambling leads to increases
in the prevalence of gambling-related difficulties. Problem gamblers
are increasingly likely to be male, under the age of 30, non-Caucasian
and unmarried. The survey found that 3.5 percent are lifetime
problem gamblers and 1.9 percent are lifetime probable pathological
gamblers.[58]
<p>
Recent studies found lifetime gambling participation rates range
from a low of 74 percent to a high of 92 percent.[59] Iowa's survey
found that respondents spent an average of $40 per month gambling.
Men spend twice as much on gambling as women. People under age
30 spend twice what older gamblers spend. Singles spend more on
gambling ($51 per month) than marrieds ($31 per month).[60]
<p>
The economic strain on gamblers is often crippling. Kansas City's
Family Policy Council found that lower-income households spend
five to 10 times as much per capita on lottery tickets as do middle-income
homes. Since casinos came to Missouri, there has been a dramatic
increase in the number of pawn shops. Today, Kansas City has 38
shops, compared to four in 1979. Twelve shops opened within 18
months of the establishment of riverboat gambling.[61]
<p>
A Kansas City pawn shop owner said, &quot;You see people come
in here who can't afford to buy groceries, but they pawn their
VCR and go to the boat, where they lose $500.&quot; St. Louis'
Gamblers Anonymous reports that gamblers get money from their
life insurance and more than a third actually cancel their policies.
Nearly $1.3 billion of insurance fraud is committed each year
by pathological gamblers.[62]
<p>
The legalization of gambling and the number of pathological gamblers
appear to be linked, and some researchers believe gambling is
the fastest-growing addiction among teenagers. Henry Lesieur, Chair of 
the Criminal Justice Department at Illinois State University, headed a 1991 
panel that studied gambling among college students. The panel surveyed six 
schools in five states and concluded that almost one-quarter of students 
gamble at least once a week.[63]
<p>
Arnie Wexler, executive director of the Council on Compulsive
Gambling of New Jersey, estimates that the number of problem gamblers
will grow as the industry expands. He graphically portrays gambling's
temptation for some. &quot;If you put a guy who wouldn't cheat
on his wife in a room with a gorgeous nude woman, some guys would
fall by the wayside.&quot;[64] While this scenario would not excuse
a man from cheating, Wexler argues that, in the same way, state
approved gambling encourages many people to bet and a certain
percentage will become pathological.
<p>
<center><h3>GAMBLING REGULATION</h3></center>
<p>
Today, there are six major sectors of legal gambling: lotteries,
casino-style gambling, pari-mutuel racing, non-profits (including
bingo and Las Vegas nights), Indian high-stakes bingo and mini-casinos.
Regulating this rapidly expanding industry is expensive and complicated.
<p>
The state of Florida estimated it would cost nearly $50 million
to regulate 34 casinos, and that figure isn't unrealistic.[65] After
all, the 1991 annual budget for New Jersey's Casino Control Commission
was nearly $26 million, and that state's casinos are concentrated
in one city, not spread across a large state.[66]
<p>
But gaming regulation costs don't stop there. The New Jersey Division
of Gaming Enforcement spends another $36 million annually, a portion
of which provides police personnel for patrol and investigative
functions.[67]
<p>
The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 created a federal commission
to set gaming rules and oversee regulation of Indian bingo games.
The federal regulation effort is scanty, however. There are less
than 30 staff persons to regulate hundreds of Indian casinos across
the nation.[68]
<p>
Bob Renneisen, president and CEO, Claridge's Casino, Atlantic
City said, &quot;Our goal is not to get more out of a customer
in three hours but to get him to stay for four hours.&quot;[69] He
figures that the gambler will lose more with time since all casino
games give the house a mathematical edge.
<p>
The industry has studied gambling psychology. The casinos don't
want the gambler to realize he is losing. Jack Binion, owner of
Horseshoe Casino, Las Vegas, said, &quot;What is gambling? It's
really just a hype on emotion.&quot; Bill Zneder, operations chief,
Aladdin Casino, Las Vegas, said, &quot;If you give a guy a $100
bill he looks at it like a round of golf, a golf cart, two beers
and a hot dog. But if you give him chips, it's just betting units
and it loses its value.&quot;[70]
<p>
<center><h3>ADVERTISING GAMBLING</h3></center>
<p>
As governments have become more dependent on gambling, their regulation
efforts have shifted somewhat to promotion. According to gambling
expert Robert Goodman, legislators are tending to legalize-higher-revenue
producing games just as the market is becoming saturated.[71] This
is why public subsidies have been used to help competing private
gambling operations survive.
<p>
Since 1934, the federal government has had a long-standing policy
of prohibiting gambling-related advertising. Current federal criminal
law generally prohibits anyone from broadcasting &quot;[a]ny advertisement
of or information concerning any lottery, gift enterprise, or
similar scheme, [or] offering prizes dependent in whole or in
part upon lot or chance.&quot;[72]
<p>
The law does permit not-for-profit organizations to advertise
if the activity is &quot;clearly occasional and ancillary to the
primary business of that organization.&quot; But that might soon
change.
<p>
Pro-gambling forces in the Senate tried to amend the Telecommunications
Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995 to &quot;allow commercial
gambling enterprises to advertise on radio and television, thereby
reversing a long-standing federal policy against commercial gambling
advertising.&quot;[73]
<p>
State governments already spend more than $300 million a year
in lottery advertisements.[74] Taxpayer funded pro-gambling ads mixed
with industry-paid ads could fill the airways with messages that
promote gambling, thus drawing in more gullible victims.
<p>
<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>
<p>
Despite its popularity, legalized gambling is taking the country
in the wrong direction. Gambling is not an economic savior but
a disease that claims millions of victims.
<p>
President Clinton supports Congressman Wolf's proposal. In a letter
to Senator Simon, Clinton said, &quot;Too often, public officials
view gambling as a quick and easy way to raise revenues, without
focusing on gambling's hidden social, economic and political costs.&quot;
<p>
A national gambling commission could examine and publicize the
devastating consequences of legalized gambling. After the commission,
public policymakers should consider legislation to re-criminalize
or severely limit all forms of gambling.

<title>FCC PONDERS BIGGER FEDERAL ROLE IN CHILDREN'S TELEVISION</title>

<h2>FCC PONDERS BIGGER FEDERAL<br>
ROLE IN CHILDREN'S<br>
TELEVISION</h2>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>

<p>
<i>Robert H. Knight</i></center>
<p>
The Federal Communications Commission is considering a set of
rules that would greatly increase federal oversight of children's
television programming.
<p>
In order to further implement the Children's Television Act of
1990, the FCC is considering:
<p><ul>
<li>Issuing a &quot;more particularized&quot; definition of &quot;educational
and informational&quot; content.
<p><li>Requiring commercial broadcasters to carry a quota of 
&quot;educational&quot; programming, or pay another (probably a Public 
Broadcasting Service affiliate) to carry an equivalent amount of such 
programming.
<p><li>Adopting licensing renewal &quot;processing guidelines&quot;
which would allow the FCC to refuse license renewal to broadcasters
if program quotas are not met.
<p><li>Restricting credit for &quot;educational&quot; fare to designated
&quot;core&quot; programming (which would eliminate consideration
of specials and public service spots that might otherwise be deemed
&quot;educational&quot;).
<p><li>Requiring on-air designations of programs as &quot;educational.&quot;
<p><li>Defining as &quot;educational&quot; those programs for which
educational content is a &quot;significant purpose&quot; of the
show.
<p><li>Excluding for credit any programs that air before 7 a.m. and
after 10 p.m.
<p><li>Monitoring the total amount of educational and informational
programming over a specific time period.
</ul><p>
Given that the worth of specifically &quot;educational&quot; programming
for children is debatable, that public television already provides
many hours of such programming, and that the networks have steadily
increased their &quot;educational&quot; fare in recent years,
it does not appear that an expansion of federal power over television
is warranted.
<p>
More importantly, there are serious First Amendment problems with
any attempt by government to mandate specific programming content.
<p>
<center><h3>BACKGROUND</h3></center>
<p>
In 1989, a U.S. Senate report found that there was &quot;disturbingly
little&quot; programming &quot;that serves the special needs of
children&quot; and that time periods in which children were most
likely to be watching were filled with &quot;reruns of adult or
family comedy, variety, or dramatic programs.&quot;[1] Several cartoon
shows, whose main characters were heavily marketed as toys (such
as G.I. Joe) were criticized by public interest groups as being
little more than show-length toy commercials. Pressure groups
such as Action for Children's Television lobbied hard for some
federal oversight. They found a sympathetic ear in Sen. Daniel
Inouye (D-Hawaii), who sponsored the Senate version of the Children's
Television Act (CTA).
<p>
In 1990, Congress passed the CTA &quot;to increase the amount
of educational and informational broadcast television programming
available to children and to protect children from over-commercialization
of programming.&quot;[2] It was signed into law by President George
Bush.
<p>
The Act limits advertising spots to 10.5 minutes per hour during
weekends and 12 minutes per hour during weekdays.[3] It also prohibits
the advertising of program-based products on the same shows. For
instance, the <I>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</I> show cannot
include ads for Power Ranger dolls. The Act also directs the FCC
to review, at license renewal time, whether broadcasters have
served the &quot;educational and informational needs of children.&quot;
<p>
In 1991, the FCC issued rules and policies implementing the Children's
Television Act. Television station licensees were required to
respond to the &quot;educational and informational needs of children
16 years of age and under.&quot; No program quotas were established,
and the FCC said it would take into consideration any programming
that served children's &quot;positive development in any way,
including serving their cognitive/intellectual or social/emotional
needs.&quot;[4]
<p>
Irked by some broadcasters' insistence that shows like <I>The
Flintstones, Leave it to Beaver,</I> and <I>The Jetsons</I> meet
the definition of &quot;educational and informational,&quot; the
FCC concluded in a 1993 report that, &quot;We do not believe that
the level of performance is, in the long term, consistent with
the objectives underlying the CTA.&quot;[5]
<p>
Pressure from a coalition of interest groups including the Center
for Media Education, the National Education Association, the National
PTA and others resulted in a renewed effort by the FCC to further
refine the implementation rules for CTA. The coalition proposes
that broadcast licensees be required to provide at least one hour
a day of &quot;educational&quot; children's programming, to be
determined with tougher FCC standards.
<p>
In June 1995, a hearing was held before the full Commission, attended
by broadcasters, interest groups and media. The FCC also asked
for public comment to be submitted in writing, with final comments
and replies being closed on November 20, 1995. More than 600 entries
were filed, from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, private
citizens, TV networks, program providers such as Walt Disney Company,
and many religious and interest groups such as the United Church
of Christ, U.S. Catholic Conference, and the Children's Defense
Fund.[6] Most commentators backed some sort of tightening of the
rules, but the networks and several others argued hard against
program quotas, citing the First Amendment.
<p>
In October 1995, Professor Dale Kunkel of the University of California,
Santa Barbara, released a survey that says some TV stations are
meeting the &quot;kidvid&quot; requirement by airing programs
such as <I>Biker Mice from Mars, America's Funniest Home Videos</I>,
and <I>Yogi Bear</I>.&quot;[7]
<p>
In an Oct. 18, 1995 speech before the National Press Club, FCC
Chairman Reed Hundt cited the Kunkel study, and took particular
aim at NBC's claim that <I>NBA Inside Stuff</I> was educational. 
NBC lawyer Rick Cotton responded that the show
&quot;uses sports to attract teenagers to a program, and then
we provide educational and informational material. This highlights
the problem of government trying to set itself up as the arbiter
of what is educational.&quot;[8]
<p>
<center><h3>THE CASE FOR STATE INTERVENTION ON BEHALF OF CHILDREN</h3></center>
<p>
As noted in the FCC brief filed by the United States Catholic
Conference, &quot;The Supreme Court has not required scientific
exactitude when legislative and administrative bodies take actions
helpful to children and their parents. The Court has deferred
to the judgments of legislators and administrators when harm to
children is at issue.&quot;
<p>
The USCC cites a number of cases in which the court has upheld
state action &quot;aimed at protecting the physical and emotional
well-being of youth.&quot;[9]
<p>
True enough. If public officials depended only on scientific research,
then there would be a pressing need for studies to show that placing
a small child in heavy traffic is dangerous. Some truths are self-evident,
and the general concept of protecting children has been an accepted
societal value in the United States since before its founding.
The only question is how to balance the legitimate public interest
in protecting children with other rights, such as the freedom
of speech, and parental authority. Over the years, the courts
have approved government abridgments of the freedom of speech
when it was determined that children would be unduly harmed without
benefit of such law. Most recently, a federal appeals court in
Washington, D.C. upheld the FCC's right to prohibit indecent programming
between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., citing the government's
&quot;compelling interest&quot; in protecting children.[10]
<p>
But shielding children from pornography, excessive violence and
coarse language is different from legislating prescriptive programming.
It is one thing to put a health warning label on a pack of cigarettes,
for instance, and another to require all citizens to take vitamins.
Similarly, it is one thing to shield children from smut and another
to require specific broadcasting content determined by government.
<p>
In tackling this thorny issue, the FCC has been lobbied to tighten
the requirements on broadcasters to air &quot;educational&quot;
programs. Here is a closer look at what is proposed.
<p>
<center><h3>DEFINING A MORE &quot;PARTICULARIZED&quot; EDUCATIONAL
AND INFORMATIONAL CONTENT</h3></center>
<p>
Currently, the FCC has broad discretion in defining what is good
TV fare for children. Stations can cite anything aired as part
of their repertoire of child-friendly programming. In 1990, Sen. Daniel 
Inouye provided this definition to convey the intent of Congress:
<p>
&quot;Educational and informational needs encompass not only intellectual
development, but also the child's emotional and social development.
Pro-social programming which assists children to discover more
about themselves, their families, and the world would qualify.&quot;[11]
<p>
The danger in adopting a more refined definition is that it may
lead to a one-size-fits-all, government-designated type of children's
programming. Given the ability of ideologues of various stripes
to commandeer government power to their advantage, expanding the
FCC's power in this way may lead to politically correct programming.
Religious programs might be considered either unimportant or even
detrimental, depending on who is doing the assessment and whose
agenda is being served. As government power grows, religion is
pushed out of the public square by those who expansively interpret
the &quot;wall of separation&quot; between church and state. Also,
concern for &quot;diversity&quot; of lifestyle might weigh more
heavily with the FCC than imagination and dramatic content.
<p>
For example, the Public Broadcasting Service outlet in Akron,
Ohio, aired the one-hour homosexual propaganda show <I>What If
I'm Gay?</I> between <I>Kidsongs TV</I> and <I>Sesame Street</I>,
from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. one Thursday in July 1994.[12] Someone thought
this was suitable educational fare for a preschool audience.
<p>
Appointing an academic panel to come up with suitable definitions,
which some FCC observers have proposed, is also fraught with peril,
since academia has proved to be at least as susceptible as government
bureaucrats to the virus of political correctness. And the networks are not 
immune to the same cultural forces. Turner Broadcasting's <I>Captain Planet</I> 
is often cited as an example of responsible privately-generated programming 
for children, but the show also has been severely criticized by some observers 
for its allegedly radical environmentalist themes.
<p>
<center><h3>QUOTAS FOR EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION</h3></center>
<p>
Any government regulation that forces privately owned broadcasters
to air specified content risks violating the First Amendment guarantee
against forced speech of any kind.
<p>
Courts consistently have allowed only the narrowest exceptions
to this rule. In 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that any government
content rules must be &quot;narrowly tailored to further a substantial
government interest.&quot;[13]
<p>
The U.S. Supreme Court in 1973 upheld the FCC's refusal to force
broadcasters to carry editorial advertisements, saying that such
a move runs &quot;the risk of an enlargement of Government control
over the content of broadcast discussion of public issues.&quot;[14]
In 1974, the Supreme Court upheld the right of a newspaper not
to have to publish government-dictated copy.[15] And in 1986, the
Supreme Court reiterated that &quot;what to say and what to leave
unsaid&quot;[16] were both protected by the First Amendment's prohibition
against &quot;abridging the freedom of speech.&quot;
<p>
In Turner Broadcasting Systems v. FCC (1994), which concerned
whether cable systems could be compelled to carry broadcast signals,
the U.S. Supreme Court said of the FCC that &quot;oversight responsibilities
do not grant it power to ordain any particular type of programming
that must be offered by broadcast stations.&quot;[17]
<p>
The FCC itself has never adopted specific prescriptions of programming,
and has formally rejected such proposals on two occasions.
<p>
Apart from the constitutional question, the FCC would have to
justify such a major government intrusion by proving that 1) there
is an indisputable need for such programming; 2) such programming
does not exist already or 3) children do not have reasonable access
to such programming if it does exist.
<p>
There is very little independent data to indicate that children
are better off watching television -- even &quot;educational&quot;
TV -- than playing, reading or engaging in other activities. In
fact, the drumbeat for &quot;educational&quot; television is part
of a larger lobbying effort in behalf of the concept of early
childhood education. The current, number-one education goal of
the Clinton Administration is that every child &quot;come to school
ready to learn.&quot;
<p>
Declining literacy rates and school test scores have persuaded
some educators to target preschoolers for education, despite the
fact that the presumed benefits of early introduction to formal
learning lack a solid base of research. Just as the supporters
of Head Start have justified its efficacy repeatedly over the
years by reference to a single, nonrepresentative study of 52
preschoolers in a private day-care setting,[18] the educational TV
lobby has based its case for early formal learning on studies
that raise questions of bias.
<p>
In its FCC brief, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting cites
a &quot;1995 report released by Children's Television Workshop&quot;
revealing that &quot;viewing educational television, including
Sesame Street, helps preschoolers in three ways: they are better
prepared to enter school; they perform better on verbal and math
tests as late as age 7; and they spend more time reading.&quot;
Children's Television Workshop produces <I>Sesame Street</I> and
other public TV children's programs. Other data cited by CPB (from
a study commissioned by CPB) indicates that &quot;88 percent of
all preschoolers and 80 percent of all kindergartners watch at
least one of four public broadcasting programs each week -- <I>Sesame
Street, Reading Rainbow, Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</I> and <I>Barney
and Friends</I>.&quot;[19]
<p>
If this is so, then the question must be asked: If PBS educational
television has made such a difference, why have test scores continued
to decline? According to <I>Ready to Learn</I>, a 1991 report
by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, increasing
numbers of pupils are deficient in language skills. Why do children
seem less prepared? Could it be that children have become so addicted
to television that they have difficulty concentrating on real
school work? Could it be that a steady diet of television reduces
a child's attention span more than it educates?
<p>
PBS defenders often cite studies by the Educational Testing Service,
sponsored by Children's Television Workshop, that report significant
gains among young viewers in a number of basic skills such as
counting and naming letters and numbers. A later Russell Sage
Foundation review of the data concluded that the gains were more
modest and that they could be attributed to other factors inherent
in the research method. Also, the Sage study found that the show
increased the intellectual gap between middle-class and poor children,
the opposite of ETA's findings.[20]
<p>
Something of a national sacred cow, <I>Sesame Street</I> is loved
by children and adults alike. Its production values have always
been high, and the content is witty and funny. Big Bird, Bert
and Ernie and other characters have become national icons.
<p>
Touted since its inception as an educational device, the show
is high-quality enter-tainment that parents often will watch with
their children. However, the &quot;educational&quot; effects,
some critics argue, may have been exaggerated to garner public
funding and to alleviate the guilt of parents who let <I>Sesame
Street</I> baby-sit their toddlers for hours on end.
<p>
One <I>Sesame Street</I> critic, Kay S. Hymowitz, even questions
the show's central premise -- that it is good for children. Writing
in the public policy periodical <I>City Journal</I>, Hymowitz
notes that for all its touted &quot;diversity,&quot; <I>Sesame
Street</I> &quot;couldn't be more monocultural and conformist
in its unwavering endorsement of American anti-intellectualism
and [the] cult of the cool.&quot;[21] Hymowitz explains that the skits
trivialize great literature and great events by making them conform
to whatever is current in popular culture, particularly television
shows. She also detects a drumbeat that kids must be &quot;cool&quot;
about everything. Encouraging children to adopt a skeptical approach
to life teaches the &quot;folly&quot; of being passionate about
anything. This can have the side effect of encouraging children
to detach from the beliefs of their parents.
<p>
Hymowitz also notes that <I>Sesame Street</I> &quot;focuses on
mere technical skills, the tools of mental cultivation, rather
than mental cultivation itself; the building blocks of thought
rather than thought....Worse, the show's anti-intellectualism
and its glorification of television culture over print send the
implicit message that the skills of literacy have no meaningful
purpose.&quot;
<p>
Aware that she may come off as something of an Oscar the Grouch,
Hymowitz acknowledges the show's appeal (&quot;who can resist
the clever witticisms of sophisticated television?&quot;) but
stresses that her main concern is the impression that <I>Sesame
Street</I> is an unalloyed educational bonanza.
<p>
No matter how educational <I>Sesame Street</I> appears to be,
if its net effect has been to make school seem dull by comparison,
and to help shorten youngsters' attention spans, then it may not
be such a good idea to promote television viewing of any type
for children. The most powerful argument, outside CTW's own studies,
is that children &quot;are going to watch TV anyway,&quot; which
has some resonance, given the overwhelming evidence that children
do spend many hours in front of the tube.
<p>
Finally, considering the enormous amount of &quot;educational&quot;
programming provided by public television[22] (PBS regularly airs
such popular shows as <I>Sesame Street, Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood,
Barney and Friends, Where in the World Is Carmen San Diego?, Ghostwriter,
Puzzleplace, Shining Time Station</I> and <I>Reading Rainbow)</I>
and the fact that most American children are already tuning into
these shows in large numbers, and the fact that the networks have
increased their &quot;educational&quot; output significantly in
recent years,[23] proponents would be hard pressed to prove that children
have so little access to &quot;educational&quot; television that
an unprecedented government intrusion into content is warranted.
<p>
CTA sponsor Sen. Daniel Inouye noted during debate over passage
of the bill in 1990 that the total programming mix should be &quot;left
to the discretion of the broadcaster, taking into account what
other stations, including non-commercial ones, are doing in this
important area.&quot;[24]
<p>
<center><h3>PROGRAM SPONSORSHIP OPTION</h3></center>
<p>
Public television has nearly monopolized weekly children's programming.
The FCC is considering allowing commercial stations to subsidize
such programming on other channels (such as PBS) as a way to satisfy
their overall duty to serve children's needs. This proposal has
support primarily from the public broadcasting community. In its
FCC brief, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting notes that:
&quot;With CPB at the helm, public television has embraced the
education of America's youth as its core mission for over 25 years.&quot;[25]
CPB promotes the concept of the &quot;program sponsorship&quot;
option in which broadcast licensees would meet a prescribed quota
of children's programming by airing it or by providing &quot;financial
or in-kind support&quot; to &quot;host&quot; stations in the same
market.
<p>
CPB notes that this would result in &quot;shifting programming
dollars to the broadcasters with the greatest expertise in and
commitment to children's educational programming -- the noncommercial
educational broadcasters.&quot;[26]
<p>
CPB also suggests that stations should not be allowed to satisfy
all of the requirement this way, and should provide at least some
educational broadcasts of their own, citing Sen. Inouye's wish
that the FCC &quot;would, of course, expect that each station
will itself broadcast some programming specifically designed for
children to serve their educational and informational needs.&quot;[27]
<p>
Several critics have charged that the formula amounts to a guaranteed
subsidy to Children's Television Workshop, among others. Dr. Laurence
Jarvik of the Center for the Study of Popular Culture calls the
idea &quot;a shakedown by PBS, pure and simple. You might as well
have Big Bird put a gun to their head.&quot;[28]
<p>
Peggy Charren, founder of Action for Children's Television, also
opposes the sponsorship option: &quot;PBS serves the needs of
children now. Allowing stations to simply pay another station
to do programming does not fulfill stations' obligations to serve
the needs of children.&quot;[29]
<p>
Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Media Education,
which lobbies for the new FCC requirements, nonetheless also opposes
the sponsorship option: &quot;The intent of the law was for every
station to air a significant amount of programming for children.&quot;[30]
<p>
Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), who, as chairman of the House telecommunications
subcommittee played an important role in passing the CTA, said
in an interview that &quot;the intent of the Act was not to have
stations pay PBS to do their programming for them.&quot;[31]
<p>
<center><h3>ADOPTING LICENSING RENEWAL &quot;PROCESSING GUIDELINES&quot;
</h3></center>
<p>
Processing guidelines would designate how much &quot;educational
or informational&quot; material had to be included for a licensee
to qualify under any new definitions. They would be the &quot;teeth&quot;
for the FCC to withhold license renewal based on compliance. As
such, they would constitute the equivalent of program quotas,
which would be an infringement of broadcasters' First Amendment
rights.
<p>
<center><h3>RESTRICTING CREDIT FOR &quot;EDUCATIONAL&quot; FARE
TO &quot;CORE,&quot; STANDARD-LENGTH PROGRAMMING ONLY</h3></center>
<p>
In an attempt to ensure regularity of wholesome content, proponents
suggest that broadcast licensees not be able to include specials
and short subjects when they make their case to the FCC that they
have served the &quot;educational and informational&quot; needs
of children. They recommend that only regularly scheduled, 
&quot;standard-length&quot; programs (at least a half-hour in length) be 
counted.
<p>
While the intent seems reasonable, the formula would discourage
imaginative public service announcements generated by the ad industry
and by interest groups. It may also discourage sponsorship of
TV specials.
<p>
The Walt Disney Company, which produces all manner of children's
programming, argued in its FCC brief for the value of non-regular
programming:
<p>
&quot;Certain lessons, for example, can be conveyed best in a
short segment, but might become overbearing or pedantic if relegated
to a 15- or 30-minute format. Anyone who can recall the impact
of the anti-drug commercial depicting a man breaking an egg into
a frying pan and watching it sizzle with the voice-over, 'This
is your brain. This is your brain on drugs. Any questions?,' knows
the unique educational value that such programming can have.&quot;[32]
<p>
<I>Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue</I>, described by NBC as &quot;a
history-making animated anti-substance abuse television special
for children,&quot; was broadcast on all major TV networks and
&quot;hundreds of independent stations and cable outlets throughout
the U.S.&quot;[33] ABC airs the Schoolhouse Rock series during its Saturday 
morning lineup. The animated, three-minute segments are set to music and
have featured such topics as multiplication tables (<I>Zero Is
My Hero</I>), grammar (<I>Conjunction Junction</I>), history (<I>Preamble
to the Constitution</I>), and science (<I>Electricity</I>).[34]
<p>
The Senate Report on the Children's Television Act of 1990 emphasizes
an &quot;overall&quot; assessment of programming to children,
and specifies that the requirement &quot;does not exclude any
programming that does in fact serve the informational and educational
needs of children.&quot;[35]
<p>
An alternative to a ban on counting other than &quot;core&quot;
programs might be for the FCC merely to state that it encourages
more regularly scheduled programming for children as part of a
good-faith effort by broadcasters. Licensees could then score
points by offering more &quot;core&quot; shows, but be able to
present significant short-subject spots as additional proof of
commitment to children's needs. Again, this is contingent upon
acceptance of an increase in the FCC's power over children's programming.
<p>
<center><h3>REQUIRING ON-AIR DESIGNATIONS OF PROGRAMS AS 
&quot;EDUCATIONAL&quot;</h3></center>
<p>
Children are drawn to particular television shows for their entertainment
value. Parents may be far more interested in a show's educational
content. An on-air designation might seem to be a valuable tool
for parents, but it risks the same problems as posed by specific
content regulation. Educational designations could be granted
or withheld arbitrarily or for ideological reasons. The designations
could also have the unintended effect of &quot;warning&quot; children
that &quot;somebody thinks this is good for you, so prepare to
be bored.&quot; Good, entertaining educational fare could wind
up being stigmatized.
<p>
The idea has other problems. As Disney points out, &quot;requiring
an on-air identification attached to a particular program will
serve no such benefit unless the parent is not only watching television
but also watching the particular channel at the moment the identification
is aired.&quot;[36]
<p>
A system to determine such designations would artificially divide
the world of programming into the &quot;educational&quot; and
the &quot;uneducational.&quot; Since the definition of &quot;educational&quot;
is so subjective, and programming does not lend itself to such
draconian division, the system would be unworkable. It is a simple
task to affix warning labels because of specific content, such
as sex, violence or vulgar language, which can be quantified.
But it is another to determine an entire program's subjective
worth as an educational device.
<p>
A reasonable alternative might be to encourage the provision of
published guides on TV content and program guides for parents.
But again, this should not be required.
<p>
<center><h3>DEFINING AS &quot;EDUCATIONAL&quot; THOSE PROGRAMS
FOR WHICH EDUCATIONAL CONTENT IS A &quot;SIGNIFICANT&quot;
PART OF THE SHOW</h3></center>
<p>
When the FCC first proposed new rules for children's TV, the agency
suggested that education must be the &quot;primary&quot; purpose
of educational programs. Now, it has shifted to the stance that
education be a &quot;significant&quot; purpose. This was a reasonable
accommodation, given the power of entertainment to attract viewers.
<p>
<I>Bill Nye the Science Guy</I> is a Disney-produced weekly program
that teaches children about scientific wonders using graphics,
special effects, music video-type sound and comedy.
<p>
&quot;Someone recently asked me to break down into percentages
the entertainment and educational components of our show,&quot;
Nye told an interviewer. &quot;Quite honestly, I couldn't do it.
But I am 100 percent certain that the program is more than 50
percent entertainment -- or kids wouldn't watch.&quot;[37]
<p>
The jury is out as to what exactly is educational fare. Jarvik
notes that even shows such as the Fox cartoon comedy <I>The Simpsons</I>
should not be dismissed as lacking educational content. &quot;While
I don't approve of a foul-mouthed brat, at the least, children
see a family with a father and mother. I suspect that some of
those who disapprove of <I>The Simpsons</I> dislike the idea of
kids seeing an intact, traditional family, and would rather replace
it with something like a cartoon television version of <I>Heather
Has Two Mommies</I>.&quot;[38]
<p>
Moreover, much of the television that children watch is not geared
specifically for them but may, in fact, be educational. What do
children derive from seeing re-runs of <I>The Waltons</I>, for
instance? The hour-long show, in syndication, features a wholesome
Virginia family working out its problems during the Depression.
While not being specifically &quot;educational,&quot; the show
conceivably conveys more valuable information about life to children
than a designated &quot;educational&quot; program.
<p>
<center><h3>EXCLUDING FOR CREDIT ANY PROGRAMS THAT AIR BEFORE 7 A.M. AND
AFTER 10 P.M.</h3></center>
<p>
Proponents of this provision charge that TV stations are airing
some &quot;educational&quot; programs when no one is watching,
in the early hours of the morning, for instance. They want a 7
a.m. standard so that more children would be exposed to educational
content.
<p>
In many markets, public television provides <I>Sesame Street</I>
and other children's shows beginning at 6 a.m. and running throughout
the morning. TV ratings data, as noted in a July 1995 opinion
of the federal D.C. Court of Appeals, show that many children
are viewing television between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., and even later
into the evening.[39] The Nielsen Company has found that an estimated
1.5 million children aged two to 11, or five percent of all children,
watch TV Monday through Friday at 6 a.m and that an estimated
2.4 million children aged two to 11 (6.3 percent) tune in by 6:30
a.m.[40] Rule proponents contend that this is too small a proportion
of child viewers to make enough difference.
<p>
The networks contend that most educational programming takes place
after 7 a.m. anyway. A study by the National Association of Broadcasters
says that during fall 1994, some 81.4 percent of programs identified
by licensees as &quot;educational and informational&quot; were
broadcast after 7 a.m, with 15.8 percent being aired before 7
a.m.[41] NBC, in its FCC brief, suggests that the FCC give credit
with no time limit, but &quot;if the Commission nonetheless feels
compelled to take some action to allay its concerns in this regard,
we believe it should simply state that licensees must broadcast
some qualifying standard-length programming after 7 a.m. and that
licensees meeting this standard will receive full credit for all
their qualifying programming broadcast during the hours of 6 a.m.
to 11 p.m.&quot;
<p>
Limiting credit to educational fare after 7 a.m. might eliminate
some licensees' obvious dodges, such as scheduling a teen educational
program at 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, when most teens are still
asleep. But it might have an unintended effect of discouraging
<I>any</I> educational programming between 6 a.m .and 7 a.m.,
when up to two million children are watching. Perhaps the FCC
should consider counting as educational fare during those hours
only those programs that appeal to the prime audience during that
time -- small children.
<p>
<center><h3>MONITORING THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING OVER
A SPECIFIC TIME PERIOD</h3></center>
<p>
One of the more arguably valuable functions of government is data
collecting, since this can shed light on a problem. It can also
create issues, and data can be (and frequently is) manipulated
for partisan ends. But at least the government must give everybody
access to the data.
<p>
Outside of the census, there is no constitutional provision for
federal agencies to collect data. The best argument that can be
made is that data collection helps bureaucrats and lawmakers do
their job better, so it adds to the &quot;general welfare.&quot;
<p>
Should the FCC decide to do anything with regard to children's
television, the agency is on the safest grounds in collecting
data on programming. But the enterprise is open to abuse, such
as widely-varying definitions of what constitutes &quot;educational
and informative&quot; programming for children. This brings us
back to the central problem: Is the federal government legally
and practically suited to the task of fine-tuning children's television?
The honest answer is no.
<p>
<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>
<p>
More federal control of children's television programming is not
in the best interests of children and their parents and would
constitute an unwarranted violation of the First Amendment rights
of broadcasters. Children learn in many ways, and government-dictated
designation of some material as &quot;educational&quot; may lead
to politically-correct programming and more government control
of the dissemination of information. The FCC should reject the
proposed rules.

Former House Committee on Ways and Means welfare analyst Ron Haskins
reviewed the research on Head Start in 1990 and found that &quot;results
from Head Start projects are uncertain for the special education

The Predictable Perversities of Bureaucratic Behavior

John Baden

<p>
There is a strong tendency for such organizations to be run for the benefit
of those in charge. This has profound implications for those in the agency
and for those they are to serve.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A bureaucracy is a formal organization that derives all or a substantial
portion of its budget from transfers. When the bureaucracy is a government
agency, these exchanges are not made on the basis of mutual consent. I do
not, for example, willingly give the Forest Service money to subsidize
clearcutting in the Gallatin National Forest. It impairs my viewshed, silts
my irrigation system, assaults my ecological and economic sensitivities,
and lowers the value of my property. Unfortunately, we have no choice but
to pay for these programs that reduce both our welfare and our sense of
what is right.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What's worse, the Forest Service cannot go bankrupt. Its programs pay off
too many politicians and special interests to prevent this economically
rational and environmentally preferable outcome. Unlike Apple Computer,
the Forest Service can lose money for 95 years and persist. So long as
their programs reward politicians and their political clientele, they can
mix good deeds with genuine plunder.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Governments have no monopoly on bureaucratic organization. Most
corporations have divisions that derive income from transfers within the
company, e.g. public affairs departments. These units, however, are rarely
if ever dominant. Rather, they are subordinate to the divisions that
generate income by selling products to willing buyers. While research and
public affairs departments are bureaucratic in structure, their pathologies
are smaller and their behavior far more responsive to the organization's
mission than that of government agencies. Deviations are constrained by
those who watch the bottom line.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This point is critical to understanding bureaucratic behavior; however
noble and inspired their genesis, bureaucracies are ultimately run for the
benefit of the head bureaucrats and the clientele upon whom they depend.
There is a historical, near gravitational, pull towards this outcome.
Resistance requires intelligence, integrity, and a continuously reinforced
sense of purpose. Few organizations have it.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When public surveillance is difficult, we can expect bureaucracies'
self-serving tendencies to become more pronounced. For instance, although
both have strayed from their alleged purpose, we would expect the CIA to be
more corrupt than the BIA. Fortunately for their leaders, we will never
know.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Returning to the theme of bureaucratic perversities, compare university
parking with that of shopping malls. In malls, employees, including
managers, park not near the entrance but rather in an out-of-the-way,
inconvenient location. The decision-makers who determine parking rules find
it beneficial to reserve the most convenient parking for customers.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In contrast, however, central administrators at universities and government
agencies have preferential, often specifically designated parking spots
marked with titles if not names. Even a former university president, driven
from office by gross improprieties if not criminal violations, retained his
preferential parking privileges. The perfidious president preserved his
privileges.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In general, bureaucrats make rules to maximize their convenience and
control over resources. This logic trumps the purpose justifying their
creation. What does it matter if mere professors, those who do the actual
teaching and research and students who pay the tuition, must park in the
dark and slog through seven months of Montana slush if those who
make the rules are spared these costs? A mall based on such privilege would
soon lose business, but rulemakers in universities are insulated from such
pressures.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
None of this is surprising. And it would be as naive to rail against as to
protest gravity, or the preferential treatment of contributors by
politicians. That is the way things work. While this behavior erodes morale
and causes no end of mischief, the costs take many years to accumulate. By
then, the culprits are often retired and on retainer.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In principle, the specific example is trivially easy to fix. Ration the
parking spaces by price. People who enjoy walking can also enjoy parking in
a cheap or free area. Those who are infirmed or busy, pack heavy loads, or
dislike exercise can allocate more of their scarce resources to
preferential parking spaces and cut back on other luxuries. Truly
handicapped individuals can have reserved parking. I've yet to hear a
reasonable objection to this.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Will this obvious reform be enacted at universities across the land? Such a
reform would require those who now receive preferential treatment at little
cost to pay for their privilege. It was indeed an aberration when Congress
made itself subject to the rules by which the rest of us must live. This
too will erode. For good or bad, it is one of the verities of life that
bureaucracies are run largely for the benefit of the bureaucrats in them.
To expect otherwise is to confuse hopes with expectations.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This essay is dedicated to the faculty and administration of Montana State
University in the hope that I never again have to sit through a dinner
party where conversation is dominated by the subject of on- and off-campus
parking.

New demographics and cultures are defining the next American West.
Newcomers, urban and affluent, are escaping cities to build better lives.
They work with information and manipulate symbols rather than stuff, and
bring with them an utterly different value system for the land. A value
system based on a romantic notion of the West's ecosystems and communities.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To them, it is not the commodity, but the amenity values of lands that
matter most-wilderness, open space, fish and wildlife, recreation. They
demand that theirs be the majority voice in protecting those values. Many
locals are resentful.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Change often generates more anger and frustration rather than adaptation
and cooperation. Few newcomers appreciate the skill, tenacity, and hard
labor that traditional Western jobs require. And long-time residents need
to honestly wrestle with the perspectives and ideas of newcomers. Both must
recognize that the West's metamorphosis requires compromise.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Fundamental to this negotiation is respect for the underlying qualities and
values that have long defined the West. Here's a story from a recent trip
to Oregon State University, the Vatican of saw log forestry, that frames
the debate for me. I share it to illustrate that as we rush toward a new
West we're in danger of losing more than old-growth and open spaces.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I used to work in the woods. Mainly in the northern Rockies of Montana and
Idaho. I had always wanted to work in the big timber of the Pacific
Northwest, and in 1977, I finally got the chance. On sabbatical leave from
my regular university post, I taught a forest policy course at Oregon State
University. This left plenty of time to work in the woods.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nearly 20 years later I was back at O.S.U., with my wife Ramona, who had a
few days of meetings. Corvallis now sports Starbucks Coffee, Birkenstocks
and other signs of fundamental change. While Ramona worked with her fellow
academics, I rode my bike. One afternoon, I pedaled the 12 miles to
Lebanon, the town where I lived while working in the Oregon timber. I
wanted to visit the saw shop that kept timber fallers supplied and
maintained. In particular, I wanted to see Ken, the shop owner. Also, I
needed a new saw.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The last saw from my days in the woods, my first Husqvarna, recently died.
I had bought it at the Lebanon Saw Shop. It spent its declining years on
our ranch near Bozeman, cutting fence posts and firewood. That's an easy
life for a pro saw, so it lasted a long time.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Peddling into town, I found the shop was in the same place, the storefront
more faded, the front windows more dusty and greasy. It's hard-core, a good
place to find recipes for spotted owl. My Lycra was on trespass in
corked-boot territory. Inside, the rich petroleum smell of 2-cycle exhaust
was the same. The owner, Ken, last saw me when I worked nearby bucking
old-growth Doug fir on Weyerhaeuser land for a contract cutter. He looked
up from his work as I entered.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Hi, Ken," I said. "Remember a guy from Montana who came in here around
1977? Wanted leads on a job in the woods, but he could only work three days
a week? You found him a job and later said that you wouldn't have if you'd
known he was professor." I took off my Bolles.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Damn! Hi, John." He grinned and stuck out a calloused hand. We exchanged
news and he told me things were great for business, but for all the wrong
reasons. "With the federal lands shut down, we're selling saws to every
farmer and wood lot owner with a few second and third growth trees," he
said. "Less wood more saws. Not many pros in the woods anymore." He is
looking towards the future. When he gets out of the saw business he'll cut
his retirement, a wood lot he's owned for years. The changing values of the
new West aren't for Ken.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Ken, the last saw I got from you just wore out. Will you send me a new
one? I can't carry it on my bike, and I don't have cash with me," I said,
"but I have a Visa card."
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Hell, don't bother. Just send me a check when you get home."
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Husqvarna was there when I got back-a bright, new orange saw with an
extra chain, a 6-pack of oil and a black gimme cap that says:
<br>
<center>LEBANON
<center>Saw Shop Lebanon,
<center>Oregon
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I put it on to finish writing this essay. And I thought about trust-about
how relationships built of shared experiences yield trust. Twenty years and
a 900 miles away, I got my new saw on the promises implicit in work
honorably done.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I want to foster a new West that respects these values of the old. Trust
that comes from working together is high on my list. Its presence in my own
life is a recognition that those of us who now work with symbols instead of
stuff have no monopoly on what's worth preserving.
<BR>

<center><h2>William F. Buckley Jr.</h2></center>
<p>
<p>
<b>Editor-at-Large, National Review</b>
<p>
<p>
William Buckley, the founder of National Review and its 
editor-in-chief until 1990, covers a wide range of political, 
cultural, and economic issues in his syndicated columns, 
which appear in NR, and in articles and reviews written 
specifically for the magazine.  Although he has handed over 
the editorial reins to John OSullivan, he continues as the 
magazines president and editor-at-large, and he produces 
his "Notes & Asides" column each issue.
<p>
Buckley served in the Army during World War II before 
matriculating at Yale University, from which he graduated 
in 1950.  He had published his first two books, "God and 
Man at Yale" and (with L. Brent Bozell) "McCarthy and 
His Enemies," before founding National Review in 1955.  
He began his syndicated column, "On the Right," in 1962, 
and launched his weekly television show, Firing Line, in 
1966; in between, he ran for mayor of New York City in 
1965, and received 13.4% of the vote on the Conservative 
Party ticket.  He has served on the Advisory Commission of 
the United States Information Agency (1969-72), and as 
Public Member of the U.S. Delegation to the UN General 
Assembly (1973).  His 31 books include political analyses, 
sailing books, and the Blackford Oakes spy novels.  He is 
the recipient of numerous awards, including Best Columnist 
of the Year (1967), a Television Emmy for Program 
Achievement (1969), the American Book Award for Best 
Mystery (paperback) for Stained Glass (1980), and the 
Presidential Medal of Freedom (1991).<p>

You Figure It Out
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
The most recent objection to the Communications Decency Act was filed 
on Monday by Microsoft, the American Library Association, and the 
Society for Professional Journalists. Their arguments are much the 
same as those of the American Civil Liberties Union filed about eight 
minutes after the bill was signed by President Clinton. And days after 
that, the District Court in Philadelphia estopped enforcement of the 
Act on the grounds that the word &quot;decency&quot; was insufficiently defined. 
Argument will proceed. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Here are points to consider in this rerun of the People v. Obscenity, 
in which Obscenity regularly wins.
<ol>
<li>The vote in the House was 414 to 16 in favor of the Act. In the 
Senate, 91 to 5. And of course, President Clinton signed it. That's 
506 out of 527 human beings all of whom swore to uphold the 
Constitution of the United States. Yet learned and experienced men and 
women who oppose the Act merely laugh at any suggestion that they 
actually did believe the Act to be constitutional. Specifically, Ira 
Glasser, the Executive Director of the ACLU, and Susan Estrich, 
Professor of Law at the University of Southern California, who eight 
years ago managed the presidential campaign of Michael Dukakis. What's 
going on here?

<li>By way of background, what sometimes is lumped in under obscenity 
is three categories of material. One is erotica: Literature or art 
intended to arouse sexual desire (American Heritage Dictionary). A 
second is pornography: Pictures, writing, or other material that is 
sexually explicit (AHD). A third is perversity. This is the stuff of 
the Marquis de Sade. 

<li>Perversity is every now and then stopped. A few weeks ago, the 
felony conviction of Robert and Carleen Thomas was upheld. Their gig 
was something called Amateur Action, a computer bulletin board that 
advertised itself as The Nastiest Place on Earth, and featured graphic 
images of children raped by their parents, and other stuff the fingers 
balk at even typing. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But the ACLU takes the position that the First Amendment protects any 
&quot;speech.&quot; And indeed it does, but the great swindle of the century has 
been the transmutation of obscenity into &quot;speech.&quot; The absolutists go 
a long way: burning the American flag is a form of speech, they tell 
you. This would be understandable if the person protesting American 
policy were blind and dumb and had available to him to express himself 
on Capitol Hill only a box of matches and a few American flags. This 
is not to say that the lines between erotica and pornography or 
pornography and perversion are clearly drawn, but neither is the line 
clearly drawn that demands &quot;reasonable&quot; compliance with various 
provisions of the law. 

<li>Perspectives change, and they have changed during the past fifty 
years in the direction of promiscuity. In the early Sixties reasonable 
people differed on whether Fanny Hill was obscene (Answer: Of course 
it's obscene, and it's a delight). During the Sixties, Simone de 
Beauvoir was pleading the &quot;right&quot; to read the Marquis de Sade (&quot;Must 
We Burn de Sade?&quot;). So that the question became muddled: Ought works 
of obscenity and even perversion be permitted to exist (i.e., should 
they not be burned?); or, as was the case in France for 175 years, is 
the work of de Sade something that should be kept in the libraries for 
the edification of those whose business it is to probe the forlorn 
atolls of twisted minds?

<li>Leaving us with the Internet. There are obscenity laws that apply 
to television broadcasting, though they are lax; and to radio; and, as 
a matter of fact, to telephone lines. The philosophical postulate here 
is that the air is public property and government has custodial 
responsibilities over that which belongs to the people, who can 
through their representatives define toxicity as more merely than 
particulates emitted by asbestos, or whatever. The Communications 
Decency Act is aimed at protecting children, and prosecutions under it 
are supposed to bear the burden of proving that the smut-merchants had 
every reason to believe that children would be tapping in on their 
product. The lawyers call this scienter, knowingly. But the ACLU is 
correct here that whatever one's hopes for Internet-style V-chips that 
would block out noxious web sites, there can't be any assurance that 
the horny 16-year-old isn't going to succeed in tapping in on that 
stuff.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In which event you may have a law that is unenforceable, but does that 
make it unconstitutional?

<BR>
<B>His political art appears artless</B>. He is a partisan truly loved by
colleagues in the opposition party, as well as in his own. Fellow politicians
appreciate his unusual habit of giving credit rather than taking it. In
four elected offices over a cumulative 32 years, he remains one of the few
candidates who promised a voluntary limit on the terms he would serve, and
then followed through.<BR>
<BR>
	Lt. Governor Joel Pritchard is retiring from elective politics in January.
He recently conquered another bout with cancer, and &quot;Physically, he
could beat two thirds of the legislators in a foot race,&quot; says long
time aide Maury Hauser. &quot;And,&quot; he quips,  &quot;Joel has always
had excellent mental health, especially for a politician.&quot; But, at
71, Pritchard decided not to see re-election.<BR>
<BR>
	Friends think that if he had run, he would have enjoyed a third term victory
election night. So nearly 600 of them planned a &quot;Victory Party&quot;
for him anyway. Leading officials, including former Speaker Tom Foley, were
set to attend on Wednesday, as were ordinary citizens whose lives Pritchard
has touched in politics, tutoring or civic affairs. But then came the big
snow. The party was postponed.<BR>
<BR>
	Thirty two years ago he already was a standout new state representative
from the Queen Anne-Magnolia area when I first met and interviewed him.
Along with some other young legislators, including Dan Evans and Slade Gorton,
he was the subject of  an article for a magazine back in Washington, D.C.
on &quot;The New Breed in Washington State.&quot; Pritchard told me, and
the article foretold, the strategy that this New Breed--young, label free,
steeped in community work and practical ideas--was following to gain a GOP
majority in the legislature and then the governorship. It all came true.
Dan Evans became governor, elected in '64, and then Slade Gorton became
Attorney General. But what about Joel?<BR>
<BR>
	The logical step up was Congress. Joel and his brother Frank, &quot;The
Pritchard Boys,&quot; were seasoned businessmen at the Griffin Envelope
Company, but in politics they were only successful amateurs. They mainly
had aided older men such as Gov. Art Langley and a string of non-partisan
Seattle mayors. One candidate they had helped was Congressmen Thomas Pelly,
who served the north Seattle and suburban First District  ably, but long.
Joel Pritchard hankered to succeed him. In a daring bid, he confronted Pelly
in the primary election of 1970, failing, but coming too close for Pelly's
comfort. The incumbent moved his retirement plans forward, and Pritchard
was the easy winner of the nomination in 1972.<BR>
<BR>
	Trouble was, in the final election, the upbeat Pritchard faced attacks
from a vigorous Democratic opponent. He never answered the attacks and on
election night his opponent, John Hempelman, finished ahead by 1900 votes
in the regular count. But, in a story whose example echoes down to the belated
1996 victories of Reps. Jack Metcalf and Linda Smith,  Pritchard's manager,
Bob Davidson, had  hopes that a letter sent earlier to each voter who had
applied for an absentee ballot would rescue Pritchard. He needed  a whopping
58 percent of the absentees to overcome Hempelman's lead. He got 60 percent,
and finally emerged victorious, with 2622 votes to spare. <BR>
<BR>
	Back in the capitol, the dean of the state Congressional delegation, Democratic
Sen. Warren Magnuson, invited Pritchard into his office. &quot;Joey,&quot;
he said, &quot;now that you're part of the team we don't intend to take
you on again.&quot; And he--and the rest of the nearly solid Democratic
delegation--did not.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Pritchard in Congress got a lot done, quietly. Everybody's favorite tennis
companion, his self-effacing statecraft was shrewd as well as virtuous.
It enabled him to get far more done than might be expected of a relatively
junior member of a minority party. He still doesn't brag, but former staffers
are pleased to note that he wrote the first drafts of such significant legislation
as the Alpine Lakes Wilderness Park and the Klondike Gold Rush International
Park. As a one man crusader, he overcame the Democratic leadership's plan
to convert the new Library of Congress building, now known as The Madison
Library, into Congressional offices. In foreign policy, he was an ardent
promoter of free trade and a greater foreign policy emphasis on Asia.<BR>
<BR>
	Pritchard had promised to leave Congress after 12 years, and in 1984, he
did so. But back in Seattle he began to recall his happy days in the state
senate. In 1988 he was easily elected Lt. Governor, in another of his low
cost, friendly campaigns. In Olympia, too, he was a force for civility and
quiet persuasion. He worked effectively against legalized gambling and for
campaign finance reform. With Frank Schronz, Chairman of Boeing, he became
a major player in the Partnership for Learning project that is trying to
assure that the state's law on education reform is implemented thoroughly.
It would not be a surprise to see Pritchard continuing in that crucial effort
after January.<BR>
<BR>
	But on the last day of the recent session, presiding peacefully over the
Senate for the final time, he received a shock. A new and supposedly routine
resolution was working the senators into an uproar. The Republican and Democratic
staff attorneys upon whose advice Pritchard--in typical bi-partisan fashion--relied
jointly for technical advice, suddenly were nowhere to be found. Conservative
Sen. Jim West of Spokane was shouting that liberal Sen. Dwight Pelz of Seattle
was a &quot;commie pinko!&quot; A horrified Pritchard demanded order. Then
Pelz called West &quot;a right wing nut,&quot; and Pritchard was beside
himself, watching his record of fostering good will fall into ruin. Eventually,
out of the corner of his eye he saw Secretary of State Munro and Governor
Lowry in the chamber and heading toward him. The place was in a strange
agitation. Lowry took the gavel away, quite illegally, from the astonished
Lt. Governor and called for a vote. He was answered by a sea of  laughing
&quot;ayes&quot;. It turned out that the mock donnybrook was staged on behalf
of a heartfelt resolution expressing respect and affection for Pritchard.<BR>
<BR>
	Wednesday night Joel was down at the Port's International Conference Center,
along with brother Frank, &quot;just in case&quot; any of the people expected
at the party his friends were giving hadn't received word of the postponement.
Some hadn't, and after refreshments and schmoozing with Joel, a number said
they thought they would come right back again on December 6. <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Never have so many politicians </B>worked so hard and spent
so much to achieve so little change. With the White House still in Democratic
hands, Congress still Republican and exactly the same partisan division
of governors, the nation's politics are roughly where they were a year and
a half ago when history's longest presidential campaign began. What was
achieved? Altogether, marathon fundraising and organizing and advertising
achieved a great record <B><I>low</I></B> turnout, 49 percent. <BR>
<BR>
The result of the voters' collective mixed message was, give us more of
the same. What each voter was saying was more complex, of course. But surely
there is one point on which we each might agree: This thing went on far
too long. <BR>
<BR>
Fourteen months ago I wrote in this space that bunching the presidential
primaries together and &quot;front loading&quot; them in the winter and
early spring of 1996 would prolong the campaign agony for citizens as well
as candidates. No wonder the mood by election day was one of embarrassment
approaching nausea in many voters, and stunned apathy in the rest. By the
end my neighbors were muttering that they wished they had gone away on vacation.
Friends said they were tempted to lock themselves in their houses, disconnect
the television and take up meditation--or worse. Some may have been driven
mad; they haven't been seen in weeks, and certainly didn't show up at the
polls. <BR>
<BR>
It customarily is said that the voters don't start paying attention to campaigns
until Labor Day. This year they worked hard to avert their eyes through
the whole show. Thus the paradox: The longer the campaign, the less the
public pays attention. To be charitable, it wasn't so much a lack of interest
as the gagging lack of oxygen one encounters in the air of unreality around
a campaign. You can take the atmospheric depression for a couple months,
but then you start to pass out. <BR>
<BR>
Nor is the national mental health the only loss. A President was distracted
from his duties for over one fourth of his first term. Not that he minded,
of course. But those days of fundraising and leading rallies were days when
he did not attend to normal business. The same goes for the voters. The
months spent learning--falsely--that Medicare was threatened were months
when long term solutions to the looming entitlement crisis were not addressed
at all. Indeed, it could be said that by avoiding the real issues facing
the country, or exploiting them for demagogic ends, the national campaign
served to decrease the sum of popular knowledge. <BR>
<BR>
It doesn't have to be this way. In September, while our campaign ground
on, the Japanese called a national election, and six weeks later, held it.
All the action was concentrated, and therefore bearable. <BR>
<BR>
We have come to the stage of our history where elections no longer provide
political catharsis. Nor do they produce anger or division, necessarily.
They produce exhaustion. <BR>
<BR>
Of course there are no panaceas in public life, but there are some things
that could help prevent a repeat of the Long Campaign of 1996. First, the
President and Congress could agree to prohibit any dispersal of federal
campaign matching funds to abet funds raised by presidential candidates,
unless they were raised after December, 1999. That would tend to dry up
about four to six months of early campaigning, or at least to slow it. <BR>
<BR>
The second contribution to sanity would be to change the election date from
November to October and move the inauguration forward from late January
to early December. In the Information Age we don&iacute;t need several months
to communicate with voters. &quot;The first Tuesday after the first Monday
in November&quot; is a date set in law in 1872; it&iacute;s not the Constitution,
and there is nothing sacred about it. The inauguration date also can be
changed. The third week in January is typically the worst week of winter
in Washington, D.C., while early December is usually cold, but endurable,
and sometimes quite pleasant. <BR>
<BR>
Knocking out a month of campaigning at the end would concentrate people&iacute;s
interest while weakening the present demand for money for television ads.
There&iacute;s only so much air time for sale, and after a campaign starts
buying it during the midnight wrestling matches, you know they are over-spending.
If the First Amendment cannot limit spending, let the calendar do it. <BR>
<BR>
Another reform would be to persuade the political parties to pass a rule
refusing to seat delegates to the national nominating conventions who were
selected in primaries held before mid-March. This apparently is the only
way to force states to repeal the front-loaded schedule and thereby to shorten
the campaign. Unfortunately, this reform needed approval at this year&iacute;s
conventions in order to apply in 2000. <BR>
<BR>
Besides, all of this was known by the parties over a year ago and ignored.
Now that the campaign is over, the lesson also will be ignored by the public
until it is taught once more in 2000. Then it will be too late, again, to
change before 2004. There does not seem to be enough sustained public annoyance
to force Washington, D.C. to fix the problem. <BR>
<BR>
Fellow voters, am I wrong about that?</BLOCKQUOTE>

Character Is Not an Issue (No, Of Course Not!)</CENTER>

<P>	 Let's not hear any more about &quot;character', okay? This country
is moving to a values neutral, non-judgmental consciousness in which such
outdated concepts are irrelevant. &quot;Character&quot; is just another
device by which the power elite seek to instill guilt in the masses and
bring everyone under the control of old fogies and their retrograde values
system.<BR>
	Character is not an issue. Character is not an issue. Character is not
an issue. Got it?<BR>
	What's with these politicians, anyway, trying to inject a concept like
character into a straightforward contest for votes? It's very negative.
Next, they'll be quoting a bunch of dead Greeks, like Heraclitus (&quot;Character
is destiny.&quot;) or Plutarch (&quot;Character is simply habit long continued.&quot;)
We're getting tired of it, burned out. It really brings people down. Talking
about character has become a character flaw itself, when you think about
it. Especially when candidates come right out and say that's what they're
doing. Give us a candidate who has good vibes and sympathetic body language.
If he's going to attack his opponent's character, he can do it on the sly
or get a surrogate.<BR>
	Besides, character doesn't matter.<BR>
	All right, maybe it matters a little bit. But, it has to take its place
at the end of a long line of considerations used to evaluate a candidate.
First, you need someone who is smart. And a riveting speaker. Good looks
help--a lot. No Abe Lincolns need apply. And then you want someone who says
things you agree with.<BR>
	Character? A poor runner up in any relationship. Maybe you are deciding
on a home remodeling contractor, or a banker, or a teacher (if you get a
choice), or a doctor (if you get a choice much longer), or a lawyer. Do
you want a good talker or character? Right: if it doesn't feel good, don't
do it! It's not how you play the game, but whether or not you win that counts.
If someone does something wrong, better to get past it, unless of course
we can sue.<BR>
	Character! Whose character, we want to know? The graybeards that prattle
about &quot;consequences,&quot; &quot;reliability,&quot; &quot;honor,&quot;
&quot;keeping your word&quot;? Talk about quaint; the other day one of them
used the word &quot;duty&quot;! Next, it will be &quot;honesty is the best
policy!&quot; Well, they have their values, we have ours. Haven't they ever
heard about the value of a good story? Or the value of getting away with
it? Their values are yesterday's, the old Eurocentric behavior control that
runs all the way back to Aristotle and the Bible. Well, isn't it time someone
had a kind word for Nicolo Machiavelli?<BR>
	Our hierarchy of character is just different. It is headed by &quot;compassion,&quot;
which is best expressed, for example, by helping  the less fortunate with
other people's money. Next comes &quot;tolerance,&quot; sometimes recognized
as indifference with a wan smile.<BR>
	The old guard are bogged down in particulars--this poor person, that family,
the town over there--while we expand our &quot;concern&quot; to include
whole groups and abstract categories of people; indeed, &quot;The People&quot;
as a whole. So who has the larger view? Their boring politicians talk about
this bill and that amendment; our sprightly leaders talk about  the symbolic
legislation that shows how they feel. The old guard say they care about
results. Well, we are more idealistic; we care about intentions.<BR>
	That's why, as I think I said, character is not an issue.<BR>
	&quot;Right? Wrong?&quot; Very good words, useful words; we use them all
the time, in fact. But let's be serious. Right and wrong depend on the situation--and
who they are used against. What's right and wrong also depends on public
opinion, or, more particularly, on the polls. And, lately, on focus groups
and on approval meters that people can hold in their lap to record their
instantaneous reactions to a speaker's every word. <BR>
	&quot;Leadership?&quot; That's very important, too. It involves finding
out what the folks in the focus group or studio audience believe (or say
they believe) and then advocating it.<BR>
	The old timers prefer principles to values, because they are more permanent,
and they think that human nature really doesn't change over time. We moderns
hope human nature does change because we are trying constantly to change
it. And we ignore principles and prefer values, because values can be anything
you want. They are merely an appendage of a constantly evolving  social
order, a reflection of the power structure at any given moment. As time
goes by, it is smart to abandon some values as they become  inconvenient.
Other values we just give others new meanings; for example, &quot;creative.&quot;
And other values we invent; for example, &quot;energetic.&quot;<BR>
	So character is not an issue.<BR>
	One candidate is a human weathervane? So? His opponent has changed his
mind on several occasions; who is he to talk?<BR>
	One candidate routinely breaks his word? So? His opponent failed to achieve
his whole agenda.<BR>
	They're all the same. It's all relative. Character is not an issue. Really,
it's not.<BR>
	Feel better now? Good. Feelings are what it's all about.<BR>

The Reality of Drugs Belies a Cartoon-style Answer</CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Garry B. Trudeau, creator of the comic-strip Doonesbury, is
one of your star Boomer celebrities, a self-appointed guru of perpetual
'60s cool. It was Trudeau who invented the jaunty Mr. Butts character that
mocks the tobacco companies and the politicians who take their contributions.
Today Mr. Butts figures haunt only Republican rallies, despite the annoying
fact from the National Library on Money and Politics that more than half
of the tobacco support of congressional candidates from 1980 to 1994 went
to Democrats.<BR>
<BR>
Real history, in contrast to cartoon history, has that way of interfering
with a good story. In Mr. Trudeau's case, this crusader against the legal
vice of tobacco recently felt obliged to write an essay in Time magazine
regarding his own past use of illegal narcotics. Were RJR Nabisco sleuths
about to expose him? Regardless, his confession is not the mea culpa of
a Newt Gingrich or even the denial of a Bill &quot;I didn't inhale&quot;
Clinton. Instead, Trudeau manages to say only briefly that he no longer
advocates drugs, while telling us at length how much he once enjoyed them
and even sold them. He implies that he only quit once he became a parent,
not so many years ago. &quot;To summarize,&quot; he writes, &quot;at one
time I possessed, consumed and probably distributed marijuana--activities
for which I may feel embarrassment but not guilt.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
These &quot;memories of TOKING UP are fondly held,&quot; he coos in capitals.
&quot;Finally, I admit that this has not caused me to lose a moment of sleep,
except as it has pertained to my career.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
How&Igrave;s that as a didactic tale for the kids? Tobacco's bad for you,
but dope's a bit of a kick. Cartoonist, draw thyself!<BR>
<BR>
The Clinton Administration also did not take drugs very seriously for over
three years; indeed, until a political attack appeared on the horizon. Then
the Administration, too, came up with the preposterous attempt to switch
the subject to cigarettes.<BR>
<BR>
In the first three years of the Clinton presidency, Surgeon General Joycelyn
Elders proposed looking into legalizing drugs and the Justice Department
recommended reducing mandatory sentences for drug crimes. The President
slashed the staff of his drug office by 80 percent and reduced interdiction
of drugs at the border and eradication efforts overseas. Coast Guard seizures
of cocaine fell 45 percent and marijuana, 90 percent. Supply reduction was
deemed a waste of time and money. <BR>
<BR>
When a report was produced for the Pentagon by the Institute for Defense
Analysis (IDA) suggesting the contrary--that interdiction is a &quot;cost
effective operational strategy for increasing cocaine prices and thereby
reducing cocaine use in the United States&quot;--the Administration held
up dissemination. Only insistence by the Republican dominated House Government
Reform and Oversight Committee brought the report to public awareness last
week. The full contents still have not been released.<BR>
<BR>
It apparently was the Administration's expectation that increased funds
for drug treatment would bring about demand reduction. Indeed, <I>The Man
From Hope</I>  told a group of Miami middle-schoolers last spring that drug
use had gone down &quot;every year for the last three years.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But the hard facts showed the hope was false. The National Household Survey
on Drug Abuse for 1995 revealed that drug use among teens rocketed upward
105% since 1992. Cocaine use among teens soared 166%. Compared to the past,
the drugs themselves have become cheap, &quot;pure&quot; and dangerous.
This would tend to validate the IDA study. Greater drug supply produces
lower prices and wider availability. Lessened drug education, meanwhile,
lowers the threshold for initial usage. Drug treatment for addicts, a Clinton
priority, is a valuable and humane service, but not much of an answer to
expanded drug supply and usage.<BR>
<BR>
The Administration tried to wriggle off the bad publicity--and escape the
merciless Dole ad showing candidate Clinton in 1992 laughing on MTV that
he wished he had inhaled--by pinning the problem on the Bush years. The
numbers in that period, however, don&Igrave;t show anything more than anti-drug
efforts and drug usage reaching a plateau. So another spin was tried, that
Republicans in Congress are responsible because they have not supported
all the treatment funds the president sought. But again, even if true, that
argument begs the question.<BR>
<BR>
That question is, what works? The best answer, so far, is an all-fronts
struggle of the kind launched in the Reagan years, when drug use was cut
in half.<BR>
<BR>
Regardless of who is elected president, let&Igrave;s increase drug interdiction
and drug eradication, overseas as well as at home. From my own service as
U.S. representative to the U.N. narcotics agencies in Vienna in the '80s,
I would argue that we should solicit more international cooperation and
financial support for these tasks. Let&Igrave;s also expand assistance for
crop substitution in countries like Colombia, and thereby promote the domestic
stability that gives politicians the courage to stand up to narco-traffickers.<BR>
<BR>
Let&Igrave;s revise the once useful, but now stale, &quot;Just Say No&quot;
educational campaign among youth. Yes, we also should continue to improve
drug treatment for addicts and we should decriminalize medicinal use. And
let&Igrave;s do more to rebut Hollywood and media figures who glamorize
drugs, or, like Trudeau, laugh them off.<BR>
<BR>
As for politicians (or cartoonists), nobody cares what they did as youths.
What matters is whether they set an example as adults who have taken the
drug issue seriously.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H1><CENTER>Whitewater: Prosecute It or Drop It</CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Ted Van Dyk is a former Washington State resident</B> and
a Democrat of national pedigree, who once served as an aide to Vice President
Hubert Humphrey, later ran a Democratic policy center and advised Sen. Paul
Tsongas in his 1992  presidential bid. These days he gazes balefully over
developments in the Whitewater scandal as described in the newspapers that
arrive daily in his Washington, D.C. office; and he asks rhetorically, what
is the likely outcome of this seemingly endless mess? <BR>
<BR>
Consider this scenario, he suggests: Bill Clinton, like Richard Nixon in
1972, wins big in November, and next February independent counsel Kenneth
Starr announces an indictment. The country and the Congress are thrown into
an uproar. It's Watergate all over again and the people demand to know why
the facts had not been presented to them when they could have exercised
their own judgment at the polls. <BR>
<BR>
Now picture a second scenario: Clinton wins, but narrowly. Then the independent
counsel announces that he has found, in the familiar term of art, &quot;insufficient
grounds to prosecute.&quot; The White House and Democrats are outraged that
they have had to put up with the character issue hanging over their heads,
when an earlier resolution could have spared the President and maybe Democrats
in Congress a lot of anxiety, and maybe given them a larger mandate. <BR>
<BR>
In scenario three, the current steady erosion of news stories--Mrs. Clinton
cited for failure to report her role in the Castle Grande real estate deal,
talk of pardoning the McDougals, and what have you--take their silent toll.
Dole wins narrowly. Then, the independent counsel reports around inaugural
time that he is indicting the soon-to-be-retired Clintons. More distress,
including Republican indignation that this information was not available
at a time when it could have led to a more substantial GOP victory. <BR>
<BR>
Or, four, a narrow Dole victory is followed by a decision by the independent
counsel not to indict. Outgoing President Clinton is relieved, but angry.
This decision earlier could have saved the election for him and helped the
Democrats in Congress. The process has triumphed over justice once again.
(Van Dyk thinks the chances of indictment overall are 50-50.) <BR>
<BR>
In short, the Whitewater scandal and the investigation attending it have
dragged on so long now that it is hard to conceive of an outcome that truly
serves the nation&iacute;s interest. In 1992 the scandal was new, poorly
reported and had no effect on the election. Later, as Travelgate and other
mini-scandals developed, it was assumed that appointment of an independent
counsel (two, as it turned out) would get to the bottom of the matter and
clear it up, one way or another. Yet here we are, going through yet another
election where Whitewater and related matters whistle around the campaign
like a nasty ditty voters hate but can't get out of their heads. <BR>
<BR>
The assumption has been that because people are fatigued with Whitewater
and related matters, they also are unaware and unaffected. In fact, voters
know that questions of tax evasion, obstruction of justice and perjury are
serious, but they don't know how to assess them. In surveys, the results
are strange, and Charles E. Cook in the Capitol Hill newspaper, <I>Roll
Call,</I> is not alone in saying that he has never seen such volatility.
Consider this exotic syllogism: a) a majority of people believe &quot;character&quot;
is important in a president; b) a majority thinks Dole is far superior to
Clinton on this count, and c) a majority plans to vote for Clinton. <BR>
<BR>
If that kind of survey is accurate, does it suggest, as some say, that the
American people have lost their moral bearings? Not necessarily. It may
suggest that people have other things on their minds, and, in any case,
prefer to give the Clintons the benefit of the doubt until hard evidence
of wrongdoing is presented. Who can blame them? Theirs actually seems like
a very sensible attitude. <BR>
<BR>
For one thing, who can remember all the chapters in the Whitewater saga
as it courses through Arkansas and Washington, D.C., let alone the details?
Few Democratic leaders in Congress or elsewhere are visibly defending the
Clintons on Whitewater, yet the Dole campaign is staying away from the subject,
too. Maybe no one can follow it all. <BR>
<BR>
Of course, there are many other, on-the-record reasons for a vote against
Clinton and for Dole (and vice versa), but they are the old, standard liberal
versus conservative arguments that have divided the parties for sixty odd
years. You don't have to have Whitewater splashed in your face. Not on the
evidence so far. <BR>
<BR>
Van Dyk, who over the past few years became a public critic of Bill Clinton's
character (&quot;I believe he is badly flawed.&quot;), is now frustrated
with the failure of the independent counsel to come to a conclusion in a
timely fashion that would allow a political resolution rather than risk
a constitutional crisis. A partisan Democrat, he is foremost concerned for
the country. <BR>
<BR>
Prosecutors, he notes, always think of building as strong a case as possible
before he takes action. Let justice takes its course. But there comes a
point where more is at stake than a trial--like the future of the nation.
Thus, Van Dyk now concludes that if Ken Starr is going to bring charges,
he has an obligation to do it before election day. Otherwise, he should
drop it.<BR>
<BR>
Think about the grave implications of either course. Someone should.

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Scott Klug, clean cut and earnest, used to be a reporter
for KING-TV in Seattle. </B>He liked to investigate politicians. You would
not have suspected that he would wind up in Congress himself one day, but
that is what happened. Having returned home to Madison ,Wisconsin, Klug
got elected as a Republican to the House of Representatives. Now in Washington,
D.C.--still clean cut and earnest--he focuses a lot on cutting costs and
privatizing government programs. And he is making some progress. <BR>
<BR>
The Republican House majority, including Klug and his Washington State colleagues,
deserves credit for reducing spending growth and making a balanced budget
by 2002 a realistic goal. It wouldn't have been possible without the Republicans'
sometimes stormy insistence, and if they lose power this fall, that goal
surely will erode. But they got in political trouble when their cuts hit
some highly visible services with broad constituencies. Everybody wants
Congress to combat &quot;waste, fraud and abuse,&quot; but one voter's idea
of waste is another's idea of a vital service. <BR>
<BR>
Similarly, almost everybody would like a tax cut, as Republicans propose.
It is, or ought to be, common knowledge that when federal, state and local
taxes are combined, the American family is more heavily taxed than ever
before. But, how do you pay for a broad cut? There will be a supply side
boost to revenues when marginal tax rates are cut, but it will cover only
about a quarter of the tab. <BR>
<BR>
We clearly need greater efficiencies in government. Klug believes that government
monopolies, lacking the discipline of the free market, raise costs directly
and--by not paying taxes--indirectly, too. Privatization, while not a panacea,
can lower government costs and still improve services. <BR>
<BR>
Privatization was a subject of fashionable discussion in the 1980s, but
few actual conversions were undertaken. Selling off Conrail, the government-subsidized
freight railroad that had been picked up when Penn Central, New York Central
and several other lines failed, was one of the stellar successes. That privatization
was led by Ronald Reagan's Secretary of Transportation, Elizabeth Dole,
and turned a multi-billion dollar public revenue eater into a multi-billion
dollar tax contributor. (The Dole campaign should make more of this story.)
Klug is now among those promoting the current proposal to privatize Amtrak
passenger service. <BR>
<BR>
Klug's efforts led Speaker Gringrich last year to appoint him head of a
House privatization task force that includes, among others, Rep. Jennifer
Dunn of Bellevue, Washington. An initial effort was the abolition, privatization
or partial privatization of some nine programs within the House of Representatives
itself--from beauty and barber shops to food services and recording studios.
As Gingrich recently noted on Meet the Press, the old House still had ice
delivered twice daily to each Member&iacute;s office--80 years after invention
of the refrigerator. Most of these in-House reforms are now completed, with
expected ultimate savings to taxpayers of $44 million, a good example for
the rest of government. <BR>
<BR>
The Clinton Administration has made a few modest moves toward privatization,
of course, such as agreeing with Congress to sell the Naval Petroleum Reserves
(at an anticipated price of $1.6 billion). But Klug is skeptical of any
serious or long term Clinton commitment. Dole is much more interested. Whoever
is president, however, Klug has a long list of privatization targets. They
involve sale or lease of assets, contracting out of services, functional
conversion to the private sector and lifting legal barriers to privatization.
For example: <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI> Klug and his task force want to contract out the debt collection
activities of the IRS. Citing a General Accounting Office report and a survey
by the American Collectors Association, Klug foresees savings of over $10
billion. 
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI>$80 million could be saved by privatizing many activities of the Government
Printing Office. 
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI>Money to build badly needed new prisons could be found by turning
some operations over to private companies, which experience shows can construct
and manage prisons for 20 % less than the government. 
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI>Contracting out government commercial-style services could save &quot;as
much as $9 billion a year.&quot; Klug cites as examples the Department of
Defense and the Veteran&iacute;s Administration, which compete with the
private sector in grocery distribution. 
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI>Privatizing management of federal loan programs could save $2 billion
annually. 
</UL>
<BR>
Some of the GOP proposals Klug is introducing will require more study and
debate. For instance, he wants to move, though slowly, to sell off the electric
power projects built in the '30s and 40s. This would have been politically
unimaginable several decades ago, but, as shown in a report this month by
a bi-partisan task force of governors from the four Northwest states, even
the huge and venerable Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) is coming under
increased consideration for privatization, at least for its power transmission
system. The power industry is moving into greater competition these days
and a co-existent government monopoly makes less and less sense. Klug wisely
suggests privatization &igrave;from least to most complex&icirc;power marketing
administrations, starting with Southeastern Power Administration, and reviewing
Western Area Power Administration and BPA last. <BR>
<BR>
Perhaps it is remarkable that anyone is even able to talk about such matters
these days. Barry Goldwater's proposal in 1964 to sell the Tennessee Valley
Authority (TVA) helped defeat him. But few attack Klug in 1996 for wanting
to bring at least the non-power programs of TVA into the private, tax-paying
sector, at a savings of $140 million a year, and he bravely asks why regulated
private ownership of TVA power would not also make sense for citizen rate-payers
in today&iacute;s environment--as well as earning $28 billion for the federal
treasury. <BR>
<BR>
There, indeed, are few sacred cows in the Wisconsin representative's budget
pasture. He even dares to mention the Postal Service. Barry Goldwater himself
didn't raise such an issue. If he had, it would have been thought a joke.
But that was before private overnight mail delivery, faxes and e-mail. Now
Klug's suggestion that the Post Office evolve into an employee-owned corporation
doesn't strike most people as either ridiculous or extreme. More and more,
it sounds like common sense.<BR>

A Common Sense Test on Contemporary Politics</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER>by Bruce Chapman</CENTER>
</H4>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="/rob_c/Rob%27s%20files/DISCOVERY/starbar.gif" WIDTH=
"468" HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>Here is a test of Common Sense Opinions on Current Politics. Write true
or false next to each item and, at the end, see how you scored.<BR>
<BR>
1. A presidential candidate, such as Ross Perot, who continually fails to
reach beyond 4 to 8 percent in the opinion polls and never would have been
in the race in the first place if he hadn&iacute;t been rich, is not owed
a position in the televised presidential debates. And he shouldn&iacute;t
get one.<BR>
<BR>
2. If Perot is invited to the debates, anyway, so should Harry Browne of
the Libertarian Party and Ralph Nader of the Green Party. At least the show
would be more entertaining.<BR>
<BR>
3. Broad tax relief that allows people to spend more of their money according
to their own priorities is better than &igrave;targeted&icirc; tax breaks
that assume the government knows best how people should spend their money.
Thus, Dole is right in his approach and Clinton is wrong.<BR>
<BR>
4. Regardless, Dole, if elected, is more likely to follow through on his
tax cuts than Clinton is with his. <BR>
<BR>
5. In domestic affairs, the number one issue facing America is entitlement
spending. Both parties know that the rate of growth in Medicare must be
reduced if the integrity of the system is to be preserved, and that little
or no damage will be done to seniors if modest steps are taken now. The
actual legislation that the Republicans tried to pass was responsible and
fair, despite the demagogic spin put on it by the current crop of Democratic
and AFL-CIO ads.<BR>
<BR>
6. Social Security takes roughly 12 and a half percent of people&iacute;s
payroll income. For the next few years, while the government takes in more
from Social Security taxes than it pays out, it is possible to a) assure
present recipients of exactly the Social Security payments they expect and
b) allow young people to turn their future payments into a mutual fund savings
instrument tied to the private economy and thereby save significantly more
for their future. The proposal has wide support in think tanks and among
economists.That this idea is not even being discussed so far by either Mr.Clinton
or Mr. Dole is testimony to the threat of demagogy on this subject. <BR>
<BR>
7. Mr. Clinton has a new spending proposal each campaign day. For example,
he wants to fund more Americorps community volunteers, even though taxpayers
pay $27,000 per &igrave;volunteer,&icirc; about twice what comparable volunteers
cost private charities. If he is re-elected, Mr. Clinton&iacute;s statement
that &igrave;The era of big government is over&icirc; will become one of
the most ironic political pronouncements of all time, along with Herbert
Hoover&iacute;s &igrave;Prosperity is just around the corner.&icirc; <BR>
<BR>
8. Under the new federal so-called &igrave;reform&icirc; laws a lobbyist
may not pay for a dinner for a senator anywhere within 35 miles of the Capitol.
But he can take the senator on an &igrave;inspection trip&icirc; to Paris
and have his corporation or oganization pay for the whole thing. The rule
should be the opposite. No politician is going to be bought for the price
of a dinner, while a glamorous, all-expenses paid trip may raise &szlig;real
questions. Congress--and the professional &igrave;reformers&icirc; that
live off controversy--should get real.<BR>
<BR>
9. Under the same new &igrave;reform&icirc; laws, members of Congress who
may not receive a free meal from a lobbyist, constituents or almost anyone
else, are quite free, however, to provide free meals for the lobbyist, constituents,
or whomever. Later, the Congressmen also are free to ask the lobbyists for
campaign contributions, and from those campaign contriibutions--pooled in
their campaign funds-- pay off all their meal chits. This is considered
part of the expense of doing business, and since it can&iacute;t be charged
to the taxpayers, it can be charged to campaign funds. This shows again
a) that petty reform laws can almost always be circumvented, and b) that
there&iacute;s no such thing as a free lunch.<BR>
<BR>
10. It is wrong for the media to refer to Sherry Rowlands, the prostitute
hired by Presidential &igrave;family values&icirc; adviser Dick Morris,
as a &igrave;call girl.&icirc; The proper term should be &igrave;call person.&icirc;<BR>
<BR>
Results: The correct answer for each question is &igrave;True,&icirc; except
for the last, number 10, which is definitely false (Tsk, tsk. Common sense
must hold to standard English, even in vernacular speech--just as in standard
morality.) Give yourself 10 points for each correct answer. If you scored
under 50, you seriously need to re-examine your prejudices, although the
same is true for many of your fellow citizens and most of the media. A score
of 60 to 90 shows that you have a common sense understanding of the American
political scene. Congratulations! A perfect score puts you in perfect harmony
with the author and cannot be admired too highly. <BR>

To Succeed, Seattle Should Share the Olympics </CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman</I></CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="starbar.gif" WIDTH="468" HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

<BR>
The Seattle Bid Committe that is spearheading the drive to bring the Olympics
to Seattle and the Northwest in 2008 has entered a new, post-Atlanta phase.
First, the organizational effort is about to be intensified. Entrepreneur
Clark Kokich will operate as chairman of the committee, and internationally
known events impressario Bob Walsh will lead planning, as before. But to
provide day-to-day continuity, Dave Syferd, a noted public relations and
marketing executive, is expected to be named soon as president. The Seattle
Sports and Events Council is loaning staff to the project.<BR>
<BR>
The second post-Atlanta development is a growing recognition among supporters
that the early inspiration to seek the games on as broad a regional basis
as possible was wise and should be re-enforced. Indeed, the regional approach
would seem to have been vindicated both by the over-crowding in Atlanta
and the results of a recent Western Washington poll on the Olympics.<BR>
<BR>
Public backing in the poll actually grows when the idea is broached to make
the games a regional affair centered in Seattle, but with events staged
throughout &quot;<A HREF="cascadia.html">Cascadia</A>.&quot; This would
seem to reflect wholly legitimate concerns about traffic congestion and
about cost. If the Olympics are held on a regional basis, both traffic and
overhead expenses can be spread from Victoria and Vancouver to Portland,
though primary emphasis will remain on the Central Puget Sound area and
the official host city, Seattle. <BR>
<BR>
In Atlanta, though a few events were staged outside the metropolitan area,
regionalism was an afterthought. Central Atlanta was closed down and the
focus of non-event activity was on the new, 21 acre Centennial Park--less
than a third the size of Seattle Center. Yet, it was also Atlanta's ambition
to host the largest spectator audience ever for the Olympics. Nine million
tickets were printed. <BR>
<BR>
The solution for Seattle is 1) regionalize to the full extent feasible,
and 2) prune the spectator ticket sales back to the four million figure
typical of earlier Olympic Games, or at least to the five million number
Sydney will print for 2000. There is good reason to think that the International
Olympics Committee (IOC) will like this approach. It was Atlanta&iacute;s
idea, not the IOC&iacute;s, that bigger necessarily was better.<BR>
<BR>
It is probable that the IOC, with Atlanta&iacute;s experience to remind
it, also will approve of Seattle&iacute;s plan to share many Olympic events
with its neighbors. The IOC requires a single city to take the lead, or
else the organizing commitee already would be moving forward with a multi-city
or regional bid. Oregonians and British Columbians already serve on the
bid committee and Seattle area participants all want bi-national regional
cooperation to develop as one of the identifiable achievements of the games.
Victoria hosted the Commonwealth Games recently and Vancouver has splendid
new facilities, as does Portland. It would be a mistake not to share many
of the Olympics&iacute; 271 events with these neighbors. <BR>
<BR>
Closer to home, Tacoma and Everett are logical hubs for various events.
A new equestrian facility already contemplated for Ellensburg will help
pull events over the mountains into Eastern Washington. And what about the
state capital, Olympia? How could we pass up holding some of the classic
&quot;Olympic&quot; competitions in the city with the same name as Olympia,
Greece, the games' birthplace almost 2800 years ago?<BR>
<BR>
In further response to the traffic issue, Seattle itself would not anticipate
closing off the downtown or concentrating recreation and cultural events
in one small area. We already have a large and lively urban core with far
more attractions to disperse crowds than Atlanta had. Also, the Seattle
sponsors would integrate local government and citizen planning on both security
and transportation early on, as Atlantans, unfortunately, failed to do.<BR>
<BR>
But what about local costs, even with sharing? Didn't Atlanta's businesses,
individuals and government wind up paying nearly $2 billion for the games?
Yes, but they brought in over $4 billion. The metropolitan area was beautified,
its infrastructure--from road surfaces to new recreation, housing and park
facilities--was immensely improved. Thousands of young people gained news
skills and work experience, representing an untold increase in &quot;human
capital.&quot; Community groups pulled together and made regional alliances.<BR>
<BR>
Hosting the games, as Atlanta found out, is no panacea for poor planning
or other urban ills, but the games--the world's biggest event, and a positive
one--do represent a useful forward strategy. In Barcelona, host to the 1992
Olympics, the games (according to the mayor, quoted in the Wall Street Journal)
&quot;were fantastic, but it was only a 15 day dream.&icirc; Thanks to his
city&iacute;s revitalization, &igrave;The best moment in Barcelona is now.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Of course, there remains perhaps the biggest question: Could Seattle win
the games in the first place? Consider, for example, the image problem.
A Seattleite who was in Atlanta found himself marooned at a restaurant during
one of the frequent downpours that were common this past sticky summer --and
every summer. Sitting there, he mentioned to a local citizen Seattle's interest
in hosting the games in 2008.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Seattle?&quot; replied the Atlantan incredulously. &quot;But it rains
all the time in Seattle!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
News flash to the IOC: Late July and early August in Seattle are golden.<BR>
<BR>
My colleagues in Discovery Institute's Cascadia project are conducting a
feasibility study to examine a range of other real and imaginary obstacles
to Seattle's hosting the Olympics. If the whole region, working together,
cannot master those difficulties, then, by all means, the Olympic games
effort should be abandoned.<BR>
<BR>
But what a mistake it would be not to find out!<BR>

They're Attacking Dale Foreman to Defeat His Ideas</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="starbar.gif" WIDTH="468" HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>	State House Majority Leader Dale Foreman is a logical candidate for
governor.  He's smart, personable, and experienced. At 48, he's still a
fresh voice in politics, having been elected first only four years ago.
He's the easily-met, thoroughly decent kind of person you'd like to have
as a neighbor.  An attorney, orchardist and author, the well-rounded Wenatchee
representative has the political advantages of an earnest speaking style
and a natural bloc of support in Eastern Washington, which has long wanted
a home-based governor. He  has many friends, as well, in Puget Sound country,
where he grew up. Former King Country Prosecutor Chris Bayley chairs his
campaign.<BR>
<BR>
	 Like Jack Kemp, Foreman is a serious social as well as a fiscal conservative.
His several legal books include one describing the trial of Jesus. He also
has Kemp's redeeming grace for seeking an inclusive, welcoming Republican
party.<BR>
<BR>
	Most of all, the scholarly Foreman, better than anyone running, understands
the state budget. And he knows he wants to cut that budget.  He specifically
and courageously announced his intention to trim 10,000 jobs, and in the
campaign he has been laying out a plan for doing so. He believes efficiencies
also can be achieved through improved technology, where the state lags behind
the private sector. It is not a radical program, but a prudent, business-like
one that he realistically acknowledges will take several years to complete.<BR>
<BR>
	In fact, Foreman's &quot;Comprehensive Change and Reform Plan&quot; reads
as if he had pulled together the best ideas that such reform governors as
Tommy Thompson in Wisconsin, John Engler in Michigan and Christine Todd
Whitman in New Jersey have enacted in their states. <BR>
<BR>
	Selective pruning, notes Foreman, the orchardist, is especially overdue
in Washington State.  He points out that state government employment has
gone up more than 50 percent in the past dozen years--from approximately
60,000 to 97,000, rising at a rate twice that of population growth.<BR>
<BR>
	Unfortunately, the media has shown little interest in Foreman's proposal.
But that doesn't mean that word of Foreman's program hasn't gotten around.
His pledge to reduce the state payroll is exactly the kind of provocation
that excites active animosity from those who feel their jobs might be jeopardized.
And, sadly, some in the media, while mainly ignoring Foreman's policy ideas,
are quick to air personal attacks on him.<BR>
<BR>
	The charges began with allegations of infractions of the Public Disclosure
law, including largely technical matters, but also a remarkable claim that
Foreman, as Majority Leader raising funds to promote the GOP agenda in the
Legislature and only considering a run for governor, should have filed papers
then as if he already were a candidate. <BR>
<BR>
	This is new ground, a free speech limiting power grab by the staff of the
Public Disclosure Commission (PDC) that almost surely will lose in the courts
if the commissioners themselves pursues it. Once again the PDC will have
strayed far from its original mandate. But meanwhile, the issue assails
Foreman during the final weeks of the primary campaign--which undoubtedly
is just what the complainant intended.<BR>
<BR>
	Then there was the hot news tip--breathlessly reported--that Foreman had
been &quot;excused&quot; from some lawsuit ten years ago. Nothing illegal
or damaging there, mind you, just an &quot;appearance&quot; of an implication
of a suggestion, you might say. What mattered was not the empty story, but
the reporting of it. Where did the story come from and why didn't the media
tell us what the motivation might be?<BR>
 <BR>
	More recently, there was yet another story: that Foreman used irrigation
&quot;water-spreading&quot; on his farm in a way that had caused a dispute
with the Department of Ecology (DOE). It is one of those penny-ante accounts
that leaves the knowledgeable observer asking, &quot;So, what?&quot; But
it leaves--and is meant to leave--the casual observer musing, &quot;I don't
understand what this is about, but it must be really serious or the media
wouldn't be covering it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Where's there's smoke, there's fire, people say.<BR>
<BR>
	Except in politics, I would say, where's there's sometimes only a smoke
machine.<BR>
<BR>
	In this case, it definitely was a smoke machine. But it wasn't necessarily
operated from within the DOE. Carol Fleskes, director of shorelands and
water resources at DOE, states that &quot;We're not the ones generating
this story.&quot; DOE and Foreman--who added five acres of land to his orchard
and is using the same amount of water as before to irrigate it--do differ
on whether he now needs a new legal claim or the old one remains suficient
under the law. &quot;Until that claim is verified by the courts it is hard
for us to take any kind of action to clarify the dispute,&quot; says Fleskes.
<BR>
<BR>
	It boils down to a minor jurisdictional issue. But somebody did want to
make a big deal out of the little claim. Why?<BR>
<BR>
	Because Dale Foreman's fiscal program, even with scant media attention,
is close to hitting a popular nerve. His talent and his ideas endanger entrenched
powers as well as some rivals. Therefore, the strategy: If you don't want
to confront a candidate's ideas, attack him personally. Or see that someone
else does.<BR>

The Networks May Boycott the Conventions? Good!</CENTER>

<P>	We are all supposed to be concerned that television's Ted Koppel left
the Republican convention early and is not even going to appear in Chicago
for the Democrats' show. At San Diego, the big three networks saw their
ratings plummet and they ascribe this failure to Republicans scripting their
extravaganza so tightly that no &quot;story&quot; (also known as &quot;bad
news&quot;) broke loose. Next week, the Democrats' shindig may be just as
impervious to negative media spin--as it should be, if the Democrats have
any sense. In this contrived atmosphere, the networks are warning us that
they will consider not covering the conventions at all in the year 2000.
They're going to take their cameras and go home.<BR>
<BR>
	Now I call that really good news! It will be an excellent improvement in
politics for the next millennium.<BR>
<BR>
	In fact, if the networks do show up at future conventions, the parties
should allow them in only if they agree to reduce the number of their cloying
&quot;analyses,&quot;  floor interviews and other speech-usurping, distracting
and tendentious pelf. In San Diego, half of each network hour was taken
up by the commentators and, of course, the ads.  For example, instead of
being allowed to watch a newly discovered political gem like J.C. Watts,
the eloquent black Republican Congressman from Oklahoma, network viewers
were left with synthetic pearls from TV's shopworn celebrities. What matters
to the networks is not airing the conventions, but re-airing conventional
wisdom.<BR>
<BR>
	Overall, network convention coverage probably subtracts more from a voter's
understanding than it adds, just as self-absorbed network coverage of last
spring's primaries represented a net loss of popular deliberation in that
process (average sound bite per candidate: 7 seconds!). We can count on
similar coverage of the serious public business at hand this fall. Perhaps,
therefore, it would be just as well if the networks decided to stop covering
the final election, too. We mustn't keep them from the important fires and
hurricanes and two-headed giraffes that increasingly interest them.<BR>
<BR>
	The best advice to both parties is to stop trying so hard to please the
networks and their celebrity minions. Especially when it comes to live coverage
of political conventions, you don't need them anymore. Since the rise of
cable TV, voters have much better options, ranging from CNN, which is at
least somewhat less intrusive than the broadcast networks, to the totally
unobtrusive C-Span--the best innovation in the cause of  good government
since punch-card voting. And there's always PBS, not to mention radio and
even the comedy channel, where the humor's intentional.<BR>
<BR>
	The parties increasingly will find it advantageous to buy their own time
on TV and put their message across the way they want it, which is just what
the GOP did this year. By 2000 we'll have some version of a &quot;teleputer&quot;
(in George Gilder's phrase), computers with interactive TV capabilities
controlled by the user.  The viewer will be able to do his own editing,
as it were, listening to a convention speech in full or cutting away to
interviews or analyses as he or she--and not some network producer--desires.
When that happens, network TV convention coverage will become largely unprofitable,
anyhow. No high ratings, no big ads.<BR>
<BR>
	Meanwhile, parties have every right--and maybe a duty-- to run their conventions
to suit their own purposes, not those of the TV networks. Party conventions
are the great gatherings of the political tribes, a unique chance to showcase
familiar political favorites and emerging lights, and, for that matter,
for the party workers and leaders to mingle with counterparts from around
the country. Simply getting the party's act together is a service to the
voters; it makes each party prepare early for the possibility of governing.<BR>
<BR>
	If these communal rites are less spontaneous now than in days of yore,
it bears remembering that the scripting of conventions to look like TV shows
is directly the fault of TV itself.  Television first covered a political
convention in 1948.  By 1952, the parties were beginning to change their
procedures to accommodate the demanding new medium. In early 1956 a novel
called The Golden Kazoo accurately forecast the parties' growing obeisance
to TV and the techniques of &quot;Madison Avenue,&quot; a satiric vision
that became reality by 1960.<BR>
<BR>
	Parties and voters accepted the likes of Walter Cronkite and David Brinkley
as &quot;moderators,&quot; sitting in Olympian judgment on mere mortal candidates.
Presidential aspirants trembled at the thought that such worthies might
criticize them, even implicitly, though the media code of the time usually
prevented the networks' power from being so exercised. And if it was exercised
sometimes, the politicians, and of course the public, were too unsophisticated
to figure it out.<BR>
<BR>
	Today, the bias--usually left wing, occasionally right wing,  but almost
always skeptical and demeaning to the people in politics--is much more common,
and also more commonly understood and resented. In respect to conventions,
in any event, the parties finally learned that what made for good network
TV was not necessarily  what made for good politics. Hence, the scripting.<BR>
<BR>
	By 2000, however, it may not matter. If the networks follow through on
their threat to boycott the conventions, the only question by then will
be, who cares?<BR>

<H1><CENTER>New Faces of 1996 Politics: <BR>
Black Conservatives</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><B>by Bruce Chapman</B></CENTER>

<BR>
	Question : What do Anthony Lowe, the Deputy Prosecuting Attorney of King
County, Washington who is running for State Insurance Commissioner, Teresa
Doggett, the international banker running for Congress from Austin, Texas
and Danny Covington of Vicksburg, Mississippi, another Congressional hopeful,
have in common?<BR>
<BR>
	 Answer: they all are  conservative black Republicans who are likely to
seek support from BAMPAC--&quot;Black America's Political Action Committee.&quot;
 Expecting to raise over $1 million this year from a membership list of
37,000, BAMPAC is cited by Hill Magazine in Washington, D.C. as the fastest
growing new political action committee in the country. Its founder was the
principled and charismatic former Reagan Administration Ambassador, Alan
Keyes, who ran for president in the GOP primaries last spring.<BR>
<BR>
	A few years ago, black Republican candidates were  rarities, especially
in predominantly white districts. They did run in black districts, but were
considered little more than sacrificial lambs. Therefore, when 11 blacks
ran for Congress on the GOP line in 1990, most observers considered the
development significant. Six years later there are at least 24 black GOP
Congressional candidates--now including two incumbents, Gary A.Franks of
Connecticut and J.C. Watts of Oklahoma. As happened to blacks on the Democratic
ticket in the '70's, there suddenly are black Republicans showing up in
state offices, such as Secretary of State Victoria Buckley of Colorado and
Ohio State Treasurer J. Kenneth Blackwell. <BR>
<BR>
	Moreover, more Republican blacks are contesting Democrats in predominately
black areas. Mississippi's Danny Covington, a former parole officer and
Congressional aide with a  conservative social message, is the first black
to win a Republican primary in that state since Reconstruction days, over
a century ago. The state's US Senators, both Republicans, strongly supported
Covington against a white primary challenger.<BR>
<BR>
	Overall, the Repbublican party could only go up in terms of  black support.
Just 10 percent identify today with the party of Lincoln. But there are
ocassional races where GOP candidates receive up to 40 percent black support,
and that edge often proves decisive.<BR>
<BR>
	The first black US Senator since Reconstruction, Edward Brooke of Massachusetts
in the 1970's, was a Repbublican--one of the rarities. But Brooke was a
liberal Republican, as were many of the appointed officials advanced by
Republican presidents until Reagan. They not only backed the civil rights
gains of the '60's--as did most Republican then, and almost all by the next
decade--but also the more controversial programs, such as racial set-asides
and quotas. Their closest prominent counterpart today would be Gen. Colin
Powell, who supports &quot;affirmative action,&quot; while opposing &quot;preferences,&quot;
a fine distinction.<BR>
<BR>
	In any case, most newer black Republican elective officials are more conservative.
In this they are closest to the top black legal official in the land, Supreme
Court Justice Clarence Thomas. They like to point out that while the Republican
party, as such, is not popular among blacks, there are strong conservative
currents running in the overall black electorate.<BR>
<BR>
	A 1992 survey by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a
generally liberal think tank, confirms that more blacks call themselves
conservative than liberal (33 percent to 29 percent). A more recent poll
by the center provides a fascinating breakdown of these averages, showing
that younger black voters, 18-25, were nearly twice as likely to identify
with the Republicans as were older ones (18 percent versus 8 percent) and
to call themselves conservatives (34 percent versus 22 percent). <BR>
<BR>
	Overall, black voters supported the death penalty 58 percent to 42 percent,
backed a two year limit on welfare by 58 percent also, by nearly 75 percent
backed mandatory sentences for drug dealers, and by 61 percent agreed that
black leaders were too quick to cite racism as an excuse for black crime.<BR>
<BR>
	The Gallup survey, similarly, found 53 percent disapproval of mandatory
busing among black voters, 48 percent pro-life sentiment and 77 percent
opposition to preferential treatment to make up for past discrimination.
Some 92 percent of blacks believe in God, a figure higher than for the population
as a whole (about 85 percent).<BR>
<BR>
	Of course, these surveys do not predict voter behavior and, moreover, wording
(for example, &quot;affirmative action&quot; versus &quot;preferential treatment&quot;)
can change poll outcomes for all groups in society. Just as Southern whites
agreed with Republicans in such polls for many years and still voted overwhelmingly
Democratic, there is little sign yet of political reallignment among black
voters nationally.<BR>
<BR>
	Yet it could come; and even a rise to 20  or 30 percent Republican support
would  transform the political landscape. Likewise, an increase of black
Republicans in Congress from two to, say, six, effectively would end the
monolithic Democratic support the media and other observers expect of black
Americans. It also might end the recent tendency of the Democratic party
to take black voters for granted. <BR>
<BR>
	However, white Republicans, too, should pay close attention to what black
members of their party are telling them. The old government solutions to
social and economic problems have failed, but, as General Powell stated
at the GOP convention, there is still a demand for solutions of some kind.
Economic opportunity is crucial. Within the party, personal or political
slights are as unwelcome as ever. Unconscious white discrimination burns
the hearts of  conservative as well as liberal blacks.<BR>
<BR>
	It's just that black conservatives, stressing family, entrepreneurism and
community self-help, believe they have found a better way of moving forward.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Bob Dole's &quot;Vision&quot; May Soon Clear Up</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="starbar.gif" WIDTH="468" HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="BOTTOM"

<P>The campaign of 1996 will get out of the summer Doledrums when the prospective
GOP standard-bearer announces his economic program. If that program is ambitious
in scope, joining a growth package of and tax reductions and spending controls
with a long term rescue of Social Security through private sector investments,
Bob Dole's supposed lack of a &quot;vision&quot; suddenly will disappear
as a political concern. A program simple in concept and profound in social
and economic implications, it would unite in common interest otherwise contending
generations and economic groups.<BR>
<BR>
The young, the working poor and much of the middle class, for whom high
payroll taxes and today's low-growth prosperity make saving exceedingly
difficult, would see the bulk of their Social Security tax finally put to
work as a genuine instrument for investment. Simultaneously, the effect
upon the nation's overall savings rate would give the United States the
higher growth rates that encourage real national and personal financial
progress.<BR>
<BR>
The risk in the package, of course, is raising the Social Security issue
in a politically charged atmosphere. The Clinton White House will be tempted
irresistibly to rouse the elderly against any change. Never mind that in
almost any reform plan Dole might endorse, protection of the elderly will
be guaranteed. The politics of misinformation that worked so well with Medicare
reform--where millions of dollars of Democratic and labor union TV ads persuaded
voters that a proposed reduction in the rate of growth of this entitlement
constituted a &quot;cut&quot;--will be used again to stigmatize reform of
Social Security.<BR>
<BR>
But several developments are pushing a cautious Dole to take up the challenge,
anyhow.<BR>
First, he desperately needs some new ideas. As is, his campaign is running
like a Kansas creek in a July drought. But something more than old-time
Republican deficit reductions is indicated. An economic plan that offers
ordinary workers a way to gain a share in national wealth-creation will
have broad and deep appeal. Without a forward-looking national agenda, on
the other hand, Dole's only hope is that the Clinton presidency self-destructs
in scandal. But even if it did, a victorious Dole would go into office without
a mandate for any particular program. <BR>
<BR>
Second, former Colorado Gov. Richard Lamm's entry into the suddenly real
&quot;race&quot; for the Reform Party nomination puts the Social Security
issue on the table, in any case. He has met with key backers of the idea,
including Jose Pinera, the Chilean who successfully introduced it in his
country, and the proposal is now part of Lamm's avowed program. So the issue
will be debated nationally, regardless of what Dole or Clinton want or fear,
or, of course, how the more likely Reform Party nominee, Ross Perot, chooses
to characterize it. <BR>
<BR>
Lamm knows he is on to something. Young voters are especially excited about
the idea. When Steve Forbes proposed it in a debate at the University of
Arizona last spring he got a standing ovation from the largely youthful
audience and won that state's primary.<BR>
<BR>
The third development promoting a Dole decision to adopt broad reform as
an issue is the imminence of a report by the Clinton Administration's own
bi-partisan Social Security advisory commission. Having labored in obscurity
for two years, the panel is about to conclude that the best solution to
the Social Security system's problems is reform that takes advantage of
the power of the free market. (The worst solution, of course, is to raise
the already high payroll taxes and to cut benefits.)<BR>
<BR>
The 13 member commission is divided as to which of several specific approaches
is desirable. The main issues are whether all or only part of a worker's
12.4 percent Social Security tax should be invested in a savings and investment
account for him personally and how best to handle the transition from the
present system to an entirely new one.<BR>
<BR>
These are not minor questions. Without some of a taxpayers' payment going
to fund the transition costs of a new system, that transition becomes problematical.
On the other hand, unless a worker gets something close to full personal
advantage from the investment of his savings, the bright potential for him
and for the economy is reduced.<BR>
<BR>
These differences can be composed, but they need not be resolved in this
fall's campaign. Even if Dole (or Clinton, for that matter) were to embrace
a specific detailed plan, Congress would want to hold hearings and make
changes next spring. In fact, there are so many variations of the private
sector plan around now that endorsing one completely would assure criticism
from backers of other approaches. The same goes for a flat tax proposal
and a spending control plan.<BR>
<BR>
What matters is a general outline that combines the benefits of a flat or
flatter income tax with the conversion of Social Security from a fund whose
current (and temporary) surplus is used to subsidize the general budget
to one that helps individual workers invest. A flat tax without Social Security
reform could be seen as tilting toward the upper middle class and wealthy,
while Social Security reform by itself will not maximize economic growth.
The two together, along with spending controls, would help every worker
and family in the country. If Dole advocates such a package he will have
a central and unifying theme for his campaign. No more Bob Dull.<BR>
<BR>
As it happens, the last Kansan to be nominated for President, Dwight Eisenhower
in 1952, also was criticized in late summer for a campaign that was &quot;running
like a dry creek.&quot; But he managed to turn that campaign around with
a breakthrough international policy idea---&quot;I will go to Korea.&quot;
Economic reform to help average Americans could do the same for Bob Dole.

How do you Play Cards with China?</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman</I></CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="starbar.gif" WIDTH="592" HEIGHT="26" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=
"BOTTOM"><BR>
<BR>
	Washington Sen. Slade Gorton received headline attention recently  when
he announced that he would not oppose extension of &quot;Most Favored Nation&quot;
(MFN) trading status for China this year. He thereby helped avoid an embarrassing
vote in the Senate at a time when Boeing has major Chinese contracts pending
and Microsoft has just reached a new agreement  on intellectual property
rights.<BR>
 <BR>
	Less noticed, however, was the angry nature of the criticism Gorton heaped
on the Chinese and their apologists here in the United States.  Throwing
down a marker on trade complaints, the Republican senior senator declared
that unless significantly fairer treatment of American companies takes place
in the next year,  he will &quot;lead the fight&quot; against awarding China
MFN status next year.  Coming from a representative of the nation's most
trade dependent state, the pledge is considered reckless swagger by some
observers and political courage by others. Regardless, Gorton, when aroused
by a large principle, is a resourceful legislative foe.<BR>
<BR>
	Meanwhile, Gorton's Democratic colleague, Sen. Patty Murray, is heading
in what seems to be the opposite direction, arguing at a recent conference
of the Washington Council for International Trade that the US should make
MFN status permanent for all nations with whom we have relations (which
is all but the likes of Iraq, Cuba and North Korea). This, she believes
would avoid the annual pain and embarrassment of the MFN debate. Many China-hands
in business and academia agree.<BR>
<BR>
	It seems unlikely that under present circumstances either option will prevail,
however. On one hand, America is too entangled with the China trade and
too smitten with the future of an economy growing by 9% a year to lift anchor
and sail away. Before long, there will be a wholesale turnover in Chinese
leadership as the aged Long Marchers finally retire or die, so US traders
are reluctant to surrender their position now to the Japanese and Europeans.
Slade Gorton is articulate as well as indignant in his cataloguing of Chinese
trade perfidies, but the very businesses he might be expected to have on
his side--software, wheat and fruit growers, for example--are unwilling
to sign up against MFN.<BR>
<BR>
	On the other hand, Sen. Murray's dream of a permanent MFN will make a easy
target for political opponents of the present annual endorsement. This year
the human rights and consumer groups who normally get involved in the MFN
fight decided to stand aside, but they certainly would not do so if a permanent
grant was being considered. Until China-US trade and other relations are
substantially improved, MFN will be retained as a handy weapon.<BR>
<BR>
	Better relations are by no means impossible, of course. Whoever wins the
Presidency in November will want to organize a US/China summit, and maybe
Bill Clinton will attempt one before then, if some attractive agreement
can be sculpted. In recent weeks, the Chinese reversed the hostile rhetoric
of the late winter and promised yet again to crack down on factories that
pirate software and other intellectual property. There are pledges also
to stop trading missile technology with Pakistan and there even are soothing
words from Beijing about the future of Hong Kong, which China will absorb
in one year.<BR>
<BR>
	But there also are trouble signs ahead. American officials, including even
 such critics as Sen. Gorton, agree that trade issues should be separated
from human rights and military issues. But, as a practical matter, China's
human rights abuses in Tibet, the military pressures on Taiwan, government-directed
abortions, prison labor camps, secret shipments of guns into the US, and
threats to democracy in Hong Kong all play as discordant background music
that cannot be ignored and could disrupt the trade dance. <BR>
<BR>
	Hong Kong is an especially tense subject, since the Chinese takeover next
July will occur just after MFN arrives once again before Congress. If the
new Chinese authorities end up arresting Hong Kong's elected political leaders,
censoring the press and exposing the economy to the corruption that too
often characterizes the Chinese version of &quot;free markets,&quot; the
resulting turmoil will not be ignored by either public or official opinion
in the West. The chairman of the Hong Kong Democratic Party, Martin Lee,
in a whirlwind North American tour two months ago (60 speeches in 13 days)
was an effective proponent of MFN for China as well as a critic of Chinese
threats against Hong Kong. Lee in jail, however, would be a powerful symbol
against an attempt to adopt MFN, let alone make it permanent.<BR>
<BR>
	This confusion on the horizon of 1997 actually makes Sen. Gorton's Cassandra-like
warnings potentially very useful. Forgoing sentimentality, he demands that
Americans look with realism at the trade picture, not as it might be, but
as experience has shown it.<BR>
<BR>
	&quot;Five years ago our trade deficit with China,&quot; he reports, &quot;was
$12.7 billion. Now it is $33.8 billion....Will we never learn?...What has
the 'engagement' of the past five years accomplished to cause us to parrot
today the very arguments that have so signally failed in the past?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Will his fellow members of Congress and the Clinton Administration simply
ignore this warning? Perhaps. But if they do so, the present opposition
to China, which is found only in minorities of the two political parties,
some human rights groups and a fraction of the business community, will
grow. Under that pressure, our relations with China may muddle through,
as they have, but they will not flourish. Already the US is less evident
in investment in China than are our western trade rivals and Japan.<BR>
<BR>
	The constructive alternative is for Congress and the White House to use
the months ahead to examine and update the full range of trade and foreign
policy tools--other than denying MFN--that can be used to influence China.
Expanding current agreements on intellectual property offers one example.
Finding ways to get China to adhere to international trade standards as
a price for admission to the World Trade Organization (WTO) is another.
Yet another is helping the Chinese to see that their current rapid economic
growth cannot be sustained much longer without large private investment
from the west, and that such loans absolutely require a more predictable
legal system. <BR>
<BR>
	In time, it may indeed become possible to abandon the demeaning annual
MFN drill. Meanwhile, the challenge of China policy fairly cries out for
more consultation and creative diplomacy in the councils of the West. The
year ahead is crucial to that purpose.<BR>

The Issues Behind Filegate; It's Not Just a &quot;Bureaucratic Snafu&quot;</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman<BR>

</H3>
If illegal use of confidential FBI files is proven, Filegate will most resemble
that part of Watergate wherein White House zeal to dig up dirt on others
led to dirty practices--and genuine scandal.<BR>
<BR>
No one familiar with the White House pass system could believe that &quot;Project
Update&quot; was merely concerned with reviewing 407 FBI files of former
presidents' aides to see if they still merited passes. That transparently
false explanation is even more suggestive of a cover-up than the reluctance
of the White House to provide Congress with evidence of the affair. <BR>
<BR>
Who among former employees ordinarily would be entitled to a White House
pass? The answer is simple: no one. As a Deputy Assistant to President Reagan
in the mid-'80's I knew very well that the day after I left the payroll
I would merit clearance only on a visit-by-visit basis, and only then with
a current pass holding staffer to vouch for me. It did not matter if I still
knew the Secret Service guards or they remembered me. It didn't matter if
I was still in the same Administration, serving in a departmental position.
I had no right to a White House pass. If there were a few exceptions to
this rule, they were close family members and personal advisers of the incumbent
president.<BR>
<BR>
So how could Craig Livingstone, director of security for President Clinton,
pretend that he wanted to check the FBI files of employees of former Administrations
to see which ones should be given passes? Again the answer is simple, he
couldn't. His explanation is bogus. (Can't you just see old Reagan and Bush
aides given free rein to roam the West Wing, parking their wingtips in the
Roosevelt Room and schmoozing George Stephanopolous in the Mess?) Coming
from a security chief who at the time had given passes to many of his own
White House colleagues without ever putting them through an FBI clearance--a
record of delay and laxity unmatched by any previous Administration--the
whole story is offensive as well as ridiculous.<BR>
<BR>
It is far more plausible that the former employees whose private files were
ordered from the FBI were improper targets of White House opposition research.
Out of curiosity, I sent for a copy of the list to see if I was on it. I
wasn't. But there was the name of my deputy in the White House, Tony Blankley.
Why would the file of the deputy director of the Office of Planning and
Evaluation be sought and not his superior's? Could it possibly be because
Mr. Blankley had become Press Secretary to Newt Gingrich, an Administration
critic? Other people on the list are now leaders of Congressional staffs
with direct oversight on White House activities. <BR>
<BR>
Many of the names on the list, it is true, are hard to assign any obvious
purpose. Former Chief of Staff (and later Secretary of State) Jim Baker
is often cited as such a case. Yet, think: in 1993, when the list was first
collected, Baker's name was a lot more interesting, for at that time he
was talking about running for President in 1996.<BR>
<BR>
So the White House assertion that the file acquisitions was just a &quot;bureaucratic
snafu&quot; does not meet the laugh test. <BR>
<BR>
The next line of defense for Administration apologists is, &quot;So what?&quot;
After all, why should former officials worry about their past being known
unless they have something to hide?<BR>
<BR>
In truth, they have a lot to worry about, starting with the danger of anonymous
and false accusations being promoted by people in official positions. In
most arenas of life, malicious rumors can be confronted in the public forum.
We see it all the time in lawsuits and political campaigns. But compilation
of an FBI file does not take place in the open. <BR>
<BR>
An FBI background security check routinely is ordered for people under consideration
for service in the White House or for appointment to a department post that
requires confirmation by the Senate. Some lesser positions also require
FBI checks. By law, the information collected in the resulting FBI file
is confidential and meant only for review by the President, his personnel
staff and, in the case of a Senate confirmation, a few relevant senators
and their top committee aides.<BR>
<BR>
However, it is a popular misconception that FBI files necessarily are objective
and represent the FBI's own considered judgment. FBI agents seek out opinions
as well as facts, and often more from one's critics than from one's friends.
If someone accuses you of something, you don't have the right to know his
name, or, as a practical matter, the nature of the accusation. The agents
roll the whole pile--fact and possible fiction--into something that is meant
to be evaluated by the authorities making (or confirming) the appointment.
These authorities almost always behave with responsibility and common sense.<BR>
<BR>
Even so, misuse of FBI files occurs. From 1959, when President Eisenhower's
nominee for Secretary of Commerce, Admiral Lewis Strauss, was defeated on
trumped up charges, through every administration since, we have seen instances
where something that sounds like a conclusive evaluation, but isn't--&quot;an
FBI file&quot;--is leaked, and a nominee or office-holder is smeared.<BR>
<BR>
Imagine that you were under consideration for a presidential appointment
and you knew that your views might incite foes to say false or distorted
things about you to the FBI, and that you ran at least a small risk that
your file might be misued by persons unknown to prevent your appointment.
It would be a disincentive to serve, wouldn't it?<BR>
<BR>
Grim as that prospect looms, now imagine you also learned that years later,
staffers in some future White House could get a hold of your unprocessed
FBI file and make whatever public or private use of it they wanted--without
your approval or knowledge and without connection to any legitimate official
purpose. That suggests why so-called &quot;Project Update&quot; was such
a stark perversion of security procedures. <BR>
<BR>
There are, indeed, &quot;bureaucratic snafus&quot; that mitigate government
&quot;mistakes.&quot; This doesn't seem to be one of them. It looks more
like an assault on privacy and due process, and more broadly, on the trust
that supports representative democracy. It fully warrants the investigation
it is getting.<BR>

<BR>
Congress Should Seek Out Sources of Worsening Military Morale</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER>by Bruce Chapman</CENTER>
</H3>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="starbar.gif" WIDTH="592" HEIGHT="26" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></CENTER>
<P>	Turf  battles and budget cuts always stir anxieties in the military,
 but recent signs of damaged morale in the officer corps  suggest worrisome
trouble from more unusual sources. At some point the fighting ability of
the military--its reason for existence--may be impaired. Before that happens,
Congress should investigate the causes of the recent spate of  firings,
resignations, lawsuits, charges of &quot;McCarthyism&quot; and top officer
suicides that are afflicting the armed services.<BR>
<BR>
	A Congressional investigation almost surely would cast a light on the results
of President Clinton's political correctness policies and micro management,
 but it also would call into question the attitudes of some members of Congress.<BR>
<BR>
	For several years now the military has been treated as some kind of social
laboratory. A Tailhook Convention of Navy aviators five years ago included
a notorious party that provided the pretext for the puritanical reaction
that followed. Somehow, few of the guilty parties at  that event were found
and punished, but people who merely attended the same convention and were
involved in no misconduct have been permanently tarnished. So were superiors
and people tagged by remarks or actions in other situations that would have
had little or no consequences in a less hysterical atmosphere.  In all,
14 admirals have been relieved or retired. Literally dozens of other officers'
promotions have been held up by the Senate. This week, Secretary of Defense
William Perry himself finally called for an end to the Tailhook witch hunt.
<BR>
<BR>
	Meanwhile, however, the Navy, and the services generally, are pinned down
by an arch-feminist fusillade of charges and policy demands. For example,
we now have reached a point, literally, where even unattributed and unsubstantiated
accusations of political incorrectness can wreck officers' careers, and
where failure of superiors to punish those so accused can bring them down,
too. This truly is McCarthyism.<BR>
<BR>
	According to the Center for Military Readiness, a Defense Department Instruction
(DoDI 1320.4) was issued last year that allows &quot;alleged adverse information&quot;
and &quot;unsubstantiated allegations&quot; to be placed in the files of
officers after they have been selected for promotion and before their confirmation.
Without the officers being informed, the possibly false charges can be circulated
to Pentagon brass, the White House and Congress.<BR>
<BR>
	If something similar happens to short-term political appointees, they,
at least, can use publicity and political connections to fight back. Military
officers, sworn to serve civilian leadership, are nearly immobilized. They
may  be subjected to unwarranted and devastating shame.<BR>
<BR>
	The recent suicide of the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Jeremy Boorda,
is almost by itself worthy of a Congressional investigation. Far more apparently
was involved than an approaching Newsweek article examining his right to
wear two &quot;V&quot; (for valor) devices on his  Vietnam campaign ribbons.
Boorda had been under pressure on one hand to push the Clinton political
correctness policies, while on the other he was incurring increasing  criticism
for failing to defend the honor of his officers and the effectiveness of
the service.<BR>
<BR>
	Among the critics was combat hero, author and former Navy Secretary Jim
Webb, who, in a speech at Annapolis revealed the &quot;disturbing statistic&quot;
that in the past year &quot;53 percent of the post-command Commanders in
naval aviation left the Navy rather than continue their careers...These
were the cream, the very future of the Navy, officers who had performed
for two decades in a manner that marked them as potential Admirals.&quot;
Rather than continue on a nominally  successful track, they are quitting,
Webb noted. <BR>
<BR>
	It's not just the Navy. A Coast Guard Captain, Ernie Blanchard, made a
speech at the Coast Guard Academy that included some weak humor that offended
some female cadets. Example: he said that his friend, the Commandant, was
so unsexy that on his wedding night, when he told his wife they could do
anything she wanted, she said she'd like to go to sleep. Was it funny? No.
Was it offensive? Well, it seemingly was so offensive that Capt. Blanchard
was forced to make a public apology. But that didn't end it. Feminists demanded
a court-martial, and the top brass went along. Blanchard, a life-time veteran
with a wife and two teen-aged daughters, was led to believe that he might
well be found guilty, and lose not only his job, but also his pension. Ruined--by
a joke--he, too, committed suicide. <BR>
<BR>
	In the Army, a recent  critical internal report on morale has not been
released to the media, but it has been described in the journal Military
Review as an assessment of &quot;anecdotal accounts&quot; indicating a growing
culture of mistrust and stifled initiative.<BR>
<BR>
	The Army report echoes a former Air Force pilot who  quit because of the
backbiting and division. &quot;It's a one-mistake military now,&quot; he
says, &quot;and the mistake doesn't even have to amount to anything much
or even be true.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	It cannot help morale, in this context, that the very President who has
visited many of the new rules upon the military is the same one who has
used his  status as Commander-in-Chief as a claim against prosecution in
a lawsuit for, of all things,  sexual harassment in the Paula Jones case.<BR>
<BR>
	Some service tension, as noted, would be expected anyway in an era of military
downsizing. The armed forces are now 1.4 million, compared to 13 million
at the height of World War II; yet we have just as many generals and admirals
as then. We are top-heavy. But demoralizing your officer class so that many
of your best people quit and many of the others live in quiet fear is  a
strange way to address the leadership issue. <BR>
<BR>
	Are these problems as serious as the news stories and &quot;anecdotal evidence&quot;
suggest? Why doesn't the Congress find out?<BR>

    <TITLE>A Clear US Foreign Policy</TITLE>

<H1><CENTER><BR>
Converging Trends Demand a Clear US Foreign Policy</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><B><I>by Bruce Chapman<BR>
<BR>
</I></B><HR></CENTER>
<P>Incrreasingly, it appears that the United States of America lacks a coherent
foreign policy.<BR>
<BR>
Yes, there are exceptions. We do have a clear (and bi-partisan) policy on
foreign trade, consisting primarily of promotion of free trade agreements
and pursuit of violators of those agreements. But what is American policy
on preventing nuclear non-proliferation? A recently published Defense Department
report on the topic is long on analysis, but blurred on policy ideas.<BR>
<BR>
What about international narcotics trafficking? The U.S. has been de-emphasizing
eradication and interdiction of drug supplies, without expressing any rationale
for this change beyond a desire to concentrate on domestic use, as if the
two concerns were mutually exclusive.<BR>
<BR>
What, in the current U.S. view, is the proper role of the United Nations?
Our policy is completely reactive, with the U.S. failing either to lead
reform or to pay our $1.5 billion bill. We cannot even come up with a candidate
for Secretary General.<BR>
<BR>
Then there is the massive issue of economic development in the less advanced
countries of Africa, Latin America and Asia, a key to peace and stability
in the 21st century. Are we for more government to government aid, or something
else, and if something else, what? <BR>
<BR>
Seven years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, one still must ask, what
kind of life do we see for the former communist states--and what role do
we see ourselves playing in helping them to achieve it? <BR>
<BR>
Not for six decades--since 1936--has a presidential election year played
out with so little attention to international affairs. Regrettably, the
national Administration takes its leadership cues from polls and focus groups,
which, like the weather before a hurricane, give no sign of disturbance.
For the Clinton White House the significance of foreign policy pertains
mainly to domestic voter groups. If there is an American strategy anymore
it is a well-kept secret.<BR>
<BR>
In 1936, history shows, the United States courted disaster by ignoring war
threats in Europe and Asia. In 1996 we tempt fate again by not supporting
development of an anti-missile weapons system and by turning our military
into a social agency instead of a fighting force. On the day that an adversary
shows a capacity to infiltrate our defensive perimeter or to intimidate
one of our overseas bases--in Korea, for example--or simply starts a regional
nuclear war, it no longer will count for much here at home that the U.S.
military has been vigorous in implementing sensitivity training.<BR>
<BR>
But even if we could assume a benign world for American interests and the
cause of peace--and who will own up to such naivet&eacute;?--we still could
not avoid the reality that global opportunities, if not necessities, are
being slighted.<BR>
<BR>
Luck and past foreign policy successes have combined to bring the world
to a point of converging trends that Richard Judy, of the Hudson Institute,
identifies and which offer great potential benefits to this generation of
Americans. The most obvious is the globalization of the world's markets
for goods and services, a trend in which the U.S. is both an actor and acted
upon. To put this trend in perspective, exported goods and services in 1960
amounted to only 4.9 percent of our Gross Domestic Product. But last year
they came to 11 percent of GDP; and by 2010, they are expected to reach
35 percent. This trend alone is transforming our relative stake in international
relations.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps even more important is the globalization of capital markets, a trend
seemingly still unappreciated by many governments. &quot;Investors worldwide
are increasingly determined and able to seek the highest risk-adjusted returns
on their investments,&quot; Judy observes, and this freedom is coupled with
a staggering growth of private investments--through pension funds and other
sources--into economies world wide. Public investments in developing countries
now represent only a third of the total, having been surpassed in recent
years by private investments. Among the likely results are a closing range
of interest rates worldwide, international funding of more innovations in
products and services and a growing inability of national governments to
thwart the discipline of the free market.<BR>
<BR>
Coincident with these primarily economic trends are four others, according
to Judy:<BR>
<BR>
&#183; &quot;Globalization of institutions,&quot; including law, representative
democracy as a normative goal and acceptance in principle that &quot;private
property (will prevail) as the basic form of asset ownership.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&#183; &quot;Globalization of technologies,&quot; whether in transportation,
materials science, medicine, or such softer fields as marketing and management.
<BR>
<BR>
&#183; &quot;Globalization of information,&quot; which proceeds in part
from the technological trend. <BR>
<BR>
&#183; &quot;Globalization of culture.&quot; To a staggering degree, the
other trends of convergence support a long term change in value systems,
permitting gratified expectations of common commercial practices, language
(English), and even food availability and environmental standards. This
is also the trend with the most dangerous and explosive potential downside,
for most of the world--including even the USA--does not want to be homogenized
into some one-world culture-glob. In revolt against this trend come myriad
forms of paranoia and rebellion.<BR>
<BR>
These global trends, therefore, may be inevitable, but our success in shaping
them is not. It is folly for American officials to let public ignorance
of these developments determine government policy toward them. Whether from
peril or opportunity, foreign affairs is unavoidably domestic policy these
days and must be recognized as a higher priority in the national debate.
Where, we should be asking, do our political candidates stand?<BR>

<P><BR>
	This summer the Congress is expected, finally, to take up the subject of
campaign finance reform. If you believe the interpretation put upon this
issue by most of the media and the permanent, self-designated &quot;reform&quot;
lobby, the only reason to oppose the proposals being made is the self-interest
of politicians and their major backers. But this simplistic view increasingly
is contradicted by the actual results of the reform measures we already
have adopted in the past 25 years.  In few other areas does the &quot;law
of unintended consequences&quot; operate so fiercely. <BR>
<BR>
	Most, though not all, campaign reform proposals in Washington, D.C., would
result in just the opposite of what reformers claim. They would reduce accountability
of politicians, increase the power of rich candidates and special interests,
decrease electoral competition and stifle the very free political speech
that the American Founders cared about most when they enshrined it  in the
First Amendment.<BR>
<BR>
	Arguably, we need more money in politics, not less, and more people giving,
not fewer, and that to protect free political speech, we need less government
regulation, not more.<BR>
<BR>
	Look at the Alice in Wonderland situation that has developed recently in
this year's presidential race. For the past couple of months, Bob Dole,
his poll numbers sagging, must have wondered why he ever agreed to accept
public matching money for his  presidential campaign. Under the law, a &quot;reform&quot;
measure of its time, Dole received federal matching grants from revenue
raised by the check-off account to which about 20 percent of the taxpayers
contribute on their income tax forms; but in return, he had to agree to
limit his campaign spending during the primary season. Now,  effectively
having secured the Republican nomination, he is only about $150,000 away
from his legal limit and the GOP convention is still months away. He cannot
legally raise and spend campaign dollars until after the Republican convention.<BR>
<BR>
	Meanwhile, Bill Clinton, who had no primary opposition, was able to husband
most of his millions in federal matching money and can campaign to his heart's
delight. In fact, as an incumbent president he already enjoys enormous advantages,
garnering campaign-like publicity while simply performing as president.
At the same time, his allies in the AFL-CIO, who are able to operate outside
the campaign laws, are spending $35 million to defeat Dole and the Republicans.
The Democratic Party has been similarly focused all spring, placing TV ads
in crucial election states. The cumulative effect on Dole's numbers could
not have been good.<BR>
<BR>
	Dole is left now with the option of using the resources of the Republican
party, but even there he has to be careful. The Republican National Committee
plans to spend $20 million to boost its cause before the party convention,
but the White House and the Democratic party's lawyers are watching to see
if, for example, Dole or other Republicans at party-sponsored events target
Bill Clinton by name in a way that will allow a campaign ethics charge to
be lodged with the Federal Elections Commission. Both parties at this point
can talk about &quot;issues,&quot; the law appears to say, but cannot explicitly
support their candidate's election. On either this ground or the likelihood
of &quot;overspending,&quot; Dole could find himself in another of our country's
synthetic &quot;scandals,&quot; and a defendant before the Federal Elections
Commission.<BR>
<BR>
	Thus we see in this one situation, the potential for absurdity in modern
campaign &quot;reform&quot; legislation. One of the major party candidates
is nearly incapacitated and tempted to technical error by the rigidity of
federal law--in a dilemma not anticipated years ago by reformers. The parties
themselves can campaign, but only if they pretend otherwise. The special
interests, however, including besides the AFL-CIO,  a host of powers, such
as the National Rifle Association, the National Chamber of Commerce, the
trial lawyers and the pro-and anti-abortion groups, can spend unlimited
funds free of public scrutiny--so long as they don't use explicit words
urging a vote for their preferred candidates. And billionaire Ross Perot
(who claims to be a reformer, of all things) can spend as much as he likes,
and say whatever he likes, so long as he spends his own money.  Ralph Nader,
another potential third party presidential candidate who  claims &quot;reform&quot;
credentials, indicates that he may not release his income tax return, since
where he gets his money  is nobody's business.<BR>
<BR>
	&quot;Reform,&quot; you see, is for other people. For oneself it increasingly
is mostly a dandy way to get the tactical upper hand over one's ideological
foes. Specifically, it is a means to handicap accountable political parties
to the benefit of unaccountable special interests, to handicap challengers
to the benefit of incumbents, and to enable personally rich candidates to
place their competition at a disadvantage. At least, that is the way it
is working out.<BR>
<BR>
	Twenty five years ago, when the post-Watergate Federal Elections Campaign
Act was adopted, the Supreme Court  (in Buckley v. Valeo) allowed the law's
limits on contributions (a $1000 amount in federal elections that has never
been adjusted for inflation), but cited First Amendment free speech objections
to permit limits on spending for wealthy candidates, special interest groups
or candidates who decline to accept federal matching money in presidential
races. <BR>
<BR>
	On their own terms, therefore, the reformers wound up with  a lopsided
system that is shot through with unfair exceptions and contradictions. And
the results show it. Though reformers sought lower cost campaigns, campaign
spending levels, in constant dollars, have gone up threefold. The incumbency
advantage actually increased after the post-Watergate reforms were enacted;
even in 1994, 91.4 percent of incumbents who sought re-election were successful.
Where reformers wanted to reduce the influence of special interests, they
failed spectacularly. The best example is the creation of political action
committees (PACs) that collect voluntary contributions in a given industry
or civic organization. This was originally a  reform meant to replace straightforward
corporate support of candidates. Now the PACs themselves are under attack.
<BR>
<BR>
	Even if the Supreme Court had accepted the full dose of reform medicine
first advanced in law--controlling expenditures as well as contributions--we
probably would have been disappointed by the consequences. As Larry J. Sabato,
a campaign finance expert at the University of Virginia, has written, &quot;One
cannot dam the flow of political money in a society as free as ours. If
it's blocked in one area, it will simply find other channels...These alternative
means of influence are often obscured and unaccountable, eliminating visible
disclosure.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Of course, Sabato's reality check runs directly contrary to what reformers
and much of the public believe to be the case. They always imagine that
good clean election campaigns are right around the corner, if only we pass
a few more regulations. What we forget is the &quot;law of unintended consequences.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Take the &quot;Bi-partisan Clean Congress Act&quot; introduced in the U.S.
House by Republican Rep. Linda Smith of southwest Washington,  and several
other legislators--Rep. Marty Meehan (D-Mass.) and Rep. Chris Shays, (R-Conn.)--with
strong support from the permanent reform lobby, including Common Cause,
the League of Women Voters, Ross Perot and most of the liberal media (the
latter have lionized Rep. Smith, though they oppose nearly every other political
view she holds). This bill would ban PACs, curb out-of-state contributions
to Congressional candidates, and further limit spending by the political
parties. A companion measure in the Senate, sponsored by Senators Fred Thompson
(R-Tenn.), John McCain (R-AZ) and Russ Feingold (D-Minn.), would seek to
convince candidates to limit spending voluntarily by offering them free
or reduced TV advertising time and government-financed mailings, and penalizing
those who do not go along by giving their opponents even more government
campaign support. The Senate bill also would expand further the regulatory
powers of the Federal Elections Commission.<BR>
<BR>
	You can't blame them for trying. But how would it work out? Linda Smith
ran last time against an incumbent, Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, who received a
lot of out-of-state money and outspent Mrs. Smith, then the challenger,
two to one. But Linda Smith, a leading power among segments of the religious
right, had a well-organized power base that raised enough money to enable
her to get her message out. It would make political sense for her now, as
an incumbent, to entrench this advantage by limiting out-of-state contributions
and providing overall spending caps.<BR>
<BR>
	But consider the case of Rep. George Nethercutt of Spokane. As a challenger
in 1994 and facing mighty Speaker of the House Tom Foley, he found initial
fundraising very difficult. Even local Republicans were afraid of offending
a powerful incumbent Democrat. Nethercutt was a challenger who required
out-of-state support to get enough traction to make his race credible. <BR>
<BR>
	Thus, whether out-of-state contributions hurt or help incumbents depends
a great deal on the circumstances of a particular race. And the same goes
for efforts to keep a lid on personal spending. A challenger's only hope
against a well-known incumbent, especially if that officeholder enjoys media
 support, is to raise a large enough war chest to get his message out on
his own.  Says Bradley A. Smith, who teaches election law at Capital University
in Ohio, &quot;What is important is not who outspends whom, but that the
challenger spends enough to stimulate voter interest in the race...Efforts
to cap spending help entrench incumbents and so foster public frustration
with the system.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
	The same also is true of contribution limits.  Little-known challengers
need to  raise large sums early if they  hope to win, and they usually cannot
raise such sums without getting large contributions from a few family members
and close friends. Contribution limits like those in the Smith and McCain
bills mainly help incumbents, people (like Smith) with an already organized
donor base, and the personally wealthy, who can contribute all they want.
One person's &quot;reform&quot; is thus another's restraint on fair competition
and voter choice.<BR>
<BR>
	A major flaw with the thinking of most reformers is the idea that there
is too much money in political campaigns now.  As Bradley Smith points out,
the total spent on all Congressional races in 1994, including primaries,
was $600 million, less than half the annual advertising budget of General
Motors, or about $3 per eligible voter--the amount of a video rental. It
is also false to think that the amount of money spent on campaigns is responsible
for  &quot;negative&quot; campaigning and attack ads on TV. There is no
evidence for this, nor for the conventional impression that expensive campaigns
always prevail. If the complaint is based on false assumptions, therefore,
it is not surprising that that it has bad consequences.<BR>
<BR>
	If we can all agree that we want ample political competition to assure
the voters choices, adequate airing of issues to provide voter's information
for making those choices and prevention of hidden influences, then a better
kind of reform might be possible.<BR>
<BR>
	First, raise the limit on personal contributions. In truth, there probably
should be no limit, so long as the money is disclosed. Personal donations
are far more disinterested than those of PACs, let alone the soft money
spending of special interests, that goes unreported.  Contribution limits
for individual donors have tilted the playing field to millionaires and
billionaires, who by court ruling, are burdened with no such restrictions.
As a compromise, at least raise the present contribution limit enough to
take account of 25 years of inflation; i.e., to $5,000.<BR>
<BR>
	Second, don't weaken the political parties, strengthen them. It is ridiculous
to try to limit or curtail their spending . They are the proper and historical
home of politics and the institutions of democracy that are most regulated
by political disclosure laws--in contrast to the court-protected  unions,
industry associations and special interest advocacy groups. Fortunately,
a Colorado case is about to be decided which could determine that money
parties spend on their candidates constitute an &quot;expenditure&quot;
under the law, not a &quot;contribution,&quot; and therefore, they, too,
are covered by the First Amendment's free speech clause. <BR>
<BR>
	Indeed, in Washington State, as a result of Initiative 134, we already
have reached a similar conclusion.<BR>
<BR>
	Third, if we are going to have strict disclosure laws, they should be applied
to special interest groups--including the reformer's own organizations--that
lobby the public on political issues.<BR>
<BR>
	Fourth, instead of trying to shrink spending on politics, which is wrongheaded,
and futile in any case, stimulate the ordinary citizen to participate more.
Nothing would go farther to liberate citizen politicians than expanded support
in the form of citizen campaign contributions. We can do this by offering
a tax deduction for all contributions up to the legal limit and a tax credit
for all those below a set figure; say, $50. Parties should be included,
as well as candidates.<BR>
<BR>
	Fifth, if the above is accomplished, it then would not hurt to limit PACs
further, and it will not be necessary to turn eventually to direct public
finance of political reform.<BR>
<BR>
	This kind of program suggestion is not unique. Variations of it recently
have been embraced by groups and individuals as diverse as the libertarian
CATO Institute and the liberal Center for the Study of the American Electorate,
Speaker Newt Gingrich and liberal columnist David Broder, the conservative
Wall Street Journal and the liberal Roll Call. They all have seen that what
we need now is not another round of reform, but, if you will, a reform of
the reforms already in place.<BR>
<BR>
	 Political freedom, after all,  is really an analog to economic freedom,
as well as its natural companion. Just as over-regulation can stifle the
economy and lead to government control, so too can over-regulation of politics.
Our object, therefore, should be to increase competition and free speech
in the political process.<BR>

A Cheaper, Surer Way to Fund and Build Public Projects</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER>by Bruce Chapman</CENTER>
</H3>
<IMG SRC="barrwb.gif" WIDTH="468" HEIGHT="7" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=
"BOTTOM"><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>How are we going to pay for it all?</B> Isn't there any way to lower
the costs? These are the plaintive cries of taxpayers around the country
as their local and state elected officials try to cajole them into supporting
a growing list of infrastructure projects.<BR>
<BR>
But even as the list grows, taxpayer tolerance for big ticket public works
is declining. In Seattle, for example, where voters this week passed (turned
down) a $50 million bond measure to help build the &quot;Commons&quot;park
near the downtown, wary but resolute city officials are expected to ask
soon for a new central library, expansion of the waterfront aquarium, improvements
to parks and roads, new courts and police stations. With previously approved
bond issues and City Council votes, Seattle expects to lay out $660 million
for capital projects in the next six years, a figure that doesn't include
projects by school districts, the separately financed, and largely self-supporting
water and light departments, or the port authority. The Port of Seattle
alone, for example, has $1.6 billion of projects scheduled for the next
six years.<BR>
<BR>
King County and its neighboring counties in Puget Sound, and the State of
Washington, meanwhile, have even bigger capital plans--some slated for action,
some just a fond wish-- including a convention center expansion, two sports
stadia, a several billion dollar rapid transit system (headed for a vote
in the fall), an environmental greenway between Seattle and the Cascade
mountains to the East, and literally untold billions in freeway and bridge
construction. Statewide, transportation infrastructure needs alone have
been estimated at $20.8 billion in the next quarter century.<BR>
<BR>
It would be an exaggeration to say that voters are either fed up or exhausted
by the large construction agenda ahead, perhaps because they are only dimly
aware of how big it is. But, if voters have not shown themselves angry,
they clearly are impatient and highly selective. Part of their reluctance
is probably based on a sense that taxes at all levels are too high. Another
part is surely due to a concern that they can see no strategy or priority
evident in all this capital planning, and too little coordination among
governmental units.<BR>
<BR>
But there also could well be some frustration that the costs of these projects
are simply too high--that taxpayers are not getting their money's worth.
Past legislation meant to prevent corruption and to assure environmental
protection has contributed to delays and higher overhead costs. However,
also contributing has been the very nature of government, where typically
the group that spends the money is different from that which plans how to
spend it and is always different from those whose money is spent.<BR>
<BR>
The usual pattern (to oversimplify for the sake of brevity) is that government
decides to build, say, a prison, then hires a design team to plan it, and
then lets it out for competitive construction bids. Once the low bidder
is selected, the construction project gets underway. Soon enough, it seems,
cost over-runs are noted. More money must be found. Even some projects that
come in nominally under budget were unnecessarily expensive in the first
place. The design team, having no responsibility for balancing all elements,
including likely operating and maintenance costs, may &quot;gold plate,&quot;
or over-engineer, the design and make high price tags inevitable.<BR>
<BR>
At least, that is the charge laid against the present system by advocates
of various alternative approaches. Some are promoting privatization of construction,
wherein, say, a jail or prison will be built and managed by a private company.
Nationally, there were 88 of these secure adult facilities under construction
by the end of 1994, according the National Center for Policy Analysis. A
1991 study in Texas that found that costs for four prisons were reduced
14.4 percent by private building and management. An Australian report in
1994 found a 20 percent saving in a similar situation.<BR>
<BR>
The term &quot;design/build&quot; is used for some such projects, and &quot;design/build/operate&quot;
for ones that take the private theme still further. In the latter category
is a new project by the City of Seattle to develop a water filtration plant
along the Tolt River. But the money is still the public's and so is the
ownership. <BR>
<BR>
This brings us to a visionary approach to public projects that has been
pioneered in England, the so-called Private Initiative Project (PFI). The
PFI has changed the very concept of government's role from providing services
as an owner to procuring them as a customer. An entire project--say, a prison,
to go back to the example used before--is designed, financed, built, operated
and owned by a private concern which then, per agreement, sells its services--correctional
services, per inmate, in this case--to the government. The private concern
technically owns the project and sells services to the government, which
is spared any cash expenditure up front and pays fixed operating expenses
over a long period, such as 30 years. The government's short term role is
to decide what correctional services it wants in the first place--technically,
the values and performance standards it expects of a well-run prison, and
the risks it wants to insure against--and then to ask for worldwide bids
to design the project on that basis.<BR>
<BR>
It is in the design process that the English have found that the most money
can be saved; not because that process represents much expense itself, but
because the quality of the design determines the ultimate costs of the project
as a whole. With the full range of private sector expertise available to
companies -- and consortia of companies -- involved in bidding the project,
various cost controls, revenue streams and financing are offered to a public
authority. Then the winning team bids out the construction, also worldwide.<BR>
<BR>
The result in Britain over the past few years has been a steep increase
in Public Finance Initiative (PFI) projects, which now amount to $28 billion,
for roads, transit, prisons, hospitals, schools, libraries, government offices,
and much else. Thanks to the wide expertise available to private consortia,
their ability to integrate their work, and the freedom they enjoy as owners
to create innovative solutions, they are able to bring in projects at an
expense 20 to 30 percent lower than those of comparable public projects.<BR>
<BR>
In the past couple of months, Douglas Hogg, who heads the PFI, and Jonathan
Hugget, an associate from Vancouver, B.C. where this idea presently is being
aired, have visited Seattle to meet with a few local business and governmental
leaders who have expressed interest in the concept. The hope on all sides
is that we might be able to learn from their experiences. Britain, Canada
and the US all have differences in the way public development is governed
today. In particular, we enjoy the benefits of tax exempt bonds for public
works, which gives our public approach an advantage over almost any private
one. Nonetheless, the advantage may not be conclusive and, in any event,
the PFI concept may be adaptable to our particular circumstances.<BR>
<BR>
When a half dozen Seattle bond attorneys and public finance analysts vetted
the Public Finance Initiative idea last week, they concluded that potential
benefits definitely warrant further investigation. <BR>
<BR>
They noted that the English also might have something to teach us about
handling the politics of this form of privatization. In the UK, the Conservative
Party initiated the Public Finance Initiative and are especially pleased
that it saves money, while the Labor Party backs it because its savings
in overhead costs result in more money available for construction jobs.
The tough job initially was persuading the bureaucracy. The Brits were courageous
enough to take on that daunting challenge. Are we?<BR>

<H1><CENTER>A New Social Contract for America</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER>by Bruce Chapman</CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
	We probably all know that costs  of entitlements are the main source of
federal budget deficits, and the problem is destined to get dangerously
worse as the Baby Boom generation ages. We all know, too, that ordinary
families--especially the young--are having a hard time saving independently
for their old age. And, we all know that elderly voters, as a group, are
easily convinced that any perceived reductions in these programs are unfair.
Less widely recognized is that younger voters are waking up to this issue;
witness recent university student council resolutions protesting the grim
future of Social Security.<BR>
<BR>
	The solutions we hear from government usually involve little more than
reduced benefits and raised taxes. But the futility of this approach, especially
for Social Security,  is evident from just one statistic. In 1945 there
were 20 American workers to support each Social Security recipient. Today
the figure is 3.1 workers per recipient. By 2030, as today's children reach
middle age, there will be fewer than two workers for each beneficiary. <BR>
<BR>
	Sharp benefit cutbacks of roughly 40 percent and payroll tax hikes from
15.3 percent to 15.7 percent will be needed in a few years to maintain the
solvency of Social Security, but they will devastate workers and retirees
alike. The entitlement programs themselves are thus becoming a source of
poverty and social insecurity  in this country.<BR>
<BR>
	Fortunately,  there is an exciting, win/win strategy for solving the Social
Security problem, at least, and it is beginning to attract broad, bi-partisan
support. The most responsible thing the two presidential candidates can
do about it this political campaign year is to agree to consider it seriously
next January, when there will be less temptation to demagogue.<BR>
<BR>
	But the public needs to start discussing the idea right away, because this
solution--using the private sector to rescue Social Security--no longer
will  be possible in a few years, once the Baby Boomers themselves have
retired. Action is needed in the next couple of years.<BR>
<BR>
	There are now several plans out to use capitalism and the &quot;miracle
of compound interest&quot; to provide a brighter future for American workers.
The libertarian Cato Institute has one, and so does Martin Feldstein, Harvard
professor and former chairman of President Reagan's Council of Economic
Advisers. Republicans, naturally, tend to like the idea.  Steve Forbes elicited
cheers when he embraced the idea at the University of Arizona debate during
the presidential primary season. A similar program, many point out, already
works spectacularly in Chile.<BR>
<BR>
	But one of the first and most carefully researched American plans is that
of a former Democratic candidate for Senate from Delaware, Sam Beard, founder
of the National Development Council that has helped create inner-city jobs
under four presidents of both parties, organizer of the Jefferson Awards
for community service, a fellow of the Discovery Institute in Seattle--and,
most importantly, author of a new book, &quot;Restoring Hope in America:
The Social Security Solution&quot; (ICS Press, San Francisco).  Beard's
first post-publication address will be  in Seattle next Tuesday, May 14,
at 7 p.m. in the University of Washington's Kane Hall Room 220, co-sponsored
by Discovery Institute, The Seattle P.I. and the UW Graduate School of Public
Affairs.<BR>
<BR>
	I was introduced to Sam Beard about a year and a half ago by the P.I's
publisher, J.D. Alexander, and immediately saw in him the classic example
of the enterprising generalist seized with a life-changing big idea.<BR>
<BR>
	Under Beard's plan, present Social Security recipients would receive exactly
what they have been promised, and those approaching retirement also would
stay part of the plan we have now--guaranteed. But young people just starting
out in the workforce would be given the opportunity to put their Social
Security taxes to work in investment funds in the private market, much as
regular mutual funds and annuity programs operate. The government's role
would be to allocate each taxpayer's money to the fund he or she selected
and to make certain that the funds are organized in a sound manner. Workers
in the middle-age brackets (such as Baby Boomers) could mix their forms
of participation, partially paying into the present system and partially
investing in the new Social Security investment funds. <BR>
<BR>
	The plan works because the private sector is so much more productive than
the public sector, which, in any case, does not invest its Social Security
funds, but spends them as they come in on other government priorities. (What
we have today is a great chain letter scheme that would be illegal in the
private sector.) The Beard plan also will work because the huge Baby Boom
generation presently--and for the next few years--is pumping into the government
far more than the older generation of recipients is taking out. Under the
&quot;Restoring Hope&quot; plan, that surplus will be invested rather than
squandered on other programs. A one-time, long term and, of course, voluntary,
bond program for better-off taxpayers will cover the budgetary shortfall
caused by the government's shift of Social Security money that it is &quot;borrowing&quot;
now back into the Social Security program for which it was intended.<BR>
<BR>
	What this plan offers the elderly is just what they have, without danger
of later cutbacks. What it offers the young is hope for a secure old age:
roughly 50 percent more money annually than from the present system, or
twice as much if they choose to treat the program as an annuity. For a $30,000
a year wage-earner,  after 45 years, this would come to $18, 424 a year,
versus $13,710 under Social Security (all of this is in constant dollars).
Capital of roughly $368,486 could be passed along to heirs. Alternatively,
the recipient could use his accumulation as an annuity, raising his annual
receipt to $29,256. <BR>
<BR>
	Knowing that they are accumulating real savings and that these funds are
working away in the private sector will give all wage earners an investment
in the future of the overall economy, a stake most presently lack.  What
it offers the country as a whole is a huge increase in the savings rate
and a brake on inflation and interest rates. No wonder it has won praise
from  sources as varied as William F. Buckley and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.,
and from both Democratic Sen. Robert Kerry of Nebraska and Republican Sen.
Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, co-chairmen of the Social Security Commission.
<BR>
<BR>
	&quot;Restoring Hope in America&quot; is nothing less than a new social
contract, a chance to unite rather than divide us, to heal generational
and class differences rather than increase them. It is the program of shared
economic growth and security that we badly need.<BR>

The PR Man Who Made Seattle a Great City</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER></CENTER>
<H4><CENTER>by Bruce Chapman</CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
	When you get a copy of the Seattle Arts Commission's Directory of Public
Art, you will see listings of statues to Christopher Columbus, Leif Erikson
and Dr. Jose Rizal, the hero of the Philippines. But we barely manage one
statue and a copper bust of Chief Seattle and a mere artistic &quot;silhouette&quot;
for the local pioneers Arthur Denny and David &quot;Doc&quot; Maynard (at
the Pioneer Square Metro stop).  And even as we prepare for next year's
100th anniversary of the Klondike Gold Rush, you will see no mention of
a statue--neither silhouette nor bas relief  --to honor the person who did
the most to establish Seattle as a world class city, Erastus Brainerd.<BR>
<BR>
	He is not in school history books (how would they know what to make of
him?), but he surely was one of the world's greatest public relations men,
and the first of a long line of such conjurers in Seattle. The very fact
that Seattle has reason to celebrate the Klondike Gold Rush at all, and
enjoys the excellent gold rush museum operated by the U. S. Park Service
across from Occidental Park, is due largely to the talents and gall of Erastus
Brainerd.<BR>
<BR>
	It was Brainerd, above all, who saw what the arrival in Seattle of a &quot;ton
of gold&quot; on the S.S. Portland in the summer of 1897 could mean for
its happenstance destination. The newly discovered gold fields in Dawson
City were some 1600 miles away in the Yukon Territory of Canada, but you
had to get there from somewhere on the West Coast. Vancouver and Victoria
were actually closer than Seattle. Tacoma and Portland were nearly as handy,
and San Francisco was bigger and better known. But Brainerd and his committee
 at the Chamber of Commerce persuaded the world that Seattle was the gateway
to the Yukon, and later Alaska.<BR>
<BR>
	The miners came here, it was said, and we mined the miners. Outfitting
stores were built, the ancestors of today's recreation equipment businesses,
shipping lines were founded, food distributors set up. A federal Assay Office
was established so that gold could be turned into U.S. currency. By 1911
Seattle had grown from a population of 65,000 to over 250,000 and was organizing
another public relations success, the Alaska Yukon Pacific Exposition. Brainerd's
public relations engineered a self-fulfilling boom and truly put Seattle
on the world map.<BR>
<BR>
	It would be nice to imagine that Brainerd achieved all this simply by sending
out a few new-fangled telegrams. But the campaign was far more extensive,
aggressive, and wily, if not deceitful. The historian Murray Morgan describes
how Brainerd &quot;wrote articles for national magazines, planted quotes
from the articles with the wire services, then used extracts from the wire
stories in advertisements which proclaimed Seattle the Emporium to the Klondike.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Other northwest cities tried to use the wire services, too, but Brainerd
sent corrections to the papers, which got printed, and provided form letters
for newcomers to Seattle to write  letters to the editors of their former
hometown papers. He used State of Washington stationery to write to mayors
and governors around the country, and to foreigners, asking how many prospectors
they expected to be heading to Seattle en route to the gold fields. Ostensibly,
Seattle wanted to prepare for all the visitors, but the effort was just
another way of leaving  the impression that Seattle was, indeed, the gateway
to the Klondike.<BR>
<BR>
	Brainerd took out ads in The New York Journal, Cosmopolitan, Century, McClure's
and other magazines of the day, had the state Secretary of State print a
guide to Klondike prospectors that, naturally, routed them through Seattle,
and sent the folders to libraries all over the world. It also was Brainerd
who went around the Director of the U.S. Mint to get the assay office opened;
he did it by  enlisting a Pennsylvania Congressman--the brother of a Seattle
businessman--in getting a special law passed.<BR>
<BR>
	Brainerd himself deserves, but lacks, a biography. We know he was born
in Connecticut in 1855, graduated from Harvard College, married and had
two children,  and was a practicing journalist in the East until 1890. At
the start of the gold rush he was, of all thing, Paraguayan Consul in Seattle.
For a while after his successful gold rush publicity campaign he tried his
own luck in the Klondike, as a mining consultant--a mistake. Returning to
Seattle in 1904 he became editor of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.  He
was active in the Republican Party and later wrote a five volume history
of great artists, and another book on &quot;Alaska and the Klondyke.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Over the decades, Brainerd has been followed by a fabulous string of civic
leaders and PR promoters--from the people who organized the early civic
&quot;Potlatch&quot; events to those who started Seafair, from the creators
of the Century 21 World's Fair to those trying now to bring the  Olympic
Games to Seattle in 2008. <BR>
<BR>
	It was Brainerd who made Seattle big and rich and confident, but he himself
never cashed in. The final years of his life were spent in a mental hospital,
where he died Christmas Day, 1922, at age 67. <BR>
	We ought to put up a statue to Erastus Brainerd.<BR>

<title>Linda Chavez: Californians can skip voting; judges overrule them anyway -- December 11, 1996</title>

<i>December 11, 1996</i><br>     
<h2>Californians can skip voting; judges overrule them anyway</h2> 
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>     
<p>
<dd><I>BETHESDA, Md.</I> - Maybe California voters ought to stay home next election. In some quarters their votes don't count anyway. 
<P>
<dd>Two years ago, a federal judge stopped the state from enforcing a measure which denied welfare to illegal aliens approved by 60% of California's electorate.  This year on election night, the television networks declared the victor in the presidential election before the polls closed on the West Coast.  And last week, a federal judge overruled a majority of California voters who voted Nov. 5 to end race- and sex-based preferences in state programs. 
<P>
<dd>This latest affront is the most galling, however, because it so grossly insults the intelligence and the decency of the voters. At issue is a ballot measure adopted by 54.5% of the electorate, Proposition 209, which banned both discrimination and preference on the basis of race, sex, national origin, or ethnicity in state employment, education and contracting.  The initiative was modeled on Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which forbids discrimination. Proponents of race- and sex-based preferences filed suit the morning after the election, alleging that the measure placed an unfair burden on minorities and women and thus violated the U.S. Constitution's guarantee that all persons receive equal protection of the laws. 
<P>
<dd>How could a measure that explicitly prohibits discrimination be discriminatory? 
<P>
<dd>How could language that explicitly forbids giving any group preference on the basis of race or sex unfairly disadvantage minorities and women?  Easy, according to the judge who issued a temporary restraining order barring the state from enforcing Proposition 209.  "Courts must look beyond the plain language of an enactment," Judge Thelton E. Henderson declared.  But if we can't trust that the words of our laws mean what they actually say, the whole basis of the rule of law falls apart. Suddenly we are in a world in which a judge can say, like Humpty Dumpty in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, "When I use a word . . . it means just what I choose it to mean, nothing more or less."  All that matters, as Humpty tartly informed Alice, is "(who) is to be master." And lately in our democracy, judges have become masters of us all. 
<P>
<dd>In this case, the judge's own background casts doubt about his impartiality. Before he was appointed by President Carter in 1980, Judge Henderson practiced civil rights law in California and was on the board of the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, one of the plaintiffs in the suit, along with California Rural Legal Assistance, Equal Rights Advocates and
other liberal advocacy organizations. These groups have long argued that it is not discrimination to give preference to some groups so long as they are minorities or women. 
<P>
<dd>By this logic it is not discrimination when Asian and white students must have higher test scores and grades than blacks or Hispanics in order to be admitted to a top university. Discrimination is just what affirmative action proponents say, no more or less. Judge Henderson claims that Proposition 209 places an unfair burden on minorities and women by denying them the right "to petition their state and local officials for race- and gender-conscious programs aimed at remedying discrimination." In fact, most such programs are the result of executive and court orders, not legislative action, anyway. Supporters of affirmative action have been unwilling even to admit that they want preferential, not equal, treatment, much less to put a proposal for those programs to a vote. 
<P>
<dd>Nothing prevents supporters of racial preferences from doing what opponents did: putting their own initiative on the ballot and letting the people decide. They are unlikely to do so, however, because most voters believe that racial preferences are wrong, period. Unlike liberal judges and civil rights groups, most people don't imagine you can end discrimination against one group of people by practicing discrimination against another. Judge Henderson may have trouble interpreting the plain meaning of the Constitution's guarantee that "no state shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." 
<P>
<dd>But most of the rest of us, including a majority of California voters, understand that to mean no discrimination and no preferences, just as Proposition 209 promises.

<title>Linda Chavez: Editors, reporters should disclose votes -- November 22, 1996</title>

<h2>Clinton should skip GOP, Arkansans and diversity</h2> 
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>     
<p>
<dd>Administration officials are departing their jobs so rapidly since the election that you'd think the Republicans had won. 

Stepping down so far are the White House chief of staff and secretaries of State, Defense, Commerce, Energy and Transportation, plus the heads of the president's Council of Economic Advisers and the civil rights division in the Justice Department, to name only the most prominent. 
<dd>Second terms always produce turnover, often because the president wants it, but this mad rush for the door barely two weeks after the president won re-election is a bit unseemly. 
<dd>Whether motivated by fear that the administration will be bogged down in Whitewater and related investigations over the next couple of years or hamstrung in directing policy by the Republican Congress, the Clinton team started to bolt as soon as the ballots were counted. 
<dd>Now the president must spend the next few months trying to reassemble his players. 
<dd>Here are some tips for the president as he makes his picks: 
<ul>
<li>Forget bipartisanship. President Clinton has already announced he'd like to appoint a Republican to his Cabinet, but it's a bad idea for the president and any Republican who might be chosen.<p>Giving a post to a Republican would only further alienate congressional Democrats, and unless the president is thinking of switching parties himself, he'll need to hold his Democratic votes in the next Congress.<p>Besides, the public isn't really fooled when a president of one party picks political appointees of the other. Look at Ronald Reagan's most famous Democratic appointees: U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick and Education Secretary William Bennett.<p>Neither remained in the Democratic Party, and Kirkpatrick became most famous in political circles for referring to Democrats as the "blame-America-first" crowd. (I lasted almost two years as a Reagan Democrat while director of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights but switched parties when I moved to the White House.)<p>
<li>Stop bean-counting. The president's obsession in 1993 with choosing a Cabinet that "looks like America" produced a series of embarrassing nominations that he had to abandon. Nonetheless, he's likely to repeat his mistakes if he listens to groups representing women and blacks, who have already been whining that the announced departures will leave the administration less diverse.<p>A coalition of women's organizations complained to Vice President Gore last week that although women gave the Clinton-Gore team a 17-point advantage in their votes, few women were being mentioned for top posts in the next term.<p>They were particularly exercised over remarks attributed to an "unnamed administration source" discounting Clinton U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright as a likely contender for Secretary of State.<p>But Albright probably isn't a good choice for State - and it has nothing to do with her sex. She's been a chief proponent of making U.N. peacekeeping/ peacemaking operations a priority for the Pentagon, as well as of expanding our efforts to include nation-building in places like Somalia and Haiti. With U.S. troops staying in Bosnia for at least another 18 months to promote more political stability, despite Clinton's original promises to have them out before the end of this year, the president would be well advised to avoid promoting to a senior foreign policy post someone who will focus attention on the mission creep in Bosnia. <p>
<li>Avoid naming anyone from Arkansas. Some of the president's most disastrous choices in his first term were political cronies and friends from Arkansas. Several of these left the administration in disgrace, including Hillary Clinton's former law partners Webster Hubbell (now serving time in federal prison for bilking clients) and William Kennedy. 
</ul>
<p>
The president can't afford any more scrutiny of his past dealings and relationships in Arkansas. He already has to worry about the likelihood of more indictments being handed down by the independent counsel investigating Whitewater, the pending Supreme Court hearing on Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit from his time as Arkansas governor, and new investigations into his Arkansas buddy John Huang, whose fund-raising efforts for the president may result in the appointment of yet another independent counsel. 
<dd>Good luck, Mr. President. You'll need it. So may the fools who rush into an administration where angels fear to tread.

<h2>Editors, reporters should disclose votes</h2>     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>     
<p>
<dd>BETHESDA, Md. - Whether Tuesday's election results make you mad or glad, there's one thing that should make you worry. 
<dd>One small but immensely powerful group of Americans influenced this election more than all the contributors to all political parties and candidates combined, but they don't have to disclose their influence or make public their political preferences. 
<dd>They are the linchpin of every election, the very source of nearly all the public's information. 
<dd>They are the newspaper, magazine, TV and radio reporters, editors and producers who bring you "the news." They are also arguably the most politically homogenous and biased group in American politics today. 
<dd>If past behavior is any indication, 9 out of 10 reporters and editors probably cast their votes for Bill Clinton and other Democratic candidates Tuesday. 
<dd>At least that's what most studies of voting behavior among the national media suggest, including one by the Freedom Forum last year that showed 89% of national correspondents, editors and writers voted for Bill Clinton in 1992. 
<dd>But voting bias doesn't necessarily prove reporting bias. It's at least theoretically possible that liberal reporters and editors were scrupulous in preventing their own personal bias from affecting their coverage of political issues and candidates during the election. 
<dd>Unfortunately, recent content analysis of TV news coverage indicates otherwise. 
<dd>A study by the Center for Media and Public Affairs, a nonpartisan Washington research group, shows that TV coverage overwhelmingly favored President Clinton this election season. 
<dd>In September, Clinton received 54% positive coverage on the networks' evening news programs, compared with only 30% for Bob Dole. 
<dd>The networks criticized Dole's economic views 81% of the time, his social policies 78%, and his conduct as a candidate 81%, according to the center. 
<dd>Ironically, Clinton's worst press in the early fall came when he signed the overwhelmingly popular welfare-reform bill, which the newscasts criticized in 90% of their stories, demonstrating that the media's liberal slant is even worse than their partisan prejudice. 
<dd>Perhaps that is one reason why, although voters think of the media as more liberal than conservative, they don't think the media are partisan Democrats. 
<dd>Can anything be done to curb such bias? 
<dd>Why not insist on full disclosure of the media's voting behavior? 
<dd>The public has a right to know how reporters, editors and others in positions to influence coverage actually vote, just as they already have the right to know who owns media outlets. 
<dd>It's possible to protect reporters' privacy while still informing the public by gathering the information and publishing it anonymously, much the way all survey data are reported. 
<dd>It could work like this: After each election, news organizations would voluntarily distribute surveys to their own staff asking them to identify their party affiliation and if and how they voted in the election. (Measures to protect individual privacy would be necessary, much as they are in mail-ballot elections.) The information then would be published or aired, allowing the public to make up its own mind about whether journalists' views may have influenced their coverage. 
<dd>Some voters might even clip and save the information, the better to judge the media's coverage during subsequent elections. 
<dd>Of course, some journalists would choose not to reveal party affiliation or voter preference, but that, too, could be measured and reported along with the overall results. Readers and viewers would be left to conclude for themselves why some news media staff did not want their political views known. 
<dd>I suspect some editors and producers might even be embarrassed by the political imbalance on their own staffs. A few might even try harder for more balanced coverage as a result. 
<dd>Who knows, a handful of editors and producers might be inspired to hire a conservative or two other than as commentators, the role to which most conservatives are now consigned. 
<dd>Is it really too much to expect members of the press to live up to the same standards of full disclosure they insist on for everyone else? 
<dd>Disclosure wouldn't necessarily eliminate media bias, but at least it would expose it so the public could be more discerning news consumers.

<h2>The clueless voter ought to stay home</h2>     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>     
<p>
BETHESDA, Md. - Next week's election is predicted to have one
of the lowest voter turnouts in modern history, which is good news for democracy in America. Oh,
I know it's my civic duty to bemoan voter apathy and urge everyone to vote. But many nonvoters
don't know or care enough about the democratic process to cast intelligent - that is, informed
- votes. Sadly, even some actual voters probably don't know enough about
the candidates or issues to be casting their votes astutely, either. And uninformed voters going
to the polls is even more dangerous than apathetic nonvoters staying home. 
<p>
Who are these uninformed Americans? Nearly half of all adults
can't answer basic questions about U.S. government, much less specifics about issues and officeholders
or candidates, according to a recent study conducted for The Washington Post by Harvard University
and the Kaiser Foundation. The survey, taken about a year ago, found that 40%
of adults couldn't name the vice president, and almost half failed to identify the speaker of the
House. I suspect fewer Americans would flunk these basic questions at the height of a national
election, but ignorance about government itself and policy issues no doubt is just as high.
<p>
For example, nearly half of those surveyed didn't know the U.S. Supreme Court can decide whether
a law is constitutional, and nearly 60% believe that the government spends more on foreign aid than
on Medicare. Although foreign aid is less than 2% of the budget, most Americans believe it accounts
for fully one-quarter of all federal spending. According to the survey, Republicans are better informed than
Democrats, but no group is exempt from ignorance. Traveling around the country, I've certainly encountered
my share of clueless citizens, including one likely Dole voter who probably shouldn't
be voting at all. Although the woman was pleasant, hard working and college educated, she literally
had no idea why she was voting. She told me she really &quot;liked&quot; President Bush and had voted
for him in '92, but she didn't have much of an opinion about either Bob Dole or Bill Clinton. She didn't seem
to know about Dole's tax proposals or where Clinton stood on anything. &quot;I'll probably
vote for Dole because Clinton beat Bush. And I really liked George Bush,&quot; she gushed. 
I've heard other would-be voters say they support Clinton because they like his looks, or the way he
hugs Chelsea, or because it's his generation's turn to govern.
<p>
And they are quite serious. Women seem more disposed to such nonsense than men in my own informal
surveys. And the Harvard/Kaiser study confirms that women - including college-educated
young women - know less about politics than men, but they are more likely to vote. Is
it really healthy for a democracy to encourage poorly informed persons to vote? I don't think so, but
mine seems to be a minority opinion - or at least so impolitic a view that few in public life
are willing to own up to it. Everywhere the next few days we will see and hear indiscriminate
pleas from politicians, the media and civic groups to &quot;get out and vote.&quot; These high-minded
folks would do a greater service by insisting that citizens not vote unless they learn something about
the issues. Democracy entails more than a willing electorate.
<p>
Those who do vote have a responsibility to understand the political process and know something about the issues and candidates before they enter the polling booth. Those who can't be bothered to educate themselves jeopardize democracy with
their ignorance. All of us would be better off if the ill-informed stayed home on Election Day.

<h2>Belgian outrage, our silence</h2>     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>     
<p>
BETHESDA, Md. - What would happen in this country if the next
time a child were starved to death or raped or murdered, we decided we weren't ever again going
to allow such a thing to occur without punishing every person who bore some responsibility? 
What if we were to stop working and take to the streets the next time a repeat offender snuffed out
some innocent life? What if hundreds of us were to descend on our local police stations, thousands
of us were to surround our courthouses, hundreds of thousands of us to march to our state capitols
demanding justice? It's hard to imagine, I know. But no harder than envisioning what's happened in
Belgium the past two weeks. 
<P>
In a population less than 5% our own, hundreds of thousands have
filled the streets of cities throughout the country to protest the handling of an investigation
into a child pornography ring that kidnapped, tortured and murdered young Belgian girls. 
In Liege, local firefighters turned their hoses on the courthouse when the Belgian Supreme Court removed the chief investigative magistrate in the case because he attended a dinner for the victims' families. 
Unions staged wildcat strikes throughout the tiny nation. Students occupied the Palace of Justice in Brussels, unfurling signs reading &quot;Justice for Sale.&quot; Even 2,000 rough-looking bikers blocked traffic with their motorcycles, demanding a reinstatement of the death penalty.  And this weekend, 300,000 Belgians gathered in peaceful protest of a justice system gone terribly wrong.  
<p>
What happened in Belgium to spark this massive civil disobedience was the murder of four young girls, two of whom were barely 8 years old, and the disappearance of at least seven more children. 
The man charged with the murders, Marc Dutroux, is a convicted child rapist who served only half
his previous 13-year sentence. He was let go in 1992 when prison social workers and psychiatrists
determined he was no longer a danger. Within one year, little girls started disappearing. Even Dutroux's own mother twice tried to turn him into the police, but he was not arrested until August when police rescued two young women who were being held in his cellar. Now, a dozen others have been arrested for their involvement in the child pornography ring, suspected of videotaping the girls' sexual abuse and torture. 
<p>
These revelations have been enough to bring Belgium to a standstill.
But can we Americans imagine any crime so heinous that we would respond similarly, with genuine
moral indignation at the failure of the U.S. justice system to punish criminals and protect the innocent?
Each year it seems some sadistic lunatic out on parole slaughters a child somewhere in
the United States. 
<p>
The list of recent atrocities is long; still, a few stand out: Polly Klaas, a 12-year-old
kidnapped, raped and murdered by an already convicted rapist. A 6-year-old boy in Washington
state kidnapped, sodomized and sexually mutilated by another demon let loose days earlier. Seven-year-old
Megan Kanka murdered by a convicted child molester who lived on her street. 
<p>
We have become inured to the kinds of horrors that have rallied
the Belgians. But who is to say whether we might put an end to such outrages here if we were to
follow the Belgians' example? Belgium's King Albert II said in a rare public speech last week
that the tragedy of the young girls' murders &quot;must become an occasion for moral renewal and for
profound change in the country.&quot; If only we would do the same. Yet we sit passively by as each new abomination unfolds. In New York, one child is starved, another beaten to death - both by their own mothers' hands. Social workers, obliged to visit these welfare mothers once a year, had failed in their duty, and twice
in barely one year babies died. Still others are murdered by their mothers' boyfriends, sometimes after years of sexual and physical abuse. 
<p>
The best we can muster by way of national examination is a Nightline episode. Most of the
time it's just an afternoon talk show.  
<p>
If tiny Belgium can turn out 300,000 people to mourn the deaths
of a dozen innocent children, why aren't there an equivalent 6 million Americans who would do the
same for the hundreds of children who die in similar circumstances here?

   BETHESDA, Md. -- A year ago, it looked like affirmative action
would be the hot topic of the '96 campaign. Today the issue has
disappeared from the radar screen, except in California where
voters will decide whether to ban state-sponsored preferences
in a ballot initiative known as Proposition 209. The pro-quota
side is nervous enough about the outcome to be running one of
the most dishonest campaigns in recent history, employing a bag
of dirty tricks more suited to an old Soviet KGB disinformation
operation than a democratic election.

<p>
In the most recent outrage, the anti-209 forces invited Klansman
David Duke to argue for the measure in a public debate today at
California State University in Northridge. The organizers said
they couldn't find anyone else to take the pro-209 position. The
real story is that once organizers had secured Duke's participation,
no reputable person would appear with him.
<p>
   Inviting Duke was a clever ploy meant to intimidate Proposition
209 supporters. Debate organizers want voters to believe anyone
who opposes race-based preferences must be a KKK sympathizer.
That's a lie, and they know it.
<p>
   But lies appear to be the stock in trade of the anti-209 campaign.
On Friday someone sent a fake "letter of appreciation" supposedly
from Duke to Ward Connerly, a businessman who chairs the group
that put Proposition 209 on the ballot. The letter thanks Connerly
for his "financial contribution" to Duke's losing Senate race
(he came in fifth in Saturday's primary in Louisiana). No doubt
the creeps who forged the phony Duke letter thought it was particularly
clever to send it to Connerly, who is black. Of course Connerly,
who abhors everything Duke stands for, has never made any political
contribution to Duke. In fact, the real money going to Duke comes
from Cal State Northridge, which is paying him $ 4,000 to participate
in today's debate.
<p>
   Another highlight of the anti-209 campaign is a graphic appearing
in fliers and some publications showing a burning cross with the
caption "Unidentified CCRI supporters celebrate the recent advances
in their struggle for civil rights."
<p>
   Why are the anti-209 groups using such dirty tactics? Because
they are desperate to deflect attention from the real issue of
preferences, which are overwhelmingly unpopular. Most polls show
more than two-thirds of Americans oppose racial quotas, set-asides
and preferences. Even with the nasty and well-funded campaign
against Proposition 209, the measure still holds a 17-point lead
among likely California voters.
<P>
   It's no wonder Proposition 209 remains popular. The measure bans
both discrimination and preferences on the basis of race, sex
or national origin in state employment, education and contracting.
What could be more fair?
<p>
It's too bad Republicans abandoned efforts to make race and gender
preferences a campaign issue nationwide. Barely more than a year
ago, Bob Dole was leading the fight to ban preferences in federal
programs, and even President Clinton was promising to "mend"
affirmative action. But Republicans got cold feet and have since
dropped their legislative efforts to ban preferences. And Clinton
has actually extended affirmative action programs, not "mended"
them as he pledged.
<P>
But perhaps politicians' reticence to take on preferences is understandable, 
given the tenor of the debate in California.
<p>
It's more difficult to intimidate millions of voters, however.
I'm betting that when Californians go to the polls Nov. 5, they
will remember the David Duke incident. We'll see then why such
chicanery rarely pays off in an election.<P><P>

<p>
BETHESDA, Md. - The Spanish have a phrase for it: sin verguenza. It means without shame, and
it's no compliment. It could become the motto of our age, exemplified most recently by Dick Morris,
the president's strategist who resigned after a tabloid published pictures of him at a hotel with a
prostitute. <P>

Instead of retreating from the media spotlight when his antics with a $200-an-hour call girl became
public, Morris is actually looking for new ways to expose himself. And he's snared a breathless
media eager to help. Time magazine has already turned over its cover (for the second week in a
row) to a shameless Morris, pictured with his betrayed wife hovering grim-faced behind him. Inside,
Morris exploits the opportunity to take credit for Bill Clinton's political comeback. And Random
House has given Morris a $2.5 million book deal for more of the same. 
<P>
Expect no apology from Dick Morris. But then, why should he bother? Not even his wife seems to
expect one. After the story broke, the president called Morris to commiserate with his friend and
image maker, as did Hillary Clinton and Al Gore. A little moral outrage would have been more
appropriate - if not for Morris' indecent conduct, then for jeopardizing the Clinton campaign by
entertaining a prostitute in a hotel room paid for by campaign funds. 
<P>
But moral outrage is unfashionable today, reserved only for those who commit the last universally
recognized sin in our culture: hypocrisy. And Morris is no hypocrite, which requires at least a
semblance of adherence to some moral or ethical code. The lesson is you can get away with
anything, becoming richer and more famous in the process, so long as you are completely amoral to
begin with. 
<P>
It wasn't always so. There was a time when anyone in Morris' position would have been deeply
mortified at being caught in such a sordid liaison. And even if the miscreant felt no inward remorse,
he would still have been shunned by his peers. 
<P>
No such punishment awaits Morris, whose hubris reflects more than his own arrogance. As a
society, we've become inured to shame. Nothing shocks us. Millions tune in to an endless parade of
vice and weirdness on daytime television. The more salacious the details, the greater the celebrity.
We glorify violence in music and films. We idolize foul-mouthed entertainers and transvestite sports
figures. We re-elect public officials caught smoking crack cocaine and seducing boys. 
<P>
Is it any wonder so many social institutions are disintegrating and our streets are unsafe? Without a
sense of what is shameful in our own lives and others', we deny ourselves the capacity to make
social judgments. Deviancy has no meaning unless we can measure behavior against some common
standard. 
<P>
A few years ago, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) wrote a brilliant essay in The Public
Interest which described the social deterioration occurring, from rising out-of-wedlock births to
skyrocketing crime. Much of the problem stemmed, he said, from a phenomenon he dubbed
"defining deviancy down." In other words, so lowering our standards about what is proper that what
once would have been considered deviant behavior has become merely individual choice. 
<P>
In fact, the situation is worse than Moynihan described. We've not only done away with concepts of
right and wrong, but we've also begun to heap huge rewards on those whose actions would once
have made them pariahs. Why should Dick Morris be ashamed of himself when so many of us are
eager to shower him with fame and fortune?<P><P>

<h2>Promises Don't Help Kids Read</h2>     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">     
Linda Chavez

<p>
BETHESDA, Md. - Four years ago when running for president the first 
time, Bill Clinton promised to overhaul the nation's education system 
from kindergarten through 12th grade in his campaign manifesto, 
Putting People First. Given his disastrous attempt at overhauling the 
country's health-care system, perhaps we can be thankful he didn't 
manage to come up with an education plan once he assumed office. But 
it's re-election time, and once again candidate Clinton is an 
education reformer. <p>

Last week, the president promised an assault on illiteracy, pledging 
$1.75 billion for new programs to ensure that every American child can 
read by third grade. Sounds great, but aren't public schools supposed 
to teach kids to read already? The United States spends more on public 
education than almost any other nation - more than $240 billion a year 
for elementary and secondary schools in 1994. That's $5,300 per 
student. If schools have failed to teach kids how to read by third 
grade, how will adding less than 1% more money solve the problem? <p>

By the president's own admission, 40% of fourth-grade students fail to 
meet basic reading standards. And money isn't the problem. In 1980, 
the U.S. was spending less than $3,900 per student. Yet the reading 
proficiency of average 9-year-olds was actually higher than it is now, 
according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress. <p>

What happened? Bob Dole blames the teachers unions, and they certainly 
share a good deal of blame. The 2.2 million-member National Education 
Association has supported every education fad that has come down the 
pike, so long as it was sufficiently multicultural and politically 
correct. The much smaller American Federation of Teachers, with only 
about 900,000 members, has a far better record on education issues, 
and its president, Albert Shanker, has been a thoughtful exponent of 
education reform. <p>

Nonetheless, both the NEA and the AFT have become well-financed 
political lobbies for liberal causes. The NEA alone raised $6.5 
million in 1992 and spent $2.3 million on congressional candidates, 
almost all Democrats. The only thing that really matters to the 
teachers unions is whether candidates support increased spending on 
education. <p>

Much of that money doesn't even go to teachers' salaries, much less 
directly into the classroom. American public education has become a 
giant, bloated bureaucracy, with school systems top-heavy with 
administrative staff who never set foot in a classroom. <p>

By contrast, Catholic schools, which educate 2.6 million students a 
year, produce better results with a fraction of the money. Catholic 
schools spend about $2,800 per pupil, around half what public schools 
do, but Catholic students outperform their public school peers, 
especially in comparisons between poor minority students from both 
groups. <p>

If Clinton were really interested in improving reading levels of 
America's poor children, he'd give them the same opportunity he gives 
his own: the chance to go to the school of her choice, in Chelsea's 
case the private Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C. The 
Clintons can afford Sidwell Friends' pricey tuition, but most middle-
class, much less poor, parents can't pay private-school tuition and 
pay taxes for public school, too. <p>

During the last election, Peter Brimelow reported in Forbes, candidate 
Clinton told the NEA, "If I become president, you'll be my partners. I 
won't forget who brought me to the White House." That's one promise 
President Clinton has kept, but it won't help kids learn how to read. <p>

<title>Linda Chavez: Dems' Use Of 'E-Word' Flies In Their Faces -- August 28, 1996</title>

<h2>Dems' Use Of 'E-Word' Flies In Their Faces</h2>     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">     
Linda Chavez     
</a>     
<p>

BETHESDA, Md. - The Democrats are using the "e-word" a lot this week, 
trying to paint Bob Dole and the Republican Congress as extremists. 
But a close look at the Democrats' platform and the delegates 
themselves suggests it's the Democratic Party that represents some 
political extremes. From a balanced-budget amendment to welfare 
reform, the Democrats in Chicago are out of step with the American 
public. <p>

According to a Washington Post/ABC poll, 82% of registered voters 
favor a balanced-budget amendment, but only 32% of Democratic 
delegates agree. Perhaps that's why the Democratic platform is silent 
on the issue. After all, it might be embarrassing to mention a measure 
that 162 Democrats in Congress voted against in 1995, dooming the 
amendment in the 104th Congress. <p>

The survey also showed that 82% of Democratic delegates favor 
affirmative action programs that give preferences to minorities and 
women. But most other Americans oppose race or gender preferences. The 
Washington Post/ABC poll showed registered voters as a whole oppose 
race and gender preferences by a margin of 52% to 45%, but polls of 
the general public show even greater opposition. A 1995 poll by the 
Los Angeles Times showed 73% of Americans favor legislation to outlaw 
preferential hiring by race or sex. <p>

But it's not surprising the Democratic delegates favor preferences and 
quotas, since they were chosen under party rules that set strict 
racial and gender quotas. Each state delegation must reflect the 
racial and ethnic breakdown of Democratic voters in the last election 
and include equal numbers of men and women. <p>

President Clinton just signed the Republican welfare-reform bill last 
week, but his own delegates don't think much of "ending welfare as we 
know it." The Washington Post/ABC poll shows only 38% of delegates 
support a five-year limit on welfare benefits, something 73% of all 
registered voters favor. The Democratic platform doesn't mention 
specific time limits, except to say who should be exempted from them. <p>

Speaking of exemptions, apparently the Clinton administration has a 
lot of welfare-reform exemptions up its sleeve if Clinton is re-
elected. Vice President Gore suggested Sunday on This Week with David 
Brinkley that the president doesn't really intend to implement the 
bill he just signed. Gore said the president will use whatever means 
available - including the line-item veto - to excise parts of the 
welfare-reform bill he doesn't like. So much for democratic process. <p>

Even on abortion, an issue that seems to plague Republicans every four 
years, the Democrats are hardly in the mainstream of public opinion - 
though you won't hear the media talk much about it this week. Democrat 
delegates are overwhelmingly pro-choice, and the party platform spells 
out an unrestricted "right of every woman to choose, consistent with 
Roe vs. Wade, and regardless of ability to pay." <p>

But Americans favor a much more limited right to choose abortion than 
the Democrats' position. Most Americans favor some legal restrictions 
on abortion: 74% favor mandatory 24-hour waiting periods, and 74% 
support parental consent and 70% spousal notification laws. Although 
the president recently vetoed a bill to ban partial-birth abortions 
except to save a mother's life, 71% of Americans oppose the procedure, 
which involves partially delivering a 20- to 26-week fetus feet first 
and inserting a surgical scissors into the skull to remove the brain. 
One of the most comprehensive surveys of American opinion on abortion 
and moral beliefs, done by the Gallup organization in 1991, showed 
that 73% of Americans support a prohibition of abortion after the 
first three months of pregnancy for any reason except to save the life 
of the mother. And more than 80% oppose government funding of 
abortion. <p>

The Democrats will continue to try to paint themselves as moderates 
and the Republicans as extremists through the election. They think if 
they say it often enough, maybe the country will believe them. I'm 
betting Americans are a lot smarter than that.<p>

<title>Linda Chavez: Perot's Legacy May Be Helping To Elect Clinton Twice -- August 21, 1996</title>

<h2>Perot's Legacy May Be Helping To Elect Clinton Twice</h2>     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">     
Linda Chavez     
</a>     
<p>


BETHESDA, Md. - Despite his quirkiness, Ross Perot has done some 
pretty impressive things in his lifetime, not the least winning nearly 
20 million votes in the 1992 presidential election. But if he persists 
in his quixotic quest for the White House this year, he may well be 
remembered only as the man responsible for twice electing Bill Clinton 
president. <p>

Polls suggest Perot won't garner nearly as many votes this time 
around. But if Perot pulls even 2% or 3% of the vote, his role could 
be decisive in a close election, as this one promises to be. White 
House aides claim they believe Perot hurts President Clinton as much 
as he does Bob Dole. (And if you believe that one, they have some land 
parcels on the Whitewater River they'd like to sell you.) <p>

In fact, Perot draws his support mostly from independent and 
Republican voters. In 1992, Perot won only 13% of Democrats' votes but 
30% of independents' and 17% of Republicans' votes. And 20% of his 
1992 voters had voted for George Bush in 1988. Maybe it's time Ross 
Perot - and his remaining supporters - rethink what they want to 
accomplish in 1996. <p>

Here are a few questions they should ask themselves. <p>

Do you really want to balance the budget? Republicans have already 
proved they can balance the budget - they passed a five-year balanced 
budget last December. But President Clinton vetoed it. And Clinton 
still can't decide when he'll produce a balanced budget. One day it's 
nine years, another day it's seven, and still another he says maybe he 
can do it in five. <p>

Do you believe the country needs to rein in entitlements? The 
Republicans offered genuine entitlement reform last year, but the 
Democrats did their best to nix it. First, Democrats - including the 
president - demagogued Medicare reform, needlessly and recklessly 
trying to scare the elderly. Then the president twice vetoed welfare 
reform despite having promised "to end welfare as we know it." The 
president is expected to sign a Republican-passed welfare-reform bill 
this week, but only because he knows he can't possibly be re-elected 
if he doesn't. <p>

lDo you still care about reforming government? Republicans in the 
104th Congress passed the most sweeping government-reform legislation 
since the civil service reforms 100 years ago. For the first time, 
laws that apply to ordinary citizens and employers now apply to 
members of Congress. The Democrats controlled Congress for more than 
40 years, exempting themselves from all the employment laws they were 
happy to inflict on others. The Republicans quickly ended that 
practice once they gained control of both houses of Congress in 1994. <p>

Which is the real reform party in America? The Democrats have said 
"no" to Medicare reform, Medicaid reform, welfare reform, lawsuit 
reform, and term limits. Meanwhile, the Reform Party can't even get 
its own members to participate in choosing the party's presidential 
nominee. Fewer than 5% cast ballots either in the nominating process 
or in selecting the candidate. Perhaps the Reform Party ought to get 
its own house in order before it tries tackling the whole government. <p>

That leaves one party and one presidential nominee for reform-minded 
voters: Republican Bob Dole. If Ross Perot and his supporters truly 
want change this year, they'll stop playing spoilers. Last time 
around, Perot spent $60 million on his campaign. This time he's not 
even willing to risk his own money, asking his supporters to pony up 
so he can receive $30 million in federal campaign funds instead. <p>

Re-electing Bill Clinton won't change politics as usual, won't end 
gridlock, won't make government work more efficiently - all reasons 
Perot says he's running. But the numbers just aren't there. Perot 
can't win, and surely even he knows it this time. It's hard to believe 
Perot wants his legacy to be a second term for Bill Clinton. But if he 
insists on staying in the race until November, he may succeed in 
ensuring just that.<p>

<title>Chavez: GOP Gender Gap Simply "Hogwash"  -- 8/14/96 </title>

<h2>
GOP Gender Gap Simply "Hogwash"
</h2>     
     
     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">     
Linda Chavez     
</a>     
<p>
SAN DIEGO - Here's a political quiz: Which political party has 
suffered from a "gender gap" in voting during the last several 
presidential elections? If you answered "the Republicans," you get an 
"A" for reading the newspapers and watching the evening news -- but 
you flunk the test.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In fact, in three out of the last four elections, it has been the 
Democrats who have actually been hurt by the gender gap. Democrats 
lost those elections because they did so poorly among male voters. In 
1984, Democrat Walter Mondale trailed Republican President Ronald 
Reagan by 25 points among men. And in 1988, Democrat Michael Dukakis 
got 16% fewer male votes than Republican George Bush. 
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Their losses had little to do with female voters. But the media have 
been relatively uninterested over the years in why men are less likely 
to vote Democratic, while they've been obsessed with the supposed GOP 
gender gap among women.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This year is no different. Expect to read countless stories and hear 
endless explanations this election season why Bob Dole can't win 
women's votes. And most of it will be hogwash -- or wishful thinking 
on the part of reporters and pundits, most of whom w ill probably be 
voting Democratic themselves in November. (In 1992, 89% of Washington-
based reporters and editors voted for Bill Clinton, according to a 
poll by the Freedom Forum, a media think tank.)
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One of the favorite explanations of why women won't vote Republican 
this year is the party's position on abortion. The Republican Party's 
strong anti-abortion stance is supposed to be a huge barrier to 
winning women's votes. But, in fact, polls show that  abortion has 
little to do with how women cast their votes.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A recent USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll showed only 1 in 5 female voters 
say the candidate they support must share exactly their own position 
on abortion. And of these women, slightly more than half are actually 
pro-life, so at best it's a wash. Abortion ranke d 10th out of the top 
12 most important issues to women in this poll, and about one-third 
said abortion was not at all important in determining how they would 
vote.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Like men, women care most about the economy when it comes time to pick 
a president. Which is good news for Bob Dole. He has certainly shown 
this past week that he intends to make the economy his No. 1 issue -- 
first with his tax-cut proposal and then with  his selection of Jack 
Kemp to be his running mate.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Both actions should have real appeal for female voters. Kemp's brand 
of compassionate conservatism and his exuberant political style will 
resonate with women who may be turned off by doom-and-gloom talk of 
budget deficits and harsh rhetoric about slashing government spending.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Most importantly, Dole's proposed 15% across-the-board tax cut, 
coupled with an extra $500 tax deduction for each child under 18, will 
mean real savings to families. Many middle-income voters with young 
children would see their federal income-tax bill red uced by half if 
Dole has his way. Most opinion polls show that working mothers would 
prefer to work fewer hours outside the home. Allowing families to keep 
more of their earnings could give many mothers the option to work less 
or to use their tax savings  to buy a home, put toward their 
children's college education, or save for their own retirement. Dole 
is proposing real choice for women -- the choice to determine their 
own economic futures. 
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's the Democrats who want to limit women's choices. The Democrats 
would rather let government decide how to spend working women's money 
than allow women to choose how to spend it themselves.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The last time Americans got a tax break -- when President Reagan twice 
reduced tax rates, in 1981 and 1986 -- the economy boomed. Growth 
averaged about 4% a year during Reagan's tenure, resulting in the 
longest period of economic expansion since World War  II. What's more, 
women's earnings grew faster during the 1980s than at any time in 
recent history.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But don't expect the media to remind voters of these economic facts 
between now and Election Day. They'll be too busy reporting the so-
called GOP gender gap.

We're Becoming A Nation Of Crybabies
</h2>

<p>BETHESDA, Md. -- Working for the federal government, which has never 
been a barrel of laughs, is about to get even less humorous. Last 
month, a Social Security Administration official told a sexist joke at 
an agency conference, and now charges are flying that the agency is 
riddled with sex discrimination. The only twist in this increasingly 
familiar charge is that the joke-teller was a woman and the butt of 
the joke was men. Now several men at the agency are claiming that a 
"hostile work environment" exists -- code words for sexual harassment 
-- which could signal discrimination complaints, lawsuits and wasted 
taxpayer dollars ahead.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unlike many charges involving sexual harassment, the facts of this 
case aren't in dispute. Ruth Pierce, deputy commissioner for human 
resources and director of equal employment opportunity at the Social 
Security Administration, told the joke to participants in a diversity 
workshop in Miami.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to The Washington Post, which reported the story on its 
front page, the joke involved a mermaid and a fisherman whose wish was 
to become five times smarter. The mermaid granted the fisherman's wish 
by turning him into a woman. Not exactly a knee slapper as jokes go, 
but it elicited enough laughs from the mostly female listeners to send 
audience member John Boyer into quite a snit.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Boyer heads an informal group called Government Men for Equality Now 
(GMEN) and alleges the Social Security Administration is dominated by 
women and rife with anti-male prejudice. Now he's hoping to turn 
Pierce's joke into a federal case, demanding that Pierce apologize to 
all 65,000 agency employees and be demoted from her current post.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Boyer's complaint itself might be laughable if the federal government 
weren't such a bastion of the double standard. If Pierce were a man 
telling a predominantly male audience a joke poking fun at women's 
intelligence, the government's political-correctness squad would 
already be on the case.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Similar circumstances at a Coast Guard dinner in 1995 led not only to 
months of investigation, but also to enormous human suffering. Capt. 
Ernie Blanchard, a career veteran of the Coast Guard with an 
impeccable record, told a few barely off-color jokes at a dinner 
honoring cadets and became the focus of an official investigation that 
ultimately resulted in an 800-page report. Informed that his career 
was in jeopardy and that he might lose his pension, spelling financial 
ruin for his family, Blanchard killed himself before the investigation 
was complete.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Even if the Coast Guard incident had not ended so tragically with 
Blanchard's death, it would still be a travesty. No government career 
should be extinguished for a one-time lapse in taste before an adult 
audience.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But ever since the courts started interpreting a "hostile work 
environment" to constitute sexual harassment, bad taste has become a 
federal offense. With men so often the targets of such witch hunts, 
it's no surprise a few, like John Boyer, strike back.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But the answer to this nonsense is not for more men to claim that 
they, too, are victims of sexual harassment because someone tells a 
meaningless joke. We are becoming a nation of crybabies who can 
respond to others' ridiculous behavior only by engaging in more of the 
same.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1994, the last year for which figures are available, federal 
workers filed nearly 12,000 harassment complaints -- more than in any 
other single category of alleged discrimination.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
With warm-up jokes and after-dinner entertainment now fair game for 
such charges, that number will no doubt climb. American taxpayers, who 
foot the bill for such silliness, surely aren't laughing.

<p>
SAPELLO, N.M. -- The night is cool atop Star Hill, east of the Sangre 
de Cristo mountains in northern New Mexico. Nearby a herd of longhorn 
cattle and a few scattered buffalo have settled in for the night. 
Earlier in the day, I observed a coyote stalking the cattle from the 
crest of a hill, and a Swainson's hawk perched on the barbed-wire 
fence.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But the thrill of seeing these creatures will soon pale as Phil Mahon, 
our host at Star Hill resort, introduces my husband and me to his 
celestial delights.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Until now, neither of us has anything but a passing interest in 
astronomy. As lifelong city residents, we rarely enjoy star-studded 
nights apart from an occasional country get-away where we can escape 
both the city lights that obscure the stars from view and the 
preoccupations that cause us not to look. Now, on an impulse we're 
here at this amateur astronomers' retreat, hoping to expand our 
horizons.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mahon, a somewhat taciturn guide, types instructions into a laptop 
computer attached to a 14-inch Compustar telescope, and the machine 
whirs into action, rotating on its pedestal until it comes to rest 
pointed at the Southern sky. Through the lens we see not only Jupiter 
and its red bands, but also four of its 16 moons. For the next hour, 
Mahon treats us to stars, pulsars, nebulae and galaxies, objects as 
close as 21/2 or as distant as 150 million light years away.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nearly all of the dozen sites we view have been familiar territory to 
astronomers for more than 200 years, since the French astronomer 
Charles Messier (1730-1817) first cataloged 68 celestial objects, 
including our neighboring galaxy, Andromeda. Still, the experience is 
awe-inspiring, putting daily obsessions into perspective. For a while 
at least, public policy, the culture wars, the federal deficit and 
politics fade.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But not for long. As I look through the telescope, I wonder whether as 
a nation we will continue to explore this vast universe. Even as our 
knowledge increases at almost exponential rates, it seems our national 
desire and will to learn more are on the wane. NASA's budget is $ 14 
billion this year but will drop to a projected $ 11 billion by 2000.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The 1990s have seen dramatic swings in our space commitments. The 
decade was ushered in with great fanfare in 1991 with the announcement 
of Project Columbus, a $ 100 million joint venture between NASA and a 
private astronomy institute to search for intelligent life in the 
universe. One year later, the Senate canceled funding with derisive 
comments about little green men.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Indeed, funding for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, or 
SETI as it is known, has been fickle throughout the history of the 
program. Since 1960, SETI has involved some 50 separate programs, 
initially with federal backing but more recently privately funded.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This year, interest is up again with the discovery in January by 
astronomers Paul Butler and Geoffrey Marcy of the first two planets 
outside our solar system. Announced earlier this year, NASA's new 
Origins project will build powerful new telescopes over the next 30 
years capable of actually seeing planets such as those discovered by 
Butler and Marcy. They could only infer the planets' existence from 
complex measurements of light emissions of the stars 47 Ursae and 70 
Virginis, around which the planets orbit.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At least that's NASA's hope, if the project receives full federal 
backing. It's a big if. With so many earthly demands on the federal 
budget, the exploration of our universe sometimes seems a luxury we 
can't afford.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This starry night, from my vantage point in New Mexico's hills, the 
investment is worth it.

<h2>
New Citizens Getting Off Too Easily
</h2>     
     
     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">     
Linda Chavez     
</a>     
<p>BETHESDA, Md. -- This July Fourth, 1.2 million more new citizens will 
be celebrating Independence Day than last year. Naturalization was way 
up in 1995, more than double the 1994 rate and five times the rate 
experienced throughout the 1980s.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As an unabashed admirer of immigrants' initiative and grit, I'd 
normally welcome this surge in new citizenship. But unfortunately, 
politics -- not patriotism -- may explain this sudden spurt in 
naturalization. The Clinton administration has been quietly moving to 
water down citizenship requirements in ways that could ultimately 
damage the Americanization process.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unlike many nations that jealously guard access to citizenship, the 
United States makes it relatively easy. Permanent residents must wait 
five years before they apply for naturalization. By law, they must 
demonstrate they can speak, read and write simple words and phrases in 
English and that they know basics about American history and 
government. They must also be law-abiding and of good character.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Though the modest commitments are hardly onerous, the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service is considering exempting whole classes of 
immigrants from them. Among the proposals the INS is reportedly 
weighing is one to exempt immigrants who've completed high school in 
the U.S. from being tested on American history and government or from 
having to demonstrate knowledge of English.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unfortunately, a high school degree today is no guarantee that a 
student knows much U.S. history or government. It isn't even an 
assurance that a student knows English. Foreign-born high school 
students in New York, for example, can take state graduation exams in 
their native language if they entered American public school after 
eighth grade. And many public school systems across the country seem 
more concerned about preserving immigrants' native language and 
culture than about helping them learn English or American history.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What's behind the administration's efforts to weaken naturalization 
requirements? Some critics suspect politics. Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., 
has pointedly asked INS Commissioner Doris Meissner whether the 
administration is trying to increase the number of potential 
Democratic voters before the November presidential election.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But partisan politics isn't the most serious concern. The real threat 
is weakening national identity. As John J. Miller points out in a 
recent article in Policy Review, "Naturalization is the only legal 
instrument that allows the United States -- a 'nation of immigrants' -
- to decide who is an American and who is not. Without it, the 
cohesive United States resembles the fractured United Nations."
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Founding Fathers understood the potential for mischief if 
citizenship were obtained too easily, Miller notes. Alexander Hamilton 
urged that immigrants be drawn gradually into American civil society 
"to enable aliens to get rid of foreign and acquire American 
attachments." Indeed, the oath of citizenship pledges the naturalized 
citizen to "renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any 
foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty" and to "support and 
defend the Constitution and the laws o
f the United States of America."
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Miller suggests what's needed now is a modern-day Americanization 
Movement. During the last great wave of immigration, from 1900 to 
1924, both public schools and private philanthropic organizations, 
such as Jane Addams' famous settlement houses, helped acculturate 
millions.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This commitment is sorely lacking today. Immigrant advocacy groups 
focus almost exclusively on immigrant rights, with little attention to 
immigrant responsibilities. If America is to continue to be an 
immigrant nation, there must be a covenant between America and its 
newcomers. Learning the national language and the nation's history and 
form of government are the least we should require from those who wish 
to become Americans.

FBI Files: Look What I Found in Mine

Linda Chavez     
</a>     
<p>
BETHESDA, Md. -- Wonder what all the fuss over the Clinton White House 
requisitioning FBI files on former Republican officials is about? As 
someone who has seen my own FBI file, I can tell you there's plenty of 
cause for alarm. FBI files contain not only private and sometimes 
embarrassing information, but also some things that are downright 
false.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1983, President Reagan appointed me staff director of the U.S. 
Commission on Civil Rights, a post that required what's called a full-
field investigation in preparation for Senate confirmation. The 
investigation took many weeks to complete and included interviews with 
my employers, colleagues, friends, neighbors, schoolmates and 
virtually anyone else who might have known me over the years. Most of 
the information the FBI obtained was innocuous and accurate. But not 
everything.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Years later, when I obtained my file through a Freedom of Information 
request, I was surprised to learn the document contained not only an 
occasional unflattering description but also outright misinformation 
about me and my family. In one case, a former neighbor said she 
couldn't say whether I might be a national security risk, an answer 
bound to provoke greater scrutiny. The FBI had no way of knowing I had 
reported this woman for leaving her young child locked out of the 
house alone and unfed until 1 a.m., which no doubt accounted for her 
opinion of my trustworthiness.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In another interview, a former supervisor claimed to have fired me 
from a Democratic National Committee (DNC) job I held in my early 20s. 
Being fired from the DNC could be considered a badge of honor for a 
Republican nominee, but the charge was untrue. My supervisor, a 
political rival, may have wanted to fire me, but she actually left her 
job slightly before I quit mine.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The most outrageous material in my file, however, had nothing to do 
with me.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although the name itself was blacked out to protect the person's 
identity, one series of entries contained information that appeared 
from their context to be about my father. I nearly fainted when I read 
the entry, which referred to an arrest for a violent crime. Then I 
noticed the date of arrest was after my father's death, and shock 
turned into anger. Derogatory information about someone who happened 
to share my father's name found its way into my FBI file, violating 
that person's privacy and besmirching my father's reputation.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As far as I know, my file was not among those the Clinton White House 
requested. Nonetheless, I'm outraged to learn that friends, colleagues 
and at least one person who worked for me in the Reagan White House 
are among those whose files were obtained.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Clinton operatives -- no one yet knows exactly how many - procured and 
read at least 408 Republican appointees' files. How many of these 
files had egregious errors in them? How many more had malicious 
gossip? How many simply contained embarrassing private
 information that should remain secret? And what did these Clinton 
appointees do with that information?
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
President Clinton has dismissed this incredible invasion of privacy as 
a "bureaucratic snafu" and has declined to punish the known 
perpetrators. Craig Livingstone, the former director of White House 
security under whose direction the FBI files were obtained, remains on 
the White House payroll. Anthony Marceca, whom Livingstone recruited 
to read the files, is on paid leave from the Pentagon. Marceca may be 
protected from immediate firing by civil service laws -- but 
Livingstone, a presidential appointee, is not. Even Democrats have 
asked Clinton to fire Livingstone, but the president refuses.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Such total arrogance of power should give Americans pause.

BETHESDA, Md. -- Want proof we've abandoned all pretense of a civil 
society? Forget name-calling politicians and rancorous talk radio -- 
take a look inside sports arenas and in the city streets after 
championship games. It's not just boorish megalomaniacs like Bulls 
forward Dennis Rodman turning games into a Roman spectacle. Some fans 
are worse. Chicago police and the National Guard are bracing for 
widespread lawlessness during the Bulls' victory celebration.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And the crowd can be a real factor in the final score. Bulls star 
Michael Jordan acknowledged as much. "We wanted to come out and take 
their crowd out of the game," Jordan told reporters, describing his 
team's aggressive start in Sunday night's game with the Seattle 
Supersonics. By racking up a big lead early, the Bulls hoped to 
depress the Seattle fans' notorious fervor.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Not content to cheer their team to victory, fans everywhere shout 
insults, throw things and do their best to distract opposing players. 
During the Sonics' own victory game over the Utah Jazz for the Western 
Conference Finals, Seattle spectators showed just how nasty they could 
be. With seconds left and the Jazz down by three points, power forward 
Karl Malone endured a deafening countdown before he took his foul 
shots. Between the verbal taunts and the sea of undulating white 
balloons, Malone -- who makes 70% of his free throws -- missed both, 
ending any chance for a Jazz win.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Those annoying white balloons wielded by fans are deployed to throw 
off a player's aim in the free throw. The balloons wiggle like maggots 
behind the basket. But some fans have gotten even more creative. 
Boosters at Florida Panther hockey games throw rubber rats on the ice 
after their team scores a goal. Detroit Red Wings fans throw 
octopuses. The ice is beginning to look like a bouillabaisse of 
rubbery critters.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sometimes the action is more than offensive -- it's downright 
dangerous. Last year, fans pelted the field at Dodger Stadium with so 
many baseballs that the game had to be halted, and the Dodgers 
forfeited a game they were winning.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There was a time when sportsmanship was synonymous with gentlemanly 
behavior. Being called "unsportsmanlike" used to be a real insult, and 
unsportsmanlike conduct actually carried penalties on the field and 
off.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
My most vivid memory of a high school game is not of some last-second 
victory but of Sister Jean Patrice, my high school principal, down on 
the basketball court scolding those of us in the stands for booing our 
opponents. "Another outburst like that and we'll forfeit the game," 
she warned -- no idle threat. She was an enthusiastic team supporter 
and a tough competitor, but she believed winning wasn't everything.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In today's billion-dollar sports business, winning is the only thing. 
If players act like freaks or worse on the court or off, no one seems 
to care. Least of all those in the stands whose own behavior emulates 
their idols'. Fans are supposed to boost the morale of the players, 
not become sideline guerrillas.
<BR>

<title>Devine: Get Political, GOP -- 5/8/96 - ACU

<h2> 
Get Political, GOP
</h2> 

<a href="/townhall/columnists/devine.html"> 
Donald Devine
</a> 

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Democratic threats have thrown Republicans into a panic. A
plan to add an amendment increasing the minimum wage from $4.25 to
$5.15, has now derailed a second major bill in the Senate. Fifteen
moderate Republicans promptly followed and introduced their own
even higher minimum wage increase bill in the House, leading the
GOP leadership to predict 40 eventual disaffections from their
ranks and passage of a minimum wage bill this year. So far have
things deteriorated in the bastion of the 1994 revolution that the
House will pass a New Deal law that Bill Clinton was afraid even to
introduce before the Republican took control of Congress.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What Happened? A cynic might note that the news of the AFL-CIO
ad campaign supporting a minimum wage increase broke just before
the Democrats hit the floor of the Senate with their plan. The fact
that big labor was willing to spend $35 million above its normal
$42 million to target vulnerable Republicans got the attention of
Republicans in districts with high union membership and among the
vulnerable, especially the freshmen. This is about politics, not
economics.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Of course, every economist knows that minimum wage laws cost
jobs. It is not necessary to repeat the facts because they are not
at issue. As reported here by Bruce Bartlett, as recently as
January 14, 1987, the New York Times ran an editorial headed, "The
Right Minimum Wage: $0.00."  Two years later they still were
correctly saying minimum wages help middle income families because
most people who get the increase are second or third income
earners, not the poor, and because employers hire fewer low wage
workers when their wage costs go up. Somehow, in a Democratic
Administration, the Times decided it was fine to increase the
minimum wage; but that does not repeal the law of supply and
demand. Fewer jobs will exist at an artificially higher wage, even
if it is only a small number--and even economists with President
Clinton know it.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On "This Week With David Brinkley" columnist George Will asked
Clinton Labor Secretary Robert Reich why, if an increase in the
minimum to $5.15 was good, why not raise it to $10? Reich admitted
$10 would have a "negative effect" but $5.15 would have only a
"negligible effect on jobs." A "negligible effect" is an effect. It
is critical to note that even the minimum wage's number one
supporter admits a higher minimum wage will cost some people their
jobs. Only he does not care. Too bad for them. It's only
politics.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Why cannot the Republicans learn to play politics? It has been
the constant, sad refrain of this space for a year of bungled
activity, trying to rule from Congress when the President holds the
veto. It is not too late to begin learning. The Democrats are
clearly playing politics on the minimum wage legislation. The
Republicans should accept the challenge and offer an amendment to
increase the minimum wage to $100 per hour. If increasing rates by
law works, why be pikers? Ten dollars is too little. Increase it to
100 an hour and make everyone rich. Get on record supporting a
minimum higher than the Democrats would approve.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If that is too high, how about $66.66 an hour. That would make
all Americans as rich as Congressmen. But that brings up a sore
subject, so $100 is better. At that rate, all workers would be at
a high enough income to be under President Clinton's surtax. That
is the right message. It would also be possible to balance the
Budget if everyone could earn that rate. Of course, they will not
because supply and demand work. But that is the point the GOP
should want to make. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I am serious. All Republicans should vote to support "a real
increase in the minimum wage" and let the President and the
Democrats sort it all out (or clean it up in a conference committee
after the point is made). Politics must be played by two or it just
is not fair, nor even interesting. There is nothing wrong with
playing politics in government, certainly not when the other side
is having all of the fun.

<h2> 
Real  Campaign Reform
</h2> 

<a href="/townhall/columnists/devine.html"> 
Donald Devine
</a> 

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Common Cause has spent a quarter-century of campaign reform  
zeal on the passion that money is evil; and the job of reform is to  
chase its specter out of politics. Yet, the fruit of their reform  
fetish has been ever greater dominance of campaigns by  
millionaires, business sharpies and union bosses, and ever less  
public confidence in the political process. Still, their only  
answer is, more laws to wipe out filthy lucre.  
  <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Finally, someone is saying stop. Curtis Gans of the Committee  
for the Study of the American Electorate has organized 30  
organizations from across the ideological and political spectrum  
under the "unifying principle" that the "approaches that have been  
pushed by Common Cause and Public Citizen are wrong." Finally. From  
the American Conservative Union to the National Women's Political  
Caucus, the AFL-CIO to the National Association of Business  
Political Action Committees, the other side is stirring. Although  
ACU and former liberal senator Gene McCarthy did fight the original  
court test, the field has generally been conceded since the "get  
money out" school prevailed in the Supreme Court.  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
A Republican Congressional "reformer" welcomed the debate by  
calling the response "a deceitful campaign to protect their raw  
power and personal profit, garnered in a corrupt system of money."  
The unions and business are hardly altruistic but the inclusion of  
think tanks suggests name-calling will not be enough. The counter  
argument begins with the unfortunate fact that everything costs  
money and, without it, there can be no free speech or right to  
association. The only other goo-goo idea is to have the government  
fund the whole process. Yet--partially as a result of reform--the  
people simply do not trust government to do it.  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Because the whole idea of reform was to eliminate the  
corrupting effects of filthy lucre, the Supreme Court reasonably  
ruled that one could not corrupt oneself--so it is an  
unconstitutional limit of speech to limit what a candidate can  
spend on his own election. Voila, we have Ross Perot, Steve Forbes,  
the rise of the multi-millionaire Senate, and even the Michael  
Huffingtons buying House seats with their small change in the  
millions. The one certainty in the uncertain future of Common Cause  
political "reform," is more Richy Rich candidates. After the yacht,  
the airplane, the football club and the young spouse, what else is  
there to do?  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
All the $1,000 individual contribution limit has done is  
replace the sometimes-altruistic, big contributor Henry Salvatori's  
and Stuart Mott's with the always-investing sharpies who bundle  
$1,000 contributions into large batches. As the value of a thousand  
declines from inflation, the number of payers needed multiplies.  
Today, the only people who can round-up big sums are those with  
wide contacts among likeminded self-interested fellow seekers of  
influence. All of the onerous reporting only hides who is the real  
influence peddler among the scores and more of thousand dollar  
givers. Meanwhile, the Congressman is constantly on the phone  
"dialing for dollars" to call the larger number of contributors now  
needed, leaving little time for average citizens or simple  
reflection on issues or even reading about issues.  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
It took great courage for Speaker Newt Gingrich to question  
the central Common Cause assumption by arguing that we do not spend  
enough on politics--we actually spend less debating than on soap  
advertising. Senator Mitch McConnell and Congressman John Doolittle  
have spoken out too. The fact is, if all money comes from the  
government bureaucrats who run it, the lawyers who write the laws,  
the media who sensationalize it and the sharpies who hustle it, the  
people will be frozen out. Not everyone can participate equally,  
but there must be some citizen participation. In the real world,  
that means relying upon the political parties and citizen groups  
that allow people indirect participation and influence.  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
David Broder is correct that the Ralph Nader-Common Cause plan  
to limit so-called soft money for party-building and volunteer  
activities would further erode the role of parties to represent  
citizens and control interests. But Broder does not go far enough.  
If political parties are the only means for effective influence,  
they will multiply. In a free society, groups always multiply.  
Either political action groups will proliferate or parties will. As  
political action committees become more hedged by law, it is no  
coincidence that Ross Perot organizes a third party.  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Real reform would: (1) eliminate limits on contributions to  
citizen-ideological political action committees (PACs) and extend  
the third-class mailing rates now granted to political parties to  
them, so they can compete in representing citizens within a two-  
party system; (2) end individual or corporate limits on  
contributions to a political party as a limit upon free speech; (3)  
continue the current $5,000 limit on contributions to candidates by  
corporate or union PACs, so they do not dominate the field; (4)  
void the $25,000 yearly total and $1,000 per candidate contribution  
limit for individuals, to allow a Steve Forbes to contribute to a  
Jack Kemp rather than force the rich to run themselves, placing  
others on a more equal footing with the Richys; (5) continue record  
keeping and reporting requirements but, to save average people from  
paperwork, only require reporting of significant amounts; (6), if  
one cannot corrupt oneself, immediately remove all limits and  
restrictions for contributions by spouses, parents, children, and  
first degree blood relatives and in-laws of candidates; (7) index  
for inflation any dollar limits; and, (9) increase the penalty for  
failing to source any unidentified campaign communication (such as  
in so-called push polls defaming opposing candidates).  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
It may be pie-in-the-sky to wish for real reform with  
demagogues like Perot and Nader exploiting public anxiety; but it  
should not be an impossible case to make. If Mr. Perot gets rid of  
all other money, he will be the only person who can compete for  
President.

<title>Devine: The Right's Confused by the Left is Dead -- 5/7/96

<h2> 
The Right's Confused But the Left is Dead
</h2> 
<a href="/townhall/columnists/devine.html"> 
Donald Devine
</a> 

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While the media are busting with pleasure that Pat Buchanan is
sundering conservatism, the leading intellectual of the left is
forced to publish a book on progressives titled, "They Only Look
Dead." In fact, he proves they are moribund. Still, a book by the
man who invented the New Democrat and called forth Bill Clinton
obviously is an expert on levitation.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
E.J. Dionne, Jr. of the Washington Post follows his award-
winning <i>Why Americans Hate Politics</i> by shedding his earlier cover
of ideological neutrality to brag that he is a progressive
dedicated to its restoration as the ruling philosophy in the United
States. In the earlier volume, Dionne granted that liberalism had
failed and that conservatives were the ones providing answers.
Traditionalists had answers on value questions and libertarians had
them on economic ones. He even recognized the "fusionist" attempt
to harmonize both, although he ultimately said the contradictions
between the two wings would lead to failure. He proposed a vaguely-
defined New Democrat alternative to liberalism that would fill the
void, and Bill Clinton appeared to claim its mantle.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
With the disappearance of the New Democrat, the world has
changed for Dionne. Now he calls the conservative formula that
places liberty as the highest value in the political sphere and
virtue as the highest in the social realm, "ingenious"--making one
wonder whether he understood conservatism as well as it seemed in
the earlier book. In any case, he ignores it and invents a New
Conservatism this time. Both "new's" are misleading. We now
discover that a New Democrat really is an old progressive, both
from Bill Clinton's performance--with constant cheering from Dionne
in the Post--and from the author's present forthrightness. New
Conservatism is more mischievous. It is a caricature. Since the
thesis of his book is that the new progressivism will arise from
opposition to the New Conservatism, it would seem to follow that
the later cannot rise from what does not exist.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Given Newt Gingrich's present standing in the polls, it should
not surprise that New Conservatism is identified with him. But this
is not a Gingrichism that the Speaker would recognize. It "harks
back not to Ronald Reagan but to the Gilded Age of the 1890's." It
is created by collecting some ideas Gingrich does have about the
future and the communications revolution and transforming them to
his entire philosophy. New Conservatism simply means "accelerating
the economic transition" and embracing the dog-eats-dog social
Darwinism of William Graham Sumner and the Gilded Age.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Not only is this an outrageous simplification but it borders
on the dishonest. This is most easily seen in the author's
treatment of Marvin Olasky. He is pictured both as part of the
"ingenious" (but failed) new fusionism and as part of the Gilded
Age because he says 1890's volunteer charity should be the model
for modern reform. Now reflect on that for a moment. A man who
advocates more reliance upon private charity is deemed a social
Darwinist, a philosophy that disapproves of social work because it
helps the less fit to survive--quite a slight-of-hand!
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Dionne even has the gaul to resurrect old Robert McCloskey's
xenophobic simplification of the period as objective proof. He
admits that Gingrich does "bow" to traditional values, institutions
and to Olasky but shrugs it off. He will not make the obvious
conclusion that Gingrich is following the traditional formula, if
in somewhat idiosyncratic terms. Rather, Dionne needs a strawman to
demonstrate that where there is a Gilded Age, there must follow a
Progressive one. After all, that is how it all progressed once
before. So has historical determinism degenerated for the modern
liberal.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The contortion of progressivism is just as bizarre. After
doting on John Dewey, Woodrow Wilson, Herbert Croly and the rest of
the progressive pantheon, he does admit that "Progressivism's
critics have identified critical flaws in Progressive thought that
have haunted the liberal project through to the Great Society and
the present day," especially the problem that its elitist-experts
manipulate central bureaucracies rather than trust ordinary people.
The solution to Dionne is a more reasonable progressive power that
will be more sensitive to the needs of private organizations. Yet,
of his seventeen proposals, only one is not straight old-time
centralized government bureaucracy. Two of Dionne's major proposals
are a national health system and improved pensions. He ignores that
the existing national health programs of Medicare and Medicaid and
the Social Security pension programs are at the center of the
crisis even he must admit now is facing liberalism. After all,
these were the ultimate progressive creations and now they are in
absolute bankruptcy.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Dionne admits that conservatives have been correct to
emphasize private mediating institutions like family, church and
associations as superior to expert bureaucrats for many social
tasks. But he still requires that the experts must direct them.
Besides, he says, they do not operate under the "logic" of the
market. But it is Dionne who identifies the market with social
Darwinism, not understanding that the real logic of both business
and private welfare institutions is freedom to operate without too
many restrictions from experts wielding government power.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
No, the only way to give the private, voluntary organizations
vitality is to get the centralized bureaucracy's experts off their
backs. Send the programs back to the states and the people, which
is the real new and old conservative program. Dionne cannot
resurrect progressivism on these grounds. He contrasts a strawman
conservatism to what progressivism would be if everything worked
perfectly, as if there were no fruits of its ideals. But the show
is over as the progressive programs fall one-by-one, recognized
bankruptcies one and all. Conservatism may have its Buchanan schism
but, if Dionne is the best and the brightest, progressivism not
"only looks dead;" it is.<p><br><p>

<p>
Pete du Pont has served as a state legislator, U.S. Congressman, Governor, and in l988 was a 
Republican candidate for President of the United States.  He writes a weekly column and is a featured 
columnist for CEO Magazine.  He hosts a weekly television program entitled FocusPoint for National 
Empowerment Television (NET) and various broadcast stations.
<p>
	Pete du Pont chairs the Strategic Advisory Committee, which advises Speaker Newt Gingrich on 
key strategic issues, and was appointed to the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform, 
known as the Kemp Commission.  du Pont is currently Policy Chairman of the National Center for 
Policy Analysis and Chairman of the National Review Institute, public policy analysis organizations 
promoting free enterprise and conservative governmental policies.   He has served as Chairman of the 
Hudson Institute and was the founder of GOPAC, the Republican political action committee.
<p>
	Pete du Pont began his political career in l968 with his election to the Delaware General 
Assembly.  In l970, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served for six years.
<p>
	In l976, Pete du Pont won the race for Delaware Governor against the Democratic incumbent 
and was re-elected in l980 to a second term, winning a record 7l% of the vote.  During his tenure as

retirement income, poverty, defense and our relationship with the Soviet Union -- earned him a reputation 
as a man with a long-range vision and the courage to speak the truth about tomorrow.
<p>
	Columnist George Will said about du Pont's l988 campaign:<p>  "du Pont has the highest 
substance-to-blather ratio among candidates, even on subjects as sensitive as agriculture policy and Social 
Security."
<p>
	Upon his withdrawal from the 1988 race, Scripps Howard News Service noted, "More than any 
rival in either party, du Pont had the courage to tell specific interest groups what they least wanted to hear.
<p>
	Rush Limbaugh recently stated Pete du Pont...[is one of the] people who have paved the way 
for me to succeed.<p>

For the past year, the Republicans have been a fractious lot.  The 
Gingrich conservatives have argued with the liberal Senate 
Republicans.  The presidential primaries were nasty.  Abortion is an 
issue that splits the party into warring factions on a weekly basis.<p>

So it is none too soon that Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole 
has centered his campaign on an issue nearly all Republicans can agree 
on - tax cuts.<p>

Given the continuing debate between the party's supply-siders and 
deficit hawks, that may seem a strange statement.  But who better to 
preside over a tax-cutting administration than Bob Dole, the deficit 
hawk?  <p>

Supply-siders can be pleased with the prospect of new economic growth 
stimulated by the Dole tax cuts.  The deficit hawks can be pleased 
because Dole's own credentials offer them assurance that he will give 
equal attention to curbing government spending.  <p>

And the entire Republican party - supply-siders and deficit hawks 
alike - can stand on a plan for running government in the years ahead 
that combines the two most important elements of a stronger economy, 
lower taxes and the reduced growth of government spending.<p>

Both of those elements are also vital to another Republican goal:  a 
balanced budget by the year 2002.<p>

The Dole plan includes a 15% across-the-board personal income tax rate 
cut over three years, halving the capital gains tax rate, repealing 
the 1993 Social Security benefits tax increase, expanding the 
availability of Individual Retirement Accounts and giving families a 
$500 per child tax credit.  Altogether the cuts are projected to 
reduce government tax revenue by $548 billion over six years.<p>

Tax cuts are more than simply politically popular.  Dole doesn't have 
to be a supply-sider to be aware of what scholarly studies conclude 
and recent history confirms - that the right kinds of tax cuts 
stimulate economic growth.  The longest periods of sustained economic 
growth in the United States have followed tax cuts.  After the Kennedy 
tax cuts in the 1960s, the economy grew by 42% over seven years.  
After the Reagan cuts of the 1980s, the economy grew by 33% over seven 
years.<p>

Economist Gerald Scully, a Senior Fellow at the National Center for 
Policy Analysis who has done extensive analysis of taxes, has 
concluded that maximum economic growth occurs when government at all 
levels takes between 21.5% and 22.9 % of the nation's output of goods 
and services in taxes.  Currently, the federal government alone takes 
20.5 % - and the Congressional Budget Office expects the economy to 
grow by only 2.2% this year.  Real gross domestic product grew only 
1.3 % last year.<p>

President Clinton may see that kind of economy as "the soundest it's 
been in a generation," but it is not growing rapidly enough to provide 
Americans with economic opportunity.  <p>

Dole projects that the stimulation of enacting his tax cuts will push 
annual  economic growth to 3.5%, generating millions of jobs, a 
lasting expansion and more opportunities.  But the Dole proposal needs 
only a third of that increase to succeed.<p>

Clinton officials will likely jump on the bandwagon, arguing that they 
will now enact the middle class tax cut they promised four years ago.  
But for the moment, they are pushing the familiar theme of economic 
class-warfare.  Those who pay the most taxes will benefit the most 
from the tax cuts, they say.  True, of course, but that argument may 
not resonate so well with taxpayers who conclude that everybody is 
getting a fair share of the reductions.  Dole will touch some 
responsive chords with the theme he sounded last weekend when he said, 
"I was thinking of the husband and wife who both work, who have little 
money to save for their children's education after they pay their 
bills."<p>

Maybe Dole decided on tax cuts simply as a political tactic.  If so, 
this is one time when good politics is also good policy.  And a 
President Dole would be unlikely to lose sight for a moment of his 
goal of a balanced budget by 2002.  Given the tax cuts, this deficit 
hawk would of necessity have to go after government spending with a 
zeal that hasn't been seen in the White House since ... well, ever.<p>

The Information Warriors
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis</i><p>
<P>
The American Enterprise Institute, the Cato Institute, the Heritage 
Foundation, the Brookings Institution, the Urban Institute, and the 
National Center for Policy Analysis.  Who are they?  Some of America's 
"think tanks."  What are they?  In the battle of public policy ideas, 
they are the information warriors, and they are changing the way 
America thinks.
<P>
In times past legislators often relied on academics and industry-
supported researchers to supply them with information and answers 
about some of the leading public policy questions.  But increasingly 
both liberal and conservative legislators are turning to private, non-
profit research institutes, commonly known as think tanks, for the 
information they need to carry on the public policy debates.
<P>
Most of the public policy debates in Congress and in the state 
legislatures begin as ideas about what the "good society" should be 
like.  For example, should the government ensure that everyone has a 
right to health care, free education, and a good job?  Or should we be 
a society of limited government?  Should the government, through its 
economic policies, try to create an egalitarian society?  Or should it 
be indifferent as to who the winners and losers are, and just ensure 
that everyone plays by the rules?
<P>
The founders of most think tanks had some vision of that good society 
when they formed their organizations, and that vision usually pervades 
the institutes' policy recommendations.  So the analyses they produce 
have been well thought through.
<P>
As a result, the ideas behind public policy proposals and the debate 
over the social or economic impact of those proposals are increasingly 
being fought between these new centers of influence.
<P>
For example, the Clinton health care plan.  The legislative defeat of 
the Clinton health care plan came in September and October of 1994, 
but the ideological battle was fought for the two preceding years 
between liberal think tanks that supported the plan and free-market 
think tanks that opposed socializing the American health care system. 
<P>
On this issue, the free-market think tanks won a clear and decisive 
victory.  But for the longest time, they were the only troops in the 
field.  The media were absolutely convinced that some version of the 
Clinton plan would pass, and even some conservative Republicans 
thought they saw the handwriting on the wall.  National organizations 
such as the American Medical Association and the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce, which should have vehemently opposed the plan, cozied up to 
the administration in order to get a "seat at the table."
<P>
By contrast, the National Center for Policy Analysis (with which I am 
associated), the Cato Institute, the Heritage Foundation, and several 
other research institutes immediately raised questions about the plan 
and began to provide in-depth analysis of the economic problems that 
would arise if the Clinton plan were implemented.  Those educational 
efforts laid the groundwork for the American people's utter rejection 
of the Clinton plan.
<P>
Currently, Medical Savings Accounts are the most controversial  health 
care  issue before Congress.  MSAs are tax-free personal savings 
accounts used to pay for small and routine medical care, while a 
catastrophic health care policy pays for major expenses.  
<P>
While the battle rages today, the idea is not new.  As far back as 
1984, the National Center for Policy Analysis was promoting a 
variation of this idea, which was eventually endorsed by a number of 
think tanks across the country and passed into law by nearly 20 
states.  
<P>
In addition, the educational efforts about MSAs has resulted in 
perhaps 2,000 businesses adopting some version of an MSA plan.  As a 
result, a whole new market for health insurance has arisen, spurring 
the industry, especially the small-and medium-size insurance 
companies, to consider innovative ways to meet the demand. 
<P>
But these battles were small compared to what is coming.  Both 
liberal- and conservative-oriented think tanks are gearing up for two 
of the biggest public policy battles yet - privatizing Social Security 
before it becomes insolvent and reforming the income tax system to 
make it fairer, less complex, and more conducive to economic growth.
<P>
Both battles will make the past debates look mild by comparison.  It 
may be years before we are able to reform either system, but the 
debate is beginning now as the think tanks prepare their arguments.
<P>
In the '60s and '70s, the liberal think tanks were winning the public 
policy battles.  In the '80s and '90s, the conservative institutes 
have had the upper hand.
<P>
Now, more than ever, think tanks matter.  They are influencing our 
economy and our society as they develop the ideas behind the policies 
<P>
that drive the politics of America.

Good Intentions and Bad Policy
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis</i><p>
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
No matter what your sixth grade teacher or My Weekly Reader said, 
America is not running out of space to put its garbage, recycling is 
not always good, and the world is not running out of resources.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The well-financed cultural mantra that recycling is both desirable and 
environmentally necessary has nearly become as much a truth beyond 
critical examination as that murder is wrong and that the earth is 
round.  Our schools have been full of it.  Mothers didn't even want 
juice boxes in school lunches because of fears that they couldn't be 
recycled.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Still, it has become harder over the years to ignore the fact that 
sometimes simply throwing garbage away is more environmentally 
friendly, financially prudent - and safer for human health.  Now comes 
confirmation from an unlikely source - the New York Times Magazine.  
"Recycling is Garbage," writes John Tierney of the Times.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Among other failings of recycling, it is frequently uneconomical. 
Tierney calculates that it costs more than $3,000 to recycle a ton of 
scrap metal, glass and plastic in New York City.  "For that price," he 
writes, "you could find a one-ton collection of those materials at a 
used-car lot - a Toyota Tercel, for instance - and drive home in it."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And, all things considered, you would need to use your ceramic coffee 
cup 1,000 times before it would be less environmentally expensive than 
a throw-away polystyrene cup.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For some materials, recycling is good, and businesses have long known 
this.  For instance, recycling aluminum cans requires 10% less energy 
than making them from virgin materials.   And more than 10 million 
automobile tires are recycled for retreads each year, reducing the 
energy used to produce tires by 30%.  But such success stories are not 
usually transferable to other forms of waste.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Now, it would not matter if the true believers in recycling recycled 
away to their heart's content - except that they have been able all 
too often to make their beliefs public policy.  In 1986, about 10% of 
solid waste was recycled at little cost to consumers or taxpayers.  
Today, with  statutory mandates  in many  communities, about 25% is 
recycled.  But achieving that level has been costly and the programs 
lose money.  Most states  initially  set even  higher  goals, such as  
50%  in  New York  and California,  60% in New Jersey, and 70% in 
Rhode Island - but none achieved them.  Mayor Rudolph Giuliani 
recently declared New York's legislated goals "absurd" and 
"impossible."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At today's prices, curbside recycling programs typically add 15% to 
the cost of waste disposal.  One should remember that every dollar 
spent on inefficient recycling and waste reduction efforts is 
unavailable for other important social programs, including other 
environmental protection efforts.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sometimes the zeal to mandate recycling and the use of recycled 
products has created worse environmental and health hazards than the 
problems they were meant to solve.  For instance, government mandated 
recycling of newsprint requires de-inking - involving the use of 
toxics that create worse disposal problems.   In February, the 
Associated Press reported that a county road in Washington state was 
closed because smoke and fire kept bursting through its surface.  The 
roadway had been built with recycled tires that began to rust as rain 
seeped beneath the road's surface, causing heat, impenetrable clouds 
of steam and eventually fire.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
By anointing recycling as the preferred method of disposal, 
environmentalists ignored technological, geographic, economic, and 
social limits to its usefulness.  In Wyoming, where transportation 
costs are high and land is cheap, it may make less sense to buy and 
use recycled paper than it does in New York.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Legislated mandates for the use and purchase of recycled products have 
wasted taxpayers' money, cost consumers both at the point of purchase 
and by limiting product options, dampened the development of resource-
saving technological innovations, and on occasion harmed the 
environment.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But don't we need to recycle because we're running out of scarce 
resources?  Hardly.  Technology makes it possible to use resources 
without exhausting them, which is why the prices of most natural 
resources, as well as food, have been falling for decades.  One 
example:  A fiberglass cable made with 25 kilograms of sand (about 55 
pounds) can carry 1,000 times as many messages today as a wire made 
with a ton of copper.  So copper prices are down, and its supply in no 
danger of depletion.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And if throwing something away is the best choice, there is room to do 
that, too.  If we keep generating garbage at current rates for 1,000 
years, how big would a landfill 100 yards deep need to be to hold it?  
Just 35 miles square.

<h2>
The Best Campaign Finance Law: Repeal Spending and Contribution Limits
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>[Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis]</i><p>
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Memo to true believers in campaign finance reform:  The only way to 
ensure fairer, freer elections is to get rid of the campaign spending 
laws.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Completely.  Require full disclosure of all contributors, but nothing 
else.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Our present campaign finance laws are ridiculous.  As a case in point, 
Ross Perot, who spent $60 million of his own money running for 
president in 1992, can get $32 million of taxpayers' money for a race 
this year if he'll hold his personal spending to less than $50,000.  
But if Perot's Reform Party picks somebody else to run, that candidate 
may not get any taxpayers' money.  Or maybe he or she will get $32 
million after all.  The Federal Election Commission hasn't decided.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Or look at publisher Steve Forbes.  He can spend a million dollars of 
his own money to run himself, but is not allowed to contribute it to a 
candidate he believes in - like Jack Kemp.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Barbra Streisand or Whoopi Goldberg can make appearances worth tens of 
thousands of dollars to candidates, but a successful CEO cannot give 
the same amount to candidates of his or her choice.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The AFL-CIO can spend $35 million on advertising against incumbent 
Congressmen, but to defend themselves those candidates must raise 
money in $1,000 or $5,000 bites.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Our current campaign laws are a failed idea; complex, ineffective, and 
manipulated by a political bureaucracy called the Federal Elections 
Commission.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The reforms currently being touted include banning political action 
committees (PACs), restricting "bundling" (where individuals have one 
person deliver their contribution checks on behalf of a group), 
requiring Senatorial candidates to raise 60% of their funds inside 
their state, and outlawing "soft money."  Proponents recognize that 
banning PACs almost certainly is unconstitutional, so there's a 
fallback provision limiting their contribution to a candidate to 
$1,000.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The goal of all these proposals is to limit the influence of people 
and groups with money on the electoral process.  It might work if 
campaigns were conducted in a vacuum.  But they aren't.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Limiting the size of contributions works to the benefit of incumbents, 
or organization or party candidates, who already have in place the 
database and the organization for mass solicitation.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
As Bradley A. Smith wrote in the January issue of the Yale Law 
Journal, "Reform proposals inherently favor certain political elites, 
support the status quo, and discourage grassroots political activity.  
Even if these proposals worked as intended, they would have an 
undemocratic effect on American elections."  To put it differently, 
campaign spending laws protect incumbents and special interests.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Besides, there really is no evidence that small contributions from 
large numbers lead to more representative government with less 
corruption, or that the numbers of small donors are an indication of 
the sentiment of the general electorate.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Eugene McCarthy would have found it difficult at best to conduct his 
antiwar campaign in 1968 without the six-figure individual 
contributions from backers Jack Dreyfus Jr. and Stewart Mott.  The two 
presidential candidates who have been most successful at raising money 
from small contributors were Barry Goldwater in 1964 and George 
McGovern in 1972.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Abolishing PACs may win cheers from reformers, but Francis Wilkinson, 
communications director for Democrat Geraldine Ferraro's unsuccessful 
Senate campaign, noted in a New York Times op-ed article "the impact 
on the 28,000 nurses who contribute an average of $46 a year to the 
American Nurses Association PAC to have a voice on issues like health 
care. ...For them, a PAC affords a convenient avenue of participation 
and a chance to exercise power they could not wield as individuals."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Campaign finance restrictions are a relatively recent development in 
American politics.  Is it coincidental that their growth parallels a 
decline in public confidence in government?  Maybe not, but certainly 
the campaign finance laws haven't done anything to raise confidence.  
And there is no evidence that we are better off because of them.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Instead of trying to fix campaign spending limitations, let's get rid 
of them.  Let people know how much money a candidate has received and 
who the big contributors are, and let them make up their  own minds 
about whether the candidate should get their vote.  One thing for 
sure, that approach would be an improvement over what we have now.

The Chicken Littles who had the last word on the International Panel 
on Climate Change tell us that the sky is falling again.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The panel of scientists comprising the IPCC recently reported on the 
state of, and potential outlook for, earth's climate.  Doubts, 
disagreements and contradictory data can be found in the body of the 
report.  But the group who wrote the executive summary, the only part 
that will be widely read, pretty flatly assert that humans are causing 
global warming.

Based on the executive summary and the policy options presented in it, 
environmentalists say the world's governments must take drastic action 
now to halt the cataclysmic consequences of such a change.  Analysts 
at the World Watch Institute, for example, call for an overhaul of our 
energy and transportation systems, ending the fossil fuel economy.  
Such policies would cost our nation billions of dollars.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Before we head for cover, let's consider whether the sky really is 
falling, or whether some Chicken Littles in the ranks of scientists 
have been led down the garden path by a figurative acorn, in the form 
of computer climate model data, falling on their heads.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Proponents of the theory of global warming, or, as is now fashionable, 
"global climate change," depend on two bits of evidence and computer 
models.  First,  ground-level measurements of global mean temperature 
indicate that earth has warmed between 0.3 and 0.6 degrees Celsius in 
the last century.  Second, atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), a primary 
greenhouse gas (those gases without which most animal and plant life 
would not exist), has increased by approximately 25 percent in the 
last century and a half.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When you put these facts in the computer models, global climate change 
theory says that the earth's current warming is due to the increase of 
CO2 in the atmosphere, caused primarily by the use of fossil fuel.  
According to the models, absent a severe and immediate reduction in 
the level of CO2 put into the atmosphere, the earth will warm further, 
causing all manner of calamities from melting polar ice caps which 
would raise ocean levels, flooding small islands and coastal regions, 
to increased hurricane activity and severe droughts, which would cause 
massive crop failure.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The IPCC report's executive summary predicts that if no further action 
is taken to curb greenhouse gas emissions, we can expect an increase 
in temperature somewhere  between 0.8 and 3.5 degrees Celsius over 
the next 100 years.  Interestingly, this figure is well below the amount 
of warming forecast just four years ago.  In fact, with every new report, 
the range of warming falls.  At this pace, in a few years scientific 
doomsayers will be talking about the next ice age again.  (We haven't 
forgotten that that was this same group's doom and gloom scenario in 
the 1970s.)
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Even if the current figure is correct, the increase is well within the 
natural range of known temperature variation over the last 15,000 
years.  Most of the earth's plant life evolved in a much warmer, CO2-
filled atmosphere.  In fact, the predicted warming would affect 
primarily night-time temperatures, lessening the number of frosty 
nights and extending the growing season.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
However, there is little evidence that increased CO2 has had more than 
a small part to play in this century's temperature increase.  Most of 
the warming occurred before the 1940s, before the widespread use of 
automobiles.  In fact, from 1938 to the present, we have actually 
experienced a cooling trend.  Indeed, satellite data, the most 
reliable climate evidence that we have, show no evidence of warming.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So why do scientists agree that we must take drastic action now?  
Well, they don't.  Some scientists are proclaiming impending disaster, 
but others of at least equal repute say the evidence of global warming 
is questionable at best.  So this is not a question of proven science 
versus a bunch of know-nothings.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And why do they agree, as the executive summary says, that we should 
take drastic action now to curb fossil fuel use, limit economic growth 
in established countries, and condemn less-developed countries to 
continue in their less-developed circumstances, and increase 
unemployment and misery all around?  They don't agree with that 
either. Even some of climate change theory's foremost scientific 
advocates acknowledge that there is nothing we can do now to prevent 
global climate change that we won't be able to do 10 years from now.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A far better course of action is to keep studying, keep learning, and 
keep improving our data until we understand what, if anything, is 
really happening.  Then we can take action that will allow economic 
growth and a higher standard of living and keep our planet livable.  
Both must be accomplished together; we must not sacrifice one to 
achieve the other.

</i>
<h2>
Cut Taxes, Help the Economy, Win the Presidency
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>[Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis]</i><p>
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
As Ronald Reagan reminded us, ideas have consequences.  And sometimes 
very quickly.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Barely a month ago, on April 29th, Bruce Bartlett, formerly at the 
Treasury Department and now a Senior Fellow with the National Center 
for Policy Analysis,  put forth a simple idea:  cut personal income 
taxes 15% across the board.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Why a 15% cut?  Because that would bring the government's share of the 
nation's gross domestic product back to about what it was in 1992, 
before President Clinton took office.  In Bartlett's words, "In the 
first three years of the Clinton administration, Americans have paid 
$151.1 billion more in taxes than if federal receipts had remained at 
their 1992 level as a share of gross domestic product."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Bartlett had the inspiration after he saw recent Commerce Department 
figures that showed that more than one out of every three dollars 
produced by the American economy last year went to government.  At the 
federal, state and local levels combined, government consumed 31.3% of 
all national output - the largest share of GDP ever taken by 
government.  Even in 1945, with the country fighting and paying for 
World War II, total taxes only amounted to 30% of GDP.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Bartlett calculated that since Bill Clinton took office, personal 
income taxes have increased 1.6 times faster than the country's 
economic growth, as measured by GDP, and corporate taxes have 
increased 3.5 times faster.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Three weeks later, on May 20th, Bartlett could report that Bob Dole, 
soon to be the Republican nominee for president, was giving his idea 
serious consideration.  Dole has been a deficit hawk during his 
career, but history, politics and economic theory are all on the side 
of a tax cut - and that may be enough to sway him.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
There is historical justification for a tax cut now.  The increasing 
government share of output caused by bracket creep during the high 
inflation 1970s led to the Reagan tax cut.  For that matter, the high 
percentage of state output that was being taken by taxes in California 
was what prompted Proposition 13 in California in 1978 and the 
beginning of a nationwide revolt against state and local tax levels.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Political justification?   Well, there's the Reagan proposal in 1980 
for a 30% across-the-board reduction that helped him beat Jimmy 
Carter.   More recently, Christie Whitman came from behind to win 
election as governor of New Jersey in 1993 after she too pledged a 30% 
tax cut.  Further, that 15% figure represents a repeal of President 
Clinton's tax increases, so it should have some symbolic importance to 
Dole and the Republican Party.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
The magic of a tax cut pledge is that it gives a campaign a focal 
point.  (After 1988, it's pretty safe to say that just pledging "no 
new taxes" is not going to be a vote-getter.)  For Republicans, whose 
agenda is less regulation, smaller government, and increased personal 
responsibility, a tax reduction proposal provides philosophical 
underpinning for all their policies.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Perhaps the most compelling justification, however, is economics.  
Because personal and corporate income taxes are graduated - the more 
money one makes, the higher tax percentage one pays - the tax burden 
increases as the economy grows.  To hold it steady as a percentage of 
the national economy requires periodic tax cuts.  Further, reducing 
marginal tax rates provides an incentive to earn more money, freeing 
up more dollars for saving and investment and stimulating economic 
growth.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
"But," as the liberals (and moderate Republicans) are fond of saying, 
"what about the deficit?"  That argument was dealt a body blow  by 
Democrat Felix Rohatyn in the April 11th Wall Street Journal:  After 
listing our most serious economic and social problems, Rohatyn wrote:  
"Even though all of these require different approaches, the single 
most important requirement to deal with all of them is the wealth and 
revenues generated by a higher rate of economic growth.  John Kennedy 
was right:  A rising tide lifts all boats.  Although it may not lift 
all of them at the same time and at the same rate, without more growth 
we are simply redistributing the same pie." 
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
So how can Dole, as a deficit hawk, rationalize a tax cut? A 
successful fiscal policy must include two vital elements.  Slowing the 
growth of government spending is one.  But encouraging economic growth 
is a higher priority, for it also creates jobs and increases take home 
pay, as well as reducing the deficit through greater tax receipts. 
There aren't many problems that a 15% tax cut can cause that a 3.5% 
economic growth rate can't solve if you keep a handle on spending.  
Ideas do have consequences.  And Bob Dole's election could be the 
consequence of a proposal to cut taxes 15% across-the-board.

<html> <head> <title> du Pont: Whatever Happened to Environmental Policy Reform? -- 5/29/96 </title> </head>  <body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">  <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>  <i>  Wednesday, May 29, 1996

<h2>
Whatever Happened to Environmental Policy Reform?
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>[Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis]</i><p>
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
The new Republican Congress roared into Washington and set out to 
change the rules of environmental policy.  Environmental reforms were 
going to be based on risk assessment, cost-benefit analysis, less 
business regulation and smaller environmental agencies.  Congress was 
going to prune back the oppressive bureaucracy and get the government 
off our backs.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Two years later, what has happened?  Not much.  The budgets of the 
Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department are little 
changed from previous years.  The EPA's 1996 budget is only 1.5% less 
than its 1995 budget.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
The flawed Endangered Species Act continues in force unchanged even 
though authorization for it has long since lapsed.  The Safe Drinking 
Water Act, among the least controversial of the nation's environmental 
laws, has not been re-authorized.  Wetlands reforms are still nothing 
but a promise.  Commitments to improve individual property rights 
protections and to give more control over environmental matters to the 
states have largely gone unfulfilled.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Congress has even been unable to reform the one law widely cited by 
both Democrats and Republicans as perhaps the most flawed 
environmental program:  Superfund.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
So why have the reformers failed? First, there was an image problem.  
Republicans focused on the cost to business of environmental 
regulation.  They talked about dollars and cents, efficiency, and 
decreased regulation, thus providing Democrats the opportunity to 
seize the moral high ground.  Defenders of the status quo frightened 
the public by painting reforms as the abandonment of basic 
environmental protection.  Talk about decreased business costs was no 
match for talk about threats to "children's health."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Then there were election year politics. The President and 
Congressional Democrats calculated that it would be better for their 
election prospects to bash Republicans for their lack of compassion 
than to support positive bipartisan environmental reforms.  Democrats 
even refused to vote for environmental policies that they themselves 
had proposed and supported when they controlled the Congress.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Then came the pollsters.  Republican pollsters found that the vast 
majority of voters consider themselves to be environmentalists. They 
also found that even Republican voters trust Democrats more than their 
own party on environmental issues. 
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
But people who vote based on environmental issues generally think 
either that environmental laws need basic reforms that balance human 
needs with environmental protection, or that we must protect the 
environment regardless of the costs.  The former group has largely 
supported reform efforts.  Backing off environmental reforms threatens 
to alienate them.  Voters in the latter group don't trust Republican 
efforts and attempting to gain their support is a losing proposition.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
But the main reason for the failure of Republican environmental reform 
goes much deeper.  It rests on the first rule of successful politics:  
you must present a positive vision for the outcome of your policies. 
While the reformers correctly pointed out the excesses associated with 
current environmental laws, they neither discussed environmentally 
appropriate goals nor provided a blueprint for attaining a better 
environment.  Simply put, they ignored the "vision thing."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
A positive environmental vision for the future is centered upon the 
solution to the tragedy of the Commons.  You remember the tale:  all 
the village cattle graze upon a jointly owned common.  It is in the 
interest of each villager to add more cattle to his herd, since he 
pays no price to use the common. Soon there is no grass left on the 
common, the cattle die, and the village economy fails.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
The solution?  Give each villager an ownership stake in his portion of 
the common and he will graze only so many cattle as it will support.  
The village economy then prospers.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Instead of the government regulating the trout stream, let the trout 
fisherman manage the lands and trout will flourish.  Let nature 
conservancies manage the bird sanctuaries and reap the profits of 
drilling for oil beneath them, and oil and fowl will peacefully co-
exist.  When the government bans the killing of elephants, poachers 
take them and the herds dwindle.  Let the natives own the elephants, 
and hunters are permitted a share, but the herds will grow under the 
watchful eye of people who have a stake in their growth.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Free markets produce more wealth, and free people are the best 
environmental stewards.  Wealthier societies have healthier 
populations and commit more resources to environmental protection than 
do poorer nations.  Freedom of people and markets is not only 
compatible with environmental health, it is essential to it. 
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
What the Republicans forgot is that beating up on regulators - no 
matter how well deserved - is no substitute for an environmental 
vision for the future.

Eastern Europe and the Western Alliance
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>[Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis]</i><p>
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil," Edmund Burke 
observed, "is for good men to do nothing."  While what has happened in 
Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 is hardly evil - 
communism was the evil - the fact is that good men have done very 
little to nourish the seeds of Western values in the freed nations of 
Eastern Europe.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
At a recent gathering of several hundred pro-democracy ministers and 
MPs from western and central European nations in Prague, Czech 
Republic President Vaclev Havel put it more bluntly:  "Six years have 
passed since the fall of the Iron Curtain.  It seems to me that little 
has happened during those six years and time is working against the 
Democrats.  Against those who want peace and peaceful cooperation.  
Unless Democrats proceed with greater vigor to build the European 
order, others will start to do so and we know who the 'others' 
are....The story of the former Yugoslavia should be a clear warning 
for  Europe and for the whole wor as to what can happen if there is 
too much hesitation."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
The Congress of Prague, as the meeting was called, stressed the 
urgency of bringing Eastern European nations into the western 
alliance.  Its mission was "to reunite the family of western 
civilization, and so to ensure its future."  Lest this seem too 
pessimistic, consider that for 50 years, from 1939 to 1989, Central 
Europe was the battleground of our century's epic battle of freedom 
against tyranny.  With the flush of the victory of the west over 
communism, all seemed possible, and the integration of Russia's former 
satellites into the European community and its commerce seemed 
probable.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
But it has not come to pass.  Instead, "Market reforms in the former 
communist countries are being slowed down or reversed.  Post-
communists now govern in all the former satellites except the  Czech 
Republic.  A former communist has replaced Lech Walesa as president of 
Poland.  The communists won 45 percent of the Russian Duma in the 
recent elections.  And Central Europe has seen its membership of both 
NATO and the EU postponed."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
So what to do?  First, the economic base of western Europe must be 
expanded eastward.  The current strategy of European Union (EU) 
advocates - principally the French and Germans - is flawed.  A single, 
common-currency, Brussels-regulated European monolith, hard to join 
and with limited economic growth potential once admitted (the EU 
annual growth targets are the same anemic 2.5% as the U.S. Federal 
Reserve's), offers less hope for the future than a tariff-free trading 
group with harmonized procedures.  All the former European Soviet 
satellites should quickly become a part of such a group.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Second, NATO must be expanded eastward as well.  The Czech Republic 
and Hungary should be admitted now; Poland and the Baltic nations 
should follow.  The Russians, of course, are opposed, and have been 
saber-rattling against it ("Moscow plans pact with Belorussia if NATO 
expands" - May 15, 1996).  But as the London Times editorialized on 
May 14th, "The case for enlargement is one of principle:  that 
independent nations have the right to choose their own foreign and 
defense policies and allies."  Especially independent nations once 
enslaved by the very nation now objecting to their increased freedoms.  
Or in President Havel's words, we cannot allow "someone else [to] 
decide which countries should be allowed to join the Alliance and 
which should not."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Third, the United States and the newly enlarged memberships of the EU 
must move promptly to increase trade across the Atlantic.  A Trans-
Atlantic Free Trade Agreement (TAFTA) must be put on the agenda of the 
World Trading Organization.  If it does not receive favorable 
attention, the EU and NAFTA should begin direct discussions to further 
liberalize trade agreements.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
For seven years there has been a window of opportunity to bring 
stability to an area of the world that has spawned a century of wars.  
But it is closing rapidly; in fact, there is a chance that it may be  
slammed shut by the June elections in Russia.  The fears of central 
European nations of instability to the East are not groundless.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Lady Thatcher's address to the Congress of Prague provided a practical 
program:  "...to merge the North American Free Trade Area with the 
European community, including the countries of Central and perhaps in 
time Eastern Europe."  And a corresponding vision:  "We in the West 
won a great victory  the Cold War.  Let us not now forget why we 
fought.  The mission of this Congress is to recapture that sense of 
purpose and clothe it with practical action."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
There is an opportunity to bring the victims of this century the 
opportunities of the next one.  It must be seized before it slips 
away.

</i>  <h2>  Unfunded Mandates:<br>
 Congress Is Targeting Business Instead of Governments 
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>[Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis]</i><p>
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Congress has made it illegal for the federal government to impose 
unfunded mandates - requirements to take certain actions or provide 
certain services without providing the federal funds to pay for those 
mandates - on state and local governments.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Unfunded mandates have been a real burden in the past, forcing state 
and local governments to spend millions and even billions of dollars 
while members of Congress took the political credit for good deeds.  
For example, Columbus, Ohio, complained in 1991 that Congress was 
forcing it to spend $62 million to fulfill environmental mandates.  
The National Association of Towns and Townships estimated that 
unfunded federal mandates cost local taxpayers about $6.5 billion in 
fiscal year 1993.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The new Republican Congress with great fanfare put a stop to it.  Or 
so it claimed.  But the fact is that Congress hasn't really repented 
of its past sins, it has just changed its focus - from local 
governments to private businesses.  Congress' new mandate addiction 
can best be seen with regard to the issue of health care reform.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; People without health insurance sometimes develop a medical condition 
and then have difficulty finding an insurer to provide health 
coverage.  Although this is a relatively small problem for the U.S. 
health care system - surveys show that less than 1 percent of the 
population has been denied health insurance because of an preexisting 
medical condition - it is nevertheless real.  And its solution - 
Congressional mandates to help the poor and the ill - has irresistible 
political appeal.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; But Congress does not have the money to solve the problem of the 
uninsurable, and under its new rule against unfunded mandates, it 
cannot tell the states to handle it.   So it has decided, through the 
Kassebaum-Kennedy Health Insurance Reform Act,  to tell health 
insurance companies - primarily those that write health insurance 
policies for individuals - that they must accept and pay the costs of 
medical care for the uninsurable.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; While everyone agrees this bill will increase the cost of health 
insurance - the difference of opinion is only how much - Congress is 
not required to provide the funds to businesses.  It just tells health 
insurers what to do, takes the credit for solving the problem of the 
uninsurable, and passes the costs of the unfunded mandate on to 
business, and ultimately consumers.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A second example concerns mental health.  Health insurance companies 
often treat mental health problems differently than they do physical 
health care problems, primarily because mental health science is much 
more complex and less understood than physical health science, and 
mental health illnesses less specific.  It can also be much more 
difficult to tell when a patient is "cured" of a mental health problem 
than of a physical ailment.  A broken limb can be seen to mend.  
Mental uneasiness has no obvious limits and can linger indefinitely.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As a result, insurers have been reluctant to give mental health care 
the blank check it has provided for traditional health care and 
insurance coverage for mental health services is much more limited.  
Some in Congress would like to solve that problem by telling insurers 
that their policies must cover mental health care needs to the same 
extent their  policies  cover other medical conditions. 
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Once again, Congress praises itself for its compassion and passes the 
unfunded mandate - the costs along with the economic chaos  - on to 
private-sector businesses.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Unfortunately, health insurance isn't the only place Congress is 
considering imposing unfunded mandates on business.  Consider the 
recent struggle over increasing the minimum wage.  Congress wants to 
raise the cost of labor to both state and local governments and 
private employers, requiring them to pay the cost.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; This is a perfect example of members of Congress appealing to the 
American public, explaining how concerned and compassionate they are 
about the plight of the low-income employee, and how Congress is going 
to solve the problem by raising their wages.  What they don't make so 
clear is that they intend to require business to pay for their 
compassion.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Worse, the 23 Republican Congressmen pressing the Republican 
leadership to increase the minimum wage all voted for the unfunded 
mandates prohibition.  Most of them even voted against an amendment 
exempting the minimum wage from the unfunded mandate prohibition.  So 
much for candor in government. 
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Perhaps what we need is a Contract With America II, with a provision 
that would protect private companies from unfunded mandates the way 
the first Contract protected state and local governments.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Simply put, if Congress isn't willing to pay for something, it ought 
not require someone else to buy it.

<h2>   
The Popcorn Follies   
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/
dupont
.html">
Pete du Pont 
</a>
<p>
Popcorn is not a trivial matter.  I am reminded of that at the movies 
where buttered buckets of the stuff are consumed and the surplus 
spread on the floor under my seat. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
But I did not realize the popcorn problem is so severe that a deficit-
bedeviled federal government must shoulder yet another burden to 
protect its citizens.  On April 4th, when President Clinton signed the 
"Freedom to Farm Act," it became the legal responsibility of our 
national government "to ensure the benefits of popcorn are available 
to the people of the United States" by "strengthen[ing] the position 
of the popcorn industry in the marketplace."  Awesome. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
And all this in a bill heralded as a revolutionary step towards the 
deregulation of agriculture, the ending of farm subsidies, and "the 
most sweeping change in agricultural policy in the last 60 years." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
A more appropriate title for this bill might be "The Slightly More 
Flexible Reform Act."  Its reforms are more illusory than real, and 
less permanent than might be expected.  And popcorn is the least of 
its follies. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
What changes under the new farm law?  Most notably, for the first time 
there will be a cap on farm spending.  The law replaces traditional 
subsidy payments with a fixed but declining level of transition 
payments to farmers ($36 billion over seven years).  It also ends 
federal authority to hold farm land out of production.  However, at 
the end of seven years, unless Congress acts, the old farm policies 
(subsidy payments and land set-asides) automatically come back into 
effect. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
What of the so-called "freedom" under the reform bill?  The act was 
promoted as allowing farmers the freedom to plant whatever crop was 
most likely to produce the highest profit.  This would seem to mean 
that, if world market prices for wheat were low but prices for 
tomatoes were high, then wheat farmers might switch to producing 
tomatoes.  Not so.  A farmer now growing subsidized crops can only 
switch to another subsidized crop - essentially other grains, cotton 
or rice. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
What doesn't change under the new farm bill?  A lot.  American 
consumers will continue to pay higher prices than the rest of the 
world's citizens for sugar, peanuts, and most dairy products, because 
these crops will continue to get subsidies amounting to more then $2 
billion a year.  Soybean subsidies will actually increase.  Americans 
will also continue to foot the bill for the Market Promotion Program, 
which helps promote U.S. agricultural products overseas - including, 
henceforth, popcorn.  Landowners don't get those regulatory exemptions 
promised for temporary wetlands under one acre in size.  Farmers and 
ranchers will continue to have to bear the entire financial burden of 
the general public's desire for no net loss of mud puddles. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
The farm bill is also surprising because of the new bureaucracies that 
it creates.  There's a new "National Natural Resources Conservation 
Foundation" to promote the conservation of natural resources on 
private lands, in part through education grants to nonprofit 
organizations.  The nation's top 10 environmental organizations 
already receive more than $500 million a year in grants and donations, 
so they are more than capable of promoting their viewpoint without any 
help from taxpayers. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
Also, a new food safety panel is created, adding one more layer of 
bureaucracy to the Department of Agriculture.  Both consumer groups 
and members of the meat and poultry industries have criticized this 
program.  Following tried and true Washington logic, if neither 
industry nor consumers like a program, it must be good. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
These new programs might surprise people who thought the Republican 
promises to "get government off the backs of people" and presidential 
statements that the "era of big government is over" would mean a 
reduction in the number of federal programs and bureaucracies, not the 
creation of new ones. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
The most perverse part of the new farm bill calls for spending $300 
million to acquire about 100,000 acres of the Florida Everglades.  
Protecting the Everglades may be in the public interest, but the 
simplest way of conserving the Everglades would be to end the sugar 
subsidy that allows inefficient sugar producers to continue to operate 
in the fragile Everglades ecosystem.  Then we could save the money and 
the Everglades.  But sugar subsidies do not seem to be a part of the 
era of big government that President Clinton assures us is over. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
Like the monsters in Hollywood movies, big government just keeps 
coming back.  So on Saturday night, enjoy "Braveheart's" anguished cry 
for freedom, knowing that Washington now has its hand in your bag of 
popcorn.   
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
Or if that strikes you as sensible, turn to Section 551 of the Freedom 
to Farm Act.  It creates the "National Kiwifruit Research, Promotion, 
and Consumer Information Act."

 <i>September 3, 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2>Brown v. Board of Ed, Pt. I </h2><p>

<i>We're told that the era of big government is over, but what about the era of judicial activism? When will that end?</i><p>



Constitutional law expert Richard Morgan predicts that the era of judicial activism is almost over -- and that, when the end comes, it will come rapidly. He likens this imminent, swift demise of an outworn orthodoxy to the sudden fall of the Soviet empire. "Just as political and social institutions that appear as durable as the mountains can collapse almost overnight," Morgan explains, "so, too, seemingly impregnable intellectual orthodoxies can suddenly stand revealed as so flawed that we're abashed at having accepted them for so long." Writing in the Summer issue of the Manhattan Institute's City Journal, the Bowdoin College professor contends that "America is on the edge of such a collapse of orthodoxy in our thinking about the proper role of judges and judge-made law in our governmental process. Central to this change," he says, "is the demythologizing of the Supreme Court's 1954 desegregation decision, Brown v. Board of Education."<p>

Before we can lay judicial activism to rest, we must first acknowledge the flawed nature of the Brown decision. "The collapse of Brown as a model for judicial behavior will resonate through many of the most contentious areas of American public policy," says Morgan, "from criminal justice and affirmative action to education and welfare reform: for Brown is the mother of contemporary judicial activism -- policy making by judges acting essentially as legislators, without any real justification from such ordinary legal authorities as statutory and constitutional texts, history, and precedent." Morgan charges that the Supreme Court decision that "overruled the people of Colorado in May with respect to homosexual rights, without any serious attempt to offer a constitutional reason for doing so, is only the latest example of the Brown style of judging."<p>

Morgan notes that "arguments undermining the authority of Brown as a model for judging have long been piling up. Right from the beginning, some of the country's most distinguished constitutional lawyers criticized Brown -and especially Chief Justice Earl Warren's opinion, which relied on essentially sociological reasoning to brush aside 70 years of precedent and settled understanding as to the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment." The Chief Justice relied "neither on text, nor history, nor precedent," says Morgan, and "was, in effect, claiming for the Court the authority to revise the meaning of the Constitution."<p>

Richard Morgan maintains that the Court "attempted to dismantle segregation (a profoundly important end) by means that were profoundly wrong. Not only did this judicial fiat traduce democracy, substituting the will of the judges for decision by the people and their representatives; it disregarded fundamental constitutional forms (federalism, separation of powers, and the procedures for amending the Constitution prescribed by Article V)." The Brown decision "launched the modern era of judicial 'reform,' in which purportedly noble ends can justify even the most constitutionally suspect means." It's time, says Morgan, to admit the error in Brown.<p>

<title>Duplantier: NAFTA & Narcotics  -- 9/02/96</title>

 <i>September 2, 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2> NAFTA & Narcotics </h2><p>

<i>"The impact of NAFTA on the sale and distribution of narcotics within the U.S. was felt immediately. In the very first month after the treaty took effect in January l 994, there was a sharp rise in marijuana, cocaine, and crack in the streets and schoolyards of our towns and cities. "</i><p>

Former Mexican president Carlos Salinas "joined Bill Clinton in bulldozing NAFTA through," recalls William Gill of the American Coalition for Competitive Trade. NAFTA made perfect sense to Salinas, who with his family was "deeply involved in the drug trade and other criminal activities. Salinas is now hiding in exile," reports Gill; "his brother, Raul Salinas, is in prison, and Raul's wife was arrested in Switzerland for attempting to withdraw some of their laundered money from a Swiss bank." In addition, "several of Mexico's most prominent businessmen were linked to the Salinas family's crime ring."<p>

Gill charges that "the lucrative narcotics industry" has corrupted public officials south -- and north -- of the border. "Three former high U.S. Justice Department lawyers were indicted last year for helping the Cali drug cartel ship literally tons of cocaine into our country, most of it via Mexico," he reports. High officials in both the U.S. Customs Service and the Immigration and Naturalization Service were "allegedly involved in drug and immigrant smuggling from Mexico." Drug trafficking generates an estimated "$30 billion in income for our neighbors to the south," says Gill. "Drug money is financing all kinds of businesses in Mexico and, no doubt, in the United States as well."<p>

The crime explosion NAFTA caused in Mexico is spilling over into the U.S. "Last year, there were 1000 slayings in the larger cities on the Mexican side of the border, most of them drug-related and unsolved," says Gill. "No one could possibly know how many murders in the United States are caused by the NAFTA-spurred increase in the drug trade. But they are bound to be in the hundreds, if not thousands, by now. Indeed, there is deep and growing interaction between the drug gangs in Los Angeles and other American cities and the drug lords and gangs in Mexico and Central America."<p>

Gill argues that "free trade is the primary driving force behind the crime wave that is sweeping the globe." Calling this crime wave "a crisis that threatens the very foundations of all civilization," he predicts that "the chaos emanating from Mexico now will sweep in stronger from China tomorrow. Already we are getting a foretaste of what Communist China and others in the East have in store for the U.S.A.," says Gill. "In May, Customs officers seized 2000 AK-47 assault rifles in California." Chinese agents had sought to sell these weapons to L.A. street gangs.<p>

"China is also exporting thousands of illegal aliens to this country," Williarn Gill reports. "Many come into Central American mini-states and are smuggled into the U.S. via Mexico." Gill warns that "the invasion from China could easily surpass the present 1 million or so Mexican illegals entering each year."<p>

<title>Duplantier: Special Ed: Kids go in, Don't come out -- 8/28/96</title>

<h2> SPECIAL ED: KIDS GO IN, DON'T COME OUT</h2><p>                           


     The budget for special education in New York City schools exceeds
     $2 billion, for just 135,000 students!<p>

     There's a lesson to be learned when "a school system that has
     made a fetish out of testing, counting, and record-keeping
     ignores the most important tests and statistics of them all: the
     ordinary measures of whether children are learning anything." So
     observes Kay Hymowitz in a distressing article entitled "Special
     Ed: Kids Go In, But They Don't Come Out," in the Summer issue of
     the Manhattan Institute's City Journal. "Two-thirds of special-ed
     students officially exiting in 1995," she observes, "dropped out
     instead of graduating."<p>

     Hymowitz reports that "only 5 percent of special-ed kids are ever
     'decertified' into general education." In other words, from the
     perspective of the students, the program is a colossal failure.
     It has, however, created enormous opportunity for the bureaucrats
     and attorneys responsible for complying with "a mammoth federal
     mandate and a 17-year-old consent decree." It has succeeded in
     "providing employment for members of the United Federation of
     Teachers." It has given poor parents an incentive for having
     their children misdiagnosed in order to obtain Supplemental
     Security Income. It has furnished a way for conniving
     middle-class parents to provide their children with "a private
     education at public expense." It's also proven to be a boon for
     those private agencies that "evaluate potential special-ed
     preschool students, and then, in 75 to 80 percent of cases . . .
     refer them to their own schools."<p>

     Hymowitz argues that "both the federal law and the apparatus
     dedicated to its enforcement rest on a largely worthless
     scientific model. The federal law asserts that such great
     progress in 'diagnostic and instructional procedures and methods'
     has taken place that, given enough money, all handicapped
     children can be educated effectively. Like a team of doctors,
     experts are supposed to 'diagnose' a child's malady and then
     recommend the proper course of treatment." Hymowitz reports that
     "the criteria for referrals and placement in New York City
     schools were far from uniform." There is no telling how many
     students have been misclassified. "A child might be called
     learning disabled in one school, emotionally disturbed in
     another, or not be referred at all in a third."<p>

     Hymowitz reports that learning-disabled, or L.D., kids "are
     overwhelmingly minority, poor achievers, and often behaviorally
     disruptive. Many have moved and changed schools often; many are
     chronically late for school. All this suggests chaotic home lives
     that clash with the ordered processes of learning," says
     Hymowitz. "Though both state and federal law clearly specify that
     the category 'learning disabled' should 'not include children who
     have learning problems which are primarily the result of . . .
     environmental, cultural, or economic disadvantage,' those are
     precisely the children who are included."<p>

     Kay Hymowitz concedes that "we must do something for these
     children," but insists that special education "does almost no
     noticeable good for perhaps half the pupils it serves . . . and
     is forbidden by law to include them in the first place."<p>

<title>Duplantier: FDA is Stifling Medical Innovation -- 8/27/96</title>

<h2> FDA IS STIFLING MEDICAL INNOVATION</h2><p>                    





     Society offers numerous safeguards against unsafe medical
     devices, including: consumer awareness, free competition, private
     testing laboratories, and tort law.<P>

     "Today, in what used to be the Land of the Free, someone with an
     idea for a new medical device that might help alleviate a human
     health problem can't just test the device and market it (and
     accept responsibility for any adverse effects)," observes Dr.
     Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of American
     Physicians and Surgeons. "First the people with the idea have to
     invest tens of millions of dollars . . . in government paperwork.
     Then they have to submit their idea to a Czar. A few years later
     their dream may lie in ruins because of the Czar's arbitrary
     decision. If they complain, the Czar might also impound other
     products they happen to have on the market."<p>

     Why isn't there more of a public outcry over this tragic abuse of
     government power? "The people who might benefit from the proposed
     new device will never hear about it," explains Dr. Orient. "The
     public might learn about an FDA error in approving something, but
     it's almost always safe for a bureaucrat to disapprove
     something."?<p>

     Writing in a recent issue of Priorities, a publication of the
     American Council on Science and Health, Dr. Orient notes that
     "devices subjected to this maddening approval system could save
     lives . . . or could mitigate serious disability." Nevertheless,
     the FDA denies access to them "for months, for years, or
     forever." There were roughly 5,000 such devices waiting to be
     approved in 1994, and there's no telling how many ideas were
     never even submitted "because their inventors were deterred,
     perhaps for lack of money, from even trying for approval. Often
     inventors just take their ideas abroad," says Dr. Orient. "The
     American lead in medicine," she concludes from this ominous
     trend, "may soon be a distant memory."<p>

     The FDA was originally established "to assure that drugs were
     properly labeled and not adulterated," recalls Dr. Orient. "Then
     its role expanded into proving the safety, and then the efficacy,
     of drugs. Now the FDA is into medical devices. Soon it will be
     dictating the practice of medicine."<p>

     The U.S. Constitution, needless to say, makes no provision for
     the FDA. "As with most of the ever-expanding powers of the
     federal leviathan, the pretext lies in the constitutionally
     mandated power of Congress to 'regulate commerce,'" observes Dr.
     Jane Orient. "This is surely not what the Founders had in mind.
     They thought of government as a necessary evil, a system needed
     to restrain evildoers; they definitely did not envision
     government as a do-gooder." Well-intentioned or not, governmental
     intervention has inevitable consequences. "As the power of
     government agencies grows, other protections wither or are choked
     off," Dr. Orient explains. "Consumers don't bother to think for
     themselves; they just trust the government to look out for them."<p><br>

<h2> TREATY THREATENS AMERICAN SECURITY</h2><p>                    

                  




     Why would anyone object to the banning of chemical weapons? Good
     question! Here's the answer.<p>

     The United States Senate is scheduled to vote soon on
     ratification of a treaty called the Chemical Weapons Convention.
     This Treaty purports to ban the production and stockpiling of
     chemical weapons, which would seem to be a laudable goal. A good
     case can be made, however, that the Treaty will not achieve its
     expressed objective and that certain unintended effects could
     undermine our nation's security and threaten the personal liberty
     of American citizens. Analyst Baker Spring of the Heritage
     Foundation charges that the Treaty "contains serious
     shortcomings. It is neither reliably verifiable nor enforceable.
     But the potential damage," says Spring, "is not limited merely to
     national security. It also will impose a costly regulatory burden
     on American businesses and thus harm America's economy."<p>

     The Treaty would require American businesses to "prove to the
     U.S. government and international inspectors that they are not
     producing or stockpiling chemical weapons," Spring explains.
     "Failure to comply with these regulations could result in
     companies being fined as much as $50,000 per incident." But
     following the rules isn't cheap either. Complying with the terms
     of the Treaty could cost American businesses as much as $200
     million a year, says Spring. That doesn't include "potential
     indirect costs to businesses, such as those stemming from the
     loss of confidential information." Spring stresses that the
     Treaty would apply not just to chemical companies, but to almost
     any business that uses chemicals, including "food processors,
     brewers, distillers, pharmaceutical companies, paint companies,
     petroleum companies, and rubber companies."<p>

     "If the Chemical Weapons Convention served the national security
     interests of the U.S., it would be reasonable to ask American
     businesses to assume some portion of the burden imposed by the
     inspection regime," concedes Baker Spring. "But to ask American
     businesses to assume the excessive cost burden imposed by
     implementing a treaty that actually harms U.S. national security
     makes neither economic nor security sense."<p>

     Frank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy agrees that the
     Chemical Weapons Convention will "seriously damage United States
     national security interests and impose a massive, new regulatory
     burden upon thousands of U.S. businesses." The Treaty, he says,
     "will do nothing to reduce the arsenals of terrorist countries
     and other nations hostile to the United States." Several such
     countries "have neither signed nor ratified" the treaty, observes
     Gaffney, citing Libya, Syria, Iraq, and North Korea as examples.
     China has not yet ratified the Treaty; nor has Russia, "the
     country with the largest chemical weapons arsenal in the world."<p>

     Gaffney also consider the Treaty unverifiable. He worries that it
     "will forbid United States commanders from using tear gas and
     other riot-control agents to protect our soldiers in the field
     and minimize civilian casualties." And he argues that it "will
     create yet another international bureaucracy costing millions of
     U.S. taxpayer dollars every year to impose costly new regulatory
     burdens on thousands of U.S. companies."<p>

 <i>August 16, 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2>SCHOOL ABUSE</h2><p> 

[On March 19th of this year, 59 sixth-grade girls at a middle school in  
East Stroudsberg, Pennsylvania were subjected to gynecological exams  
against their will and without the permission of their parents.]<p> 
 
"This whole unsavory incident provides us with one more reason why  
parents ought not to put their children in public schools, and another  
reason why the government ought to be kicked out of the education  
business," concludes education expert Samuel Blumenfeld in the June  
issue of his Blumenfeld Education Letter. "This is probably the worst  
case of public educators violating the privacy rights of students and  
parents that we have seen to date."<p> 
 
Blumenfeld warns that "the totalitarians among the education  
establishment are becoming bolder and bolder in their assertion that they  
own the children." Heretofore, it was "unheard of in this country for  
perfectly healthy individuals to be forcibly herded into a nurse's room,  
and told to strip and lie down on a table for an examination." Blurnenfeld  
associates such practices with Nazi Germany. "During World War II,  
when the Jews were rounded up and sent to concentration camps," he  
recalls, "the first thing their captors forced them to do was strip. The  
purpose of the stripping was to deprive these captives of any notion of  
privacy or personal dignity. The stripping meant that they were now the  
property of their captors, who could do anything they wanted to them."<p> 
 
Blumenfeld argues that the 59 grade-school girls in East Stroudsberg  
were similarly dehumanized. "The psychological damage done to these  
girls by the government of Pennsylvania cannot be undone," he contends.  
"They shall have to live with the traumatic consequences for the rest of  
their lives." Some good may come of the incident, however, if parents  
learn "that the educators cannot be trusted and that they will continue to  
deceive the public. The cavalier manner in which the school authorities  
say that parents were supposedly 'informed' of the planned exam, and the  
fact that the school cannot provide any evidence that such prior  
notification was indeed given, is an example of the contempt that school  
authorities now have for parents," says Blumenfeld. "It's as if they were  
telling them, 'We own your kids and we don't need your approval for  
anything we want to do with them."'<p> 
 
Blumenfeld argues that "this trend toward totalitarian enslavement will  
continue until such time as the American people put a stop to it. They can  
do so tomorrow by simply withdrawing their children from the  
government's national socialist schools and educating them at home or in  
private schools they can trust." He warns that public school officials now  
"feel so confident of their power to impose their will" on schoolchildren  
that they think they no longer have to obtain parental permission for  
anything. Samuel Blumenfeld urges all Americans to assert their parental  
rights before they lose their children entirely to the totalitarian state.<p>

<title>Duplantier:  FREON -- 08/15/96</title>

 <i>August 15, 1996</i><p>

<h2>FREON</h2><p>
 
[Twenty million American drivers will pay four times as much for air  
conditioning repairs this summer, and it won't make any difference to the  
ozone layer.]<p> 
 
"Federal law has banned production of Freon, the refrigerant used in  
more than 100 million automotive air-conditioners, in response to  
concerns about depletion of the ozone layer," says Ben Lieberman of the  
Competitive Enterprise Institute in a recent Washington Times  
commentary. "America's first post-phaseout summer is now upon us,"  
notes Lieberman, "and the news for consumers is not good. The price of  
existing Freon stocks is rising, and with it the cost of auto A/C repairs.  
Millions of car owners who will need A/C service are going to get very  
angry, especially when they realize that the excessive costs are both  
unnecessary and unfair."<p> 
 
The wholesale price of Freon was less than a dollar a pound five years  
ago, Lieberman recalls. Nowadays, that same pound of refreshing Freon  
costs upwards of $20. That's wholesale, too. The retail price is roughly  
double, and you'll probably need three pounds to fill your car's A/C.  
"Nearly all pre-1994 vehicles use Freon," Lieberman observes. "In  
addition to higher Freon costs, EPA regulations on the handling of  
refrigerants are time-consuming and require expensive equipment, adding  
to labor costs. In total, the bill for a typical automobile A/C repair has  
gone up by $100 or more."<p> 
 
Ironically, none of this extra cost or effort will have any real impact on  
the ozone layer. Most scientists have concluded that "ozone depletion is  
not nearly as serious nor immediate a threat as once predicted," observes  
Lieberman. "In fact, virtually every scary sounding prediction about the  
consequences of ozone depletion . . . has been qualified or abandoned by  
scientists." According to Lieberman, "The abrupt phaseout does not make  
sense. A few more years of limited Freon production to meet the needs of  
the existing fleet of Freon-using vehicles would have made little  
difference to the ozone layer, but a big difference to consumers."<p> 
 
Banning an efficient coolant may be a mania in America, but very few  
foreign countries are suffering from Freon phobia. "Although more than  
100 nations have signed an international treaty banning the production of  
Freon and other compounds," observes Lieberman, "developing nations  
have been given a 10-year extension, and few other developed countries  
are taking the phaseout as seriously as the United States. For example,  
illegal Freon is readily available throughout much of Europe, at a fraction  
of the U.S. price. Further, most countries have nothing like our  
Environmental Protection Agency's costly Freon-handling regulations."<p> 
 
But facts won't phase the phaseout. "Rather than trying to reduce the  
ban's costs, the EPA is loudly denying their existence," says Lieberman.  
"Most car owners have no idea how expensive their next A/C breakdown  
will be -- until it happens," he adds. The Freon phaseout is an  
unnecessary and unfair tax on everyone with a car made before 1994.<p>

<title>Duplantier: Corporate Welfare -- 08/13/96</title>

 <i>August 13, 1996</i><p>

<h2> CORPORATE WELFARE</h2><p>

<i>"Business research and development should be paid for by stockholders, 
not U.S. taxpayers."</i><p>

"When it comes to attacking the federal deficit," says Stephen Moore of 
the Cato Institute, "there is one area of the budget that both parties have 
come to regard as politically untouchable: corporate welfare." Moore 
reports that a recent Cato study "shows that Uncle Sam currently spends 
$75 billion a year on direct subsidies to business. Eliminating those 
subsidies would cut the budget deficit in half," he contends. "If Congress 
were willing to stop the giveaways, the feds would save enough money to 
make up for the complete elimination of the capital gains tax and the 
estate tax. Reducing the deficit or eliminating the anti-growth taxes 
would do far more to benefit American industry and U.S. global 
competitiveness than asking Congress to pick industrial winners and 
losers."<p>

Moore tells us who the lucky "winners" are. "About $10 billion to $15 
billion a year is spent on agriculture subsidies -- not to small family 
farmers, but to large agribusinesses, such as Archer Daniels Midland. The 
federal sugar program provides the owners ofthe 33 largest sugar 
plantations in America more than $1 million each per year and doubles 
the price of sugar to U.S. consumers." Who else is on the gravy train? 
"Another $8 billion to $10 billion a year subsidizes U.S. exporters," says 
Moore, "including such impoverished companies as Boeing, General 
Electric, and Westinghouse." And that's just a sampling.<p>

Moore chides the Congress for failing to make any significant reductions 
in corporate welfare, then takes the executive branch to task. "With few 
exceptions, the administration has shown itself hostile to even the modest 
corporate welfare cutbacks proposed by Congress," he observes. "In fact, 
the administration's 1996 budget actually requested a slight increase in 
spending on business subsidies." Noting that "Republicans made a valiant 
effort to close down the Commerce Department, but the Clinton 
administration allied itself with lobbyists to fend off the budget cutters," 
Moore concludes that "the Clinton administration has proved itself to be 
corporate welfare's best friend."<p>

Moore contends that corporate welfare "corrupts both our free market 
system and our representative form of government. Corporate welfare 
converts the industrialist into a statist businessman, whose market is the 
political arena in DC, not consumers." Corporate welfare also "creates a 
bidding war for preferential treatment among businesses and industries," 
a process not conducive to high ethical standards among lawmakers. 
Corporate welfare appears to be counterproductive no matter how you 
look at it. "There is no evidence that business subsidies and industrial 
policy programs are at all successful in creating jobs or wealth," says 
Moore. "Even if they did, those benefits would almost never offset the 
efficiency loss from large tax burdens imposed on workers and 
businesses to fund the programs."<p>

Successful businesses do not require the financial assistance of American 
taxpayers. One of these days we're going to have to dismantle the welfare 
system, and we might as well start with the least needy.<p>

<h2>
Trade Revolution 1996
</h2>

<i>"Most Americans are still living and laboring under the illusion of 
freedom. But more and more of us know that our freedom has been sold 
out from under us by a totally corrupt government. "</i>
<P>
"America is frittering away the last shreds of its once inviolable and 
cherished sovereignty," says William Gill of the American Coalition for 
Competitive Trade. The mechanisms for ceding our nation's sovereignty 
to a global authority were established in the North American Free Trade 
Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (known as 
NAFTA and GATT) "and a host of subsidiary actions via the UN and 
other international agencies," says Gill. "The list of actual and potential 
infringements -- and worse -- upon U.S. laws and the rights of our 
citizens ," he warns, "is literally endless."
<P>
Gill laments the ease with which a foreign country can "invade the United 
States with its exports and agents, with its products and services -- even 
with its own plants and equipment -- and skim off American capital and 
technology with the help of its American wage slaves." Under the 
circumstances, the United States can no longer "call itself a free and 
independent nation," he concludes. "Any nation that permits foreign 
interests to take over its plants and production, its farmland, and even its 
banks is no longer truly independent. Any nation that sacrifices the jobs 
and livelihood of millions of its citizens in order to absorb billions upon 
billions of dollars in imported goods from Third World countries . . . has 
already surrendered its claim to nationhood. Any nation that has already 
openly acknowledged that its own laws are subject to interpretation -- and 
even cancellation -- by an international tribunal such as the World Trade 
Organization or the United Nations . . . is no longer free."
<P>
Gill points out that our Founding Fathers did not labor under illusions as 
we do today. "In 1776 all Americans knew that King George III and his 
Parliament were the rulers of this country," he observes. "Today we are 
not even permitted to know who the real rulers of the supposedly 
independent USA are, let alone what they are up to in leading us toward 
world government. Along the way toward this goal, they have already 
surrendered our sovereignty in the unholy name of 'free trade.' They have 
also surrendered millions of our best-paying and most secure jobs -no 
less than nine million in the downsizings since 1990." Gill charges that 
our nation's self-destructive trade policy "has been fostered by such 
esoteric groups as the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateralists, and 
the super-secret Bilderbergers."
<P>
If we want to save our country, William Gill advises, we must "stop the 
New World Order now -- before the Bilderbergers and other plotters have 
transferred the last vestiges of our sovereignty and independence to the 
United Nations via its subsidiary World Trade Organization." To protect 
American sovereignty, Gill's group, the American Coalition for 
Competitive Trade, will soon file lawsuits seeking to nullify NAFTA and 
GATT.

August 2, 1996<br><p></i>
<h2>
Good Business
</h2>

<i>The revolutionary ways in which corporations have improved the 
everyday lives of Americans over the past half-century are rarely 
recognized.</i>
<p>
"Most businesses exist to make or sell things, not to engage in political or 
social commentary, act as a philanthropic foundation, or even . . . to 
employ people," observes John Hood of the Heritage Foundation. 
"Focusing solely on the means by which businesses carry out their basic 
mission -- such as their employment practices, their participation in 
community or cultural life, or their waste management -- distracts us 
from the benefits that businesses confer on society." Writing in the 
August issue of Policy Review, Hood explains that businesses benefit 
society by inventing "new products, new services, new ways of doing 
business more efficiently. This they do better than other social 
institutions, such as governments or charities. And the impact of such 
innovations on our society is massive, often far exceeding the benefits of 
governmental or charitable action."
<p>
Why do so many Americans fail to recognize the enormous contribution 
that businesses make to our individual and general welfare? The 
prejudice of the press and the demagoguery of Democrats deserve much 
of the blame. Hood argues that "journalists and politicians thrive on bad 
news. They continue, for example, to decry the inequality of men and 
women in the workplace, and blast American companies for unfair hiring 
and compensation practices." In doing so, says Hood, they consciously or 
unconsciously ignore the fact that "business innovation historically has 
helped liberate American women. Technological advances have 
promoted greater equity in pay by reducing the value of physical strength 
and increasing the value of mental acuity and social skills, which are 
distributed more evenly between men and women. At the same time, 
labor-saving devices in the home have given married women more 
freedom to pursue education and employment."
<p>
Technological advances have also made the workplace safer, for both 
sexes. Hood notes that "automation and computers have improved 
workplace safety far more than has government regulation or union 
activists. Computers allow employers to track accidents carefully and 
devise solutions to systemic problems."
<p>
For reasons of their own, professional agitators "spend a lot of time 
talking about what they perceive to be the wasteful or destructive 
properties of goods and services, while ignoring their value to 
consumers," Hood charges. He cites one of the more telling examples of 
anti-business bias. "Critics of free enterprise denigrate plastic for being 
nonbiodegradable and polluting," he observes. "Yet, plastic is the 
essential ingredient of many of the products and services that make our 
standard of living possible, such as medical devices, telecommunications, 
wastewater treatment, transportation, safe and tasty food, and computers."
<p>
John Hood laments the fact that, "with few exceptions, those who create 
the amenities we enjoy and the innovations that make our lives safer, 
healthier, and happier toil in relative obscurity." He argues that "the real 
heroes of our age are the innovators who raise our standard of living and 
overcome the fundamental problems of humanity."

<h2>
Positives Of Pesticides
</h2>

<i>As usual, the mass media have gotten the story completely backwards. 
Far from threatening our health, the pesticides that control bugs, rodents, 
and plant disease have proven to be a boon to mankind.</i>
<p>
"Pesticides are not scary; they're wonderful. They rank equal to 
pharmaceuticals in saving and extending life. They save the environment, 
they save wildlife, they give the American housewife a roach- and rat-
free home," contends Pat Tigges of the Pacific Northwest Aerial 
Application Education Foundation. Tigges says she is "sick and tired of 
agriculture being on the defensive. We don't have to defend; we should 
be on the offensive," she insists. "Crop production technology has made 
our quality of life the envy of the world."
<p>
Radical environmentalists are winning the propaganda war, however, 
primarily because they've been the only ones waging battle. "The focused 
concerns of a few will take precedence over the unfocused concerns of 
the majority," Tigges warns, unless farmers -- and the American 
consumers whose larders they fill with inexpensive, unspoiled food -- 
fight back. Of particular concern, she says, is "new EPA-recommended 
legislation that would phase out consideration of benefits when 
establishing food-use pesticide tolerances." The net effect would be to 
raise the cost of the food we eat, while lowering its quality.
<p>
"The 'pesticide scare' is not about pesticides," Tigges insists, "it's about 
fear and control." She charges that radical environmentalists "use 
pesticide misinformation to create fear, from which they create a crisis, 
and a crisis generates funds. These funds are not spent saving anything. 
They are spent furthering a political and social agenda. The pseudo-
environmentalist leaders don't want to solve problems. They love 
problems. Problems give them more press, create more fear, and gain 
them credibility and money."
<p>
Fear mongers capitalize on the agricultural ignorance of the average 
American, but that ignorance can be overcome. "We can fight fear in 
children with education," says Tigges. "Children are afraid of the 
unknown. Farm pesticides are an unknown," she observes, "but 
household pesticides are not." Tigges fights fear in children by showing 
them that farm chemicals are similar to "things they touch and use every 
day in their homes. They aren't afraid of mom's shower cleaner; they just 
don't know it's a fungicide. They aren't afraid of pool chlorine; they just 
don't know it's a bactericide."
<p>
It's not just children who are afraid, but their teachers too. That's where 
Pat Tigges and the Pacific Northwest Aerial Application Education 
Foundation come in. "We teach teachers the truth," she explains. "We 
refute all the lies and misinformation that, for the past 30 years, have 
been repeated so often they are taken as truth." The foundation offers 
"continuing education classes, teacher conferences, in-service workshops, 
and structured farm fairs." Tigges and her colleagues come prepared to 
discuss "the history of the environmental movement, man-made vs. 
'natural' biochemistry, organic farming, Alar, and anything else a class 
wants to talk about." They know that minds, like farmland, need to be 
cultivated.

We were 35 minutes ahead of TWA Flight 800 on the runway at John F. Kennedy International Airport.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But for a whim, we would have been on the later plane. A TWA flight to Rome, departing within minutes of ours, was cancelled. The Rome passengers were put aboard TWA Flight 800, to make connections in Paris. We were not aboard TWA because, at the last minute, our travel agent found a bargain on Delta.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Close friends and family knew of our destination, but few knew whether we were flying with Delta or TWA. When we arrived in Todi, our hostess had been up most of the night, fielding calls from our friends in America -- wanting to know what she knew.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>She had verified with a kindly Italian airline clerk that we were indeed on the Delta flight, that our names were on the manifest, that we probably watched "Grumpier Old Men" on the inflight movie. He reassured her and she relayed the news to America. We didn't learn of the TWA crash until we arrived in Todi.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We settled into the enchanting stone house overlooking the Umbrian hills, and called home. We thought our family would like to hear our voices. We knew we wanted to hear theirs. We spent the next few days and nights swinging helplessly between polarities of alternating emotions, haunted by images of a plane exploding, plunging through the night into the dark sea, taking with it 230 men, women and children -- fathers, mothers, daughters, sons who would never see another day.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Frugality saved our lives. At least that's what we told ourselves. But we could not escape the eternal question, a soulful and frightening version of the tragic challenge: Why us? Or more to the point, why not us? Frugality is not a virtue that spares lives.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Indeed, the night after we arrived in Todi we went out to an especially fine, and expensive Italian restaurant and there we spent far more on food than we saved with the bargain on Delta.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Whatever we do now suddenly feels strange and precious. We are like children tasting a fresh fig for the first time, discovering the extraordinary in a blade of grass, a clay cup, a barking dog, the crunching sound made by the tires against the stones in the dirt road, the shapes of the white clouds scurrying across the sky as they begin to turn a beautiful shade of gray.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Everything is beautiful. Everything counts. We can't settle for the commonplace experience of a vacation. This vacation must mean something more. We feel compelled to testify to life, to our senses, to our appreciation of the world in all the wondrous variety of God's infinite gifts to man.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We celebrate with fresh bread and old wine, the trivial and the contemplative. Whatever we look upon and listen to is nourishment for the soul, linking us with others through succor and sustenance.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Umbria is a special place to think about the inexplicable. Its earthy colors, punctuated by acres of sunflowers and threaded with cypress trees, is a region of gentle, verdant, undulating hills and valleys where St. Francis of Assisi fed the birds. He was a man of prayer and penitence whose poetry in praise of all living things is a lesson to us still.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We rediscover the Sistine Chapel at St. Peter's. We look at Michelangelo's glorious fresco of God giving life to man. God barely touches man's fingertips and the spirit is suddenly tangible. We stand in awe of the vividness of the image, now illuminated in a gorgeous restoration of color. We ask again the eternal questions that haunt every thoughtful man and woman tormented for the answers to the questions about the meaning of life and death.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We do not find the answers. We say a silent prayer for the passengers aboard TWA Flight 800 and mourn with their families. We leave the Sistine Chapel chastened and uplifted, sobered if not wiser. The forces of evil and terror wound deeply and destroy with enormous power, but such dark forces ultimately have no power to smash the human spirit. <BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The Washington Times, is nationally syndicated.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

</FONT><HR WIDTH=30%></center><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bob Dole is obsessed with the gender gap. All the pundits inside the Beltway say so. His gaffes, his turn-arounds, his flip-flops, his misspoken attitudes and waffles over abortion, the assault weapons ban, and a less-than-enthusiastic attempt to trash the affirmative action quota schemes that discriminate against the innocent, are meant to reach out to the women's vote.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>They aren't working. He's looking through the wrong end of the telescope. He's right to show tolerance for those with different opinions on abortion. His choice of Rep. Susan Molinari, an unusual one, as the keynote speaker at least sharply contrasts to the Democrats who wouldn't let Bob Casey, a former governor of Pennsylvania, even talk about his pro-life convictions in New York in 1992.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bob Dole's record as a pro-life senator shouldn't be discounted by pro-lifers simply because he has lately become inarticulate on the subject. But he desperately needs to re-focus on what pro-life and many pro-choice women agree on. A majority of women in both parties want to ban the infanticide procedure euphemistically called "partial-birth abortion." They want to be notified if their under-age daughter seeks an abortion.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Elizabeth Dole gave her husband good advice when she told him to look at crime as a women's issue. A majority of women favor the ban against assault weapons, but few expect it to have much impact on their lives. A majority of women, like men, want dangerous criminals locked up for longer. That's always been a strong Republican issue and Mr. Dole ought to ask Bill Clinton how he hopes to reconcile midnight basketball and curfews as an effective approach to crime. Such ideas are the work of an illogical mind and reflect a pandering politician.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Affirmative action hurts ambitious women, and there are lots of ambitious women in this country today. Furthermore, they vote. Bob Dole ought to gather the facts and talk to women who are naturally receptive to conservative fiscal solutions.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>One of the most fascinating stories lost in the debate over affirmative action is the way that women are smashing through glass ceilings. These women don't need affirmative action and, in fact, many of them could be hurt by it, especially those among the large numbers of female entrepreneurs with small companies who don't need meddlesome and burdensome government mandates.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Women own and run a third of the businesses in the United States and 40 percent of all retail and service firms. According to the Public Interest, magazine women-owned and operated firms grew by 43 percent -- almost double the rate for all firms -- between 1987-1992 under Ronald Reagan and George Bush. These women also increased their payrolls by 100 percent, compared to 38 percent for all firms in the same period of time.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Women who look up and see only their reflections in the glass ceiling usually have made "quality of life" choices that determined their rank. Those who got in and duked it out like men are closing the wage gap, rapidly. Working women between the ages of 27 and 33 who have not had children earn 98 percent of what a man earns. A 2 percent disparity isn't fair, but it isn't bad and it's certainly not difficult to close.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Women who continue to earn less than men in their fields usually have chosen to work less and take off more time, mainly for the children. Women are more willing than men to give more points to "home and family" in measuring success, whether they work or not. These women especially appreciate lower taxes.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Women, traditionally the moral arbiters of our society, are fundamentally conservative. Many are deeply offended by Bill Clinton on character issues and appreciate the integrity they perceive in Bob Dole. So far this moral outrage hasn't registered in the polls, maybe because Mr. Dole hasn't talked directly to them. Now is the time if he is ever to do it.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The Washington Times, is nationally syndicated.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=6>The shattered fairy tale<BR>
of Charles and Diana</FONT><HR WIDTH=50%>
By Suzanne Fields<BR><FONT SIZE=1>The Washington Times
</FONT><HR WIDTH=30%></center><BR><DD>The marriage and divorce of Princess Di and Prince Charles
is a fairy tale for our time. Their story has all the appropriate literary
ingredients.<BR><DD>Prince Charming may not be as gallant as we like our princes to be, and we
don't know whether Cinderella turned out to be so terrific either. We only know that the shoe
fit.<BR><DD>Royal watchers chatter about the many ways Prince Charles and Princess Di were
mismatched, but the original Sleeping Beauty was mismatched with her prince, too. She slept
through the last 100 years. At least Di was awake in the 1980s.<BR><DD>There's also a jealous
Other Woman in the Di and Charles fairy tale triangle. Camilla Parker Bowles is a mistress of
the prince, not the mean stepmother, but she gets no sympathy from the rest of us and deepens
our empathy for the hardships endured by Di. The princess once remarked with bitter wit: "There
were three of us in this marriage so it was a bit crowded."<BR><DD>An angry Queen Mother also
pulls her weight against the princess, not letting her keep the title "Her Royal Highness."
That's a little like giving her back the glass slipper after it's broken, but at least she gets
to live in a palace.<BR><DD>Lots of fairy tales include dwarfs and rogues, unpleasant little
people who try to put something over on the princess and who frequently disguise themselves as
something finer. Does anyone doubt that Capt. James Hewitt, who kissed the princess and told the
world about it, and more, is such a stunted human being? The princess describes his "handsome
physique," but everyone thinks that such physical perfection must camouflage an ugly character
inside.<BR><DD>People in disguises in fairy tales are free to say outrageous things, half-truths
and lies, because the princess cannot see the wickedness within. Capt. Hewitt may later turn
into an ass, literally, reflecting his nature in outward form, but even without the tall ears we
can see that he's a donkey. When his tell-all book was published in London, Tory Member of
Parliament Sir Nicholas Bonsor said, "I cannot comprehend how he can still look at himself in
the mirror." Mirrors tell the truth. Snow White's royal stepmother discovered that to her
dismay.<BR><DD>I've been reading fairy tales (that's what happens when a grandson comes into the
family). Fairy tales are more illuminating and insightful during this pre-election season than
Bob Dole's inexplicable gaffes and Bill Clinton's "conservative" conversion pronouncements. One
man on the road to ruin, the other on the road to Damascus. (Read your Bible.)<BR><DD>I've
discovered what John Updike saw in a collection of Italian fairy tales: "They were the
television and pornography of their day, the life-lightening trash of a preliterate
peoples."<BR><DD>We're fascinated by the stories of Princess Di and Prince Charles for the same
reasons medieval men and women repeated fairy tales and for reasons these stories remain
popular. They're rooted in the reality of human emotion, both conscious and unconscious, an
awareness of wishes and desires that make us do strange and irrational things. They also grow
out of the culture and history of their time, at the upper reaches of society as well as what we
would now call the underclass.<BR><DD>No one -- certainly no one who has ever been part of a
couple -- believes any couple lives happily ever after, but it's fun to imagine they do. That's
no longer possible as newspapers, zoom lenses and an increasingly permissive society bring the
philanderings of the prince and the promiscuousness of a princess into our living rooms. You
might call this "defining deviancy up."<BR><DD>We no longer need to pretend that royal
personages act any different than commoners. But the British, unlike their American cousins,
must consider whether it's worth it to them to continue to support in such a lavish fashion a
modern royal family which creates such a cultural embarrassment. Americans may pay thousands of
dollars for faux pearls to turn Jackie Kennedy into faux royalty, but at least we don't pay
taxes to invent happy fairy tales we know aren't so.<P><I>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The

By Suzanne Fields<BR><FONT SIZE=1>The Washington Times
</FONT><HR WIDTH=30%></center>
<BR><DD>We get the leaders we deserve. Such cliche may be glib but it's not without insight.<BR><DD>The character issue is dismissed as irrelevant and hence unimportant, and Bill Clinton holds a large lead over Bob Dole. Explanations, such as they are, abound.<BR><DD>First, Bill Clinton has been through a trial by fire and is no longer burned. We knew that he was no angel, but 43 percent of the voters gave him a plurality to win in 1992. So who cares?<BR><DD>"Filegate" may change the polls in ways that the conviction of his business buddies in Arkansas did not. But that's certainly not clear yet.<BR><DD>Character and politics seem to have little to do with one another. The Democrats have succeeded in sticking unfair descriptions of "extremism" on the Republicans. Bill Clinton knows how to read the polls and promise the American people exactly what they want, which is what a lot of the extremists promised first.<BR><DD>The rap on Bob Dole, who nearly everyone agrees is a man of character and integrity, is that he cannot turn his virtues into victory. He hasn't persuaded the American people why he wants to be president. Besides, "he's too old." That may be inaccurate, but it's a powerful perception nonetheless.<BR><DD>Hence, better to elect a deeply flawed young man than a decent "old" man. Sophisticated Europeans understand this amoral approach. They could never understand how a successful president like Richard Nixon could be brought down by the clumsy cover-up of a third-rate burglary.<BR><DD>But Americans have been a deeply moral people in matters of money, sex and power. When a leader shows lapses in any one of these categories, we react by electing someone who is dramatically deficient in those vices.<BR><DD>Gerald Ford, a stolid congressman, conspicuous for his ordinariness, restored a measure of confidence to the office of vice president after Spiro Agnew disgraced it by taking money under the table. Jimmy Carter had lust in his heart, but he kept it there, and he was upright and virtuous in his personal habits, a sharp departure from Jack Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, leaders whose private behavior was unscrupulous, promiscuous or unprincipled, or all of the above.<BR><DD>Bill Clinton has surmounted scandals of sex, money, and power, at least so far. No one cares about Gennifer Flowers any longer and Paula Jones has been relegated to the wrong side of the tracks, beyond feminist concern. The Little Rock trials demonstrated that as governor Bill Clinton had criminal associates, but he has not yet been found guilty of anything illegal. Not yet.<BR><DD>In fact, the public appears to be extremely forgiving of Mr. Clinton. He could promise a middle-class tax cut in his campaign in 1992 and drop it completely after he won the election. He could seek the lifting of the arms embargo on the Croats in Bosnia, and once elected drop it. The voters don't care. Not yet.<BR><DD>Bob Dole supporters, down in the dumps about his poll ratings, insist that his ultimate integrity will win out if he's able to connect with powerful conservative issues that he has not yet articulated with any force -- slower growth in Medicare and Medicaid, balancing the budget, school choice, English as our binding language and a foreign policy that won't suffer from "misguided romanticism." But they seem to be trying to persuade themselves first.<BR><DD>A fascinating book called "Character Above All" measures 10 presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to George Bush on elements of character. The most provocative essay is by David McCullough, Harry Truman's biographer. He reckons that "character counts in the presidency more than any other single quality."<BR><DD>Could we find another president like Harry Truman? "Who knows?" he replies. "Maybe somewhere in Texas she's growing up right now."<I><BR>

By Suzanne Fields<BR><FONT SIZE=1>The Washington Times
</FONT><HR WIDTH=30%></center>
<BR><DD>When Hillary Rodham Clinton is tempted to give in to self-pity, she ought to consider her sisters of earlier White House imprisonment. She and Eleanor Roosevelt were neither the first nor will they be the last to suffer outrageous slings and errors. Nor are they the most "victimized," in the fashion of the day. This pouring of new whine into old battles does not become a first lady.<BR><DD>She can consider herself lucky by comparison to Rachel Jackson, who was so vilified by the supporters of John Quincy Adams that she didn't live to move into the White House. She had wanted to skip the inauguration of her husband, but Andrew Jackson's friends warned that she mustn't give in to her tormentors lest they enjoy a "chuckle" at scaring her away.<BR><DD>She made plans to come to Washington, only to be reminded that her enemies not only called her an "adulteress" (and worse), but described her as "fat, forty, but not fair." Old Hickory himself was 61, but that didn't count. Buying a ball gown wasn't much fun. Rachel grew depressed and fell sick before she left Nashville, fulfilling a wish she had announced, paraphrasing the Psalmist, when she heard that her husband had won the election: "I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of God than to live in that palace at Washington."<BR><DD>If it's a seance she wants, Hillary ought to run a short circuit to Mary Todd Lincoln, who also dabbled in spiritualism, even before there was a Psychic Friends Network, believing that she had supernatural powers to communicate with dead relatives. But despite Mary's confidence in her own prophetic powers, she couldn't foresee how wretched she would be as first lady.<BR><DD>Although she was loyal to the Union cause, many of her relatives, including two brothers, fought for the Confederacy. She was accused of being a traitor and a spy. The newspapers were merciless, even when Will, her 11-year-old son, died. Instead of showing the first lady a little sympathy in her grief, the newspapers attacked the style and "extravagance" of her mourning clothes.<BR><DD>Not only did Mrs. Lincoln endure the assassination of her husband, but when she became a widow, a Lincoln biographer argued, probably inaccurately, that Lincoln had only one real love in his life, Ann Rutledge, a woman who died before he met Mary Todd. On reading this, Mrs. Lincoln broke down and was eventually placed in a mental institution by a son.<BR><DD>Florence Harding, like Nancy Reagan, consulted an astrologer -- as a senator's wife, not as first lady. But why not? It was "Madam Marcia" who told her that her husband would become president of the United States and he would also have many sordid affairs. Madam Marcia was right on both counts. Futurespeak has a downside.<BR><DD>Mrs. Harding, like Hillary Clinton, was furious at those who protected her husband from her. President Harding continued to see Nan Britton, a favorite mistress, after he moved into the White House, occasionally partaking of Nan's favors in a coat closet adjoining the Oval Office. Once when Mrs. Harding heard that that woman was in the White House she set out to find her, and only because someone tipped his Secret Service detail did the president and Nan escape the wrath of "the Duchess."<BR><DD>Nor is Hillary the first first lady to make personal and public sacrifices to protect her husband. Bess Truman learned early in the election year of 1948 that the White House was collapsing, rotting from within. Mrs. Truman preferred to bear the accusation that she failed to initiate a formal social season than to give her husband's enemies the metaphor of a crumbling White House. The Trumans moved into the Blair House after he upset Tom Dewey, and the White House was renovated.<BR><DD>Jean Houston, Hillary's psychic friend, suggests that she carries the burden of 5,000 years of subservience to men, and compares her to Joan of Arc. Bob Woodward writes in his new book "The Choice," that Hillary "seemed jerked around by the muddled role of first lady as she swung between New Age feminist and national housewife."<BR><DD>The first lady cut short one session with Jean Houston to inquire into Chelsea's tummy ache. Thus a child's aching tummy brought the burden of 5,000 years of "female subservience" abruptly to earth -- where it belongs.<P><BR>

<font size=7>The rising tide of 'Wifewater'</font></center><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Hillary Rodham Clinton has done more for educating the public in the principles of modern feminism than Gloria Steinem or Betty Friedan, the early superstars of the movement.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>She climbed to the nexus of power using everything it takes. Like many male wheeler-dealers before her, she took ethical risks which, now that they have come to light, are like curses. Chickens coming home to roost.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>No wonder that she's taking a solo trip to Eastern Europe to celebrate the Fourth of July in Prague. Wicked wags in Washington say, unkindly, that she's looking for a country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the United States.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>For anyone who doesn't yet know her offenses, a quick read of the majority report on the Whitewater hearings will fill in most of the blanks. Many ethical lapses lead in and out of Vincent Foster's office and continue to fuel speculation not only about why he committed suicide, and where, but how his files mysteriously disappeared from his office with the help of Hillary's staff: "From the moment that she was notified of Mr. Foster's death," the committee says, "Mrs. Clinton and her key agents -- Margaret Williams and Susan Thomases --were engaged in the subsequent handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>That means they dealt with papers about Whitewater and Travelgate that were -- and are -- potentially damaging to the First Couple, which the first lady knew were in Vince Foster's possession.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>What we have here is a pre-White House/post-White House scandal in which Hillary Clinton is accused of hiding or destroying documents from her law firm, and for holding on to files when they were subpoenaed by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, two years earlier.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"At every important turn, crucial files and documents 'disappeared' or were withheld from scrutiny whenever questions were raised," the committee charges. One of the most damaging bits of evidence are her fingerprints on the late-recovered billing records of the Rose Law Firm found in the White House residence last August. Although other fingerprints were found as well, the others are not those of anyone who was in that part of the White House the day the files were found.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>What's more, the billing records -- which Mrs. Clinton says she's "happy" were finally found -- reveal that Hillary lied about the amount of time she spent on the shady side of the Whitewater and Castle Grande land investments. She had the most to lose if the billing records were made public.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Naturally, the Democrats are trying to diminish the importance of her activities, attacking the committee report as blindly partisan. They'll have lots of time during the campaign to make their side of the argument. What may be more fascinating for the rest of us is to consider is how Hillary has played the cards handed to her, and its implications for the future course of feminism.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>What's abundantly clear is something many feminists are loath to accept. A woman in power -- however that power is obtained -- is little different from a man in power. She can use it for better or for worse, but being a woman has very little to do with it. Lord Acton's famous dictum applies to her, too: "Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mrs. Clinton gingerly slides back and forth into mini-feminine dramas, putting on pink and granting interviews with favorite reporters to talk about menus and White House decor. Such appearances are carefully orchestrated for maximum political impact. Just as a man will occasionally use his "sensitive" side to highlight how much compassion he has, he knows that really power resides in his tough positions. No man knows better how this works than Hillary.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>A chorus of friendly critics has frequently suggested that if only Hillary Clinton had come clean about Whitewater and Travelgate she could have quickly put it all behind her. This overlooks the possibility that maybe there was something to hide. You can only come clean if you are clean.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The First Feminist doesn't get the First Man off the hook, either. No matter what his wife did, Mr. Clinton as governor and then as president is responsible for her semi-official actions affecting the public good and bad, whether by arranging to have employees in the White House travel office cashiered, or in causing elderly blue-collar Arkansans to lose their savings in bad land investments.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The late, great Satchel Paige, who had a curve ball that could go around a mountain, used to say that it's dangerous to look back because "somethin' might be gainin' on you." If Hillary is brave enough to look back, she might recognize it.<P><I>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The Washington Times, is nationally syndicated.<BR><BR></I><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<BODY>
</center><DIV ALIGN=Right><FONT SIZE=2><B>LONDON</B></DIV></FONT><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>I've always enjoyed the comfort and easy convenience of the London underground. The tunnels and cars lack the grime, grunge and menacing quality we associate with most big city transportation. New York this is not. Not yet.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But today the London subway is emblematic of the cultural changes that reflect a deterioration in manners, morals and civility that we've always associated with our ever-so-polite English cousins. Graffiti is everywhere. Litter is more prominent than it used to be. Rudeness is commonplace. A fear of violence lurks in spontaneous discourtesy.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>I boarded a subway car on June 8 with dozens of young men heading for an important soccer match at Wembley. They wore the black leather jackets of hooligans, swigging beer from cans, unshaven and loudmouthed, singing rowdy drinking songs.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>When two English bobbies boarded the same car, these young men switched to verses of "Old MacDonald's Farm," drawing attention to "the pigs" with a boisterous "oink oink here, and an oink oink there." The bobbies showed their customary patience and forbearance, holding steady lest a riot break out. But it was scary as well as shocking to feel adolescent intimidation kept in check only by police firmness.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The Brits worry about violence breaking out whenever their soccer team plays, and commentators are much in demand to lend historical perspective to bad behavior. But England is wary this month as it hosts "Euro 96," the soccer championships of Europe.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>One professor, who directs the soccer research unit at Liverpool University, traces the roots for modern hooliganism back hundreds of years, when young English working men went abroad to fight. This is to explain how the fighting spirit lives on in the shrunken psyche of a small island nation. But soccer as the Crusades? Others argue that violence and aggression among the lower classes are psychological compensation both for Britain's poor athletes and bruising social realities. Wobbly legs made me do it. Or maybe it was Lady Thatcher.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>After this mindless drivel how can it hurt for a foreigner to offer her instant analysis? What seems to be at work is a growing tolerance for anti-social behavior such as we thought was rampant only at home.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>I lived in London in the "Swinging Sixties"; I have no illusions about the coarsening of manners in the city once identified with propriety. But remembrances of the Beatles and Carnaby Street, miniskirts, mod ties and Chelsea mornings evoke a nostalgic high of innocence. We're talking about the loutish rebellion that has followed them.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Behaving badly, loud swearing and filthy insults, drinking and fighting in what the stylish English critics have dubbed the "New Lad" culture has been elevated to a lifestyle of perverse glamour that's begun to upset even the cultural elites that created the monster.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The defenders of nastiness and the violent underpinnings of the "New Lads" are in cowardly retreat, hiding behind the feeble defense that they never expected their irony and wit to be drunk straight up as it was "democratized down."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"The New Lad style was taken up by a mass of young men who had little in common with their counterparts in Medialand," writes Cosmo Landesman, a critic bewailing the decline of civil standards in London's Sunday Times. "These were the prole-lad-tariat, and they had no interest in irony. Here was loutishness without the alibi of quotation marks. Now the middle class of Medialand are horrified by what they've unleashed."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Sound familiar?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The first to speak out against moral decline in London, are, like their American counterparts, conservatives who were derided as "right wing" squares, cranks and old fogies. But old fogies have a way of cranking up influence over time. The starting point for most cultural and political debates in England -- as in the United States -- is right of center.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Recently Bill Clinton, ripping off another conservative issue, called for curfews for American children as a means to control violence by youngsters. The British Labor Party was inspired to quickly follow. But Tony Blair, head of the Labor Party, suffers the same problem (without the character issue) afflicting Bill Clinton. The farther he runs to the right, neglecting his core support, the more he risks becoming merely a bleached imitation of the political opposition.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Lefties in England face the same dilemma that lefties in the United States confront with our president. Can they trust their leader to run right and govern left? If not, why vote for watered-down conservatism? Good question.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The Washington Times, is nationally syndicated.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

By Suzanne Fields<BR><FONT SIZE=1>The Washington Times
</FONT><HR WIDTH=30%></center>
<BR><DD>The hip young man in khaki Dockers and the striped Henley has a problem. He's just met a young woman he thinks he might like a lot. But before he can unreel his line she tells him: "I'm into abstinence."<BR><DD>He's heard this lady's line before, at cocktail parties where nothing stronger than sparkling water of expensive vintage is served, on or off the rocks. Should he take it personally, or put it down to the luck of the draw? The third or fourth time he hears it he might wonder, is something else going on here?<BR><DD>Sometimes such a woman sounds like the incredible tease that every boy's mother has warned him about. But who, male or female, needs this or any other come-on in our sex-drenched age, when every man can be a libertine without even trying.<BR><DD>But wait: from almost anyone's circle of acquaintances among single women in their 20s and 30s comes a repeated refrain: They're tired of a man's great sexual expectations. In this game even liberty has its limits. A woman wants to get to know her man before she knows him.<BR><DD>Since the dawn of the sexual revolution, which was supposed to have put all aright, sex and not love has preceded intimacy, and the intellectual and emotional titillation that a man and a woman find in the first thrill of a romance has been reduced to days, sometimes hours. Some women, determined to regard themselves as gifts to the men they expect to love, call themselves recycled virgins. They're transformed in mind if not precisely in every aspect of body.<BR><DD>Premature mating, they believe, puts at risk the delicious journey of discovery that courtship provided for generations upon generations of young adults before them.<BR><DD>Few of us want to return to boy-meets-girl conversations on a front-porch swing with Mom, Dad, two brothers, three sisters and the neighbors looking on and listening in. (Nobody has a front porch, anyway.) Nevertheless, the easy flirtation of style over substance, with no guarantee of even a call the next day, may be becoming yesterday's weapon, the discarded Gatling gun in the war between the sexes.<BR><DD>The men in the trenches of this warfare want something better than a casual hayride, too. David Klinghoffer, who writes the "token man" column in Women's Quarterly, understood just how times had changed one Sunday morning when, on a Hamptons weekend with several other eligible young men, he found himself in the usual fight over the newspaper. Everyone reached not for the arts or book review sections, or even the sports pages, but for the wedding announcements. Who among their friends was lucky enough to be on the latest casualty lists from the front?<BR><DD>Many unattached young women so despair of finding Mr. Right they suspect themselves of the commitment-phobia they accuse young men of. How else to account for always choosing the wrong man, which ultimately keeps them free from a lasting attachment? Of course, with wrong men as plentiful as the mosquitoes on a summer's night at the lake, sometimes a girl can't help herself.<BR><DD>The Victorians, whose manners and morals are not always any longer a source of merriment for the sophisticates of our age, raised romantic love to elevated heights by introducing an element of the sacred into the pursuit of pleasure. They linked sensuality with divinity, sexuality with divine approval. A man regarded a woman as "saint-like," or "heavenly," an angel of light sent to restore his faith in life, love and marriage. Or tried to. Instead of sleeping together, courting Victorians attended church together. This required an appreciation of sexual abstinence and chastity, even if occasionally observed in the breach. They understood that romantic love without opposing resistance could have all the flavor of Juicy Fruit left overnight on the bedpost.<BR><DD>Julia in Byron's "Don Juan" linked remorse with temptation:<BR><DD>"A little still she strove, and much repented,<BR><DD>And, whispering 'I will ne'er consent' -- consented."<P><I><BR></I><I>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The Washington Times, is nationally syndicated.<BR><BR></I> <FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

were merely tasteless</FONT><HR WIDTH=50%>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><Align=center>

</FONT><HR WIDTH=30%></center>
<BODY>


<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>I've changed my
treadmill schedule from the evening, when I watched "The News Hour with Jim
Lehrer," to the morning so I can get a sampling of the talk-show fare and stay in
touch with "real people" outside Washington. No offense to Jim Lehrer, but I can
watch him at night without the help of endorphins.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But if my morning energy
level has gone up, my tolerance for talk television has sharply declined. In the weeks
since I began surfing for the morning shows the absolute worst, yet quite typical,
was about identical 10-year-old twins. Two girls and two boys were videotaped by
their parents showing how nasty they could be to each other, kicking and biting and
pulling each other's hair. Then we meet the twins live, in the television studio, to
hear and see them tell the audience why they hate one another. Each boy and girl
wish they weren't stuck with a horrible double.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>To give this junk morally
redeeming value, we're told that after the commercial break these twins are going
to want to shape up and learn the meaning of brotherly (or sisterly) love. When we
return we're introduced to the tutors for the twins.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>One is a tragic mother
who ran over her son, a twin, when he was 4 years old. She didn't see him as she
backed the van out of the driveway. She felt a bump and wondered if she had hit the
dog. She thought both boys were asleep upstairs in their room. Her son, sitting by her
side, describes almost inaudibly how lonely he is and wishes he could bring his
brother back. By now everybody is crying, the twins, their mothers and the audience.
I confess, me too.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>I've written about child abuse on television before and
this time I'm not even going to castigate the hosts of such shows. They only offer
what the guests and the public of the idiot culture will bear. But what can we say
about the exploitative parents of these children? Do they have no
responsibility?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Maybe less should be written about the effects of television
sex and violence on children and more about the ill effects of putting children on
display before the cameras. This is a long way from "Sesame Street" or silly home
videos.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We eagerly write child labor laws. We lock up pornographic
photographers of children. Isn't it obscene to portray children violently taunting
each other in scenes of sibling rivalry and then on cue parade their feelings before
their friends and millions of others?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The last time I complained about child
abuse on television, it occurred on a show where children, ages 6 and 9, were trotted
out to explain how and why they wanted to kill their mothers. Greek tragedy this
was not.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The hosts usually make a pretense of offering such families "a
therapeutic environment," with bright lights and microphones, lots of supportive
gasps, sympathetic applause, and of course ample commercial breaks. Frequently a
resident expert is recruited to say that killing mothers is bad for their health, or
that beating up a sibling is not nice, either.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>These shows are sometimes
defended as "the democratization of culture," a harmless low-brow pleasure -- like
watching Christians being fed to lions? Or defended as giving those who don't have
much to feel good about an opportunity to feel superior to someone else: At least my
kids don't want to kill me or each other! They've even been called popular theater
with an Aristotelian catharsis: There but for the grace of God and television
producers, go I.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But no matter how you look at it from an audience's point of
view, the children placed in front of that camera are abused children. We should
worry about the psychological impact on their lives.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Now that we've bid our
farewell to Phil Donahue, who started this abuse, we can wax nostalgic about a more
innocent time when the host merely wore a skirt and brought male strippers into our
homes. Tastelessness beats beating up kids.<P><I>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for

<BR><DD>Big Bob Dole and little Billy Clinton are strapping on the shootin' iron for the shootout at Gender Gap. Like the Clantons and Wyatt Earp at the O.K. Corral, they're itchin' to show the wimmen just who the real man is.

<BR><DD>Neither of these men strike any resemblance to Gary Cooper, to stretch the metaphor, but each is desperate to convince the ladies that he's a man who knows how to protect women, children and the community from bad guys in black hats.

<BR><DD>Women ought to find it offensive that any candidate thinks he can woo a woman on the basis of her &quot;gender&quot; (what in our pre-euphemistic days we called simply, sex.) But in a world where voting blocs are about differences, and women make up a majority of voters in almost every economic category, it can't hurt to target women. Picking up their votes is another matter.

<BR><DD>Bob Dole, who is looking for a quick fix for his depressing poll numbers, decides that women's issues might help him cross the finish line first. He cites day-care funding in the Republican welfare-reform bill, which Bill Clinton vetoed twice, as well as the balanced budget and regulatory reform, which are Republican initiatives that provide strong reasons why women should vote Republican in November.

<BR><DD>Bill Clinton, who is better at seducing women with his sensitive and puckered lower lip, is aggressively wooing blue-collar women, who voted in the presidential elections in 1992 but who stayed home in the 1994. Some women are harder to seduce than others.

<BR><DD>Blue-collar women in focus groups describe the president as a &quot;wussy&quot; and a &quot;pantywaist,&quot; according to Hanna Rosin in the New Republic magazine. They're not charmed by his boyishness or his chameleon-like changes. They're familiar with untrustworthy men who promise them moonshine at midnight and disappear in the harsh light of morning.

<BR><DD>These women, who have been described by pollsters as Angry White Women, do not have a college degree, and they're too smart to be impressed by Hillary Rodham Clinton trading on her husband's position to achieve the perks of power. High-powered patronizing women like the first lady are the nemesis of women who would rather stay home with their children than put their children in day care, if only they could afford it. Feminists who scorn men as white male devils make them uncomfortable; some of those men with pitchforks and forked tails happen to be their husbands.

<BR><DD>Blue-collar women are the biggest losers when public schools decline and they can't afford an expensive private school, like, for example, Bill and Hillary Clinton. They're a natural voting bloc for such conservative temptations as school vouchers, dumping affirmative action (which hasn't much benefitted them and certainly not their husbands), and illegal immigration which sometimes takes theirs and their husbands' jobs.

<BR><DD>Abortion is often not an emotional issue for these women, but most are appalled (like most of the rest of us) that Bill Clinton vetoed a bill banning partial-birth abortion (nothing short of infanticide), which liberal feminists railed at in China, but accept in our own country.

<BR><DD>If blue-collar women are angry and disconnected from feminism, middle-class mothers feel like Rodney Dangerfield, who &quot;don't get no respect.&quot; They're stressed to the max.

<BR><DD>A survey of more than 18,000 women for Parents magazine turned up some surprises. Sixty-eight percent of the working moms say they work for money, not emotional or intellectual satisfaction, up 12 points in seven years. Big majorities of mothers prefer part-time work to full-time work when their children are young. A mere 4 percent say they would choose full-time work. Though 49 percent of working mothers say they envy at-home moms, only 11 percent of at-home moms envy working mothers.

<BR><DD>Readers of Parents magazine make up a special sampling because nearly all of them live with their husbands, have been married only once, and more than half are college graduates. They are especially open to listen to Bob Dole's critique of the president for vetoing balanced budget proposals and welfare-reform bills. This would have put more money in their pocketbooks, to spend or save as they see fit.

<BR><DD>Most startling of all is the majority - the majority - of young mothers under 25 who say they prefer the lifestyle of the 1950s, the decade the feminists love to hate; 43 percent of these mothers say they long for the security and less pressured lives of that decade. A 24-year old mom captured their sentiment succinctly, describing herself as a &quot;June Cleaver Wanna-be.&quot;

<BR><DD>Neither Bill Clinton nor Bob Dole will woo their votes. These women vote very much like their husbands, and aren't interested in life in Gender Gap.

<BR><DD>The baby boomers flooded the culture with post-pubescent rebellion: &quot;Never trust anyone over 30.&quot;

<BR><DD>Adults trembled and then surrendered. Now the boomers are on the back side of 30 themselves and their children are saying: &quot;Never trust anyone over 13.&quot;

<BR><DD>Brittany, 13, is typical. She lives in a small New England town where her parents moved to get away from big-city problems. The big-city problems have moved into their town and into their living room.

<BR><DD>&quot;What she watches and hears from television and her peers on the bus to school deprives her of childhood innocence,&quot; her mother tells me. &quot;We can't control the other children, but we thought we could control our own daughter.&quot;

<BR><DD>Brittany's parents put a &quot;family-code lock&quot; on MTV so she wouldn't watch too much television. But Brittany is bright and she broke the code. Retaliating, she put her own code lock on the &quot;Discovery Channel,&quot; her parents' favorite.

<BR><DD>On the way to school, one of Brittany's buddies laced a large Coke with vodka and passed it around on the bus. She wound up in the emergency room, dead drunk.

<BR><DD>What we have here is a variation of the inmates taking over the asylum. With computer-literate, media-saturated, middle-class children poised for revolt, it's more difficult than ever for parents to maintain their position of authority.

<BR><DD>Not so long ago we accepted terms like &quot;identity crisis&quot; as a normal stage of development that adolescents would be expected to pass through. But today young people are exposed to so much &quot;adult&quot; information without the emotional development or psychological security to cope with it that parents are terrified.

<BR><DD>We look for one-shot elixirs to enable them to cope. We try to prevent teen-age pregnancy by distributing condoms at school. That sounds reasonable, but it plays to the lowest common denominator among us. The girl who would say &quot;no&quot; because she's afraid to get pregnant is reminded that the school provides condoms for squeamish young girls just like herself. How could it be bad?

<BR><DD>Movie and television producers, sensing a growing movement for censorship, offer ratings so parents will know what their children shouldn't watch. That only makes such shows and movies more desirable, of course, and the children quickly find the latchkey kid with no supervision at home. They hang out there to watch whatever they want.

<BR><DD>Most of us remember our own teen-age traumas and figure that those of our children will pass, too. But parents raising teen-agers today can't be so sure. The starting place for belligerence is so far beyond where the baby-boomer parents ended their rebellion that the test of limits is limitless. Today's teen-agers tolerate graphic sexuality and violence that would have made their parents throw up.

<BR><DD>Children are entering puberty at younger ages, some as early as 10. They're more likely to want to separate themselves from their families when parental protection is absolutely essential. Their mothers burned their bras; their daughters never get one. Young girls of another generation who would debate who to go out with, and &quot;how far to go,&quot; now debate when and with whom to have uncommitted and casual sex.

<BR><DD>We could begin to change some of this by pointing out that rhetorical and abstract appeals to sexual equality are false and misleading, hiding a multitude of dangerous differences starting at puberty. What once made up a teen-ager's fantasy life quickly became a short cut to coarsened reality. Parents must repeat and re-establish moral principles that reinforce an understanding of the difference between the sexes, enabling young women to once more become the arbiters of what's acceptable and what's not, because they're the ones who have the most to lose.

<BR><DD>This started out to be a column about the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act, pending in Congress, which is an attempt to give parents a veto power over policies in schools that they say undermine them. It sounds good, but it won't take the place of parents paying close attention to their own children. Nothing else, in the end, will work.

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=7>Time for another<BR>killer euphemism?</FONT><HR WIDTH=50%>

<BR><DD>In 1789 Jonathan Swift bewailed the shameful numbers of abortions and murders of &quot;bastard children&quot; among the Catholic peasants of Ireland, desperate women who sacrificed innocent babes to avoid the expense and the shame of giving birth without benefit of clergy. Such horrid practices, Swift wrote, &quot;would move tears and pity in the most savage and inhuman beast.&quot;

<BR><DD>In searching for a way to alleviate such cruelty, Swift invents an American, whom most Englishmen regarded as a not-so-noble savage, to support his modest proposal.

<BR><DD>&quot;I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London,&quot; he writes in a satire that became a classic of English literature, &quot;that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious, nourishing, and wholesome food whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricassee or a ragout.&quot;

<BR><DD>Swift was only ahead of his time, and he was only kidding. His modest proposal was deliciously sly in appealing to an impeccable financial logic. His classic was a dig at the rapacious absentee English landlords of Ireland, whose money-grubbing tactics were condoned by the British parliament, ministers and the Crown.

<BR><DD>Taking a cue from Swift, the time is right for a similar modest proposal to President Clinton and all those congressmen who are willing to uphold his veto of the ban on &quot;partial-birth abortion.&quot;

<BR><DD>First the facts: a partial-birth abortion is the euphemism for the procedure of turning a baby around (with forceps) in the birth canal so that his tiny legs and tummy and arms escape the mother's body, allowing the doctor to stick a pair of scissors into his head while it is mostly still inside his mother's body. The doctor then spreads the blades of the scissors to allow him to insert a tube with which to suck out the tiny brain. Scientists who work with animals in a laboratory wouldn't be permitted to perform such nasty business.

<BR><DD>So heinous is the procedure that such abortions as are done are mostly to preserve the mother's health, usually her psychological health, since the procedure is done a few seconds before the baby's head slips free of the womb.

<BR><DD>And since psychology is so crucial, why should we deprive the mother-to-be of &quot;psychological closure&quot; by the technicality of keeping the head inside the birth canal while the procedure is being done? Why not do it outside, so that she can watch?

<BR><DD>Why not, in fact, provide a grace period of 15 minutes after birth, to allow her to decide whether she really wants to have a baby. Or even an hour. Perhaps a day or two. Why rush these things? The doctor's scissors would still work the next day.

<BR><DD>It's almost impossible to anesthetize an infant in the womb without putting the mother in great danger. But a baby who lives outside the womb for an hour or even a day could receive treatment to reduce pain prior to its execution. We shouldn't be barbaric, after all. The law, of course, must exempt this carefully considered procedure from charges of premeditated murder. We could give such infanticide a nice name like &quot;mercicide.&quot; The kindly Dr. Jack Kevorkian might offer the use of his death machinery.

<BR><DD>There is another great advantage to this scheme. By forcing the whole baby out of the mother's body for mercicide, we could decide at our leisure whether the infant is indeed a monster with four legs and no suitable brain, thus avoiding disposing of (we must watch our language) a Down's Syndrome child or a child with a cleft palate, both of which are justifiable reasons now for electing a &quot;partial-birth abortion.&quot;

<BR><DD>In fact, the law as it is now interpreted enables a mother of a normal baby to kill the child in the last trimester if the birth contributes to a mother's depression or neurotic excesses. Though it may be difficult for some to imagine that a loving adoptive mother would welcome a live baby with Down's Syndrome or a cleft palate, that option would be made available before mercicide, which is after all permanent.

<BR><DD>The advantages of this proposal are obvious and many, it seems to me, as well as of the highest importance to the body impolitic. To satisfy the squeamish who require the delicacy of euphemism, as the president seems to, we could describe mercicide as killing with kindness.

<title>Fumento: New Gun Law Penalizes Cops - 1/8/97</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i>January 8, 1997</i><p>
<h2>Cops Pay the Price for New Gun Law</h2><p>
<P>  
	Lt. Dale Barsness was truly one of Minneapolis's finest. A 28-year veteran of the police
force, he had just been promoted to head the homicide department. But now he may lose
everything, courtesy of our national lawmakers.
<P>
	A month before the election, Congress approved and President Clinton signed a law
proposed by Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D.-N.J.) forbidding anyone who has committed a misdemeanor 
act of domestic abuse from possessing a handgun.
<P>     
	In Barsness's case, the act in question (details are unknown) occurred back in 1991. He
pleaded guilty and served his punishment. Yet he is now on a six-month administrative leave
while the department decides whether it has any choice but to fire him.
<P>     
	If he loses his job, his ex-wife told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, "it hurts the people
who were hurt in the first place: his children and his ex-wife."  
<P>     
	Lautenberg and Clinton championed the bill as necessary to protect women, children, and
other living things, but it was essentially a ball of fluff--99.9 percent substance free. 
Already persons who commit domestic felonies are forced to turn in their guns, so by
definition the bill only targeted lesser offenders.
<P>     
	In support of the proposal, the White House cited a Justice Department figure that of 
the 1.7 million incidents of domestic violence reported each year, 88,000 involve firearms.  But
that comes out to 5 percent of such incidents, and it doesn't mean anybody was shot or even
that bullets were fired. Considering that almost half of all Americans own guns, guns and
domestic violence hardly go hand in hand.
<P>
	But nobody in Congress had the guts to point this out, the law passed, and now it's 
time to pay the piper.  Officers across the country like Dale Barsness are doing the 
paying--as are the citizens that such police serve and protect.
<P>     
	Police departments are now scouring their files to see if any of their officers were
ever convicted of misdemeanor domestic abuse--10 years ago, 20, 30, it doesn't matter. Once a
conviction is found, the officer may be fired or reassigned to a permanent desk job.
<P>     
	It hardly seems fair to take away a cop's livelihood because of something he did a
decade ago, even as the average time served for murder in this country is about six years. It is
even more unfair to slap him or her with penalties that were unforeseeable when the officer
pleaded guilty.
<P>      
	How would you feel if a new law mandated that the speeding ticket you pleaded guilty
to 15 years ago now results in your license being revoked, your car impounded, or your
first-born sold into slavery?  You might wish you'd gone to court and fought that ticket,
huh? Picture Bill Clinton saying: "Ah feel your pain--but it's too late, sucker!"    
<P>     
	The Constitution clearly forbids laws which make something a crime after the act has
already been committed.  But for some reason, penalties slapped on after a crime has been
committed is a shadier area. Thus, while the gun law may still be legal.
<P>     
	Further, though the law was billed as a crime-fighting measure, in practice it may
impact only crimefighters themselves. (It might also be applied to soldiers.)
<P>     
	"It's being unfairly applied to our people since we're the only ones with the capacity
to check our people and take our guns away," said Sgt. Bill Clayton, a Denver cop and head of
the Denver County Police Protection Association. "For us, it's the tools of the trade, like
taking a hammer away from a carpenter," he told me.   For other persons who have committed
past acts of misdemeanor abuse, he says, "There's just no way to enforce it."
<P>     
	Exactly. The new law can be used to take away guns from all persons convicted from now
on.  But even the most ardent gun-control advocates wouldn't dare call for making lists of
domestic abuse violators and systematically ransacking their homes looking for firearms--not
that the idea of it doesn't make them feel warm and tingly all over.
<P>     
	In Denver, two cops with 37 years' experience between them are in danger of losing
their jobs because of the new law. Meanwhile, Clayton points out, "In the state of Colorado, a
convicted felon can get a gun after ten years but if convicted of a misdemeanor domestic
abuse, you get a life sentence [preventing your from] carrying a gun."
<P>     
	"I don't know how they got this [law] through," said Barsness's ex-wife.  "I think
there were a million people sleeping."
<P>     
	Maybe, but the lawmakers were wide awake.  Clinton fervently backed the bill, and the
Senate twice voted for it by a margin of 97-2. House Speaker Newt Gingrich gave it his
explicit support.
<P>     
	This truly was a bipartisan act of cowardice and foolishness.</P>

<title>Fumento: Greens Still Trying to Salvage Their Alar-Stained Reputation - 12/18/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i>December 18, 1996</i><p>
<h2>Greens Still Trying to Salvage Their Alar-Stained Reputation</h2><p>     
<P>
     They're mad as hell and they're not going to take it anymore.  For almost seven years
environmentalists have had to put up with people (like me) crying, "Remember Alar!" as
shorthand for bogus science and health scares. But now, they're striking back.
<P>
     For those who don't recall, the Alar scare began in February, 1989 when reporter Ed
Bradley began a 60 Minutes segment by calling Alar "the most potent cancer-causing agent in our food
supply." Alar, manufactured by Uniroyal Chemical Co., was sprayed on apples to keep them on
trees longer so that fewer would fall to the ground and rot before they could be picked.
<P>
     It was this substance that the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) decided to
scapegoat to illustrate the horrors of man-made chemicals. The 60 Minutes segment was part
of a campaign by a PR firm the NRDC had hired, called Fenton Communications.  The rest of
the campaign consisted of helping reporters write scary articles, enlisting the support of
actress Meryl Streep, and creating an NRDC front group called Mothers and Others for
Pesticide Limits.
<P>
     In short order, terrified people were dumping their applesauce into the trash, apple
juice down the sink, and swearing off apples entirely for "healthier" foods.  (You know, like Hostess
Twinkies.) Soon Uniroyal felt it had no choice but to stop selling its product to apple
growers, some of whom then went bankrupt.
<P>
     In the ensuing months, though, articles, monographs, and even whole books by myself and
many others revealed that the NRDC-Fention effort was, as I put it, "one of the slickest,
most cynical fear campaigns in recent American history."  Few people dispute this nowadays,
and it drives the environmentalists bonkers.
<P>
          Thus author and long-time environmental doomsayer Paul Ehrlich, in his new book
<U>Betrayal of Science and Reason</U>, calls the Alar debunking a "fable." A recent article in the Columbia
Journalism Review (CJR), published at the nation's most prestigious journalism school, was
entitled: "Myths," with the subtitle informing us "The Alar `Scare' Was Real."
<P>
     Their evidence, however, is embarrasingly flimsy and often downright false.  For one,
the NRDC and other environmental groups claim the EPA banned the chemical. CJR writer Elliot
Negin gives a date for the ban, saying the decision was "in late 1989." Ehrlich informs us
that three years late, "the EPA issued a statement reaffirming the sound scientific basis
for banning Alar."
<P>
     Sorry Charlies, but the EPA never banned it in the first place, much less reaffirming
any ban. Once Uniroyal withdrew the product for use by fruit growers, the EPA considered the issue
moot. Further, to this day Alar continues to be used on plants which don't produce food.
<P>
     A simple phone call to the EPA would have revealed this.  But apparently
environmentalist crusaders have better things to do with their time.
<P>
     Any other evidence?  Well, Negin makes much of the fact that Washington State apple
growers lost their suit against 60 Minutes alleging their products were wrongly disparaged.
<P>
     In the wake of the decision in the O.J. Simpson criminal trial, such utter confidence
in the court system is truly touching.  But in any case, the courts didn't rule that Alar is
carcinogenic or evil or anything like that. They simply said the apple growers had failed to
meet the extremely high standards needed to win a suit against a media outlet.
<P>
     Finally, both Negin and Ehrlich and other revisionists remind us that both the EPA and
the International Agency for Research on Cancer had labeled Alar "a probable human carcinogen."
Neither writer points out that the studies these agencies had relied upon to make this
classification later proved to have been terribly sloppy. That's why the EPA had
commissioned several new ones. But the NRDC, rather than await the outcome, decided to
launch its scare campaign instead.
<P>
     Neither writer points out--nor do any other environmentalists--that all the evidence
against Alar was always based on the findings of tumors in mice, while the same doses of chemical
caused no tumors in rats. The EPA had simply arbitrarily decided that mice in this case were
a better surrogate for humans. Had the rats developed the tumors and not the mice, they
could well have decided that mice were the better surrogates.
<P>
     All of this is explained in detail in my book Science Under Siege.  Ehrlich, for one,
quotes from that book repeatedly, in an attempt to refute it.  But rather than meet its arguments
head on, he simply ignores them.
<P>
     This, alas, is all too typical of environmentalists.  Evidence that challenges their
world view is inadmissable to them. All that matters is that their myths live on forever. 
Alar-as-deadly-poison was a myth in the making that was cut off at the knees--and deservedly so.

<title>Fumento: Women's Magazines Are Pink Propaganda - 12/11/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i>December 11, 1996</i><p>
<h2>Women's Magazines Are Pink Propaganda</h2><p>     
<P>
 I don't know about you, but when I want a real scare I don't pick up a Stephen King novel
 or rent a movie like Curse of the Demon.  No, when I want a real bone-chilling I go to my
 neighborhood news stand and look at the covers of the women's and family magazines. Where
 else, I ask you, can you find such headlines plastered over the face of Kathie Lee Gifford
 or Claudia Schiffer:  "Schools That Make Kids Sick," "The Foods That Are Poisoning Your
 Child," "Are Pesticides Poisoning Our Children?" "The Woman Who Stole 5,000 Babies,"
 "Stranger Danger," "The Infidelity Epidemic," and "EPA Warning: How the Sun Can Kill Your
 Kids."
<P>
 My favorite?  Hmm . . . That would probably have to be: "Shocking Report: 
 Babysitters who Maim and Kill."  Boy, that'll keep a parent up at night, won't it?  Or at
 least keep the parent from ever going out again until the children are old enough to stay
 home alone. 
<P>
Professor John Graham of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis did a poll in
which he found that women were far more likely to buy into the latest fad scare than were
men.  While he wasn't sure of the reason, I'll bet these magazines have something to do
with it. The Washington, D.C. watchdog groups Consumer Alert and Media Research Center
appear to agree.  Indeed, their recent study, "Women's Magazine's: A Liberal Pipeline to
Soccer Moms," found that in addition to lipstick and tampons, what these magazines
specialize in selling is fear--and the notion that Big Government is almost always the
solution. Looking at a year of offerings from 13 such magazines, with a combined
circulation of over 66 million, the organizations found most stories on science and risk
issues served no other purpose than scaring the skirts off readers--outnumberingd balanced
articles by two-to-one.
<P>
Among them:
<ul>
<LI>Family Circle in last August's article, "Danger in the House," warned of a "chemical invasion" from cleaning solutions and garden pesticides.  The evidence?  Well, there's this spooky anecdote about a mother who blamed a neighbor's pesticide spraying for her daughters' stomach aches and vomiting.  That's enough for you, isn't it?  After all, mother knows best. 
<LI>McCall's and Better Homes & Gardens warned of pesticide residues in baby food.  The McCall's article warned that babies and children are more sensitive to pesticides than adults (a supposition, not a fact), but never let readers know that government sets pesticide standards to account for individuals who are 1,000 times more sensitive than average. 
<LI>Articles in Mademoiselle, Glamour, and Weight Watchers reported the alleged link between chemicals and breast cancer, without noting that the largest study ever conducted on the subject looked at two of the most often-mentioned culprits -- the insecticide DDT and the insulating liquid PCB -- and found no connections.  Weight Watchers even condemned scientific studies that pointed to such causes as genetics and diet as sexist because they "suggested it was a woman's fault if she developed breast cancer." Next thing you know, even saying the words "breast cancer" will be politically incorrect because it suggests that it's a woman's fault that she has breasts.  And what all this has to do with watching your weight I just can't figure out. 
</ul>
<P>
 Once these magazines have you
 hyperventilating into a paper bag, they then spring upon you the solution to these terrible
 problems. Yes, it's Uncle Sam, or more specifically Uncle Bill and Aunt Hillary.  The
 Consumer Alert/Media Research Center survey found 115 articles with positive portrayals of
 government activism and/or calls for more activism.  There were only 18 negative portrayals
 or calls for less government action.  Of these, 23 stories also asked readers to lobby
 government officials on behalf of expanded government programs. 
<P>
 Having made their readers
 feel bad about the way mankind is treating the environment (when you're describing
 something bad, like polluting, using "mankind" isn't sexist), they then go on to promote
 feel-good environmentalism.  Never mind that even the New York Times magazine recently did
 a cover article affirming what free-market environmentalists have been saying for over a
 decade--that most recycling is a waste of time, energy, and money.  Out of the 15 articles
 in the women's magazines on recycling, each and every one was solidly in favor of it.
 (Actually, probably the last 14 articles were simply recycled versions of the first one.)
<P>
 "Story after story," in these magazines, says Consumer Alert Executive Director Fran Smith,
 "outlines a problem and proposes that a new law be enacted and that women should lobby for
  it."
<P>
   Not for nothing did the Clinton team label its re-election campaign aimed at young
   mothers and women in general as its "Redbook strategy."  The Redbooks of the nation had
   already paved the way for his second term.

<h2>
 "Killer Airbag" Hysteria is the Real Killer
</h2>     
<p>
<dd>
 For all the news lately about the threat that airbags pose to children, you'd think it's
 the Slaughter of the Innocents all over again.  You'd believe you could look out your
 window at any time and see an airbag chasing some poor little boy or girl down the street.
 But no, such is not the case.  The scariest thing about this whole airbag thing is not the
 threat to children but that the media has taken its cue from USA Today, the paper that
 prides itself on promoting hysteria.
<p>
<dd>
 It was USA Today that led the coverage of the missing
 children epidemic in the early 1980s, telling us, "estimates of lost children [per year]
 run as high as 2 million," and asking "how could it happen?"  It also said, "More than
 100,000 children are abducted each year." How could it happen?  It couldn't and didn't. 
 The newspaper was later forced to admit that the two million figure was probably about
 30,000, of which (according to the FBI) only 67 were kidnapped.  Oops.
<p>
<dd>
 More recently, it
 was the first newspaper to inform us of an "epidemic" of  black churches being torched by
 racists.  After six months of incendiary reporting it finally admitted that of over 70
 black church burnings it looked at, only three were clearly done by racists and a third of
 the churches were burned by blacks.  Oops. No matter, there's always a new hysteria to be
 created.
<p>
<dd>
 And so it was that USA Today crack reporters in May kicked off the airbag mania
 with an article running under the inch-high headline, "DEADLY AIR BAGS."  An accompanying
 story was titled, "Why Air Bags Are Killing Children."  If your trembling hand turned to
 the next page you found "Deadly Force: Air Bags Are Claiming the Lives of Children," while
 yet another page blared, "Prescription for Safety Turns Deadly." The rest of the media then
 followed USA Today, which is about as wise as letting Stevie Wonder pilot your plane. 
 Suddenly it's worthy of a headline when a child is so much as injured by an airbag. It's
 gotten to the point where volunteers at busy freeway rest areas spent their Thanksgiving
 handing out fliers warning parents of the danger of these pneumatic beasts.  (USA Today
 proudly displayed a story on this on page one.)
<p>
<dd>
 I've always been a big seat belt fan,
 myself.  They've saved my rear (and the rest of me) twice.  But it's clear that even if you
 do wear a seat belt and especially if you don't, airbags are far more likely to save you
 than to kill you.
<p>
<dd>
 Department of Transportation (DOT) figures show that since 1987, airbags
 have probably kept 1,136 people from being crushed to death, with the life-saving rate
 accelerating rapidly as more and more cars are equipped with them.  In 1995 alone, airbags
 prevented 462 deaths. The trade-off?  Since 1990, DOT says, they have caused 52 deaths,
 including those of 32 children.  You needn't dig out that misplaced pocket calculator to
 see that this comes out to a net savings of a lot of lives. As to those 32 children, in a
 real sense that is 32 too many.  But other than being mauled by a Siberian tiger in New
 York City, there is practically nothing less likely to kill your child than an airbag. 
<p>
<dd>
 Indeed, according to the National Safety Council in Chicago, during the time those 32
 children were killed by airbags, over 15,000 children age 11 or under were killed in car
 accidents for reasons having nothing to do with the devices. But hard facts like these are
 the first casualty of panics. And so, reacting to the hysteria, DOT has decided to relax
 the law making it illegal for a mechanic to disconnect a vehicle owner's airbag.  The
 utterly unavoidable result is that people will die in crashes whose lives would otherwise
 have been saved by the devices. And for what?  As tiny as your child's risk of being killed
 or injured by an airbag currently is, you can reduce it even further by simply by sliding
 the passenger seat all the way back, and by making sure your child is wearing a seat belt. 
<p>
<dd>
 Last year, over half the children killed by airbags were not wearing seat belts.  The
 one-year-old girl who just died from an airbag was, according to the coroner, not properly
 restrained. To reduce your child's near-zero risk from airbags to absolutely zero, just put
 him or her in the back seat. Unfortunately, panicky people don't think about such things. 
 So it's off to the auto shop to have both the passenger and driver side bags disconnected.
 The first time a person is impaled on a steering wheel or squished by a dashboard because
 of a disconnected airbag, I hope we read about THAT in the papers.  But don't expect to
 hear about it from USA Today.

<title>Fumento:Bill Clinton's Domestic Abuse Cruise Missile - 9/05/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i>  September 5, 1996</i><p>
<h2>  Bill Clinton's Domestic Abuse Cruise Missile</h2><p>     
Bill Clinton has made it clear yet again that he likes cruise 
missiles, with their ability to slip under radar screens and do damage 
without endangering the guy who launched them.  No, I'm not talking 
about Iraq, but rather Clintons' advocacy of a federal law prohibiting 
those convicted of domestic abuse misdemeanors from ever again being 
able to legally obtain a gun.  I've counted at least five things it 
accomplishes: <p>
<ul>
<li> It appeals to feminists. 

<li> It appeals to Americans' natural desire to protect women and 
children. 

<li> It promotes "gun law creep," whereby inch by inch we make fewer and 
fewer people able to legally obtain and keep guns. 

<li> It promotes "federal power creep."  See above. 

<li> It leaves the public with the impression that Clinton is a no-
nonsense "law and order" president. 
</ul>
If you're thinking that none of this has anything to do with making 
anybody safer, you're missing the point--there's an election hard upon 
us, and as Clinton taught Bush there's no such thing as a safe lead. <p>

But let's hear out Cruise Clinton. <p>

Said the president, "if you're stalking or harassing women or 
children, you shouldn't have a gun."  Can he not know that the 1994 
Violence Against Women Act which he signed already forbids the sale of 
guns to stalkers and harassers who are under court restraining orders? <p>

"The problem is there is one class of misdemeanors that tend to be 
particularly violent, where we know there's a potential for future 
violence," said Clinton.  "And that is the painful area of domestic 
violence." <p>

In fact, as Woman's Freedom Network Vice-President Cathy Young notes, 
"There is no evidence that domestic violence misdemeanor offenses are 
more violent than non-domestic misdemeanor assaults."  We'll just 
chalk that one up to presidential puffery. <p>

With domestic violence, says Clinton, "often there's a plea bargain 
which goes from a felony to a misdemeanor. " <p>

Sure, but that's true of all felonies. "Virtually all available 
research shows that when the levels of injury are the same, domestic 
assaults are no less likely than non-family assaults to be prosecuted 
as felonies," Young told me.  <p>

To the extent such plea-bargaining is a problem, it can be dealt with 
"three strikes and you're out" or other mandatory sentencing laws.  
Increasingly, states are passing just such laws.  Our purpose should 
be to try to make sure those guilty of felonies are punished with laws 
meant for felons, not to apply felony laws to persons who commit 
misdemeanors. <p>

"If you commit an act of violence against your wife or child, you 
shouldn't have a gun," thunders Clinton, who is such a fatherly type 
that he plans to adopt a child if the polls show Dole getting to 
close. <p>

But it's not that simple because the definition of "violence" can 
stretch from all the way from an unwanted grab to strangling your 
spouse and tossing the body into a meat grinder. <p>0

In most states, misdemeanor assault is any intentional touching 
without consent.  That includes such things as poking someone with 
your finger. In a New Jersey case, a man was convicted of misdemeanor 
assault not for punching his girlfriend but rather the couch she was 
sitting on.  Some states allow misdemeanor assault convictions for 
yelling at someone.  Los Angeles hero Rodney King accused his wife of 
assault because she yelled at him in the car for not being able to 
read a map.  (Rather than press charges, he promptly ran her down.) <p>

All of these are wrong, which is why the law covers them.  You can 
serve "hard time" for misdemeanor domestic violence.  But take away a 
person's right to own a gun for life because of an arm grab or heated 
words?  Slap that person in the same category as a brute who blackens 
his wife's eyes because she burned the toast?    <p>

Ironically, one outcome of this might be that many prosecutors and 
judges would feel sorry for the defendant faced with a 
disproportionate penalty, and be tempted to let him or her go scott-
free.  <p>

Conceivably Clinton's proposal could keep guns out of the hands of 
some violent people, if we make the shaky assumption that violent 
people when turned away from stores won't just go out and buy their 
guns on the street.  It's also true that we would keep guns out of the 
hands of some violent people if we forbade them for other arbitrary 
reasons, such as having blow-dryed gray hair and a bulbous nose. <p>

But the point of any law that denies somebody the right to own a gun 
should be to match as closely as possible that denial to persons most 
likely to use them for violence. There's no evidence that this is the 
case here. <p>

One figure cited in support of Clinton's proposal is that according to 
the Justice Department, of the 1.7 million incidents of domestic 
violence reported each year, 88,000 involve firearms.  That comes out 
to 5 percent of such incidents, and it doesn't mean anybody was shot 
or even that bullets were fired.  Considering that almost half of all 
Americans own guns, guns and domestic violence hardly go hand in hand. <p>

Like most gun control measures, this proposal is essentially 
irrelevent to crime control.  If you think reelecting Clinton and 
piling on more federal laws are worthy goals, you may not mind.  
Otherwise you'll see this as the harmful distraction and campaign 
stunt that it is. <p>

<title>Fumento:"Dr. Death" Takes Us Down the Slippery Slope - 8/28/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i> August 28, 1996</i><p>
<h2>"Dr. Death" Takes Us Down the Slippery Slope</h2><p>
       


He's the sickest American cult figure since Charles Manson, with two 
major differences. First, he's killed almost eight times as many 
people. Second, he's still walking around, free to kill again. And 
kill he will. Some call him an Angel of Mercy, but he's better known 
as Dr. Death. <p>

As I write this, Dr. Jack Kevorkian has put down/put to 
sleep/euthanized persons 35, 36, 37, and 38, though lately he's been 
killing faster than I can type. None of the people appear to have been 
imminently close to death. One had Lou Gehrig's disease, the same 
illness that Dr. Steven Hawkings had for decades when he penned a 
best-selling book and became world famous. Two had multiple sclerosis, 
the disease Annette Funicello had (and has) when she starred in her 
film autobiography. <p>

The fourth, 42-year-old Judith Curren, was a nurse and a mother of two 
young children. She was overweight and depressed and believed she 
suffered from a vague (though sometimes real) malady called chronic 
fatigue syndrome (CFS). None of these are terminal, and the woman's 
belief she had CFS may well have been a manifestation of depression. <p>

Further, severe depression is often accompanied by a desire to commit 
suicide. But this is a highly treatable condition, and in any case a 
severely depressed person no more has the capacity to "elect" to die 
than a five-year-old girl can "elect" to engage in sex. <p>

But no matter, for Dr. Death continues to be treated like some gallant 
crusader. "Dr. Jack Kevorkian stepped up his campaign for doctor-
assisted suicide," began a recent Associated Press article. <p>

Wrong. Kevorkian no more kills in the name of any higher cause, 
including doctor-assisted suicide, than a lion rips out an antelope's 
throat in the name of balancing the eco-system. The lion is driven by 
instinct; Kevorkian by something we used to call evil.  <p>

The man is a ghoul. Some of us like to watch female volleyball; 
Kevorkian likes to watch people die. A much-ignored 1993 Newsweek 
article documented that in the 1950s, while studying to be a 
pathologist, Kevorkian made regular visits to terminally ill patients 
and peered deeply into their eyes. He wanted to watch the sparkle of 
life disappear. "There was no practical application," he admitted 
later. "I was curious, that's all." <p>

Later he advocated surgical experimentation on the bodies--
particularly the brains--of live death row prisoners. Later still he 
expanded his idea to encompass other persons, including "comatose, 
mentally incompetent or otherwise completely uncommunicative 
individuals . . . " <p>

Earlier this year, thinking he was making some salient point, 
Kevorkian invoked Christ's death, saying "Do you think it's dignified 
to hang from wood with nails through your hands and feet?" He said, 
"Had Christ died in my van . . . it would have been far more 
dignified." <p>

Look Jack, it's not just that a van would look rather bizarre hanging 
above the altar of my church. When Christ sacrificed his life, he knew 
he was setting himself up for crucifixion, the most painful and 
undignified mode of execution in use. Again, Kevorkian shows he is 
devoid of understanding of humanity. And it speaks volumes about the 
pro-euthanasia movement that it pretends that this man is a crusader 
for a larger cause, rather than a grown-up version of the little boy 
who pulls wings off flies.<p>

Not that some euthanasia supporters aren't just a bit queasy after 
this latest round of killings. "Sooner or later, someone will die for 
the wrong reasons," conceded a USA Today editorial, not specifying 
what the right reasons are. <p>

Others warned that if we don't watch it, we'll slide down the slippery 
slope. As if we haven't already? Jack Kevorkian IS a one-man slippery 
slope. He keeps loosening the definition of who "deserves" to die. 
Originally he saw the need to pretend that his 
clients/patients/victims were in great pain and on death's doorstep. 
But after the latest killings he admitted, "It had nothing do with 
lethality. It's quality of life . . . . Quality of life." <p>

This evolution was utterly predictable. It's called the "camel's nose" 
effect. The camel puts his nose into the tent to see if he can get 
away with it. If so, he keeps moving in until he's fully inside, hump 
and hooves. <p>

Those on both sides of the euthanasia debate in the United States are 
fully aware of the history of legal euthanasia in the Netherlands. It 
began with a doctor responding to the wishes of her terminally ill 
mother who was in much pain. Within a few decades it encompassed 
killing infants born with non-fatal diseases--Down's syndrome and 
spina bifida. Patients in persistent vegetative states, often 
incorrectly referred to as "comatose," are also now legally killable 
in Holland. <p>

According to a Dutch government survey, doctors there kill some 20,000 
patients a year, most without the patients' consent. The difference is 
that the Dutch took decades to get to that point, while Kevorkian is 
trying to bring the whole camel in within a matter of years. And 
damned if he isn't getting away with it. <p>

We need to ask ourselves right now if we want to follow Dr. Death down 
the Dutch path or if we're going to treat human life as sacred. In 
other words, we tell our doctors that they are to follow the 
Hippocratic Oath they took and "first do no harm." Executioners kill; 
doctors are supposed to heal. And "Dr. Death" is a contradiction in 
terms. <p>

<title>Fumento:The EPA vs. Clean Air - 8/22/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i> August 22, 1996</i><p>
<h2>  The EPA vs. Clean Air</h2><p>



                    

DENVER, COLORADO  "Make a better mousetrap and the world will beat a 
path to your door," goes an old saying. Well, not always.  In some 
cases you just may find a 300-pound government gorilla obstructing the 
way. Such has been the experience of University of Denver chemistry 
professor Donald Stedman. <p>

Stedman has developed a machine which, when hidden by the side of the 
road, can detect how much exhaust a car puts out as it drives by. High 
emissions trigger a video camera which films both the car and its 
license plate.  This allows the municipality using the device to send 
a letter (perhaps backed by a fine) to the violator informing him that 
his car must be repaired. <p>

As present, the standard practice in high-pollution areas is to 
subject cars to regular inspection and maintenance programs. The 
problem is that drivers with the dirtiest cars can pass the test by 
pouring a commercial additive into their gas tank. (Since they refused 
to pay me a product placement fee, I won't tell you the name.) Or they 
can pass by tampering with the exhaust system.  <p>

Studies with remote sensors have shown that such cheating is rampant. <p>

But drivers who happen upon remote sensors have no ability to cheat. 
The effectiveness of such devices has been demonstrated repeatedly in 
the U.S. as well as in Canada and Great Britain.  Indeed, they have 
now been put into regular use in various parts of California; Phoenix; 
Ontario, and Stedman's hometown of Denver. <p>

"If we want to have any success in reducing emissions from autos, we 
must employ remote sensing technology" says Buzz Breedlove, the 
assistant director for the California Research Bureau. <p>

But the EPA, whose mission is supposed to be preserving the 
environment, doesn't like remote sensing. <p>

Why?  Breedlove told me that "the staunchest opponent of remote 
sensing" he knows once said, "The problem with remote sensing is that 
it will clean up all the cars  and we won't be able to justify a 
centralized program on a cost-effective basis." <p>

For over a decade now, the EPA has put all its eggs in one basket: the 
inspection and maintenance program. In part, this is because such 
testing requires a large centralized bureaucracy to administer it. <p>

This involves--surprise--lots of money!  The tests cost about $25 per 
car.  Remote sensing, by contrast, is about 50 cents per test. <p>

Although the EPA has improved the efficiency of its testing devices, 
they will never be truly cost efficient. "It's not a mechanical 
engineering problem," Stedman observes, "It's a human behavior 
problem. The driver's interest isn't in reducing emissions; it's in 
passing the test." <p>

Hence, if the driver thinks he'll fail and be liable for perhaps 
hundreds of dollars in repairs, he'll cheat. And the EPA's equipment 
can't stop him. <p>

But pride, reputations, and bureaucratic inertia refuse to allow the 
EPA to admit this.  And so, while remote sensors work to clean up the 
air, the EPA is working against remote sensors. <p>

First, the agency actively discriminates against state and local 
governments that want to use remote sensors. Under the Clean Air Act, 
governments are not given credit for actually cleaning up the air. 
Rather, they're given credit for running programs that the EPA says 
SHOULD BE cleaning up the air. And in its credit formula, remote 
sensing counts for very little.   <p>

Second, EPA has now cut off further funding for Stedman's lab, 
hampering his efforts to enable it to detect more types of pollutants. 
For six years he got a fairly small but, to him, vital amount of his 
research money from the EPA. No more. <p>

But hey, things are tough all over, right? Money is tight these days. 
But not for things that suit the EPA's  agenda--namely more government 
regulation. <p>

Competitive Enterprise Institute scholar Jonathan Adler has documented 
that from 1993 to 1995 alone, the radical environmental group the 
Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) received almost $2 million of 
your and my tax dollars funneled through the EPA. That's 20 times what 
Stedman's shop was receiving annually. <p>

The American Lung Association (ALA) received almost as much from the 
EPA. Unlike the NRDC, the ALA does some good work.  But part of what 
it does with all that cash is to lobby for EPA-proposed mandates.  It 
even sues the EPA to make regulations stricter.  Since by law the EPA 
can't lobby itself, it throws money at organizations who will do it 
for them.   <p>

In fact, the EPA even gives cash to a group called the Consumer 
Federation of America, which publishes literature disparaging remote 
sensing. <p>

The EPA's mandate isn't to promote bureaucratic self-interest and 
political lobbying, but to clean up the environment. Supporting remote 
sensing would do just that. <p>

<h2>Gun Control Advocates Shoot Blanks At Study</h2><p>

A new report on the impact of laws allowing persons to carry concealed 
guns has gun control advocates shooting wildly and missing their 
target by a mile. <p>

The report, co-authored by law professor John Lott and economist John 
Mustard, both of the University of Chicago, concluded  "allowing 
citizens to carry concealed weapons deters violent crimes and it 
appears to produce no increase in accidental deaths.  If those states 
which did not have right-to-carry concealed gun provisions had adopted 
them in 1992, approximately 1,570 murders; 4,177 rapes; and over 
60,000 aggravated assaults would have been avoided yearly."    <p>

Think of it; that's more murders than the combined total of 21 states 
last year.  That's over 4,000 women last year alone who were violently 
sexually assaulted. <p>

In percentage terms, the authors found that when state concealed 
handgun laws went into effect in a county, murders fell by 8.5 
percent, and rapes and aggravated assaults fell by 5 and 7 percent, 
respectively.  (Thirty-one states now have such laws). <p>

Lott and Mustard, however, probably feel like they've been assaulted 
after the smearing they received in much of the press. <p>

For example, director of the Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence 
Dan Kotowski blasted the study as biased because it was funded by the 
Olin Corporation, which owns Winchester, Inc., a firearms 
manufacturer.  An <i>Associated Press</i> (AP) story and that of individual 
newspapers aired the Kotowski allegations as fact, but they were wrong 
several times over. <p>

Lott, as the John M. Olin Professor of Law and Economics at Chicago, 
is paid by the Olin FOUNDATION, which funds guest academic positions 
at institutions throughout the country.  It does not choose the 
scholars who fill these slots, but leaves it up to the institution.  
Nor does it choose their research projects.  John Olin did make money 
in firearms, but died in 1982, endowing the foundation that bears his 
name.  Since then there has been no connection between the Olin 
Corporation and the Olin Foundation. <p>

AP has now issued a retraction of the allegations.   <p>

On the other hand, Kotowski gets ALL his money from advocating handgun 
control. <p>

Meanwhile, Douglas Weil--who as research director at the Center to 
Prevent Handgun Violence also makes all his money from advocating 
handgun laws--claimed the Chicago study "goes against well-established 
evidence," citing specifically a University of Maryland report from 
last year which claimed to show that concealed weapons laws cause 
homicides to go up. <p>

Really?  The Chicago report looked at the entire nation over the last 
15 years for which data were available.  The authors of the University 
of Maryland study, conversely, picked out just five cities to report 
on out of the hundreds it could have chosen.  They didn't even use the 
same sample period for the cities, but the periods they did choose 
were just a few years each. <p>

So somehow a study that uses specially-picked cities and specially-
picked periods of time is better than one covering the whole nation 
over a decade and a half.  It makes sense to the gun control 
advocates. <p>

The nation's top law enforcement official also weighed in.  Asked 
about the Chicago report at a press conference, Attorney General Janet 
Reno avoided giving direct comment, saying she hadn't yet read it.  
But Reno, the former chief state prosecutor in Florida's Dade County, 
added her impression that Florida's concealed weapons law "didn't seem 
to be effective." <p>

Oh no?  When that law was passed in 1987, Florida had the nation's 
highest murder rate and it was going up.  Immediately it began 
dropping steadily year by year, falling almost 30 percent by 1994 and 
putting Florida under the national average in homicides.  Of over 
320,000 licenses issued between the time the law passed and the end of 
January of this year, only 58 have been revoked because the owner 
committed a crime. <p>	

So why does Miss Reno think the law wasn't effective?  Maybe it has 
something to do with the view she stated to a B'nai B'rith gathering 
in Ft. Lauderdale in 1991 that, "The most effective means of fighting 
crime in the United States is to outlaw the possession of any type of 
firearm by the civilian populace." <P>

Naturally, some gun control advocates would rather avoid the need to 
use data at all.  "It defies common sense," said Kotowski at his press 
conference, "to think that putting more guns on the streets is going 
to make us safer." <p>

Actually it makes perfect sense.  If a criminal thinks you might be 
packing something more powerful than a tiny canister of pepper spray, 
he might be just a bit more hesitant to rape, rob, or kill you.  
That's common sense, and the Chicago study simply backs it up. <p>

Common sense also suggests that if this were happening, criminals 
might compensate somewhat by committing more property crimes.  And the 
Chicago study found just that.  Criminals respond "to the threat of 
being shot" by substituting "less risky crimes," state the Chicago 
authors.  One example is burglaries in which the criminal has "cased" 
the house to make sure no one will be home. <p>

That seems a small price to pay.  I don't know about you, but I'd 
rather have my home or car broken into than be smashed over the head 
for my wallet or have my girlfriend raped.  I'll bet even most handgun 
control advocates feel the same way.   <p>

<title>Fumento:  Ignored Study Finds Pollution Program Costly and Fuelish - 8/07/96</title>

   <h2>
         Ignored Study Finds Pollution Program Costly and Fuelish</h2>
<P>
(DENVER, COLORADO) Oxygenated fuels started here in Denver and took 
the nation by storm--sort of like the Denver Boot, a nasty contraption 
they clamp onto your wheel when you don't pay your tickets.  But 
unlike the boot, which works all too well (don't ask me how I know!), 
it turns out that oxy fuels may be virtually worthless, yet cost 
motorists across the country billions of dollars. 
<P>
That's the conclusion of a recently-released report by the National 
Research Council (NRC), an arm of the National Academy of Sciences. 
The report has been utterly ignored outside of the Denver area, yet it 
concerns municipalities--and drivers--across the country. 
<P>
Oxygenated fuels, generally shortened to "oxy fuels", are made by 
putting an additive into gasoline, usually either ethanol made from 
corn or a chemical derived from natural gas called MTBE. These 
additives put more oxygen into the gasoline, and in theory make your 
car burn more cleanly. Allegedly they especially reduce the production 
of carbon monoxide, which reaches relatively high levels in many 
places during the winter. 
<P>
About 27 areas around the country are using oxy fuels during the 
winter months.  They are not provided as options, but rather forced 
into your gas tank by law.  Which is the only way local governments 
can get motorists to use them, since they not only cost as much as 
seven cents a gallon more than regular gasoline but also decrease 
mileage by at least 2-3 percent. 
<P>
As to how much this is costing the nation as a whole, bizarrely enough 
the EPA says it doesn't know.  "That should be one of the easiest 
things to identify," says Carleton Howard, an atmospheric scientist at 
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, 
Colorado. 
<P>
In any case, the Colorado Health Department says the program has cost 
the Denver area alone about $14 million a year since 1988 and critics 
say it could be twice that.  It could therefore easily be setting back 
the nation over half a billion a year. 
<P>
And for what?  We don't know, says the NRC.  Nobody knows. 
<P>
The Colorado Department of Health (CDH) instituted the oxy fuels 
program back in 1988 under pressure from lobbyists funded in great 
part by the huge grain conglomerate, Archer Daniels Midland (ADM).  
ADM is the biggest producer of the oxy-fuel additive ethanol.  It has 
also been supporting an activist who goes around saying that ethanol's 
chief rival, MTBE, makes people sick. 
<P>
  The CDH concluded the oxy-fuels program was a resounding success and 
made it permanent in Denver.  Mayor Federico Pena (now Secretary of 
Transportation) crowed about it, the Environmental Protection Agency 
crowed about it, and next thing you know, Congress was requiring it 
around the country. 
<P>
But CDH had based its approval on two findings.  First, it said that 
carbon monoxide levels in Denver's air had gone down significantly 
since the program was instituted.  Actually the city's carbon monoxide 
levels had been dropping yearly since the 1970s, primarily due to the 
installation of catalytic converters on cars.  Ah!  Details, details, 
said the CDH.  Don't bother us with details! 
<P>
Second, it put together a nice computer model that it claimed showed 
that an area-wide oxy-fuels program would reduced carbon monoxide by 
29 percent. 
<P>
But while computers don't lie, liars compute.  The NRC found that the 
most optimistic study which actually measured carbon monoxide 
reductions from oxy fuels found a 16 percent drop.  And the author of 
that study, University of Denver chemist Donald Stedman, says that 
even if everybody else had such promising results "it wouldn't be cost 
effective." 
<P>
Other studies such as one conducted by the University of Georgia found 
virtually no reduction in carbon monoxide emissions at all. 
<P>
According to one NRC panel member, University of Colorado professor 
Douglas Lawson, it does seem to be the case that at warm temperatures 
oxy fuels reduce carbon monoxide.  But carbon monoxide is only a cold-
weather problem.  "In some studies there were higher carbon monoxide 
emissions with oxy fuels at that lower temperature than with standard 
fuels," Lawson told me. 
<P>
Further, even if oxy fuels do reduce carbon monoxide, they can 
increase levels of other pollutants.  For example, benzene levels go 
up.  Benzene is strongly suspected to be a human carcinogen. 
<P>
Carbon monoxide, on the other hand, merely replaces oxygen in the 
bloodstream.  While this can be fatal in massive doses (such as when a 
faulty propane heater killed former tennis great Vitas Gerulaitis), in 
even the heaviest levels ever recorded in the air above a city it 
never causes anything more than headaches and fatigue. 
<P>
In any event, notes Lawson, "It's been known since 1983 that majority 
of emissions come from a small percentage of the cars on the road."  
<P>
Says Stedman, "Forcing all drivers to use oxy fuels for the sake of 
those few broken cars is like making everybody take aspirin every day 
for the sake of a few who will get headaches." 
<P>
As a result of the NRC findings, Colorado Governor Roy Romer--hardly 
an enemy of regulation--says he is considering dropping the oxy-fuels 
program.  Unfortunately, since this story was ignored in all the other 
parts of the country that have since adopted it, the evil that 
Colorado's regulators did will live on.

<h2>
           Paper Scares Parents for Politics and Profit
</h2>
<p>
"DEADLY AIR BAGS."  So ran the inch-high headline in USA Today.  "Why Air Bags Are Killing Children," was the title of an accompanying story.  Jump to the next page and you found "Deadly Force: Air Bags are Claiming the Lives of Children," while yet the next jump is entitled "Prescription for Safety Turns Deadly."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
There's nothing a sensationalist paper likes more than running stories about suffering children, and no paper does it better than USA Today. Back in the early 1980s it led the way in publicizing the epidemic of missing children, an epidemic that turned out to be non-existent.  Now there seems to be an epidemic of children crushed under air bags which--oh irony of ironies--are supposed to save lives.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Don't get me wrong.  I'm not the world's biggest proponent of air bags.  I AM one of the world's biggest proponents of seat belts. Twice seat belts have saved my life.  The second time was when my car went flying off a cliff and tumbled down 350 feet.  I would have had just a few scratches had my air bag not then--after the tumbling had stopped--gone off and bruised my face.  Gee, thanks a lot.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But that's the nature of the beast.  Presently air bags only protect you in head-on collisions.  And while they don't provide much additional protection beyond seat belts, they apparently do help a little, saving a little over 500 lives a year.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Unless, it seems, you're a small child.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
According to USA Today, probably 20 children will be killed by air bags this year, ten more than will have their lives saved by the devices.  Now ten children is ten children, no doubt about that.  But this year, according to the National Safety Council in Chicago, about 1,100 children between the ages of 0 to 4 will be killed in motor vehicle accidents.  An additional 2,000 will die who are between the ages of 5 and 11.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
With that many deaths, it is hard to imagine any aspect of motor vehicles less likely to kill your child than air bags.  Indeed, it is hard to imagine anything that can possibly kill your child that will kill fewer children this year than air bags.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Naturally, USA Today does everything it can to exaggerate the scope of these deaths.  Of 22 children known to have been killed by air bags since 1993, it pictures fully 12 of them.  For each and every child on which it was able to obtain records, it lists their name, age, home town, and date of death.  Their anguished parents are repeatedly quoted.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Meanwhile, the thousands of other children killed in other ways since then by car accidents go unmentioned, and even the number goes unlisted.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Yeah, yeah, but aren't I missing the big point here, that these devices that are supposed to save lives are taking them?  No, because tradeoffs with safety devices are commonplace.  Seat belts, for example, save over 5,000 American lives each year but every once in a while somebody whose life would have been saved if they had been thrown clear was instead trapped in their vehicle by a seat belt.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Air bags do save lives.  Last year, according to National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) figures, air bags saved 570 lives and took 12, including eight children.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The real point here is that while we're off  turning little bogeymen into giants, giant bogeymen are stalking the land but not getting huge spreads in USA Today or elsewhere.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
A fourth of all children in this country are now obese, setting them up for a lifetime of disease and early death.  Schools are steadily dropping physical education programs from their curricula and nobody's complaining.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Half of all black children in this country, according to Berkeley biologist Bruce Ames, are suffering broken chromosomes due to lack of folic acid in their diets.  Broken chromosomes often lead to cancer. Adding folic acid to the diet is a cinch, but parents worried about airbags and all the other media-fabricated scares of the week--from Alar to power line electromagnetic fields to pit bull attacks--don't even know this.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Of course, as few deaths as air bags cause, they could be made to cause even fewer.  Many years ago regulators such as Joan Claybrook, who was then President Carter's head of NHTSA and is now at the Naderite Center for Auto Safety, suspected that air bags posed a risk to children. Nonetheless, she pushed full speed ahead and child safety precautions were never built in.  But whose fault was that?  Why, says USA Today, Ronald Reagan's of course!
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"'If I had gone back another four years, it's entirely possible we'd have gone back and rewritten the (air bag) standard' to better account for children," USA Today quotes Claybrook as saying. "But Ronald Reagan ousted Carter," says the paper, "foreclosing Claybrook's chance to revise the standard."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Entirely possible"?  She just needed four more years?  It's bad enough to use pictures of cute dead kids to sell papers, but turning them into political fodder--well, that's just cold.

<h2>
The Great Black Church-burning Hoax
</h2>
<p>
Responding to the reported wave of southern black church burnings, 
President Clinton proclaimed that "Racial hostility is the driving 
force" behind the church burnings and said, "I want to ask every 
citizen in America to say we . . . we are not slipping back to those 
dark days." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Okay, Mr. President, I'll say it.  I'll say it because this "epidemic 
of hatred" is a fraud.  A myth.  A deliberate hoax.  There is no good 
evidence of  any increase in black church burnings. There is, however, 
evidence, that a single activist group has taken the media and the 
nation on a wild ride. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
It turns out there is no good federal data on black church arsons.  
The FBI doesn't keep such statistics, and the Department of Justice 
doesn't usually break them down by white and black churches or arson 
and accidents.  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms only 
tracks federal fires and those it's specifically asked to investigate. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
A private group, the National Fire Protection Association, keeps 
careful track of church arsons.  While their data don't break down 
churches by race, they do show a dramatic drop in the number of church 
arsons, from 1,420 in 1980 to 520 in 1994. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Though arson committed against any house of worship is especially 
heinous, it should be reassuring to know there have been far fewer 
recently than there used to be.     
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
So who is giving out these data suggesting it's open season on black 
churches?  It turns out the main source--indeed, the one which started 
the whole thing--is far from impartial.  It is the Atlanta-based 
Center for Democratic Renewal, whose self-proclaimed mission is to 
work "with progressive activists and organizations to build a movement 
to counter right-wing rhetoric and public policy initiatives." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Originally called the National Anti-Klan Network, it changed its name 
when the Klan virtually fell apart in the 1980s.  But far from seeing 
that as a sign of declining bigotry, it has continued for more than a 
decade to issue statements and reports "discovering" a sudden 
resurgence in racist activity. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The CDR's agenda goes well beyond rooting out genuine bigotry; the 
group tars mainstream conservatives with the same brush as racist 
criminals.  The Rev. C.T. Vivian, chairman of the CDR board said,  
"There's only a slippery slope between conservative religious persons 
and those that are really doing the burning." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In late March, the CDR held a press conference and released a 
preliminary report showing a tremendous surge in black church arsons 
from 1990 to the present.  From there it's been a media snowball, with 
over 2,200 stories written on the subject to date--including three 
huge consecutive layouts in USA Today. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"You're talking about a well-organized white-supremacist movement," 
the Rev. Mac Charles Jones, a CDR board member told one paper.  "This 
is domestic terrorism," he told CNN. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But after numerous law enforcement agencies concluded there didn't 
seem to be any contact between those arsonists who had been arrested, 
others have blamed, as Jesse Jackson put it, "a cultural conspiracy."  
The "ringleaders" are everyone from talk radio hosts to Supreme Court 
Justice Clarence Thomas to the religious right. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Mary Frances Berry, chairwoman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, 
said the Christian Coalition "created the context for the fires." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The CDR report claims there have been 90 arsons against black churches 
in nine southern states since 1990, with the number rising every year 
up to 35 in 1996 as of  June 18.  Each culprit "arrested and/or 
detained," it stresses, has been white. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But when I contacted the law enforcement officials of several states 
on the CDR list, a very different picture emerged. The CDR, it turned 
out, regularly ignored fires set by blacks and those that occurred in 
the early part of the decade, and labeled fires as arsons that were 
not--all in an apparent effort to make black church torchings appear 
to be an escalating phenomenon. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
For example CDR lists ten churches allegedly torched in Alabama, but 
State Fire Marshall John Robison says that only one of these was a 
confirmed arson.  All the others were accidental, undetermined, or 
weren't fires at all but vandalisms. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
CDR somehow managed to omit three bonafide black church arsons that 
took place in Alabama in 1994.  In two cases the culprits were black. 
Moreover, the group left out ten black church arsons that took place 
before 1994, creating the illusion that the burning of black churches 
is a recent phenomenon. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Even the claim that black churches have been singled out for arson is 
questionable.  In 1995, according to USA Today, there were 45 arsons 
against white churches and 27 against black ones in the surveyed 
states. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Other than saying that some black churches over the years have fallen 
prey to racists, we can't easily infer motives. "We have not uncovered 
in [Alabama's] 38 cases a single piece of information to substantiate 
racially-motivated fires," said Robison.  Further, "There have been no 
dramatic increases, except for this year because of the media hype."  
Other states' officials have told him the same. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Here lies the ultimate irony.  By claiming there has been an epidemic 
of black church burnings, it appears that in recent months they have 
actually caused one. They have also fomented tremendous racial 
division and caused great fear among southern black churchgoers. That 
which the Ku Klux Klan can no longer do, a group established to fight 
the Klan has done for them.

<h2>
Old Law Continues to Be a Highway Killer
</h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">
Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>
We often hear that to live longer, most of us need to lose weight.  
But did you know that when it comes to automobiles, losing weight is a 
killer? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
That's the conclusion of a draft National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration (NHTSA) study just evaluated by the National Academy of 
Sciences (NAS).  It found that for every 100 pounds shaved off the 
average weight of cars, 322 more Americans will die each year in 
traffic accidents. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The NAS panel declined to endorse the report, but did not specifically 
reject the 322 death figure. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
That estimate is considerably higher than the 200 deaths  a year cited 
in a 1991 NHTSA report. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And it should make us re-evaluate an anachronistic law that's turned 
an agency with "Safety Administration" in its name into a killer. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The law is CAFE, which stands for Corporate Average Fuel Economy 
standards.  Congress enacted it in the mid-1970s as a means to 
increase the fuel economy of cars and reduce our dependence on foreign 
oil.  It mandates that the cars sold by any manufacturer selling in 
the United States must average at least 27.5 miles per gallon. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Since then, we've fought a war which made clear that nobody can tamper 
with our foreign oil supplies.  The post-war period has shown that the 
world has such a glut of oil that even with one of its major producers 
(Iraq) out the business, prices when adjusted for inflation are as low 
as they've ever been. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Yet CAFE remains on the books and it continues to kill.  Here's why. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
There are numerous ways in which auto makers have made their vehicles 
more fuel efficient.  Engines have been improved, tires have been 
stiffened so they balloon less at high speeds, car bodies have been 
made to cause less wind resistance. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But for all this, the easiest way to improve mileage is still to make 
a car lighter or to simply sell more lighter cars and fewer heavier 
ones. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
NHTSA has calculated that every 10 percent reduction car weight, on 
average, produces and 8 percent reduction in fuel consumption. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And there's the rub.  For as car companies have sold more lighter 
cars, there have been more deaths as a result. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In what is still the best peer-reviewed work on the subject, Robert 
Crandall of the Brookings Institute and John Graham of Harvard 
calculated that CAFE had caused about 500 pounds to be cut from 
automobiles and that this 500 pound reduction was causing from 2,200 
to 3,900 fatalities per year. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
They found that each 100 pounds shaved off cost 440 to 780 lives--
somewhat above NHTSA's calculation but the point is the same.  
Lightness kills. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In defense of CAFE, NHTSA has pointed out that since it was enacted, 
automobile death rates have gone down considerably. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Sure they have, but that's because on a per-vehicle miles traveled 
basis deaths have been going down since the 1920s.  The point is they 
would have declined even further but for CAFE. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Another argument is that cars are safer than ever because of things 
like airbags and crumple zones that make the car collapse upon impact 
in such a way as to protect passengers. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This, too, is true but irrelevant.  Were it not for CAFE those cars 
would be safer yet.     
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Indeed, one study shows that an airbag is the equivalent of about 485 
pounds.  So the airbag that you think makes you so much safer really 
just, on average, offsets CAFE. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
NHTSA contends that while cars have gotten lighter, there's no telling 
how much of this is due to CAFE  and how much to market forces.  It 
notes that many consumer items, such as cameras have been downsized by 
manufacturers without any incentive from the government. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But that comparison is "incredibly dumb," points out Sam Kazman, chief 
counsel for the Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C.  
"Cameras are products you carry around on cords around your neck.  
There's a tremendous incentive to make them smaller and lighter.  But 
with fuel prices staying the same, there's no indication that market 
forces have made cars lighter." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Since 1988, Kazman and CEI have fought CAFE, calling it "blood for 
oil."  In 1992 they sued NHTSA over the agency's insistence that CAFE 
wasn't killing anyone.  The court found that NHTSA had used "fudged 
analysis," "statistical legerdemain," and "bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo" 
in order to avoid dealing with CAFE's safety impact. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Unfortunately, NHTSA won the next time the case returned to the court, 
because the judges said that while they were troubled by the safety 
issue, a bureaucratic agency deserves a certain amount of deference. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And so, the deception continues.  As do the deaths. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
If all that's not enough for you, Bill Clinton and Al Gore's 1992 
book, Putting People First proposes raising CAFE standards to 40 miles 
per gallon by the year 2,000 and 45 miles per gallon by 2015.  That 
sounds more like putting people last.

<title>Fumento: Dole Right (Mostly) on Cigarette Addiction - 6/27/96</title>

<h2>            
Dole Right (Mostly) on Cigarette Addiction
</h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">
Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>
When I heard seven tobacco company executives testify before Congress back in 1994 
that smoking wasn't addictive, I thought "These guys are lying through their nicotine-
stained teeth." The issue has resurfaced with Bob Dole's recent remarks at a Kentucky 
rally that, "To some people, smoking is addictive; to others, they can take it or leave it." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Having studied the issue since that original congressional hearing, I've found it's a lot 
more complex than most of us think. In fact, Dole's characterization seems about as 
sound as anything you'll hear on the subject. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
No matter, for Dole is a presidential candidate, and so a tempting--apparently irresistible-
-target. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"The last thing our kids need to hear is a statement from a man who would be president 
that smoking is not addictive," said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif. "Senator Dole, side 
with our kids, not with the tobacco industry."  
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Rep. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said Dole's comments show that Joe Camel -- the cartoon 
advertisement figure -- is in the lead to be his running mate. Mother Jones magazine 
actually took a full-page advertisement out in the New York Times declaring that Joe 
Camel would be Dole's choice for Surgeon General. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Referring to the fact that tobacco companies have been among Dole's biggest campaign 
contributors, Clinton campaign spokesman Joe Lockhart said "Bob Dole should spend 
more time looking at the scientific evidence and less time counting his campaign 
contributions."  
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But you needn't be a recipient of tobacco money to think that this addiction thing is a lot 
smokier than it might seem.  True, a lot of people have had a hard time quitting 
cigarettes, but there are about as many who have managed to quit as are still smoking.  
According to the surgeon general, the vast majority of them gave up the habit without 
formal treatment. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
We live in a country in which a third of us are obese. Virtually all of them will tell you 
they've tried restricting their food intake but just can't keep it up.  Does that make food 
addictive? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One definition of addiction says that the substance in question must have some sort of 
intoxicating effect, and cigarettes do--albeit very slight compared to such drugs as 
cocaine and heroin.  But researchers have found the same thing about chocolate, that it 
raises levels of certain chemicals in the brain and makes you feel better. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Many of us joke about being "chocoholics" but to some who binge on thousands of 
calories of chocolate a day it's no laughing matter.  Indeed, a drug has now been found to 
block chocolate cravings. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But there is no scientific definition of addiction.  Neither the Diagnostic and Statistical 
manual of the American Psychiatric Association nor the World Organization use the term 
addiction.  This allows anybody who wants to use any definition they wish. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Thus, the famous 1964 U.S. Surgeon General's report on smoking concluded that 
smoking was not addictive, though the Surgeon General's office now says it is--a move 
some say is motivated by politics and not science. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ultimately it comes down to how a New York Times headline put it in 1994: "Is Nicotine 
Addictive?  It Depends on Whose Criteria You Use." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But Bob Dole cleverly sidestepped the issue of whether smoking is addictive in general 
and observed that different substances have different effects on different people. You 
really can't argue with that--as much as his opportunistic opponents have tried. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
As it is, however, the issue of addiction is a red herring.  Dole was also right when he 
said, "But I think the more serious question is whether or not the FDA has jurisdiction" 
over cigarettes. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The FDA is using the addiction issue as an excuse to gain the power to regulate tobacco.  
But it routinely regulates drugs that are non-addictive--antibiotics, for instance--while 
forsaking regulation of substances that are. By the same criteria the FDA is applying to 
tobacco, "beverages containing alcohol or caffeine are addictive, but they're not regulated 
as drugs," notes Reason magazine senior editor Jacob Sullum, author of an upcoming 
book on the anti-smoking movement. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Addictiveness is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for FDA jurisdiction," he 
says. Rather, it's just a smokescreen for Commissioner David Kessler to justify the 
sudden reversal of its longstanding position that cigarettes are not covered by the Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act. "They pretend this is a new development," Sullum told me, "but 
people have been talking about the addictive potential of tobacco for hundreds of years." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Only in one respect was Dole truly wrong. He also told the Kentucky crowd, "In effect, if 
they should claim jurisdiction and find that cigarettes are a drug, then in effect, you're 
banning cigarettes and production of tobacco, so it's going to affect a lot of people." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Possibly, but probably not. Kessler and Waxman did initially say that if the FDA decided 
to regulate tobacco as a drug, a ban might be its only option. But now the FDA is instead 
pushing a series of measures ostensibly intended to reduce underage smoking, including 
restrictions on advertising, promotion, and sales. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Personally, I like some of what they propose. Society has traditionally given children less 
leeway to do stupid things than it has adults. But Dole's right in that cigarette regulation 
is best left to the states--and individuals and their parents. Federal Big Brother should--
pun intended--butt out.

<h2>
     Animal Rights Mean Human Wrongs
    </h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">
Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>
Back when I was in college, I attended a meeting of the local animal 
rights organization.  When somebody asked the group leader about using 
animals for medical research she replied (and I'm not making this up) 
"Well, it's our belief that people shouldn't get sick, in which case 
there would be no need for animal testing." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Such awesome smugness is actually par for the course for these people.  
Consider the following statements from Ingrid Newkirk, co-founder and 
vice-president of People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), the 
largest animal rights organization.  
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"A rat is a pig is a dog is a boy." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Medical research is "immoral even if it's essential." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Even if animal testing produced a cure for AIDS, "We'd be against it."  
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And here's the kicker:   "Six million people died in concentration 
camps," she told the Washington Post, "but six billion broiler 
chickens will die this year in slaughter houses." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Somehow I have trouble identifying that chicken breast I ate last 
night with my cousins who died in German camps.  And I must say that 
"Heil Frank Perdue!" seems to lack an ominous ring. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But then, I am a member of the group that constitutes the lowest form 
of animal life.  No, not lawyers--humans. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This week, the animal rights groups are going on the warpath against 
us human types.  They're launching "World Animal Awareness Week," 
beginning June 18th, in Washington, D.C. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Fortunately, the medical community has decided it's mad as hell and 
isn't going to take it anymore. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
They pre-empted Wacky Week by launching their own campaign.  It 
included a press conference, statements by scientists and patients 
affected by animal rights extremism, release of a joint consensus 
letter signed by the nation's leading AIDS organizations supporting 
animal testing, and a report called Endangered Cures, which details 
specific areas of research threatened by animal rights activists. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Animal rights activists aren't called that for nothing.  They don't 
just stand around on street corners politely handing out pamphlets.  
Indeed, they have struck at scores of labs across the country and in 
other nations, smashing equipment and releasing experimental animals--
sometimes killing them in the process. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Among the raids the animal liberators have conducted was one on the 
laboratory of Dr. John Orem, who was using cats in painless research 
on crib death.  Crib death will claim 8,000 babies lives this year. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Everyone who works with experimental animals lives in constant fear of 
harassment, vandalism, and death threats.  Said PETA's medical 
advisor, Dr. Neal Barnard, a few years ago, "We're demoralizing the 
people who think there's a buck to be made in animal research.  And 
they're starting to get scared . . . and they're starting to veer 
away." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But the activists are also waging a war of public opinion with 
misleading ad campaigns, staged photos of animals in pain, and by 
enlisting the support of many celebrities like Paul McCartney, the B-
52s, Kim Basinger, Mary Tyler Moore, Woody Harrelson, and Alec 
Baldwin--the last of whom was later spotted wearing a leather jacket.  
Oops. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"The worst aspect of these campaigns, says Frankie Trull, president of 
the Foundation for Biomedical Research.  "Is the way they have shaped 
public opinion by providing misinformation and playing upon emotions 
of people who love pets." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This is ironic, because if the activists get their way, keeping a pet 
will be outlawed as slavery.  Pet ownership is an "absolutely abysmal 
situation brought about by human manipulation," Newkirk told the 
Washingtonian magazine. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But such views are kept out of the slick adds.  As a result, "They're 
eroding public support that would allow this research to continue," 
Trull told me. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The stakes couldn't be higher.  Animal testing of drugs intended for 
humans is absolutely vital.  Indeed, it's required by law. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"All drugs approved by FDA in last 30 years have to be tested on 
animals," says Wise Young, a professor of neurosurgery at New York 
University Medical Center and medical advisor to actor Christopher 
Reeve. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Without animal testing, he told me, we wouldn't have gotten anti-
hypertension drugs, anti-diabetic drugs, pharmaceuticals for epilepsy, 
or any of the modern anti-depressants.  "It's horrendous the kinds of 
lives people have when they don't have the benefits of research." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
He noted that one drug originally tested on spinal cord injuries in 
humans failed.  But later it was tried in much higher doses in 
animals. There it was found effective and the trials were successfully 
repeated in humans.  This drug was given to Reeve and reduced his 
paralysis to the point where he has been able to resume much of his 
life. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ultimately, the animal rights activists are simply parasites.  They 
benefit just as much from animal-assisted medical research as anyone, 
even while they vigorously oppose it.  Oh sure, they abstain from 
eating hamburgers or wearing raccoon coats. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
On the other hand, they could wear bracelets with tags (similar to 
those worn by persons with penicillin allergies), saying "In case of 
emergency, do not administer any drugs or therapies tested on 
animals." Bet you don't see that any time soon.

               Bill Clinton Again Betrays the Vets

<P>

Wanted for pandering: President William J. Clinton. No, not 
philandering, pandering.  The latest incident: doling out money to 
veterans allegedly suffering from the effects of the herbicide Agent 
Orange, in order to shore up his political support among a group that 
has understandably come to loathe him.  
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Clinton had a PR problem with the military even before he became 
president.  When almost three million of America's sons and daughters 
served their country in Vietnam, he was dodging the draft and figuring 
out a way to smoke marijuana without inhaling.  As president, he had 
barely taken the oath of office when he ordered that homosexuals be 
openly allowed in the military. And now, the greatest insult, his 
lawyer has declared him an active duty serviceman in order to postpone 
Paula Jones's suit against him. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
So with the election just five months off and his opponent a true war 
hero, Clinton decided to open the government coffers to a number of 
Vietnam vets by providing compensation for those who have suffered 
from a rare nerve disease called peripheral neuropathy, who contract 
prostate cancer, or have babies born with spina bifida. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Veterans' Administration has estimated the five-year cost of this 
largesse at $350 million, which of course is too low because early 
estimates always are.  In any case, because prostate cancer is the 
most common malignant tumor in men (about one in ten will eventually 
contract it) and because Vietnam vets are only now starting to reach 
the age where it becomes a major threat, the cost of this giveaway 
will surely reach many billions of dollars. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This might be fair if there were scientific evidence that these 
problems were really being caused by Agent Orange.  But there is not. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Those who were exposed to the very highest levels--the men of 
"Operation Ranchhand" who actually sprayed it--have been intensely 
studied for years. They have shown no more cancers, and their children 
no more birth defects, people with no dioxin or Agent Orange exposure. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Thus, one of the Ranchhand researchers told a House committee in 
April, "The accumulated evidence does not establish that there is a 
cause-and-effect relationship between herbicide exposure and spina 
bifida." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
So where does President Clinton get off on saying there IS a 
connection? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
His support comes from an Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, which is 
an update of an earlier report previously used to grant compensation 
to veterans suffering other diseases such as Hodgkin's disease, non-
Hodgkins lymphoma, and certain respiratory cancers. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
IOM is an arm of the non-governmental National Academy of Sciences.  
Congress asked the group to look into Agent Orange after Congress's 
own Office of Technology Assessment repeatedly found that very few 
ground troops were ever exposed to the herbicide and that no vets or 
their offspring had been shown to suffer health effects from it. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Both IOM studies used methodology that was anything but scientific.  
They largely ignored the volumes of data that showed no link between 
Agent Orange and health effects--the Ranchhander findings--and instead 
looked at studies of  Swedish and Dutch herbicide applicators, and the 
like. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Any study of anybody anywhere in the world with exposure to 
herbicides was used by IOM," explains Michael Gough, director of 
science and risk studies at the Cato Institute, a former chairman of 
the Ranchhand Advisory Committee, and author of the book Dioxin, Agent 
Orange. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One problem: None of these people were exposed to Agent Orange, but 
rather to other types of herbicides, many of which didn't even contain 
dioxin. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Moreover, the studies themselves consistently contradicted each other.  
One might find an excess of lung cancer but not of Hodgkin's disease.  
Another would find an excess of Hodgkin's disease but not of lung 
cancer. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ignoring such inconvenient facts, the IOM--well aware that it was 
working under political parameters and not scientific ones--seized on 
the slightest excuses to indict the herbicides even when the evidence 
weighed heavily on the other side. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
For example, their 1993 report listed 28 studies which looked for 
prostate cancer among persons exposed to herbicide.  Of these, three 
were positive (that is, they found a statistically significant 
increase), one was significantly negative, and 24 didn't go either 
way.  Bingo!  Herbicides cause prostate cancer.  Agent Orange is an 
herbicide.  Ergo, Agent Orange causes prostate cancer! 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"It's unbelievably bad what the IOM did," says Gough. "I think one of 
the major costs of something like this is that all the scientists, 
government and nongovernment, who have done their best to understand 
and explain the health of veterans are now discredited." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Thus, he says, it also bodes ill for getting the truth out on Gulf War 
Syndrome, another alleged disease phenomenon that has more to do with 
politics than science. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ultimately, it is the vets themselves who will lose the most. Yes, 
some will get money, if they contract the right diseases. But at the 
same time, they're being needlessly terrified. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
How many vets will now refuse to have babies because they're afraid 
they will be born with birth defects?  How many will spend the next 
few decades agonizing that because of their Vietnam service they are 
far more likely to contract prostate cancer, a terrible illness to get 
even if you survive it?   
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Once again, Clinton has shown himself the enemy of the military.  And 
it's when he's making a show of being compassionate that he does the 
most damage.

<h2>Men & Abortion</h2><p>
<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html">
<b><i>Kathleen Howley</i></b></a><br> 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I am going to try to say this without sounding like a man-hating 
feminist. Here goes. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There are few things in life more disgusting than men who, when 
discussing abortion, use the phrase: "I can't tell a woman what to do 
with her body." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's like a password. It's usually pronounced with a self-satisfied 
smile. They're saying, "I'm cool. I'm a supportive kinda guy. I'm 
sensitive to the needs of women." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yea, right.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sometimes, there's a slight reluctance in their voice as they recite 
the mantra. Those are the ones who believe that while they, 
personally, are opposed to abortion, they couldn't tell a 
woman...blah, blah, blah. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
You've heard it before, I'm sure. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In most cases, these guys have never, in their lives, used the words 
"chaste" and "dating" in the same sentence. You can bet that many of 
them are pretty adroit at telling a woman what to do with her body, if 
it happens to serve their own needs. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Abortion, or "choice," as it's euphemistically called, becomes a 
requirement, for many of them, because it has the ability to erase any 
unforeseen problems caused by their lack of moral discretion. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I was at a G.O.P. cocktail party last week, and a man used that old 
line on me: "I can't tell a woman what to do with her body."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I gave him the logical response: "What about the body inside her womb? 
What if it's a male body, a little boy? Surely that can't be her body, 
because she can't be a man and a woman at the same time. Can you tell 
her, in that case?" 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
He looked at me glumly. This was not the response he expected. He 
probably assumed, because I'm a young woman, that I'm pro-choice.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Not a wise move. Three major studies within the last four years show 
that women tend to be more pro-life than men.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Makes sense, doesn't it? We're the ones with the maternal instincts, 
and if we know the facts of life -- meaning all the stuff you never 
read in the newspaper, such as what an abortion does to an unborn 
child -- many of us come down on the side of the baby. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I've been around enough men to know that they occasionally daydream 
about great feats they would perform if, for example, they suddenly 
found themselves trapped, with their whole platoon, under enemy fire. 
It's one of the most charming qualities of men, this desire to prove 
themselves to be brave and fearless. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But, so many men fail to realize that all around them, in our modern 
world, are opportunities to show their valor. Every day, they are 
confronted with opportunities to witness to the truth -- situations 
which, perhaps, take more courage than saving a platoon from enemy 
attack. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Once a month, I attend a rosary vigil with about 200 people in front 
of a local Planned Parenthood clinic. I see the woman going in for 
abortions, some reluctantly, some being steered through the door by a 
man who is probably the father of the baby.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
After about 45 minutes, some of the men come out, alone, looking 
relieved. They did their duty and sat in the waiting room with their 
significant other until it was time for the abortion, and then they 
get to go off -- get a cup of coffee, read the paper -- while she's in 
the recovery room.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What bothers me is that most of these guys are dressed as if they were 
on a date -- as if they were on the way to the movies. Except, this 
date involves the destruction of their children, and the wounding of 
their girlfriends. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I'm with the early feminists, when it comes to abortion. Elizabeth 
Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Dr. Alice Bunker Stockham, and the 
whole crowd of them were staunchly pro-life. They called abortion 
"child murder," and the "exploitation of women and children." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More emphatically, they pointed out that abortion primarily serves the 
needs of the predatory male. In a July, 1869, article in "The 
Revolution," the feminist newspaper edited by Elizabeth Cady Stanton 
and Susan B. Anthony, the latter -- of current U.S. one-dollar coin 
fame-- wrote: 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Guilty? Yes, no matter what the motive, love of ease, or a desire to 
save from suffering the unborn innocent, the woman is awfully guilty 
who commits the deed. It will burden her conscience in life, it will 
burden her soul in death; but oh! thrice guilty is he who, for selfish 
gratification, heedless of her prayers, indifferent to her fate, drove 
her to the desperation which impels her to the crime." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In her day, Susan B. Anthony was describing a tiny minority of men. 
Today, you'll run into hordes of them at just about any political 
cocktail party you attend. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But, still, there are countless other men who dare to swim against the 
tide -- men who respect life, and respect women, at a time when 
neither is required by the world. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Those are men who don't have to daydream about performing feats of 
great valor. They do it every day.

When the local Catholic priest trades his black suit and Roman collar 
for faded jeans and a T-shirt, and says to his flock, "Just call me 
Bob," what should you do? 
<P>
I suppose intercessory prayer should be your first response, but after 
that, you might think of picking up "Serpent On the Rock," a 1994 book 
by Alice Thomas Ellis, a native of Liverpool. 
<P>
It's a funny, faithful, and realistic view of what it means to be 
Catholic in the 1990s.  <P>

P.D. James, best-selling author of British murder mysteries, reviewed 
the book for the Times Literary Supplement, and described it as: "One 
woman's idiosyncratic, passionate and sometimes intemperate 
view...(It) should be compulsory reading for all bishops and placed in 
the library of all seminaries and theological colleges." <P>

But, most importantly, it will make you laugh. In fact, it's quite 
possible that while reading the book you will, on occasion, be 
convulsed by fits of uncontrollable laughter. I was. 
<P>
Ellis, the mother of seven children, traveled across Ireland and 
England, asking people what they thought about the current state of 
the Catholic Church.  <P>

 Ecumenism, liberation theology, liturgy, and feminism -- it's all 
there. <P>

She gives plenty of ink to Catholics who dissent from Church 
teachings. Then, she politely puts in a word or two of her own. 
<P>
She writes: "Visiting some people I had not seen for years I found 
again that smiling determination to deny that there is anything awry 
in the Church -- despite the fact that the Vatican and many 
theologians are seldom in accord and that there is laxity, confusion 
and an abundance of what used to be called heresy until it was decided 
that this was rude and everyone was entitled to his own opinion." 
<P>
Ellis, on church architecture: <P>

"If you visited a place where you knew the Catholic church had been 
recently constructed, you only had to ask for the most diabolically 
ugly building in town, bar none." 
<P>
On the interior decoration of churches: 
<P>
"It doesn't feel too different from McDonald's or the bank, and the 
local post office has got a new carpet, too. If I merely want to feel 
comfortable I go to the pub." 
<P>
On Confession: <P>
   "The church noticeboard advertised a 'Ceremony of Reconciliation' 
with the word 'Confession' in brackets. One day, bowed down under an 
awareness of my failings, I went to unburden my soul. Having conducted 
an examination of conscience I announced 'sub rosa' that, on 
reflection, I had to accuse myself of having fallen short in virtually 
every aspect of what was required of me: I was, to say the least, 
inadequate as a daughter, wife, mother and Catholic. Picture my 
astonishment on hearing my confessor suggest soothingly that he feared 
I was suffering from 'low self-esteem.'" 
<P>
On women priests:  
<P>
"I find something infinitely touching in the sight of males serving at 
the altar. A seriousness, a dignity and a humility which are not 
readily apparent in most of the other things they do. Women don't give 
the same impression. I saw some round the altar in New Zealand. They 
looked incongruous and bossy, very much as though they felt only they 
knew how to wash up properly." 
<P>
On sex: 
<P>
"I keep meeting women who insist on telling me how important their sex 
drive is to them. Once they might have announced they were regular 
church-goers; now they tell you they're sexually active. It's a sort 
of claim to credibility." 
<P>
On homosexuality: 
<P>
"Nor do I understand why so many people seem determined to define 
themselves by their sexual orientation. It seems unnecessarily 
limiting. When a person fixes you with a glance and says 'I'm 
gay/lesbian, you know,' you think: 'So what, darling? Just don't eat 
with your mouth open.'" 
<P>
On nuns:  
<P>
"One sometimes hears of women who are said to have been 'hurt' by the 
Church. I was thinking now of a new-style 'nun' who, finding herself 
at dinner sitting between two Jesuits, burst into tears because they 
spoke only to each other. She felt ignored and therefore diminished -- 
and fled, weeping. As a married women I am entirely accustomed to this 
kind of experience and do not mind it in the least. It gives you time 
to think your own thoughts, which are often more diverting than the 
conversations of men. Perhaps she would have felt more at ease in an 
old-fashioned convent where she would not have had to cope with the 
complexities of social intercourse between the sexes." 
<P>
Unfortunately, you might have a problem getting your hands on a copy 
of "Serpent on the Rock," published by Hodder and Stoughton, a British 
firm. So far, the book hasn't been distributed in America. 
<P>
Your local bookstore may be able to special-order it. If you have 
friends or relatives in Ireland or England, you could ask them, or 
even beg them, to send you a copy. Or, write directly to the publisher 
at: 338 Euston Rd., London NW1 3BH. 
<P>
It's worth the effort. If you're not one of the lucky Catholics in 
America who lives in a parish with a licit and reverential Mass, then 
you're probably long overdue for a dose of laughter, the best 
medicine.

<html><head><title>Howley: Divorce, Irish Style</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg"><center><i>
 November 28, 1995</I><hr><h2>Divorce, Irish Style</h2><br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"><b><i>Kathleen Howley</i></b></a><hr><br></center>  

Centuries of oppression couldn't stamp out the Catholic Church in 
Ireland. The deadlier the persecutions became, the more people clung 
to the Rock of Peter. 
<p>
A tragic famine that killed one out of every eight people in Ireland 
didn't shake their faith. Only a tiny fraction became "soupers," the 
name given to people who denied the faith in order to receive food 
from Protestant soup kitchens. 
<p>
Nor could dismal poverty, lasting for generations, make Irish people 
lose their hope in winning eternal life through fidelity to the 
teachings of the Church.  
<p>
But, a decade or two of secularization and materialism has managed to 
cripple the faith in Ireland quite easily, with hardly a voice raised 
in complaint. 
<p>
For proof of that, just look at their politics. 
<p>
In 1990, Ireland elected a left-wing, pro-choice lawyer, Mary 
Robinson, as president. In 1993, the government removed legal 
sanctions against homosexual activity, and made condoms freely 
available. 
<p>
And now, in a country that is more than 92 percent Catholic, divorce 
has been legalized -- albeit by a wafer-thin margin. 
<p>
In fact, the recent divorce referendum proved to be the closest vote 
in Irish history. A recount confirmed that only 9,114 "yes" votes 
provided the margin of victory for 1.6 million ballots cast. 
<p>
The Irish press lent a helping hand in defeating the pro-family 
forces, just as our own American press does for family issues on our 
side of the ocean. 
<p>
For example, Irish articles tended to describe those who opposed the 
legalization of divorce as blindly following the heavy-handed 
teachings of the oppressive Catholic Church. 
<p>
On the other hand, pro-divorce voters were not portrayed as mindlessly 
following the dictates of the liberal agenda -- like liberal Democrats 
in America, who all claim to be free-thinkers, yet, march lockstep on 
every issue.  
<p>
No -- articles tended to give the impression that supporting divorce 
qualified someone as being thoughtful and farseeing. 
<p>
And, the press employed their usual "reductio ad extremus" technique, 
giving big play to stories that profiled heartbreaking cases, to 
emphasize the tragic results of opposing liberal advances.  
<p>
Such as: the story of a young woman, abused and deserted by her 
husband, consigned to a life alone. In reality, that situation 
represents only a tiny fraction of the marriages in Ireland. 
<p>
Someday, the Irish will learn what many Americans have gleaned from 
watching the disintegration of our own society: Tough cases make bad 
laws. 
<p>
As it turned out, there were several deciding factors in the campaign 
to legalize divorce. The biggest was the $800,000 chunk of public 
money used by the government to fund a pro-divorce publicity drive. 
Shortly before the big vote, an Irish court ruled it was illegal to 
use tax revenues in that way. But, by then it was too late. Most of it 
was already spent. 
<p>
And, the pro-divorce movement was helped with cameo appearances by a 
host of Irish celebrities, such as Bono of U2, and Van Morrison. 
<p>
Another factor was the weakness of the Catholic Church, depleted by an 
endless array of sex sandals that began several years ago when the 
much-beloved bishop of Galway, Eamonn Casey, resigned after admitting 
he had fathered a child with an American woman. 
<p>
In the days before the vote, posters appeared on lampposts all over 
Dublin picturing Bishop Casey. The text stated: "Let the Bishops look 
after their own families ... VOTE YES." 
<p>
Fifteen years ago, no prominent Irish politician would have dared to 
support divorce. To do so would have meant mean electoral suicide. 
Yet, in the recent divorce campaign, every major party was pro-
divorce. 
<p>
What could have caused such a change in Irish society? The biggest 
impetus, many agree, has been the endless stream of soul-less 
television shows beamed into Irish homes over the last decade, most of 
it American-made. 
<p>
Last June, I was in Ireland, visiting my family. One afternoon, I 
stopped at a friend's farmhouse for tea, and while we chatted, she 
kept the television on in the background to entertain her four-year-
old daughter. 
<p>
Children in Ireland watch television just like American kids: soaking 
everything in with big eyes. 
<p>
It was an episode of "Murphy Brown" that portrayed Murphy and her 
lover having a tryst in a hotel room.  
<p>
My friend didn't mind that her daughter was exposed to such 
immorality. But, it was a shock to me, even though I was weaned on 
that kind of trash. 
<p>
What was once inconceivable in Ireland had become old hat. 
<p>
In times past, the Irish believed that marriages, even unhappy ones, 
lasted forever. They believed that adultery was a poison to a society. 
And, their laws reflected their beliefs.  
<p>
Today, they have set their sights on the liberal path that Americans 
blazed more than 20 years ago.  
<p>
It leads, as we know first-hand, to a place where broken families, 
violence and endless heartache are commonplace. 
<p>
Remember that lonely young woman, abused and abandoned by her husband? 
Currently, she represents just a handful of Irish women. But, you can 
bet that in a few decades, that sort of misery will be spread all over 
Ireland.

<html><head><title>Howley:  Pagans I Have Known</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg"><center><i>
 November 16, 1995</I><hr><h2>Pagans I Have Known</h2><br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"><b><i>Kathleen Howley</i></b></a><hr><br></center>  
 
The press pretty much ignored the 20th annual Women's Ordination 
Conference, held during the Veteran's Day weekend at a Marriott hotel 
near Washington D.C. 
<p>
Apparently, it's not newsworthy when 1,000 Catholic women -- more than 
half of them nuns from mainstream orders -- gather to denounce the 
teachings of their church, ridicule the pope, and voice avid support 
for lesbianism and abortion.  
<p>
Ho hum. Tell me something new. 
<p>
But, if the reporters and their cameras had been there, I'd be willing 
to bet that they wouldn't have focused on the over-the-edge, bizarre 
events of the conference, such as the Friday night opening ritual that 
included women dressed as bishops and priests, dancing on-stage to a 
rhythmic, sensual drum beat.  
<p>
Instead, they probably would have zoomed in on the mere handful of 
moments that corresponded with their idea of what these women are 
interested in: ordination and inclusive language. 
<p>
But, anyone who has spent five minutes around W.O.C. members knows 
better. Do you really think these women want to kneel at the feet of a 
"patriarchal" bishop to receive the Sacrament of Holy Orders?  
<p>
No way. First, they don't believe in Sacraments, as instituted by 
Christ and defined by the Catholic Church. For example, I've heard 
their leaders suggest, repeatedly, that several new Sacraments should 
be added to mark the stages of women's lives, such as the onset of 
wisdom, which supposedly happens when a woman reaches 50 -- they call 
it "croning." 
<p>
The "Sacrament of Croning." See what I mean?  
<p>
Secondly, they are adamant about their desire to dismantle the 
priesthood as we know it, and change the function of a priest into a 
non-sacramental facilitator who derives power from the community. 
<p>
 "Ordination means sub-ordination," was the mantra at the recent 
conference. They claim they want to "deconstruct" the priesthood. 
Meaning, they want to destroy it. 
<p>
And, inclusive language? They're definitely not interested in that. 
They demand that liturgical language be exclusively feminine. 
<p>
I've been to plenty of W.O.C. and Women-Church gatherings. The events 
always include prayers to the goddess, who, for the uninitiated, has 
three personalities -- maiden, mother, and crone -- each with various 
names. 
<p>
And, the conferences usually include bread-breaking rituals that 
resemble a Catholic Mass. 
<p>
At most of their rituals, the focal point is an altar with a statue of 
the goddess, usually with a candle burning in front of it.  
<p>
During the Saturday night "ritual meal" at the recent conference, 
there was no statue in sight, but the goddess personality of the 
moment was the ever-popular Sophia, a W.O.C. invention that twists the 
Scriptural meaning of "Sophia" -- recognized by Catholics as the 
virtue of wisdom, or as another name for the Holy Spirit -- and turns 
it into a pagan deity. 
<p>
That night, in the darkened banquet hall, one of the incantations 
sounded eerily like the Divine Praises: 
<p>
"Blessed be Sophia. Blessed be her holy name. Blessed be all women: 
young, generative and wise. Blessed be Sophia's sisters who keep alive 
the discipleship of equals. Blessed be all children who tell the 
stories of their foremothers...."  
<p>
It was chanted by all the attendees, following a bread-breaking 
ceremony. The only ones who didn't take part were a handful of 
faithful Catholics who were there as observers. 
<p>
Hours later, after the ritual meal was finished, and the attendees had 
moved on to another room for an all-women dance with cash bar, I spoke 
to one of the waitresses, who was clearing tables. 
<p>
"What did you think?" I asked her. 
<p>
"I'm a born-again Christian," she warily told me, in broken English, 
"so I really don't know about these Catholic things." 
<p>
"This was definitely not Catholic. It was pagan," I said, 
emphatically. 
<p>
She looked relieved to find out that I wasn't one of "them," and 
confided, in a low voice, "I felt the presence of evil here, tonight." 
<p>
"Me, too," I told her. 
<p>
Beyond the fact that every soul is precious in the eyes of the Father, 
why should the apostasy of W.O.C. followers interest us in the least? 
<p>
Because these are powerful women. They teach at Catholic universities 
and seminaries. They run Catholic high schools. They work in 
chancelleries and parishes. They design R.C.I.A. and C.C.D. programs. 
They run retreats and offer spiritual direction to unsuspecting 
Catholics. 
<p>
They don't want to leave the Church. They want to remake it, in their 
own image. 
<p>
And, it's rare to find one who doesn't have a string of graduate 
degrees after her name. The elderly members of their religious orders 
may live in fear of losing their health insurance as a result of a 
shrinking financial base, but these younger members, typically 50 to 
65 years old, have plenty of money to continue their education. 
<p>
In the battle for the soul of the Roman Catholic Church in America, 
these women are mighty adversaries, indeed.<p><p> <I>Copyright 1995, <a href="mailto:73360.271@compuserve.com">Kathleen Howley</a></i><P> <br><center><a href="/townhall/tbut.map"><img src="/townhall/tbut.gif" ismap border="0"></a></center></body></html>

<title>Howley:  The Catholic Church(es) in China</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<h2>The Catholic Church(es) in China</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"><b><i>Kathleen Howley</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
 
Americans are in the dark when it comes to the Catholic Church in 
China -- or, I should say, the two Churches in China: one, the 
underground Roman Catholic Church, the other, the Communist-controlled 
Patriotic Catholic Church. 
<p>
To illustrate the degree of confusion, Joseph Kung, the nephew of 
Ignatius Cardinal Kung, the much-beloved bishop of Shanghai, tells the 
following story: 
<p>
He was at a pro-life dinner last year in New Jersey. A monsignor 
tapped him on the shoulder, introduced himself, and said: "I just saw 
your uncle. He gave a speech at the seminary this morning." 
<p>
Joseph Kung knew his uncle had not been at the seminary that day, and 
immediately realized that the monsignor was talking about the OTHER 
bishop of Shanghai -- Aloysius Jin Luxian, S.J., appointed by the 
Communists and consecrated without the Holy Father's permission. 
<p>
After Kung explained the situation, the monsignor replied: "I had no 
idea. I thought I was listening to the Roman Catholic bishop of 
Shanghai. And, so did all the other people at the lecture." 
<p>
Generous Catholics in America have donated millions of dollars to aid 
the Catholic Church in China. Few realize that their money is helping 
to support the Patriotic Church. 
<p>
Still, the real Catholic Church in China is alive and growing 
stronger, despite the fact that it is persecuted, penniless, and, it 
would seem, friendless. 
<p>
Chinese Roman Catholics celebrate their Masses in hiding, or, during 
bolder moments, in open fields. They risk life and limb to protect 
their underground priests and seminarians. Their families pray the 
Rosary in secret.  
<p>
Life would be easy if they would just align themselves with the 
Patriotic Catholic Church. But, they won't. 
<p>
They follow the example of their shepherds, the loyal bishops who have 
refused to renounce the fullness of the faith, despite imprisonment 
and torture. Three years ago, one elderly bishop, Joseph Fan Xueyan, 
S.J., was beaten to death by his jailers. The rest of the world hardly 
noticed. But, his flock did. 
<p>
On the other hand, the Patriotic Church controls the real estate, the 
churches, and has approval from the Communist government and numerous 
Catholic bishops in the free world. Often, their seminarians study in 
America, supported by American dioceses. 
<p>
Bishops and priests of the Patriotic Church describe themselves as 
loyal members of the Catholic Church. Or, if they are willing to admit 
to their true status, they'll rationalize that the pope is "making 
overtures" to the Patriotic Church.  
<p>
The Holy Father has a certain brand of patience and tact that he uses 
when dealing with Communists -- a method he learned first-hand during 
his years in Poland. It's not to be confused with approval. 
<p>
In fact, John Paul II made his feelings clear when he made the true 
and loyal bishop of Shanghai -- Ignatius Kung -- a Prince of the 
Church. 
<p>
"With what prayerful longing and love do I follow the life of the 
loyal Chinese Catholic communities," the pope said, when he received 
Cardinal Kung in 1991. 
<p>
True -- the Patriotic bishops say they love the Holy Father, and 
respect him as the Successor of Peter. But, they don't believe that he 
has the authority to appoint bishops or to govern the Catholics in 
China. 
<p>
Cardinal Kung, now 94 and living in Connecticut, spent 30 years in a 
Communist prison. If he had been willing to renounce the authority of 
the pope, he would have been released and rewarded with a high 
position in the Patriotic Church. Others did -- like Bishop Jin of 
Shanghai, Bishop Fu Tieshan of Beijing, and Bishop Zong Huaide, the 
president of the Patriotic Association. But, Cardinal Kung would not. 
<p>
Today, the Communists continue to arrest members of the underground 
Church. Sadly, the state-connected Patriotic Church has yet to 
denounce the persecutions. 
<p>
The ranks of the loyal bishops arrested within the last few weeks 
include the 76-year-old Bishop Zeng Jingmu -- his second arrest since 
August -- as well as Bishop Han Dingxiang and Bishop Jia Zhiguo. All 
were later released, but the message was clear: don't give us trouble, 
or you'll be arrested again. 
<p>
Several underground priests, including a Jesuit, are currently serving 
prison terms. One was recently released, after being severely 
tortured. 
<p>
And, lay people have been imprisoned for attending an underground 
Mass. This past Easter, dozens were arrested and tortured. 
<p>
For an update on recent arrests, or for information on how to help the 
underground Catholic Church in China, contact the Cardinal Kung 
Foundation, P.O. Box 8086, Ridgeway Center, Stamford CT 06905. 
<p>
 With all its advantages, it would be reasonable to assume that the 
Patriotic Catholic Church has the most followers, wouldn't it? But, it 
doesn't work out that way. 
<p>
There are three million members of the Patriotic Church. Compared that 
to NINE million members of the underground Roman Catholic Church -- an 
increase of 300 percent since the beginning of the persecution in 
1949. 
<p>
Best of all, the true bishops of China continue to proclaim Church 
teachings joyfully, loudly and completely -- even though they know the 
only way to ensure their own safety is to stay silent. 
<p>
Sixty years ago, Catholic school children in America donated "pennies 
for China" to support the missions. 
<p>
Today, we have reaped a priceless reward for that almsgiving: an 
example of courage and faithfulness that could -- if it were more 
widely known -- be an inspiration for others to remain steadfast in 
the ancient Faith.

<title>Old TV Makes A Comeback</title>

<h2>Old TV Makes A Comeback</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"><b><i>Kathleen Howley</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
I stopped watching mainstream television shows almost two years ago. I 
finally cracked.  <p>

One of the last straws was an episode of "Seinfeld" -- a well-written 
series that was relatively clean in its first year, but gradually 
ended up in the gutter. <p>

Jerry, after sleeping with his new girlfriend, decides that he doesn't 
like her. So, he asks a buddy how many more dates he has to waste on 
her so he can break up with her "like a gentleman."  
<p>
Has womanhood fallen so low in America? Is respect for females so 
absent, and the standards of gentlemanly conduct so warped? 
<p>
The answer is, "Yes." But, but, must we be continually reminded? 
<p>
I resolved -- after that episode, and others that were even worse -- 
to honor the old-time computer motto: "Garbage in, garbage out." 
<p>
Watching shows that featured members of my generation sinking to the 
bottom of a moral pit -- although being very witty in the process -- 
was bound to effect any viewer, eventually. Makes sense, doesn't it?   
<p>
So, I decided to go cold turkey. 
<p>
Now, I keep the TV tuned to either CNN, C-Span, or Nickelodeon, the 
cable station where Dick and Laura Petrie are still young, Mary Tyler 
Moore is still looking for a husband, and Lucy is still trying to get 
a spot in Ricky's nightclub act. 
<p>
Perhaps Nick at Night, advertised as "safe TV," has put me out of 
touch with popular culture. Recently, I asked a friend, "Did you watch 
Nick last night?" 
<p>
She replied, innocently, "Whose Nick?" 
<p>
And, last month, when I saw a road sign for New Rochelle during a trip 
to New York, I turned to a pal and asked, "Hey, do you know who lives 
there?"  
<p>
She didn't. 
<p>
But, a growing number of Americans could answer that question. TV 
shows that feature a better vision of America are making a comeback, 
as recounted in a recent Washington Times story. 
<p>
The article, titled, "Old television gives disgruntled viewers new 
hope," credits the "Dick Van Dyke" show -- set, of course, in New 
Rochelle, NY -- as being one of the most popular shows on "old TV." 
<p>
According to the article, Warner Brothers, Universal, Columbia and 
Paramount are all trying to start cable networks that will feature 
1960s and 1970s sitcoms. 
<p>
Old television is big. Very big. 
<p>
And, why not? The old shows remind us of a era, not so long ago, when 
Moms were at home when their kids came in the door from school, 
neighborhoods were safe, and marriages tended to last a lifetime. 
<p>
I was a baby when Dick Van Dyke made its original run in the 1960s, so 
I don't remember it first-hand. But, that was the America that I grew 
up in. Not such a bad world, after all. 
<p>
When I was a kid, my Mom used to send us out the door without worrying 
about us -- just like Laura did with Richie. Can you imagine? Even if 
we were a whole block away, there was another Mom nearby, keeping an 
eye on us through her kitchen window.  
<p>
The biggest part of our day was when Dad came home from work -- just 
like on the old sitcoms. We would crowd around him, looking for hugs. 
The dog would bark. It was general pandemonium. 
<p>
Now, the biggest part of the day for many American children is the 
moment when Dad or Mom walks through the door of their daycare center 
to take them home for a few short hours, before returning them the 
next morning. 
<p>
Today's network executives have a strange sense of what "family 
values" means. They claim their new fall lineup is dominated by family 
shows.  
<p>
But, the most normal family they could come up with is portrayed in 
"Bless This House." According to the previews, it portrays a family 
with "rock solid values."  
<p>
Unfortunately, the actor who plays the husband is Andrew Dice Clay -- 
a real-life comedian known for his obscene nightclub acts. 
<p>
In addition, TV executives this year came up with 10 new "family 
shows" with divorced or single parents. Some would call that being 
"realistic." I call it, "accentuating the negative." 
<p>
Also, on the heels of the already-established "NYPD Blue," touted as 
the first R-rated television series, there are at least a half-dozen, 
brand-new "adult" shows bent on breaking new ground. Half feature law 
firms. The rest feature news rooms. 
<p>
TV Guide describes one of them as containing "gratuitous lewdness." 
Remember -- in the eyes of TV Guide, that's not necessary meant to be 
critical.  
<p>
Another contains "risqu scenes." A third is described as "seductive." 
<p>
If the writing is good, and the story lines are interesting, the new 
R-style shows will probably attract even some Americans who try to 
live according to higher principles.  
<p>
And, despite their good intentions, they will slowly, bit by bit, be 
corroded.  
<p>
After all, garbage in, garbage out. 
<p>
Give me that old-time TV, any day of the week. 
<p>

<title>GRAMM:  CANDIDATE FOR THE NEW ENVIRONMENT</title>
</head>

<h2>GRAMM: CANDIDATE FOR THE NEW ENVIRONMENT</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
The Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary are just a year away, and the contestants for the 1996 GOP presidential nomination are already out of the gate and heading for the first turn.  With an unpopular Democratic incumbent likely to be on top of the ticket -- for the first time in sixteen years -- and with a historic victory in last November's midterm congressional elections, Republican challengers are fighting to win a nomination many see as virtually guaranteeing a four-year lease on the White House.<p>
One GOP presidential aspirant has a leg up on the competition -- and maybe an arm, as well.  In the view of many political insiders, in fact, he's been preparing to run for President for at least the last decade, with his sights set on the 1996 GOP nomination.  With a secure Senate seat, a national fund-raising apparatus to go with his prodigious fund-raising skills, and an issue clearly in vogue, he is likely to be one of the finalists for the GOP crown.<p>
He is U.S. Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, and though he has never before run for national office, he already is seen as a member of the GOP's top tier of presidential contenders.<p>
<b>THE NEW NOMINATING ENVIRONMENT</b><p>
Before we can begin a dispassionate analysis of a presidential contender's prospects, we must recognize the changes in the rules regarding the nominating process, and their likely impact on the contest itself.<p>
The formal 1996 nominating season will be shorter than any in recent memory.  Large states like California and New York -- which, between them, control one-third of all the electoral votes needed to capture the White House -- long have held their primary elections relatively late in the election season.  As a result, they had relatively little influence over the party nominees.  Party activists in those two states, tired of having to support candidates largely chosen for them by others in states with earlier primary elections, finally rebelled and decided to move their respective state's primary elections up on the calendar, to give them more influence over the process.  Key midwestern states -- Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan -- facing the loss of their own influence as a result of the California and New York moves, are now considering holding their primaries on the same day in mid-March, as sort of a Midwestern regional primary.<p>
The result:  with California moving from early June to late March, and with New York moving from late April to early May, more than seventy percent of the delegates to the 1996 GOP convention will be chosen within a six-week period from mid-February to the end of March.<p>
The impact of the scheduling change on the nominating race could hardly be more dramatic.  No longer will long-shot candidates have the luxury of plotting an insurgent upset in Iowa or New Hampshire, then coasting on free media while raising money over the next several weeks.  In the new environment, money will matter even more than previously; candidates simply won't have time to raise large amounts while in the heat of battle.  Most seasoned analysts expect that a candidate will have to have a minimum of $20-$25 million on hand on January 1, 1996, to have a serious shot at winning.  And the shortened time-frame means that name identification and media skills will increase in value, as well.<p>
This new environment, then, favors candidates with the ability to raise large amounts of money, who know how to present themselves well through the media, and who already have positive name identification.  On two of these three counts, Phil Gramm is well-armed for the competition.<p>
<b>GRAMM:  CANDIDATE FOR THE NEW ENVIRONMENT</b><p>
Money is the mother's milk of politics, now more than ever.  Of the last eight major party nominees for President -- that is, going back to the 1980 campaign -- seven were the candidates in their party who had the most money in the bank on December 31 of the year preceding the nomination contest.  The new primary schedule enhances the need for early money.  Gramm has some of the best fund-raising skills of any of the likely contestants -- including even Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole of Kansas, who has already run three national campaigns.  Even before the end of the 1994 election cycle, Gramm was far in front of the pack when measured by funds on hand for a potential run -- he had almost $8 million in the bank, as compared to about $2.5 million for Dole.  None of the other potential GOP candidates had even $1 million on hand.<p>
Too, Gramm knows how to raise money.  In his last Senate campaign, he spent more than $12 million; and since then, he has served four years as chairman of the Senate Republicans' campaign committee, the National Republican Senatorial Committee.  From his post at the NRSC, Gramm has had the opportunity to travel the country on behalf of dozens of GOP Senate candidates -- and, in the process, has acquainted himself with literally thousands of high-dollar donors, the kind who write $1,000 checks without a second thought.  It would not be too much of an exaggeration to say that every American who has contributed $5,000 or more to the GOP in the last four years probably has an autographed photograph of himself and Gramm hanging on the wall of his den or office.<p>
The second key to winning the GOP nomination will be positive name identification.  This is the chink in Gramm's armor.  As the field begins to shape up for 1996, Gramm runs far behind better-known party leaders like Bob Dole, Jack Kemp, Dan Quayle, and Dick Cheney.  In early trial polls, Gramm only captures 2-3 percent of the GOP vote against the field, while Dole and Kemp battle it out for first place in the low twenties and high teens.<p>
But name identification can be driven up with paid advertising -- as long as there is adequate money to finance it.  As noted above, Gramm will likely have more money to spend than any other candidate in the field.  Thus, it is the third key to the nomination -- media skills -- that likely will become the determining factor.<p>
Media skills can be broken down into PAID media skills and EARNED media skills.  "Paid" media is just that -- media advertising paid for with campaign dollars; "earned" media is time on the mass media earned by the candidate for making news in some way.<p>
Gramm's earned media skills have, for the most part, been little better than adequate.  His slow Texas twang turns off Northeasterners as much as it soothes Southerners; but his wit and his knack for framing issues serve him well in the studio interview setting.  He has been known to drone on in speeches to large gatherings; he is perhaps best-remembered for his long-winded and boring keynote speech to the 1992 GOP convention in Houston.<p>
But while Gramm may not be well-armed when it comes to basic earned media skills, when the battleground shifts to PAID media skills, there is not a stronger warrior on the field.  Gramm's television commercials are things of beauty, miniature movies -- not surprising, given the attention Gramm pays them, not to mention the money he lavishes on these mini-productions.<p>
In big states like New York and California, the ability to successfully communicate with the electorate through television advertising is THE key to success.  And that means just two things are needed:  a good flight of commercials, and the money to saturate the media.  Gramm will have both.<p>
<b>SOME NEGATIVES</b><p>
It's a good thing Gramm has money going for him, because he's got to overcome several handicaps on his way to the White House.  To begin, no Republican has gone directly from the Senate to the presidency in this century (and only one Democrat, John Kennedy, has made the trip); Senate experience appears not to be as great a plus as experience in a governor's mansion, which, with its executive decision-making prerogatives, is viewed by most voters as a better testing ground for the nation's chief executive.<p>
Moreover, Gramm -- long known to the public at large as a conservative activist -- starts with a relatively small base in his own party, as a result of the kind of internecine warfare among conservatives that threatens to divide their movement and render it politically impotent.<p>
At issue is Gramm's support for the 1990 budget deal -- which included what was then the biggest tax increase in the nation's history -- despite President Bush's promise of no new taxes.  While conservatives on and off Capitol Hill raged about the President's betrayal, Gramm loyally carried water for Bush, and was pilloried by purist conservatives for his apostasy.  The following year he opposed a Social Security payroll tax cut offered by Democratic Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and even opposed another Social Security payroll tax cut -- combined with a capital gains tax cut -- offered by Republicans Malcolm Wallop and Tom DeLay.<p>
These heresies have given cause to some conservatives to think that Gramm -- a former economics professor at Texas A&M -- cares about only the spending side of the budget equation, and that he is unwilling to consider tax cuts as stimulative and necessary.  To most Americans, these arcane debates -- pitting minority factions of a minority party against one another -- remind them of nothing so much as Medieval arguments over how many angels will fit on the head of a pin; but to the conservative activists who have enormous influence over the nominating process of the Republican Party, they are important tests of purity.  If Gramm allows himself to be boxed in to a corner marked "green eye-shade Republican" along with Bob Dole, he will leave the economic optimist label open to others.<p>
But it's not just money and access to money that sets Gramm apart from the rest of the Republican field; it is another trait, deep in his bones.  In the words of one former House colleague of Gramm's, "Phil wakes up in the morning and thinks to himself, 'What are the ten things I need to do today to be President?' -- and then he gets seven of them done."  It is a driving ambition deep within Gramm, a determination to do what it takes in order to be President.??<p>

<title>BRADLEY TO REELECT CLINTON?</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<h2>BRADLEY TO REELECT CLINTON?</h2>
<i> by Bill Pascoe</i>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Add Bill Bradley to a list that already includes Ross Perot, Colin Powell, and Jesse Jackson, and what do you have?  On the surface, a list of possible Independent candidates for the presidency -- but below the surface, a recipe for the reelection of Bill Clinton.<p>
For even as the political class muses loudly and publicly about the erosion of two-party politics and the breakdown of civil society -- both because the Establishment finds such talk interesting in an otherwise slow news month, and because it sells newspapers -- it blithely overlooks a fundamental fact gleaned from any in-depth analysis of American political history:  that national elections are about relatively simple choices; that much more often than not, those choices boil down to ONE simple question in the minds of most voters (to wit, Do I want to return the incumbent party for another four years in the White House?); and that, therefore, virtually any Independent candidacy (to the extent it is effective in its goal, which is to win votes) can have but one result -- the reelection of Bill Clinton.<p>
Of course, there are exceptions to the rule.  In 1996, the exception could be Mr. Jackson.  A Jackson Independent candidacy would likely have two effects, at least one of which would be good for the Democratic Party:  on the down side, a likely split-off of the black vote, with much of it going to Mr. Jackson, thereby making more difficult Mr. Clinton's chances for reelection; but on the good side,  an increased turnout among black voters, which could redound to the party's benefit in salvaging congressional seats that otherwise would be considered at risk.<p>
The jury is still out on whether Mr. Jackson will run or not.  The betting here is that he won't.  But that still leaves Messrs. Bradley, Powell, and Perot.<p>
And if even one of the three were to mount a serious Independent candidacy -- let alone a combination, or even, possibly, all three -- the likely result would be a renewal of Mr. Clinton's lease at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.<p>
Ah, the Conventional Wisdom says, of course that's true of potential Independent bids by Mr. Powell or Mr. Perot.  Both of them, according to the CW, would draw more heavily from the GOP presidential candidate.  Nothing new there.  But how would an Independent bid by a known Democrat like Mr. Bradley enhance Mr. Clinton's electoral prospects?  Wouldn't he draw from the  Democratic base vote, and weaken the President?<p>
No.  Mr. Clinton has a firm hold on his party's base vote.  Feminists, liberals, pro-abortionists, welfare recipients, gays, environmentalists, union members, public service employees -- the traditional Democratic coalition -- are still solidly behind the President, who has done as much as he can to deliver for them.  He was elected to office with 43 percent of the vote, and his approval ratings have hovered within a ten point range of that margin throughout his presidency, never dropping much below, even though he never gets too high.<p>
More importantly, any analysis that projects presidential results based on a simple reading of partisan loyalties -- or even ideological loyalties -- misses the point.  When push comes to shove in the polling booth, voters choose not on the basis of party or ideology, but on whether they want to give the incumbent party another four years in power.  Just ask Ken DeCell and Alan Lichtman, whose seminal book THE THIRTEEN KEYS TO THE PRESIDENCY remains the best analysis -- and projection 
model -- for explaining voter behavior in presidential elections.<p>
By their standards, a Perot or Powell candidacy would help Mr. Clinton not because they would split the GOP vote with the Republican candidate, but because they would split the ANTI- INCUMBENT vote with the Republican candidate.  (Interestingly, a close examination of exit polls from 1992 shows that, contrary to much of the Conventional Wisdom, Mr. Perot didn't actually hurt President Bush, he HELPED him, by splitting the anti-incumbent vote then, too; had Mr. Perot not run in 1992, the result would have been NOT a Bush reelection, but a Clinton LANDSLIDE victory.)<p>
Similarly, a Bradley Independent candidacy would provide a second option NOT for those inclined to return to Mr. Clinton to the White House, but to those seeking his removal.  And to the extent he waged a serious campaign and actually won serious votes, he would, necessarily and concomitantly, draw anti-incumbent votes from the anti-incumbent candidate -- e.g., the Republican nominee.<p>
Thus, in the unlikeliest of paradoxes, an Independent bid by a long-time Democrat unsatisfied with his party's presidential leadership would likely have just the opposite of its supposedly intended effect.<p>
Mr. Bradley has been accused of many things in his career, but being stupid isn't one of them.  The day before he announced his potential Independent candidacy, he claims to have called 120 people to tell them of his decision to retire from the Senate, and to discuss future options.  Would someone please send him Mr. DeCell's phone number?<p>

It takes a stronger stomach than a lot of people were born with.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>So these Nice Republicans trembled on cue because Mr. Dole rebuked NBC-TV's Katie Couric for her adversarial scolding of Mr. Dole for his not joining the crusade against tobacco.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"Instead," reported The Post July 4 on Page One, "the former Kansas senator, who volunteered his doubts about the addictiveness of cigarette smoking during a tour of tobacco-producing Kentucky almost three weeks ago, has continued to wage war with the news media on the issue" (italics mine).<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Wage war with the news media?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Why, you might ask, would the news media -- news media being journalogical jargon for "reporters" -- be waging a war against a candidate for president of the United States in the first place? Don't the "news media" advertise themselves as neutral in these disputes? Odd that you should ask.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The Post's description of the parties in the dispute tells you even more about media neutrality: The candidate is "old Dole," who is the "picture of frustration," picking on Miss Couric, "a popular anchorwoman known for her perky image and big smile." <BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The description of Miss Couric is accurate enough as far as it goes, and fairly daring for the politically correct Post, because this is the shorthand of aging white guys, their lechery showing, for "the perky boobs, blond hair and empty head that are the requisites for network-news pinups."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But it's not that Mr. Dole, treating Miss Couric with the respect that feminists say they despair of getting from old white guys like Mr. Dole, was picking on a little lady who merely parrots in a silkier voice what she hears the boys say. This is exactly how George Bush gobbled up Dan Rather for breakfast in a famous interview in 1988, which was grudgingly applauded even by the media notabilities who didn't like him, and the only difference between Mr. Rather and Miss Couric is that Katie is prettier.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Dole, too bad for him, challenges a doctrine of media theology. Tobacco is this season's fashionable evil -- like eating steak and potatoes, or going to church. Enlightened people just don't indulge in such morbid things. (Speaking of behavior modification, the real old Dole would challenge President Clinton to scold gays for their addiction to practicing anal sex, the chief conductor of the AIDS virus, which is far deadlier than tobacco smoke.)<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>It's enough to make little Richard Cohen bang his rattle against the wall on the op-ed page at The Post: ". . . he went after [Miss] Couric, the Dorothy of our early morning Oz." (Won't someone please send this poor guy a man-size box of Kleenex?)<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>There's evidence, scant but nevertheless just visible, to suggest that Mr. Dole is at last paying occasional attention to his own instincts. Only in Washington can you hear grown-ups question the universally held belief that the media are relentlessly liberal, or suggest that a candidate is out of step for saying what everyone already thinks.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Dole has been in politics long enough, longer than his armchair skeptics, to understand that neither he nor anyone else will take down Bill Clinton with a campaign designed to please the League of Women Voters. He'll have to fight with the tenacity, energy, guile and shrewdness of Mr. Clinton, who in turn will fight with the artifice, deception and cunning that propelled him from the casino-and-racetrack culture of Hot Springs to the hothouse of Washington and the White House.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The rap on Mr. Clinton is that he has elevated phoniness to high art. You might not like Bob Dole's indulgence of tobacco smoke, or even his treating a network bimbo with the respect he accords his other media adversaries, but the anger looks authentic. His only hope for November is that authenticity is what America is yearning for. America, not America's media, is the authentic constituency.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

SRC="/wash_times/pruden.gif"> <BR><FONT SIZE=6>Dreamy dreams for an August
morning</FONT></center><BR><DD>Suppose you're Bob Dole and you wake up on a Monday morning in
August, pick up The Washington Post (the quickest way to ruin your day), and there on the front
page is more bad news:<BR><DD>Bill Clinton has just been indicted for mopery, Hillary is a
fugitive from justice last seen in Nepal, and Janet Reno has appointed a special prosecutor to
press charges that Socks the Cat has been hunting mice out of season.<BR><DD>But a new poll,
commissioned just in time for the Republican National Convention in San Diego, shows the
president 31 points up on you, and you're only 6 points ahead of Ross Perot.<BR><DD>Ordinarily,
this would curdle the cream in your coffee, but the cream had turned sour weeks earlier. You
decide to drink your coffee black, to match your mood. You sit there, staring at the trees on
Roosevelt Island across the Potomac (which looks particularly bleak), and your mind begins to
examine the possibilities:<BR><DD><I>Hmmmmmmmmm. George McGovern is a nice guy, a good friend,
but do I really want to be remembered as the man who made the Nixon-McGovern blowout look like a
cliff-hanger? And Fritz Mondale -- always liked him. Good man. Wrong on some stuff, not so bad
on other stuff. But do I really want to challenge his mark of winning only a single state? The
numbers from Kansas don't look so hot, either.</I><BR><DD><I>Got to do something. Maybe make
another speech. Start wearing a tie again. Put new pennies in my loafers. Take Katie Couric out
to lunch. Get a new bathing suit. Buy some jokes. Whatever. Nah, it wouldn't last. Been there,
done that. Maybe call Colin Powell one more time. Nah, been there, too. Besides, he's like all
the other generals, waiting for somebody to appoint him president. Got enough of generals in
Italy.</I><BR><DD><I>What if ... Nah, too bold. Better to lose it all in November. Except . . .
Nah, better wait 'til Liddy leaves the room even to think these thoughts. Ah, there she goes ...
What if . . . I call a press conference and announce that I'm stepping aside. Had some chest
pains, back pains. Pains in the neck. Whatever. Gonna throw the convention open. No endorsement.
Not from me. The ultimate act of loyalty and generosity from the ultimate party man. Who else
would be remembered as being so unselfish? Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid
of the party. Only I actually will. Let the right-to-lifers and the abortionists slug it out.
See how far Pat Buchanan gets in an open convention. Let's see who's got the uh, nerve, to get
in now. Jack Kemp won't. He's afraid he might run third. Or fourth. Never called fourth-and-one
in his life. I won't play any favorites, but I might get somebody to nominate Colin. We'll see
how the general who couldn't get to Baghdad fares with all those ex-privates and ex-corporals
out there in the convention hall. Whatever.</I><BR><DD>Well, of course it won't happen. Nobody
with a politician's ego would forego the moment of watching himself being nominated for
president of the United States, standing up there waving to a standing ovation big enough to
fill a stadium and loud enough to make a man's mother believe some of them actually mean it. But
it is a thought, and if such wistful musings ever occur to Bob Dole it doesn't take a Hollywood
scriptwriter to imagine what would happen.<BR><DD>The country would be electrified, and here,
finally, is the place to use that cliche. Direct current at 240 volts. The reporters and
commentators would go bonkers, finally getting to cover a nominating convention like they had in
those old black-and-white newsreels. The good, gray Republican Party, where a simple
disagreement over where to go for dinner is considered gauche, finally giving lessons to the
Democrats, who can start a floor fight over a resolution commending Mother Teresa for giving
milk to starving babies, about how to conduct a free-for-all.<BR><DD><I>Mister Chairman, Alabama
is proud to cast its votes on the 29th ballot for . . . </I><BR><DD>ABC would pull its camera
crews from Bosnia, CBS would call back reporters from Tel Aviv, CNN would forsake its stakeout
of O.J. The newspapers would double their staffs in San Diego, with finally something to
actually write home about. <BR><DD>The delegates in San Diego would forget all about the beach,
the side trips to Tijuana, the cocktail parties aboard the yachts tied up in the
harbor.<BR><DD>Best of all, the race would be transformed overnight.<BR><DD>By waiting until
August to bequeath his great gift to the party, Bob Dole would guarantee an open convention.
Nobody would have time to raise the money to ruin it in the way that the primaries have ruined
the process, and at last the Republicans could tell little Virginia that yes, Virginia, there
really is a Republican National Convention, and this is how it's supposed to
be.<BR><DD><I>Mister Chairman, Alabama is proud to stand fast on the 44th ballot for . .

<BR><FONT SIZE=6>Let's blame the dead for the scary stuff</FONT></center><BR><DD>These guys at the White House are fast learners.<BR>
  George Stephanopoulos sees how Mortuary Bob Woodward gets by with talking to men lying in comas and crediting the most unlikely assertions in his books to sources conveniently dead, so George does it, too.<BR><DD>It wasn't Hillary who hired Craig Livingstone to vacuum raw FBI files to put together dossiers on their Republican enemies, says the president's senior adviser. "It was Vince Foster."<BR><DD>Dead men not only tell no tales, they don't dispute tales, either.<BR><DD>This emboldens Hillary. She was in Romania and Eastern Europe for the Fourth of July holiday (where she didn't have to put up with a lot of tacky flag-waving by men in military uniform parading down the avenue), but she supports Mr. Stephanopoulos in his blaming of Vince Foster, who, though still dead, has his uses yet.<BR><DD>Said she, repeating the White House mantra the nation has heard over and over in Clintonoid answers, some under oath and some not, to all questions about Whitewater: "I don't know anything about it."<BR><DD>She has no idea who hired the hapless Mr. Livingstone: "I know I didn't."<BR><DD>She doesn't like Gary Aldrich's new book, either. "It is a politically inspired fabrication, and I don't think anyone should take it seriously."<BR><DD>But the White House is taking it seriously indeed, mounting a full-scale offensive we hadn't seen since, well, since Bill and Hillary attacked Gennifer Flowers' claims that she had been Mr. Clinton's main squeeze for years and years in Little Rock, when Miss Flowers produced a tape recording of beddy-bye conversation that included Mr. Clinton's suggestion that Mario Cuomo was a Mafia asset. (Mr. Clinton denied saying it, of course, but apologized the next day to Mr. Cuomo for saying what he never said. Of course, it never happened, but he would never do it again.)<BR><DD>Americans soon learned what Arkansans had learned before them, to their considerable sorrow, never to take the first denial as the last word from either Clinton.<BR><DD>Mr. Stephanopoulos, citing widespread coverage of the Aldrich book by newspapers and lecturing David Brinkley on the ethics of journalism, complains that Washington newspapermen and journalists seem willing to believe anything malicious, salacious or promiscuous about his bosses. Journalists, in his view, don't enforce a high-enough credibility threshold.<BR><DD>What he means is that when someone tells the story that the prez sneaks off in the middle of the night to visit a bimbo -- no doubt to discuss Bosnia policy -- almost everyone is likely to believe it. True or not, the most risible rumor has the ring of truth. Sad that may be, but whose fault is that? Nothing but hoots of disbelief would have greeted a story like that about Jimmy Carter. The trouble Mr. Clinton and his men have on occasions like this is that he, like Jimmy Carter, has a track record.<BR><DD>We've all come to recognize the track record. First the denial -- in the case of the Aldrich book, not exactly a categorical denial -- and then the White House smear attacking "the Republican smear." Finally, days or weeks later, the facts dribble out, confirming the original story.<BR><DD>We're near the end of the first stage of this controversy, with Mr. Stephanopoulos attacking not Gary Aldrich, but Bob Dole, of all people, demanding that he disavow the book that has so panicked the White House, but that Mr. Dole has had nothing to do with.<BR><DD>The White House is not really concerned about the reputations of either Clinton. It's too late for that. But if the allegations in the Aldrich book -- like the allegations in the Meredith Oakley book, the Roger Morris book, the James Stewart book, the Bob Tyrrell book to come, take a number -- begin to stick, it's curtains for the Clintons. At some point the wonderfully/woefully tolerant American public will decide that we've had enough of Flem Snopes' grandson and his unblushing parvenue bride.<BR><DD>The White House knows how to read polls, and knows what not to attribute to them. <BR><DD>The Wall Street Journal reported only last week how some Democratic congressional candidates, even in liberal districts, are putting a little distance between themselves and the president.<BR><DD>Says John Tierney, a Democratic candidate in Massachusetts: "I'm campaigning on my own strengths." Says Steve Eastaugh, a Democratic challenger in Maryland: "A person's not worth spit if he doesn't defend his team captain. But I don't defend Clinton." Even the Democratic candidate to succeed Patsy Schroeder in Colorado says, with emphasis, that she's "not a Clinton Democrat."<BR><DD>"They're being prudent," says Charles Cook, a political analyst. "They don't know what's coming next." Too bad for George, but who does?<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=6>It's 1996, and we're all from Arkansas</FONT></center><BR><DD>What a country. (If the polls are correct.) Most Americans think the president is probably a crook, more than half of them think his wife is the family bag man and a shrew besides, and 62 percent have concluded that the administration they preside over uses the power of the government to intimidate and blackmail private citizens.<BR><DD>And they want four more years of it.<BR><DD>Bill Clinton leads Bob Dole by 17 points, or 20, or 22, or 6. Whatever. Take the poll of your choice. Talk about the Stockholm Syndrome.<BR><DD>This is good news for people who sell newspapers, because the Scandal/Outrage/Screw-up of the Day sells newspapers. It's a shame for the country, but the bigger shame appears to be that the country doesn't any longer give a damn who a president is or what he does. Hot Springs is at last writ large.<BR><DD>A poll taken for the Wall Street Journal/NBC News and released late last week, not only shows Mr. Clinton up by a ton, but 44 percent are down on Hillary, 62 percent think she's lying about past deeds of graft and greed, 35 percent say they believe the president helped himself to public money to cover his Whitewater investment, and 68 percent say they believe the Clinton White House is using the FBI, illegally, to bullyrag opponents.<BR><DD>New revelations litter the landscape, if not yet the public consciousness. The books pour out a profusion of perversion, greed, incompetence and criminal bumbling. The Clinton crowd is exposed as a collision of clowns or crooks, and probably both. It's not the comedy, stupid, it's the stupidity.<BR><DD>We've become such a nation of soap-opera addicts, having mainlined Oprah and Phil Donahue and their cretinous compatriots for so long that we no longer aspire to be "the good nation" that Alexis de Tocqueville found here almost 200 years ago, when he observed that America was great because it was good and predicted that America would cease to be great when it ceased to be good.<BR><DD>We live in the New Age now, and happy is as happy does. A new book out this week, "Unlimited Access," by Gary Aldrich, an FBI agent assigned to the White House, details how the president assuages his melancholy memories of Gennifer, Sally, Paula, Kay and the other ladies of the wee hours he left behind in Little Rock. Mr. Aldrich describes how the prez leaps into the back seat of Bruce Lindsey's car, pulls a blanket over his head and doesn't come out until they're safely in a tunnel beneath the JW Marriott Hotel, just down Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House. He takes an elevator to a suite upstairs, where the late evening's yum-yum awaits. This would be the hour for the bad guys to unleash missiles, since nobody knows where he is for hours and hours. Hillary is safe in the arms of the Sandman.<BR><DD>This beats the arrangements in Little Rock, where he was reduced to using the front seat of a car on the deserted grounds of his daughter's school or the back seat of his limo on a side street at the foot of Main. But let's be fair. Bill Clinton is not the first president to slip around with the satin smoothness of the son of a preacher man. Warren Harding made a love nest of a closet off the Oval Office. Grover Cleveland made out like Bill Clinton before he got to Washington, leaving a love child in his wake, and JFK partook often of the consolations of forbidden feminine charms and, in a fit of populist bonhomie, even shared his treats with a Mafia don.<BR><DD>FDR had a squeeze, too, but his was a vice that paid the homage of hypocrisy to virtue, and nobody knew for sure for years afterward. This was in part due to diligence and careful competence, and in part the work of media that protect Democrats to conserve energies to ravage Republicans. Bob Packwood was hounded from office for kissing women in elevators, but when Bill Clinton was caught at dropping his drawers and demanding curb service it was his accuser who was held up to public ridicule. "I'm not interested in Bill Clinton's sex life," said Johnny Apple of the New York Times in a widely quoted (and widely copied) dismissal of the larger part of Bill Clinton's life and career.<BR><DD>Some people say that this merely reflects selective distaste, but Mr. Apple is not the only man in town who finds sex a vice unfit for the consideration of gentlemen. But polls indicate that a mean average of 61.3 percent of the rest have concluded that vice is nice at twice the price, and Bill Clinton is our man.<BR><DD>Robbing banks in Arkansas is old stuff, and doesn't count. Covering it up in Washington is what anybody would have done. Using the FBI to compile dossiers on "enemies" is sort of shoddy, but Republicans deserve it. Billy Dale might have been Everyman, but thinking about it can make a man's teeth itch.<BR><DD>Too bad for Bob Dole, but that's the way the cookie -- whoever she may be -- crumbles. We're all from Arkansas now.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<IMG SRC="/wash_times/pruden.gif"><BR><font size=7>A familiar odor from<BR>
the summer of '73</font></center><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bill Clinton is not a crook. We have Chris Dodd's word on it.<BR>
  And the word of Paul Sarbanes, Mary McGrory, Richard Cohen, Jim Hoagland, Tom Lantos and maybe Norman Ornstein. And Mark Fabiani's and Mike McCurry's.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The Democratic defensive line -- the politicians, academics and journalists who work hard to make our lives happy and productive, if only we would listen to them -- assures us that despite all the evidence that the ganglion of criminal scandal called Whitewater may look like a duck, walk like a duck and even quack like a duck, it's really a turkey.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Nothing upsets these refined worthies more than for someone to remark on the obvious, that the Clinton White House smells like the Nixon White House, that the flavor of the Clintonoid excuses, rationalizations and tortured justifications is remarkably similar to the taste of stale Nixonian leftovers, and that Pennsylvania Avenue reeks of the aroma that old-timers remember from the summer of '73.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"On my scorecard," writes Jim Hoagland in The Washington Post, "the president has endured a couple of bad but far from fatal weeks as the Senate Whitewater committee rolled out its final, conflicting reports, old associates in Arkansas were convicted in crooked land deals and House hearings revealed the White House's improper possession of more than 400 FBI investigative files. All that hurts, but there was no smoking gun: The Clintons were not personally and conclusively linked to major scandal."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Say what? Mr. Hoagland, a genial fellow who has heretofore successfully disguised himself as a wise-policy wonk and good-government groupie, thus reduces the Clinton White House "enemies list," to which he insists the Clintons are not "conclusively linked" even though it happened in their house, from outrage to merely a matter of "impropriety." We didn't hear this kind of excuse for Chuck Colson, who went to prison for the possession of a single FBI file.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mary McGrory, still waiting for JFK to float out of his grave at Arlington to rescue Camelot, mocks the Republicans on the Whitewater committee as witch-hunters: "They put a pointed hat on Hillary Clinton ... and they all but called her ... the wicked witch of the White House. But that doesn't make it Watergate. She isn't the president." Evita Peron wasn't the president of Argentina, either, but she did a good imitation of the maximum leader. (Don't cry for me, Arkansas.)<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Tom Lantos, the congressman from California, turned livid the other day when someone on Bill Clinger's committee, investigating Hillary's beheading of Billy Dale, remarked on the perfectly obvious, that the Clintons, who matured, sort of, in the Watergate years, learned nothing from that experience, except how to do it better.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Paul Sarbanes, who hectored the Nixon men without mercy for crimes less outrageous than those for which the Clinton men -- and women -- have implicated themselves and each other, finds the Clintons guiltless of doing anything wrong in Washington and even perfectly innocent of anything shady in Arkansas. (Ain't nobody here but us chickens.) Richard Cohen, the conscience of The Washington Post, assures us that he took time out from his bizarre feud with blacks to personally investigate the FBI files scandal and found nothing to worry about. (So there.) The good gray Norman Ornstein, also writing in The Post, says what went wrong at the White House was a bureaucratic snafu after all: The Clintons cut the size of the White House staff, and shouldn't have, because what they (and we) actually need in Washington are more bureaucrats.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>For their part, the Clintons keep sending poor Mark Fabiani out to tell the reporters artless fibs, stretchers, fables, myths and yarns every time another scandal rocks the house. The president has put him in the position of the man who, caught by his wife between the sheets with her best friend, tells his wife: "I guess you'll try to make something out of this."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Fabiani will be on call over the next few weeks as the second Whitewater trial proceeds in Little Rock, where two bankers are on trial for robbing their bank in behalf of Bill Clinton when he needed the last few sacks of cash to sew up his gubernatorial election in 1990.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Clinton's fingerprints, so far as we know, were not on the deal. David Hale, his earlier banker angel, says Mr. Clinton was always insistent that his hands never touch the deals he designed.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bill Clinton, up 20 points in the polls and looking at disgrace and ruin, is his daddy's salesman son, still trying to sell the notion that nobody but David Hale, a convicted felon, has accused him of anything illegal. But one by one the president's men are becoming convicted felons.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Sort of reminds people with long memories of Richard Nixon.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

with not very much</font></center><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bob Dole poses an interesting question for America in 1996: Can a man with no strength of his convictions beat a man with the strength of no convictions?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Dole seems determined to campaign on a platform that can be boiled down to a forgettable bumper sticker: "Vote Republican: We're Not as Bad as You Think We Are."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bill Clinton's message, no less succinct, is the mirror image of the Republican slogan: "Vote Democratic: You're Right, We Bad -- And You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>This sets up an interesting Hobson's choice, with each alternative worse than the other, and the answer may tell us not only who the president will be, but a lot about who we are as a people. Bill Clinton and his campaign-year alter ego, Dickie Morris, understand that almost everybody mistrusts Mr. Clinton, many regarding him as a liar like his wife and a fraud like no other, but an amiable fraud nonetheless and a likable liar besides. Not only that, he's famous. Mr. Clinton and his guru believe that since America now keeps pace with fiction, liars rule.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bob Dole is a man of character and principle, even if he gives the impression that he doesn't understand what that means, exactly. In any event, he gives the impression that he's not really serious about wanting to be president. He seems to think the presidency is something like being a senator, only bigger, if not necessarily better. He believes in things, but not too much, which is good, but he's not as famous as Bill Clinton, which is not so good.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The poor guy has been so long in the Senate, where cutting deals is the mark of leadership, that when he closes a sale now, he can't shut up. He had the abortion question squared and boxed, safely on the shelf, with all the Christian "extremists" willing to put their suspicions aside, and then somebody or something persuaded him that Colin Powell and John Warner and Christie Whitman and the pro-choice wing of the party deserved a little lagniappe. Having flaunted his tolerance in the face of the conservatives, he shoved it down their throats.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>He expects to bask in the applause of the liberals and Democrats whose approval such Republicans not-so-secretly covet. We'll see how long he has to wait for that. Within minutes after his tribute to the successes of 1970s liberalism in his farewell address to the Senate, all but ignoring the legacy of Ronald Reagan in his rush to shower accolades on the Democrats who thwarted the Gipper's revolution, the Democratic National Committee in return faxed a bulletin to political writers listing 10 bad things Mr. Dole had done as a senator. (Note to Colin Powell: They're ready for you.)<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Given the givens, selling himself as the lesser evil is not necessarily a hopeless strategy. Despite the piously naive cliches of the political-science professors, the pundits and the good-government groupies, most people vote against, not for. Bill Clinton has disillusioned a lot of his 43 percent of '92, but if he has persuaded many in the 57 percent who voted against him in '92 that he's better than they thought he was, it's difficult to find them.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>No one understands this better than Mr. Clinton and Dickie Morris. That's why Mr. Clinton is running this year as a conservative Republican. He'll steal every issue Bob Dole lets him steal, understanding that he can't fool all the people all the time, but with a little Clinton luck maybe he can fool enough.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>What terrifies the president and the man behind the curtain is the sure and certain knowledge that, despite everything the media elites can do to persuade everyone otherwise, Americans are growing more, not less, conservative. A poll taken last month for USA Today demonstrates that 83 percent of Americans favor a balanced budget, 83 percent want to prohibit racial preferences (i.e., scrap affirmative action), 82 percent want to make English the official language, 80 percent want life sentences imposed on drug dealers, 74 percent want term limits, 73 percent want prayer in the schools, 73 percent oppose legalization of marijuana, 71 percent want to cut off welfare to deadbeats, 71 percent want to reduce the number of government agencies, 67 percent oppose same-sex "marriage," and 57 percent oppose partial-birth abortions.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Exact or not, such percentages tell Mr. Clinton -- and almost any other politician who can stay awake through the second cup of coffee -- who the real extremists are, and that there's no percentage in diluting a conservative message.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>That's why he intends to run to the right of Bob Dole if the Republican nominee lets him. Mr. Dole and his compassioneers, full of moderation and meekness, may persuade a few people that he's not as bad as they think he is, but he'll never get anyone to throw his hat in the air with a message like that. An army marches on its stomach, and you can't win a war on milk and toast.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=6>The limited hangout at the White House</FONT></center><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Nothing makes Bill Clinton and Miss Hillary and their friends jump quite like barking the words "Nixon" and "Watergate" at them, in the manner of thrusting a cross in the face of Count Dracula.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Like the count, they quail.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>You can almost see the beads of perspiration breaking out in the hollow of Miss Hillary's pretty throat, and the president reddens like a schoolboy caught with a hot book hidden between the covers of his geography text.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>There's no sign yet of the ghost of Richard Nixon, but he can't be pleased by the comparison, either. Fortunately, it's difficult to libel the dead.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The first lady, who worked as a staff lawyer for the congressional committees working to bring down Mr. Nixon an eon ago, is a quick study and she learned a lot. Her mistake, as it may turn out, is that she thought she could make the Nixon strategy work in her husband's White House.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Nixon's men came up with what they called "the modified limited hangout," the paying out of as few of the sordid details of the Watergate scandal as possible in hopes that the press would go away.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Clinton's men are similarly paying out the sordid details of the Whitewater collection of scandals -- any one of which might be worse than the third-rate burglary of the offices of the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate Office Building on Virginia Avenue NW -- in the hopes that the press, with an attention span shorter than you could find in any kindergarten class, will get bored and go away.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The modified limited hangout is not working any better for the Clintons than it did for Mr. Nixon, for whom ultimately it did not work at all. Pity the poor spokesmen at the White House. Not only are they asked to tell fibs, distortions and stretchers to the reporters, some of whom are finally getting it, but the fibs, distortions and stretchers change every hour on the hour.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Late last week, Mr. Clinton's hapless excuses men came up with the third and fourth explanations of why the president's lawyer (and we can assume that a smart Yale lawyer like Bill Clinton knew about it all the time) tried to get the confidential FBI files on Billy Dale, covering 30 years of his life, seven months after the first lady ordered him fired as director of the White House travel office.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Rep. William Clinger of Pennsylvania suggests that Bernard Nussbaum, who was the president's lawyer, sought the FBI documents because even then the White House was concocting a smear job on Mr. Dale. Naturally, Mr. Nussbaum couldn't remember sending the request to the FBI. Nobody in this White House ever remembers anything. This is the first White House in history to make Alzheimer's disease, with its consequent loss of memory, a helpful qualification for employment.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Then someone at the White House had another bright idea. Maybe someone could say that Mr. Dale was being considered for another White House position, and they needed the background checks to make sure they knew who he was. He had only worked for the U.S. government for three decades. This was an excuse first tried at the Nixon White House when, in a celebrated fiasco, it got caught putting together a dossier on a prominent Washington reporter and then insisted that he was being considered for an important job in the administration.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But wait! The FBI dossier was not asked for by Bernie Nussbaum, who as everybody knows would never pull a dirty trick, but by the General Accounting Office. Drat! Then the GAO said no, it had never asked for nor looked at FBI files on Mr. Dale.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Back to the drawing board once more: The White House said it asked the FBI for the files by "accident" when it routinely sought background reports on all White House employees. Bernie, George, Bruce, Patsy, Harold, Maggie, maybe even Hillary. Not just Billy and the boys, but everyone in the Goodtime Gang.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>This was too much for Louis Freeh, the director of the FBI. He certainly doesn't want to do a Patrick Gray imitation, and be left twisting slowly, slowly in the wind. He ordered a full investigation of the White House request for the FBI dossier.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"He certainly doesn't want the bureau mixed up in this stuff," says an official at FBI headquarters. "He has moved to make sure that the public's perception is that there's not some cozy relationship between the White House and bureau executives."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>This is surely a puzzlement to the president, accustomed to using the State Police for all manner of conveniences when he was the governor of Arkansas. Puzzling to the first lady as well, who thought she had learned from the errors of the Nixon White House and imagined that the failure was not in conception, but in execution.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

Learning lessons,<BR>all of them wrong
</FONT></center>

<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30
HEIGHT=0>When Jefferson Davis was inaugurated as the president of the
Confederacy on the steps of the Capitol in Montgomery, he and the occasion were
acclaimed as the time and place where "the man and the hour have met."<BR><IMG
SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We may be on the scene of
another occasion when the planets align themselves with reckless abandon and
God throws down the stars in a fit of divine disgust. Bill Clinton, the man, and
the nation, in an hour of disarray, have met.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT=""
ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Disaster followed Davis, and disaster is no doubt
stalking us, too. Billy Graham said it best the other day when he came to
Washington to receive the Medal of Freedom: "... the greatest nation in history
stands on the brink of self-destruction."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top
WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The signs of unraveling are certainly all about. The chief of
the Navy, having presided over the emasculation of the greatest sea service in
the history of man (presuming Atlantis had nothing better), shoots himself in the
chest, which almost anyone's elderly aunts, armed with their modest knowledge
of firearms, could have told him was not the way to do it. He was afraid someone
might think he was wearing his medals crooked.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT=""
ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>This was the most dramatic Washington suicide
since James Forrestal, the secretary of defense, leaped from a window at the top
of Bethesda Naval Hospital in 1947, pursued by the vicious demons and fierce
worms known only to himself, haunted by fears of the red menace when it was
not fashionable to be so haunted. It's already the second major suicide of the
Clinton administration, and as the going gets tougher, the curveballs breaking
ever more sharply across the plate, all the president's men must stand resolute
against despair.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30
HEIGHT=0>Like Vince Foster, Mike Boorda was by all accounts a man of splendid
character and moral stature, but, like Mr. Foster, he was over his head in the pool
of ego and ambition that the capital is and has been since the days when someone
was forever trying to set fire to George Washington's wooden teeth.<BR><IMG
SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>What other explanation can
there be for the suicide of a warrior who is expected to dispatch 19-year-old
boys -- and pregnant 19-year-old girls, to make the most shameful point -- to
court a briny death on the stormy sea but who so quails at the prospect of talking
to a reporter that he takes the weak man's out?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT=""
ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>It's difficult to imagine that an old salt as
experienced as Mike Boorda would have killed himself over the misuse of his
medals, as dear as such decorations are to the men who understand the sacrifice
required to win them. It's not so difficult to understand why Washington, with its
unerring instinct for getting it wrong, took a crash course last week in how many
pins can dance on a campaign ribbon.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top
WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Adm. Boorda, though skillful enough at playing the
bureaucratic game to make it to the top of the sea service, might have understood
that at the end he had let down his beloved Navy by betraying it into the hands of
snotty Clintonoids who think that no opportunity must be missed to emasculate
the military the commander in chief has said he "loathes."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif"
ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The admiral conceded months before his
death that he reckoned that he had let down the Navy by caving in to the
pressures brought by the neurotic feminists inside and outside the Congress, and
the frightened senators (some of them Republicans) leaping to chairs, pulling up
their pants' legs to cry "eeeek!" when Pat Schroeder walks into the room, who
demanded the head of Adm. Stanley Arthur when he was nominated to be the
commander of the Pacific Command.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top
WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Adm. Arthur, a 500-mission hero of the Vietnam War
(enough already to condemn him to scorn and ridicule), was accused of reaching
an incorrect judgment when a female pilot filed a sexual-harassment claim
against her flight instructors. Upon investigation, Adm. Arthur ruled the claim
without substantial merit. The poor woman should count her lack of blessings;
she might have been assigned to the USS Acadia, "the Love Boat," which returned
from the Persian Gulf War with 10 percent of her crew in a family way, more in
need of diapers and bassinets than armor and bullets.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif"
ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The promotion was held up by a single
senator, the self-righteously strange David Durenberger of Minnesota. "I should
have fought this to the end," Adm. Boorda conceded to the Navy Times. "I helped
screw it up, and I don't feel good about it."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT=""
ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>That made everything A-OK, of course. "Feeling
good" is what life in Bill Clinton's America is all about. But not to everyone. Jim
Webb, another authentic hero of Vietnam who was Ronald Reagan's secretary of
the Navy, demanded of the weak John Dalton, the Clintonoid secretary of the Navy,
and of Mike Boorda: "Where was the outrage?"<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT=""
ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But outrage is not appropriate in a Navy fit for a
lady, and a ladies' Navy is what we've got.

No cheap sentiment<BR>for his generation
</FONT></center>

<BR><DD>Gentlemen (and ladies): Start your spinning.

<BR><DD> This is the Bob Dole nobody expected to see, lean and tough and poignant without the cheap sentiment, and from the White House to the newsrooms of the elites (and some who only dream of being among the elites), the favorite adjective was &quot;desperate.&quot;

<BR><DD>&quot;The irony of Dole's decision ... is that one of the pivots of Dole's campaign was in fact an admission of his defeat&quot; (from the Boston Globe). The announcement &quot;is a drastic bid to unyoke himself from an unpopular Republican Congress ...&quot; (from the San Jose Mercury News). &quot;A bold maneuver, full of potential perils - not the least the possibility that an electorate weary of tactics and stratagems would see his resignation from the Senate as just another gimmick ...&quot; (from the New York Times).

<BR><DD>Some of the punditry was born of the amnesia that strikes nearly everyone who has lived in Washington long enough to get a telephone. Says Peter Hart, the Democratic pollster: &quot;Dole will live to rue the day. ... It's too tactical. You're denying your career. It's like going back to Russell and announcing you're moving to New York.&quot;

<BR><DD>Kevin Phillips, the Democrats' favorite Republican analyst, agreed: &quot;I don't think this puts a whole lot of electricity in his socket. He can go out and give speeches, but the speeches he gave before were no good.&quot; Concurred Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution, echoing the favorite spinsters' word of the day: &quot;It sounds like a strategy that's a good deal more desperate than the situation demands now.&quot;

<BR><DD>There's no doubting that Mr. Dole was in tough shape - dire straits, a panic, up a creek without the paddle, almost any of the cliches the pundits rush to employ. But the speech, one of the most memorable campaign speeches since Ronald Reagan's famous speech for Barry Goldwater in 1964, does not strike the ears of Middle America as a gimmick, a stratagem or even a tactic. (Most people forgive politicians their tactics, even when they shoot trespassers.)

<BR><DD>Mr. Dole sounded at last like a man who knew what he was doing, who was saying what he thinks because he was speaking from the heart. His careful, precise allusion to his heroic service in World War II struck just the right grace note. There is life after all beyond a company job in the ultimate company town: &quot;I will be the same man I was when I walked into the room, the same man I was yesterday and the day before, and a long time ago when I arose from my hospital bed and was permitted by the grace of God to walk again in the world. And I trust in the hard way, for little has come to me except in the hard way, which is good because we have a hard task ahead of us.&quot;

<BR><DD>He does, indeed. But when he speaks his mind from his heart, it rings as true as the sound of distant battle. Speaking this way now, after so many months of avoiding all sentiment because he was afraid it would sound like cheap sentiment, makes it all the more believable. If hardly anyone can imagine authentic sincerity from Bill Clinton, who will say everything about anything to anybody, hardly anyone doubts that the tears and the choked sobs were real. Nobody, said Steve Forbes after watching the remarkable ceremony on television, can pucker a lip like Bill Clinton, and only the most foolish of fools would try.

<BR><DD>The most heartfelt part of the Dole farewell was the hardest for Washington to credit: &quot;My campaign for the president is not merely about obtaining office. It's about fundamental things, consequential things, things that are real. My campaign is about telling the truth, it's about doing what is right, it's about electing a president who's not attracted to the glories of the office, but rather its difficulties.&quot;

<BR><DD>Lincoln's famous observation about not being able to fool all the people all the time will get its test this year. Bill Clinton has a lot of things going for him - youth, vigor, the gift of gab unencumbered by steadfast principle or heartfelt conviction - and the greatest of all is his confident reliance on the cheerful willingness of the public to cut a little slack to a roguish shill.

<BR><DD>Mr. Dole is embarked on a mission to see how many adults are left in America. He has said that he thinks a man of his generation, arguably the bravest and most dependable since the nation sent two mighty armies to battle against each other and there was enough left over to tame a frontier and build a constellation of gleaming cities, has enough left over this time for one final mission.

<BR><DD>Like Hernando Cortes, the Spanish conquistador who burned his boats on the beaches of Mexico 400 years ago to impress upon his crewmen that they were in the New World to stand or die, the Republican candidate for president is gambling that America has had enough of the children's hour.

Somewhere there's a<BR>hero from Kansas
</FONT></center>

<BR><DD>Now that someone from Kansas has to stand up to the wizard behind the curtain, where's Dorothy?

<BR><DD>The wizard, without even popping a sweat, has sent the Republicans into a tailspin a lot like the crash of George Bush in 1992, when his eye-popping poll numbers fell from 92 percent in the wake of the war in the Gulf to 38 percent in the ruins of November.

<BR><DD>One loud &quot;boo!&quot; from the nation's most famous draft dodger and the entire regiment of Republicans, who only yesterday imagined they should be posing for recruiting posters, went flying for cover, crawling up under the nearest front porch to hide with the dogs. Bill Clinton, who's never met a woman he didn't run after or a man he didn't run from, was the most astonished pol in town.

<BR><DD>When the president found someone to throw the first punch at Newt Gingrich, he never imagined that nobody would strike back. When he found someone to throw the second punch, he never imagined that the Republicans themselves would join in piling on.

<BR><DD>The campaign to demonize the speaker was simple and brutish: Throw out lies and distortions and scream even louder when the Republicans fire back. The lies got louder, but the Republicans never fired back.

<BR><DD>The speaker's aims were not radical, unless most of us are radical: Cut down the size of government, shrink the budget on which big government feeds, crack down on criminals, throttle welfare cheaters, strengthen the military, roll back the regulatory bureaucracy, cut the throat of the trial-lawyer lobby before everyone but the lawyers are bankrupt, limit the terms of congressmen so they can return home to productive jobs, take the necessary steps to preserve the medical-care safety net - and cut taxes. Some radicalism.

<BR><DD>So radical, in fact, that President Clinton adopted most of these goals himself, beginning with his assertion that &quot;the era of big government is over.&quot; None of his own troops, liberals all, believe he really means it. Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, the Vietnam war hero whose contempt for the organizer of Vietnam anti-war rallies is obvious, calls him &quot;an unusually good liar,&quot; and in this case the president's big-government allies feel reassured.

<BR><DD>Some of the speaker's erstwhile allies, in the bravura of the morning after the November '94 blowout, likened their mighty victory to the D-Day landings at Normandy. The analogy, for a bunch of guys who mostly spent the Vietnam war at the Student Union, sounded a little far-fetched to some aging ears, but if some of these warriors had been barreling across France in the summer of '44 they would have braked cold on hearing Axis Sally's first diatribe against that ol' meanie Georgie Patton, and looked for a barn to hide in. Second Lt. Al D'Amato would have wanted the Germans to understand that he never really liked that Patton fella, anyway.

<BR><DD>Who can be surprised that the clouds of pink and baby blue floating over the White House are made of gauze and giddiness? Bill Clinton hasn't had a stroke of luck like the Republican collapse since Monroe Schwarzlose, a turkey farmer so obscure that even Mrs. Schwarzlose wasn't sure who he was, turned up as his only serious opponent in a Democratic gubernatorial primary back home. (Mr. Clinton won, but not by much.)

<BR><DD>The moral is that the Republicans can make a race of it in '96, too, if they can figure out which end of the gun you shoot with, and how to tell a foot from foe.

<BR><DD>For weeks everyone in Washington was trying to figure out whether Bob Dole was asleep, or merely dead, and now they're trying to figure out whether Al D'Amato is the hit man from Cleveland, dispatched by Mr. Dole, or whether he's just a slap-happy, showing off.

<BR><DD>What the Republicans seem to have lost sight of - and Bill Clinton hasn't - is that the conservative tide is still running, and gaining momentum. The great risk to Republican fortunes is that the voters will conclude that the Grand Old Partypoopers never had the convictions they seemed to have the courage of only a few months ago. Bill Clinton has no convictions, either, but he knows better than anyone else how to fake it.

<BR><DD>Mike McCurry, his press agent, remarked May 6 that the pendulum measuring the Clinton fortunes is groaning against the rope, close to reaching its apogee. Soon everything that has been breaking in the president's favor may begin breaking the other way.

<BR><DD>But maybe not. Iron laws govern politics, but not the iron laws of physics. The Republicans think they've got the character issue cold, and maybe they do, but in a street fight and a presidential campaign raw courage can count for more than character.

<BR><DD>The wizard, trembling behind the curtain, understood that. So did a little girl from Kansas.

The stern rebuke of<BR>a Sunday-school boy
</FONT></center>

<BR><DD>To everything a season, to quote the forbidden texts, and that includes even politics. If you wait long enough, the wheel comes 'round.

<BR><DD>Only nine presidential campaigns ago, the elites of media and academe were aghast at the redneck notion, propagated by the lesser fundamentalist tribes, that the pope and his Roman legions would impose the morality of a foreign church on America if Americans were foolish enough to elect John F. Kennedy.

<BR><DD>Voting for the Catholic candidate thus became something close to a civic duty for the enlightened American. The enlightened elites of course never imagined that anyone as smart and as attractive as a Kennedy actually believed any of that religious stuff, just as the enlightened elites never imagined that Martin Luther King and his fellow clergymen in the civil-rights movement were men of actual faith. In 1965, when I asked to interview Dr. King and said that I wanted to talk about faith as well as politics, he invited me to lunch in New York. &quot;I thought no one would ever ask,&quot; he told me, and a promised 30 minutes stretched into the mellow gloaming of late afternoon, long past the ham sandwiches at his desk, and we talked about how faith in Christ must guide every step in a believer's life.

<BR><DD>Ah, but now the enlightened elites are not so sure.

<BR><DD>Just when they thought the streets - or at least the power positions in the culture - were safe for atheists and pagans, witches and wizards and assorted lesser geeks, along comes something barbaric and grotesque like President Clinton's veto of the partial-birth abortion bill. Suddenly the priests and preachers and rabbis think they have something to say that the rest of us ought to hear.

<BR><DD>Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York, a Catholic and a Republican who usually supports secular Democratic positions (and whose efforts at raising well-behaved children have been mixed), was one of the first to tell Pope John Paul II to butt out of the moral argument. &quot;Such direct involvement in politics is not a good idea, because I think it confuses people.&quot;

<BR><DD>This is an odd view, that politicians and not priests should declaim on moral issues, and that when priests want to say something about moral issues they should be careful not to offend the politicians.

<BR><DD>The partial-birth abortion procedure is certainly a moral issue, though the Ministry of Euphemy has already decreed that it must be called &quot;intact dilation and evacuation,&quot; or &quot;late-term abortion,&quot; which is somewhat like calling the District of Columbia &quot;an interesting experiment in local government.&quot; But you may have noticed that the media have already taken the cue.

<BR><DD>This particular abortion, on a whole baby in the act of being born, is so gruesome, so cruel, so like something from the Manual of Procedure at Auschwitz, that the vicars of the Catholic Church, beginning with the vicar of Rome, have suspended their usual reticence at involving themselves in American electoral politics to tell Bill Clinton that he blundered in behalf of the forces of darkness.

<BR><DD>Cardinal John O'Connor of New York departed from his sermon during Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral to rebuke those who, like His Honor the mayor, denounced the pope for sticking his nose in what the mayor insists is only the business of politicians.

<BR><DD>Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston, appearing on the David Brinkley program, repeated for television what he had said earlier, that if a public official finds an irresolvable conflict between his conscience - the president has said that he personally finds this abortion procedure repugnant - and public service he should resign.

<BR><DD>&quot;I think that's rather straightforward,&quot; the cardinal said. &quot;It means what it says. I believe that an individual has an obligation to follow his or her own conscience, and I don't think any of us would want to be served by persons who don't do that.&quot;

<BR><DD>Well, of course no one could imagine that he had Bill Clinton in mind as a man conflicted by demands of duty and conscience, but it is curious that a pol as attuned to the political uses of public worship could have made such a miscalculation. Bill Clinton, after all, is the man who, after losing his first bid for re-election as governor of Arkansas, suddenly joined the largest Baptist church in Arkansas, which telecasts its Sunday morning services, and joined the choir on the assurance that he could sing from a position at the preacher's right hand, in full view of the camera at all times.

<BR><DD>Some cynical people have noted that now, since it has become clear that Baptists and other evangelicals aren't likely to do doodly-squat for him in November, he has abandoned his church for Hillary's Methodist congregation, one of the most liberal in town. This is, of course, merely another of those Arkansas coincidences.

<title>Rockwell: Bad Law Bites Back -- 12/3/96</title>

<h2>Bad Law Bites Back  </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>
<P>
<BR> 
The &quot;Contract with America,&quot; reflexively denounced
by leftliberals, was never as good as its bad reputation. It posed
as big government's tormentor, but on close analysis proved to
be more gimmick than gauntlet. It even included some planks that
increased the power of the central state.
<P>
One item in particular did positive harm. This was the Congressional
Accountability Act, passed in the first days of the last &quot;revolutionary&quot;
Congress. Its point was to apply the government's health and labor
laws to Congress, thereby ending its previous, and presumably
hypocritical, exemption. Hardly anyone stopped to ask: was there
a reason for exempting Congress in the first place? 
<P>
Congress is beginning to find out. If labor laws apply to
Congress, its employees can use the courts to demand quotas, form
unions, threaten strikes, and generally cause trouble. And who
enforces all these laws? Bureaucrats in the executive branch.
That gives the Clinton administrationor whoever happens to be
in chargedirect control of Congressional offices.  
<P>
In the American constitutional tradition, Congress is <I>supposed</I>
to be exempt from any laws enforced by the executive. Remember
the doctrine of the separation of powers that used to be taught
in highschool civics? Congress supervises the executive, not the
reverse. Any other system invites abuse of power, corruption,
and intimidation of the elected officials closest to the people.
<P>
Let's say some lawmaker wants to cut the budget of the Labor
Department, and has a good chance of succeeding. Well, maybe the
Secretary of Labor might get interested in whether this lawmaker
is obeying all the laws on overtime pay or racial nondiscrimination.
Just the accusation would cause harm.  
<P>
To avoid that kind of intimidation, lawmakers might decide
they have better things to do than attack the agencies with new
legal power over them. That takes the heat off the home of big
governmentthe executiveand puts it on the Congress, the branch
charged with overseeing the spending of our tax dollars. 
<P>
The proponents of the Accountability Act argued that if Congress
is going to impose lawslike racial quotas or the minimum wageon
the private sector, the least it can do is obey these laws themselves.

<P>
For starters, not all legislators vote for every law. Why
should a majority of lawmakers be able to impose laws, enforced
by the president, on a minority of lawmakers? Even if a law passes
unanimously in one Congress, why should a future Congress be bound
by it? Congressmen should have sovereign immunity from all these
laws, even when they are passed by the Congress itself. 
<P>
A case now before Congress illustrates the point. Members
of the U.S. Capitol Police, a Congressional institution, want
to form a union, an action made possible only by the police applying
the executivedepartment labor code to themselves. In response,
the Republicans have done the right thing: sued to prevent it
from happening.
<P>
As the Republicans arguethough not for the recordunionization
introduces all sorts of complications. Unionized cops can, for
example, engage in work slowdowns and expel conservative, antiunion
police. Moreover, unions are heavily political organizations,
backing Democrats in all national elections.
<P>
If this suit succeedsand it probably will notit would gut
the Congressional Accountability Act, which would be great. But
by attempting to prevent unionization, the 105th Congress puts
itself in the ironic position of trying to repeal one of the most
heralded, if wrongheaded, achievements of the 104th.
<P>
When imposed against private companies, U.S. health, safety,
and labor laws cost hundreds of billions in lost productivity
every year. They are a major source of the secular decline in
American business vibrancy. Why did Congress, which should be
trying to repeal these laws, instead expand them?
<P>
When confronted with this point, some people argue that the
real purpose is to make Congressmen &quot;feel&quot; the laws
they have imposed on the American people and thereby encourage
them to work towards cutting red tape. But this too is a flight
of fancy. The authors of the Contract believe in these laws for
the private sector, and meanwhile, good lawmakers face witch-hunts
by the regime they are supposed to be battling. 
<P>
 Congress is right in suing to stop a police union. But it
should also admit it made a mistake in imposing this law on itself,
repeal the darn thing, and then repeal the oppressive regulations
that make life a living heck for American business.
<P>

<title>December 2, 1996--Murder by Air Bag</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<I>December 2, 1996</I><p>
<h2>Murder by Air Bag</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>
<P>
<BR>
Can we trust government to regulate business? For an answer, take
a look at the great airbag fiasco. Five years ago, the government
mandated that air bags be installed in cars. In an instance of
death by government, these bags kill people involved in fender
benders. 
<P>
Turns out, the car makers were right about the dangers all along.
But they were browbeaten and overruled by the usual cabal of anticapitalist
militants, Congressional liberals, and regulatory bureaucrats.
Let's review the history. 
<P>
Ralph Nader and his political network never stopped trying to
replicate the successful smear of the Corvair, as found in his
famous fairy tale, <I>Unsafe at Any Speed</I>. In the seventies,
they dreamed up a new way to attack the car industry, by now vulnerable
to media assaults. 
<P>
Here's what Nader and the gang came up with. Hear ye, hear ye:
there's a technology that would massively cut automobile deaths.
It is a pillow that pops out of the steering wheel in an collision.
Yes, it's even better than the seatbelt.
<P>
So why aren't these magic pillows available on cars? Why, indeed,
aren't they mandatory? In a word: Greed, said Nader and Co. The
car makers could be spending money to save your life. Instead
they are lining their pockets with profits from unsafe vehicles.
<P>
Thus did the air bag become the leftwing craze of the Carter years.
Typically, the product and the mythology surrounding it embodied
socialist paranoia. In this view, the capitalist is secretly killing
the consumer while the average man is too stupid to know about
it, which is why we need the government to intervene.  
<P>
But if air bags were a valuable product worth the expense, car
companies would have installed them while Nader was in law school,
if only to gain an advantage over the competition. 
<P>
None of the Naderite nonsense was convincing to people who knew
something about markets. But the media laughed at company warnings:
that, first, air bags were not cost efficient (yes, you can put
a price tag on safety; we could all drive around in tanks, after
all). Second, air bags would make people think they could get
by without a seatbelt, thus increasing injury. 
<P>
Third, that air bags are not soft and fluffy at all, but can hit
your forehead like a 200 mph brick wall. You might have all your
limbs after a crash, but you might also be dead. The companies
warned that children and small women were particularly at risk.
<P>
But the crash dummies favored by the consumer groups didn't test
for this factor, and, anyway, the well had been poisoned. The
media dismissed company complaints as more evidence of the capitalist
conspiracy to make people drive dangerous cars.
<P>
The government prevailed against the car companies, and the airbag
mandate went into effect. Everyone cheered Ralph and booed Detroit.
But the bags added billions to the cost of cars, led Americans
to drive more recklessly, and directly killed some fifty people
in just the last three years, including the infant who was decapitated
by an air bag in Idaho.
<P>
Haven't they also saved 1,500 lives? That's the claim, but there's
no way to know. It's easy for the airbag lobby to play fast and
loose with these hypotheticals.
<P>
Plus, it's one thing to have a loved one die in a tragic traffic
fluke; it's quite another to have him killed by a government mandate.
It's the difference between falling and being shoved off a ledge.

<P>
To correct the problem, the government is considering a number
of options. One is to allow people to have their air bags disconnected
by car dealerships. That's right: they can't do that legally now.
<P>
Another is to mandate a huge warning sign on the dashboard: WARNING!
DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY CAN OCCUR. Thanks a lot. Another is to
mandate a &quot;smart&quot; bag that will supposedly adjust to
your height and weight so it won't kill you. Still another would
order you to keep your baby in the back seat (as if a single parent
could take a long commute that way).
<P>
Mandate, mandate, mandate, that's all the government can talk
about. Instead, those behind this mess should be offering public
apologies and then forced to pay compensation to the families
who've had their mothers and children murdered by air bags, to
the car buyers who've had their prices artificially increased,
and to the car companies that have been vilified and harassed.
<P>
Even if the government won't draw the right lesson from this fiasco,
we should. Don't trust the feds with your safety. Trust those
in private enterprise, who have the best interests of the consumer
in mind. They won't kill you and then lie about it. 
<P>

<title>Rockwell: The Republican Mixed Economy -- 8/22/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<I>August 22, 1996</I><p>
<h2>The Republican Mixed Economy</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>
<P>
<BR> 




In the 1950s and following, when full-blown socialism began to lose 
its intellectual credibility, there arose a theory of the "mixed 
economy." The idea was that the best of socialism and capitalism can 
be combined into a new system that curbs the excesses of both. The 
result was the political economy of contradiction: "market socialism," 
"collective entrepreneurship," and "community investment," among many 
other strange hybrids. <p>

The theory of the mixed economy didn't get very far, no doubt because 
of its confused and conflicting character. Property is either private 
or it isn't. Prices either float freely or they don't. Investment is 
either market-driven or it's not. One system must dominate the other, 
in the same way that cars must drive on the left- or the right-hand 
side of the road. <p>

The idea of the mixed economy may have fizzled among American liberals 
(though academic publishers are still enthralled with the idea). In 
the Republican Party, however, the idea is making a huge comeback. The 
party is not backing the old mix of socialism and capitalism or 
anything as systematic as that; it is backing the political economy of 
polar opposites.<p>

No where is this more evident than in the Republican treatment of the 
budget. With Jack Kemp on the ticket, supply sideism has again become 
the dominant fiscal ideology. There's nothing wrong with the idea that 
tax cuts fuel economic growth. The American people are overtaxed, and 
only an all-out statist would deny it. The problem is the belief that 
government spending can go up forever without someone, sometime, 
having to pay for it. <p>

The Republican plan has not spelled out any spending cuts because Jack 
Kemp doesn't believe they're necessary (as he demonstrated during his 
free-spending HUD years). He's got a long history of excoriating 
people to his right who have the courage to call for cuts in Social 
Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare generally. He never misses 
the chance to underscore the ticket's desire to keep the social 
"safety net" exactly the way it is, or even expand it. <p>

In some areas, Republicans are pushing for huge spending increases. 
For example, they say that the Clinton administration has cut the 
military budget too far too fast, and that they will reverse course 
with tens of billions in new spending. And they are promoting the 
hare-brained idea that taxpayers should foot the private-school bills 
of any kid who is dissatisfied with public school. <p>

At the same time, tax cuts have become the centerpiece of the 
campaign. They are promising a three-year 15 percent cut in income tax 
rates, a per child tax rebate, and a 50 percent capital gains tax cut. 
That's laudable, though the full program--even if it passes--won't 
begin to reverse the tax increases Robert Dole has engineered during 
his 35 years in office. <p>

For once, liberals are asking the right question: where in tax-cut 
land is the money going to come from to supply new guns to the 
Pentagon, and a $2000 annual voucher to every "poor" child in America? 
The candidates won't say, except to suggest that this contradiction 
will be solved through the mysterious magic of "economic growth." 
Private enterprise can be enlisted, unwittingly, to pay for ever-
higher public spending. <p>

The ticket compounds the error by suggesting it will "end the IRS as 
we know it," a phrase designed to lead voters to believe they will no 
longer have to answer to the tax police. Here again, the idea is a 
fine one. But to make it a reality, government must dramatically curb 
its appetite for spending. Without such curbs, the promise to stop 
collecting taxes, or make paying them less onerous, is deeply 
deceptive.  <p>

There is such a thing as the bottom line. Every dime in new public 
spending must be extracted from private markets, either through 
stepped-up use of the taxing power or more borrowing, or by calling on 
the Federal Reserve to monetize the debt by printing money. All three 
have a destabilizing effect on the financial markets at some point. 
There's no such thing as having your cake and eating it too. <p>

The same contradictions spoil the Republican monetary policy. Jack 
Kemp has long advocated a gold standard (or, more strictly, a gold 
price rule for monetary management). But the chief benefit of the gold 
standard is that it puts shackles on the ability of government to 
borrow and monetize debt. You can always print paper money (which is 
why politicians like our present money system), but gold has a fixed 
supply (alchemy being the stuff of legend). <p>

At the same time, Kemp evangelizes for giving the poor more "access to 
credit." He endorses the dangerous movement to force banks to lend 
money to borrowers on grounds of their lowly economic status, without 
regard to whether the loans will be paid back on time or ever. This 
policy requires the kind of loose money regime absolutely prohibited 
by the gold standard. You can't expect to gain the benefits of a gold 
standard unless you're willing to accept its discipline. <p>

The same mixed-up approach is evident in their statements about 
regulation. Dole and Kemp employ the rhetoric of deregulation and call 
for the government to stop muscling private enterprise. At the same 
time, just prior to the convention, Dole told a group of disability 
activists that he is going to expand enforcement of his pet Americans 
With Disabilities Act.<p>

Yet the ADA--which calls on all public and private entities  to make 
accommodation for every conceivable disability, physical or mental--is 
surpassed only by the Clean Air Act in the costs and burdens it places 
on business. According to the letter of the law and court precedent, 
practically every business and public facility is in violation right 
now. For that reason, the ADA has become the latest get-rich-quick 
scheme for the litigious overclass of trial lawyers. <p>

So it goes for the freedom of association. The ticket has strongly 
implied it will retain the laws imposing affirmative action; indeed 
Kemp has been a rabid advocate of these policies. At the same time, 
the Republicans want to be seen as opposing "quotas," the logical and 
necessary outcome of anti-discrimination laws empowering the 
government with defining what constitutes illegal preference in the 
workforce. <p>

On and on it goes with welfare spending (they promise both a 
guaranteed national income and policies to force people to work), 
education (they promise to abolish the Department of Education and to 
have it administer a federal voucher program), immigration (they 
promise to end the free ride and give immigrants full rights to 
welfare), and trade (it is supposed to be both "free" and "fair," i.e. 
restrictive).  <p>

The final and most brazen contradiction has been the Republican 
Achilles heel for at least three decades. They promise smaller 
government at home while insisting that the U.S. step up its empire of 
foreign aid, foreign troops, and foreign wars. This is the most deeply 
dishonest of all the clashing positions within the Republican grab 
bag. A government big enough to run a global empire will hardly shrink 
from total social management at home. <p>

Philosophers speak of antinomies: contradictory truths that may not 
negate each other. Unfortunately for Republicans, these do not exist 
in economic policy. The mixed economy of Robert Dole and Jack Kemp is 
just as mixed-up as the attempt to blend socialism and capitalism. 
Reality eventually forces the politicians who try it to choose one 
path or the other. <p>

<title>Rockwell: Conservatives and Vouchers -- 7/22/96</title>

<h2>
Conservatives and Vouchers</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Seeking to align himself more closely with conservatives 
before the Republican convention, Bob Dole has endorsed a federal 
school voucher program. But if he had done his homework, he would 
have known that conservatives have grave reservations about 
putting private schools on the dole. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mr. Dole's idea is a four-year pilot program that would cost 
$5 billion, with half the bill paid by the federal government 
providing the states foot the rest. Four million students from 
mostly poor families would get grants to attend private schools.
This is "a civil rights movement for the 1990s," he said. Is it? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For decades, conservatives have debated with liberals on 
education. Liberals say money needs to be redistributed from rich 
districts to poor ones, and overall spending increased 
dramatically. Bosh, say conservatives. The answer lies with local 
control, returning to basics, and rewarding achievement. Throwing 
more money at the problem--especially federal money--will not 
work. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To which side of the debate does the voucher idea belong? 
Vouchers means new federal spending in a new federal education 
program that violates the 10th amendment. Vouchers guarantee 
perpetually higher budgets for the Department of Education, which 
will distribute them. Vouchers get the feds involved in the 
funding and running of private schools, something not even Mr. 
Clinton's Goals 2000 does. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Even Mr. Dole's pitch is strangely class-based: we should 
take from the rich, who send their kids to private schools 
because "they have the money," and give to the poor, so they can 
have "choice" too. The implication is that disparities in wealth 
are inherently unjust; it takes subsidies to make people truly 
free. Only the far-left used to talk like this. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Of course rich people have more "choice" than poor people, 
and not only in the schools they attend. Rich people can live in 
nicer homes, drive nicer cars, dress better, eat fancier food, if 
they so choose. Mr. Dole says "that's not the way it ought to 
work in America." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Oh? There's a name for the system that allows such 
disparities: it's capitalism. Those who work hard, save, and 
invest benefit materially, as they should. And by spending their 
own dollars on private school, people are investing in the future 
of their children. How strange that Mr. Dole would be the one to 
offer such a radical critique of this system. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What's brand new in Mr. Dole's plan is that vouchers would 
also be given to home schoolers. That's a sure path to disaster. 
The feds would not only monitor and license these caring 
mothers--the way social workers do welfare recipients--but also 
determine what and how many hours they teach. Goodbye 
homeschooling. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Already Americans are taxed to the hilt to pay for failing 
public schools. Already states are strapped by intrusive federal 
regulations that have transformed many schools into condom-
distributing, multicultural petri dishes. Now, Republicans are 
supposed to get behind a program that will do to private schools 
what the feds have done to public ones? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's safe to say that Mr. Dole's idea won't go far. Of course 
teachers unions oppose vouchers. But so does an organized 
movement of religious and economic conservatives in the 
Republican Party.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
George Roche of Hillsdale College says vouchers would remake 
private schools "into the image of the very public schools that 
have failed so miserably." Ronald Trowbridge adds that "if 
government vouchers are extended to private primary and secondary 
schools," private schools "will become virtually extinct." 
Columnist Samuel Francis says that if vouchers pass, the nation's 
"private and parochial schools would soon be homogenized by the 
same government that has already ruined public schools."
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Looking at the budget figures, Charlotte Allen, writing in 
the American Spectator, is shocked by the sheer cost. Taxpayers 
will "find themselves obliged to pay for a private-school system 
on top of a public-school system." Worst of all, they will "leave 
us even more in thrall to a powerful central government."
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Pat Buchanan, who once backed them, says he took "a hard 
second look at those school vouchers." Now he predicts they will 
"entail greater state contamination and control." Why not "give 
the billions back to taxpayers" in tax cuts, he asks? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Economist Murray Rothbard was once asked what he proposed in 
place of vouchers. Abolish the Department of Education, he said, 
repeal regulations on private schools, cut public school budgets, 
and insure local control. Finally, Dr. Rothbard said, the best 
voucher is a person's own hard-earned dollar; government should 
let us keep what we earn. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Instead, Mr. Dole has proposed yet another far-flung federal 
program. On this issue, as with many others, he has abandoned the 
true conservative position, and thrown in his lot with the 
big-spending, egalitarian left.

<title>Rockwell: Alienation in American Politics -- 7/8/96</title>
</head>

<h2>
Alienation in American Politics 
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Marxists used to talk about the "alienation" of workers 
exploited by wage slavery. Someday, they predicted, the system 
would come unglued, and the workers would expropriate the 
expropriators. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's a bunch of malarkey, to be sure; no system is as 
exploitative as socialism. Yet alienation does exist: it's what 
average citizens feel towards the political process and the 
massive federal government it sustains. Every day we are 
exploited more and more, and yet seem powerless to change 
anything. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Consider the recent example of VMI and the Citadel, proud 
and ancient institutions steeped in the respective histories of 
their states. As single-sex military academies, they offered 
young men the camaraderie only this setting can provide. Then, 
for no good reason, a majority of the Supreme Court decided it 
didn't like these schools. In one fell stroke, they are 
destroyed. It's the kind of action that alienates citizens from 
their government. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Another example involves Stalinesque demographic planning. 
Federal judges in Baltimore, Maryland, and Dallas, Texas, have 
decided that inner-city public housing residents should be living 
in the suburbs, again, for no good reason. By court order, these 
residents will be dispersed according to a government plan and at 
taxpayer expense. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is wildly unpopular, both among those who pay to live 
in nice areas and among public-housing residents. When a similar 
scheme was tried in Chicago, it led to enormous social upheaval, 
huge population shifts, and the wrecking of formerly decent 
neighborhoods. No doubt, if the judicial dictators get their way, 
the same will happen in Baltimore and Dallas. Yet exploited 
citizens are powerless to stop these schemes. No wonder they feel 
so alienated from the government. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Another example was brought home by the bombing in Saudi 
Arabia. How many people knew the U.S. stationed thousands of 
troops at the King Abdul Aziz air base in Dhahran? Of those, how 
many think the U.S. has a vital interest in continuing to do so? 
Yet when 19 Americans were killed, the obvious solution--bring 
the troops home--escaped everyone in Washington. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bloated military budget and the foreign policy it 
supports have virtually nothing to do with the average citizen. 
Only the traditional beneficiaries of imperialism gain: 
politicians, corporate exporters, military contractors, lifetime 
bureaucrats, and spooks. The long-suffering taxpayer is alienated 
from the whole system, yet powerless to change it. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The examples provided by the last few years could be 
multiplied without end. Clintonian tax increase, Nafta, Gatt, the 
Mexican bailout, welfare for immigrants: all are projects of federal 
government, all were fantastically unpopular, yet all were 
steamrollered through anyway. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Marxists used to talk about the "power elite"--the 
wealthy and unaccountable capitalists who oppress the workers. 
Who today denies that American politics is in fact dominated by a 
power elite? This class is not made of capitalists, who make 
their living, after all, by serving the consuming public. It 
consists of employees and hangers-on of the federal government 
itself. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Alienation is fueled by the obvious reality that the power 
elite does not have independent means of support. The huge public 
treasury they have at their disposal is transferred directly from 
the paychecks of the working class. This creates a permanent 
state of conflict, and deepening political discontent unlike any 
we've seen. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some people drop out of politics altogether, and turn 
towards radical groups with a leftist or rightist bent. Those 
still active seek other outlets, including third parties. Most
Americans think two parties are not enough. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What else can we expect when the nominees of the major 
parties are such open representatives of the ruling class? But if 
Watergate undermined faith in the presidency and in government 
generally, what will the newest unflattering revelations about 
Bill Clinton do? They can only increase alienation and 
discontent, and cast a permanent pall on the Beltway elite. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The elite may bemoan this fact, but the rise of intense 
anti-government feeling is the most encouraging development in 
modern political life. Jefferson and Madison said a free people 
should never have confidence in men with power. The bigger the 
government, the less it should be trusted, and the less it's 
trusted, the more likely it is to fall. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In Marxist lore, history would settle all scores in favor of 
socialism. But the opposite is happening, and, because the system 
cannot hold, time is running out for leviathan. The expropriated 
taxpayers will have their day, the troops will come home, the 
central planning will end, and the dictatorship of the power 
elite will be no more. Then we will understand the one truth in 
Marxism: the state can wither away.

<title>Rockwell: Clinton's Libertarian Cloak -- 7/3/96</title>
</head>

<h2>
Clinton's Libertarian Cloak 
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's a crazy, mixed-up political world when Bill Clinton 
comes out for individualist libertarianism. The trend began in 
his state of the union address when he announced that "the era of 
big government is over"--and then proposed half a dozen new 
government programs. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But that statement was merely a coming attraction. During a 
press grilling on the FBI files controversy, Mr. Clinton said he 
is "appalled" by "any kind of abuse of public authority that 
tramples on the liberties of individual citizens." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
He's gone beyond stealing Republican issues. Now he's 
remaking himself in the image of Patrick Henry and Thomas Paine. 
Moreover, he says, this is not a new position, but one held "from 
my earliest days as a young man."
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mr. Clinton's new-found libertarianism does have one 
advantage. He has committed himself to a philosophical standard 
by which he can be judged. Do his policies measure up? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The White House wants to outlaw work that pays under $5 an 
hour. But what if a person can't find a job that pays that much? 
If he works for less, he and his employer violate federal law. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Here's a clear case of public authority trampling on the 
liberties of individual citizens. If a person works for two bucks 
an hour, and the deal is by mutual agreement, there's no harm 
done. But when the government steps in to prevent the 
transaction, it robs both parties of the liberty to contract. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Similar examples can be found on every page of the U.S. 
Code. Why should the government drive a wedge between consumers 
who want to buy cigarettes and companies that want to sell them? 
Why should the government force employers to hire people who 
aren't right for the job?
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Why should the government stop importers from selling Iraqi 
oil? Why should the government prevent property owners from 
draining their swamps and developing their land? Why should the 
government tax away up to 40 percent of people's incomes, and 
declare some to be "unearned"? All these actions trample on 
liberty. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Is it unfair to discuss economic policies when Mr. Clinton 
was talking about the "civil liberty" not to be spied on by 
federal police agents without cause? No, although left-liberals 
have long tried to have it both ways, dreaming of socialist 
economics and strict enforcement of the Bill of Rights. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite the ACLU, it's impossible to separate the different 
aspects of liberty. A government that forbids and controls 
economic exchange will think nothing of invading what are 
designated as "civil liberties." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There might have been a time when left-liberals believed in 
free association and other civil liberties. They are still fuming 
because Senator Joseph McCarthy thought it mattered when a public 
figure in Hollywood or the State Department was a member of the 
Communist Party. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But those days are long gone. Today, the left is far more 
hysterical about private militias than Mr. McCarthy ever was 
about communists. Freedom of association? Any gun owner who gets 
together with a few friends to fret about the feds is to be spied 
on and treated as a potential bomb builder or church burner. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Liberals are still shrieking about J. Edgar Hoover's 
investigations of the civil rights movement. But today, left-wing 
nonprofit groups spy on people's political affiliations and share 
their files with happy federal bureaucrats. No anti-communist 
group of the 1950s painted with the broad brush of the 
"anti-hate" blocs of the 1990s, which link the desire for tax 
cuts or less recycling with every manner of terrorist activity. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The left loved the Bill of Rights when it was used by the 
federal government against the states. With the independence of 
the states demolished, the left thinks nothing of openly 
attacking the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 9th, and 10th amendments. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If Bill Clinton's devotion to libertarian doctrine is 
laughable, so is the left's claim to defend individuals against 
the government. These are the people who have created the 
Orwellian state they warned us against, and--among a host of 
other depredations--turned private comments into punishable 
speech crimes. 
 <BR>

Mr. Clinton's libertarian sentiments were provoked by the 
accusations that he used FBI files for political purpose. We'll 
know he's serious when he proposes to burn--not the files on 
political appointees--but the millions of dossiers on law-abiding 
private citizens. Until that great day, the big government whose 
era he claims has ended, will still be lording it over us.

<h2>
The Politics of Church Fires
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The 1988 Willie Horton ads were considered awful because 
they played on fears of race and crime for base (that is, 
Republican) motives. Fast forward eight years, and consider the 
uses to which the Democrats are putting the church burnings in 
the South.
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These fires are invariably described as part of a "wave" or 
"rash" of attacks against blacks not seen since Jim Crow. Even 
though almost all are unsolved, the Clinton Justice Department 
assures us that whites are the perpetrators and racial hatred the 
cause. Therefore, these are not mere arsons, but big-league 
political crimes. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Meanwhile, more than 200 federal agents are crawling around 
the rural South, usurping local and state fire investigators, and 
the South-bashing New York Times has had a field day, running 
treatises on why this is exactly what one would expect from a 
racist region. We should all look to New York City, locus of 
peace, harmony, and intergroup love. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A gaggle of left-wing organizations, led by specialists in 
racial agitation, has declared the burnings to be part of a 
conspiracy tacitly encouraged by the Republican Congress and the 
Supreme Court's rulings against racially drawn voting districts.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Jesse Jackson takes it a step further. The burnings are part 
of a new "anti-black mania," he says, a "white riot" spread by 
"lawmakers." People in white sheets burn churches, but so do 
Congressmen "in blue suits, who use thinly coated, veiled race 
signals when they say welfare and crime and three strikes and end 
affirmative action." Mr. Jackson urges people to register and 
vote for you-know-what party.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As for the victimized pastors themselves, they went on 
television to complain that they and their parishioners had been 
questioned, even though it's standard procedure to look to owners 
first when a building is torched. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
All this is but a side show to the central message as stated 
by Bill Clinton. Standing outside a black church in South 
Carolina, he denounced burnings, poverty, and discrimination, and 
proclaimed the glories of civil rights. "We are not going back," 
he said. "We are not slipping back to those dark days." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In case you missed it, there's a political agenda here: any 
attempt to repeal quotas or welfare is, like torching a church, 
motivated by hatred. This is how liberal politicians play on 
racial fears and crime for their political purposes. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mr. Clinton has already been caught in one fib. He said he 
had "vivid and painful memories of black churches being burned in 
my own state when I was a child." It turns out that there is no 
record of such burnings. His remarks had to be corrected by a 
spokesman. They weren't churches, but "community buildings." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Joyce Price and Warren Strobel of the Washington Times
talked to NAACP officials, black pastors, and historians in 
Arkansas. But only one expert could remember a suspicious fire in 
the 1950s that involved a racial element. Curtis Sykes, chairman 
of Arkansas's Black History Advisory Committee, said the fire was 
set by a black man, who was convicted of several insurance-fraud 
arsons. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Frank Wolfe of the Arkansas-Democrat Gazette said that Mr. 
Clinton might be remembering the bombings in Little Rock on Labor 
Day 1959, resulting from resentments over forced school 
integration. Trouble is: all the targets were white, including 
public officials, lawyers, and firemen who had turned their hoses
on protesting white parents. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Fibs aside, the campaign marches on. Always anxious to find 
evil in Alabama, the media have focussed on our four fires since 
December. But Alvin Benn of the Montgomery Advertiser raises 
serious questions. Since 1990, thirty-eight houses of worship 
have burned in Alabama. Twenty were black; eighteen were white, 
although there has been no publicity about them. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And none of the fires apparently involved "hate," says the 
State Fire Marshal. For example, some burglars set fire to 
churches after robbing them. Other cases involved internal church 
disputes, drunks who decided to burn a building, insurance fraud, 
electrical fires, and lightning. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More interesting data: thirty church burnings in the South 
over eighteen months may sound like a lot, and it is obviously 
thirty too many, but it represents 0.03 percent of the arsons 
recorded. In just 1994, Chicago had more than 1,000; Los Angeles 
more than 3,000; and New York City more than 5,000. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The church fires may "harken back to a dark era," as Mr. 
Clinton claims. But his efforts certainly harken back to other 
fear-based campaigns to get out the vote, while chilling anyone 
who would question statist federal policies and the racial 
orthodoxies used to justify them.

<title>Rockwell:  The Terror Threat? -- 6/5/96</title>

<h2>
The Terror Threat?
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Whip yourself into a frenzy. Dig a shelter out back. Fly 
into a panic and be extremely scared. It's time for special 
alarms, drills, and teach-ins. Most of all, pay your taxes with 
diligence and joy so the government can protect you.
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The big news? The feds say terrorists are loose on the land. 
And you could be their next victim. The only way to safety is to 
surrender your money, your freedom, and your guns to the 
bureaucrats, and quake with fear unless the FBI is near. At least 
that's what we'd do if we believed everything we're being told. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ever since the Oklahoma bombing, we've heard that the threat 
of domestic terrorism means the government needs vast new power 
and money. Every chance they get, officials from virtually every 
federal police agency--the FBI, FEMA, Justice, the CIA--tell the 
press that a bomb could blow up your neighborhood any minute. 
Look out! 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And that's only the beginning. Why, do you realize that 
someone could use chemical weapons against your hometown? Even 
more frightening is the supposed prospect of biological warfare. 
If something isn't done right away, we'll be infected with a 
deadly disease or writhe on the floor, dying from asphyxiation. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"The likelihood that state or nonstate actors," says head 
spook John M. Deutch in his best bureaucratise, "will attempt to 
use weapons of mass destruction against U.S. interests is 
growing." But, never fear, the feds are here to protect you, 
just as they protected so many in the past. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Last November, for example, FEMA hosted a creepy gathering 
in Mount Weather, Virginia, attended by the CIA, the FBI, and 
various other spies and paranoids prominent in the D.C. political 
racket. They met in a huge bomb shelter built at the height of 
the Cold War to maintain life and luxury for government officials 
as the civilian population suffered nuclear annihilation.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At this meeting, according to the Wall Street Journal, the 
geniuses in government met to fret about how little money is 
being spent to prepare for terrorist attacks. But "some serious 
planning has begun," says the Journal. Oh to be a fly on that 
wall. Who can doubt that these people salivate over the prospect 
of martial law, suspending the Constitution, and shoving the 
population around like cattle?  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What will the ruling regime do to maintain its power in the 
post-Cold War environment? Well, there is the terrorism bill 
passed by Congress and signed by the president. It bolstered 
federal police power with new funds and responsibilities, and 
restricted the rights of American citizens. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Funny that the framers of the Constitution never anticipated 
the need for an internal police force to keep the people in check 
and protected. If they had, they might have given up those silly ideas 
about liberty and self government. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Going on seven years now, the ruling elites have confronted 
a serious problem. With no credible foreign threat on the 
horizon, the central state seems to have lost its primary reason 
for existence. The average fellow can't understand what the 
apparatus in Washington does with 1.7 trillion bucks every year. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A government this big does its best to avoid peace at home 
and abroad. As it knows from experience, these are the times that 
try men's pocketbooks. People demand lower taxes, shrinking 
government power, and less government arrogance. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For instance: during the first World War, the government 
practically established martial law at home, planned most 
industrial and agricultural production, revved up the military 
machine to full capacity, and squelched free speech and a free 
press. It was a sad chapter, but one that came to a quick close 
when the war was over. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For the American people demanded an immediate end to the 
violation of their rights and the high taxation of their 
property. The military shrunk in size, and the war planning 
boards were shut down, not to be reopened until the New Deal 
(under the auspices of curing an economic crisis, itself brought 
on by the Federal Reserve). 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The same thing might have happened after the Second World 
War, which also saw an explosion in government power over the 
economy. But just as people were demanding a return to normalcy, 
the Cold War intervened, and thankfully so for folks in 
Washington. The communists were coming, and taxpayers could be 
relied up on to stay frightened and relatively docile for another 
forty years. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Fast forward to 1989, and the end of the ramshackle Soviet 
empire. With no substantial foreign policy threats on the 
horizon, peace and freedom threatened to break out yet again. A 
series of botched military exercises overseas has made the public 
ever more skeptical of the ruling regime. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Terrorism is as good an excuse as any for keeping people 
alarmed about some enemy, and to deflect attention away from the 
real threat to their liberties, which is the government itself. 
Indeed, for several years, polls have recorded record-level 
dissatisfaction with government. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Washington is none too happy that nobody seems to care about 
the supposed terrorist threat. Complains Senator Dick Lugar, 
"there is almost a sense of denial out there in the public." 
Indeed a recent poll--which underscores that the public is 
keeping its wits--reveals that only a few Americans are 
"seriously worried" about terrorism. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The government is trying to fix that. Some militia guys were 
recently arrested in Georgia, and the anonymous federal informant 
who had undoubtedly egged them on told the press they planning to bomb 
the Olympics. Not true, said the on-the-record briefing that followed, 
but the essential message had already been planted in the minds of 
many.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And last year, the feds called the Anaheim, California, fire 
department to say that Disneyland would be sprayed with poison 
gas in three hours. Whoops, they said later, it's not true. But 
again, the essential message had been planted. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
From the beginning of time, governments have used the 
prospect of attack, real and phony baloney, to inspire citizen 
compliance. Will it work this time?
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I have my doubts. A government that can't deliver the mail
surely can't stop poison gas attacks. And the American people 
have become stingy with their rights and liberties, as they 
should be and will ever be, now that government has become the 
"fearful master" George Washington warned us against.

<title>Rockwell:  Revenue Neutrality   -- 5/9/96</title>

<h2>
Revenue Neutrality  
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Republicans might as well pack their bags, admit defeat,  
and head home. Their entire program has been doomed by the  
doctrine of "revenue neutrality." In practice, it means that the  
government's income can never fall. This has turned fiscal policy  
into, at best, a pointless exercise; at worst, a deeply dishonest  
shell game.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Look at recent Republican maneuvers. Every proposed lower  
tax is matched by some increase. Give a tax credit for adoption,  
and raise taxes on business. Cut gas taxes, and increase other  
excise taxes. What's next? Cuts in the inheritance tax, "paid  
for" by an increase in the gas tax? Maybe the per child tax  
credit can be "paid for" by repealing the adoption tax credit.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The total burden of taxes remains the same no matter what  
these guys do. So what is supposed to be the purpose of this  
nonsense? If it is too much to ask that the federal government  
take less from the private sector, Republican slogans about  
cutting the size of government are empty. There's no point to  
elections, platforms, or debates, because you can't cut  
government without cutting its income.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The doctrine of "revenue neutrality" is a leftover from  
George Bush's 1990 budget agreement, which raised taxes and  
arguably lost him the election. Part of the deal was that any  
increase in spending must be accompanied by an increase in taxes;  
likewise, any decrease in taxes must be matched by an equal  
decrease in spending.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At first, it sounds reasonable to treat the federal budget  
as if it were a household's. But it's not, because it doesn't  
consist of owned property. It is a vast redistribution scheme  
whereby property is pilfered from some and doled out to others;  
either or both practices should be curbed wherever possible.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Before the 1990 budget deal, no one said that all tax cuts  
had to be "paid for" in other ways. That language makes it seem  
deeply expensive to cut revenue, and thus fiscally irresponsible.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For taxpayers, however, a tax cut is not an expense, but a  
boon. It allows them to keep more of what is rightfully theirs in  
the first place. What's expensive is keeping taxpayers on the  
hook for the same percentage of the national income, year after  
year, and never allowing it to fall.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One fallacious assumption behind the doctrine of revenue  
neutrality is that Congress can know exactly what people will do  
before and after tax changes. Consider the gas tax. It's possible  
that deep cuts in the gas tax would cause the price to fall and  
the demand to rise, thus increasing overall revenue. But Congress  
doesn't even consider the prospect. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is true for many taxes. If the inheritance tax were cut  
dramatically, people's incentive to accumulate property would  
increase dramatically. It's even possible that the resulting  
economic activity would offset the revenue losses of the tax cut.  
So it goes for the income tax and every other excise tax.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But let's say the so-called Laffer Effect didn't kick in,  
and total revenue actually went down. A loss to government is a  
gain for everyone else. Lower revenue means government is less of  
a burden on the American people, and that the economy is that  
much freer. That's why we should be as thrilled to see a falling  
tax take as a falling crime rate. Each makes people that much  
more secure in their person and property.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What about the deficit? It's true that deficits crowd out  
private investment, tempt the Treasury into monetizing debt, and  
drive up interest rates. A balanced budget, with both spending  
and taxes low, is a joy to behold.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But we live in the age of deficits not because taxes are too  
low, but because government has been freed from the obligation to  
back the currency with gold. It's no coincidence that the budget  
was last balanced in 1969, when gold restricted the Treasury's  
ability to pile up debt.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Why do increases and decreases in the deficit always seem to  
surprise the political class? Because its size is influenced by  
factors over which they have little control, like economic  
growth, the business cycle, the size of the underground economy,  
and the numbers of people receiving wages and salaries. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One thing politicians can control is how much government 
steals from our paychecks every year. But to fix that, we must  
first trash the 1990 budget deal. Concocted by an evil genius,  
it's the only budget agreement in the last two decades that  
anyone bothers to obey. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
So long as "revenue neutrality" is the rule, leviathan will  
grow and grow, and the Republican promise to reduce the size of  
government will continue to be a rhetorical cover for the same  
old political racket.

<h2>
"Civil Rights" Hits the Adoption Industry
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>
  
Federal offices aren't often surrounded by protesters. But   
egregious civil-rights decisions against Mitsubishi and Hooters   
inspired their workers to take to the streets. Meanwhile, lesser   
victims of the civil-rights police are forced to suffer in   
silence as legal defense bills threaten bankruptcy.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The Justice Department and the EEOC decide what constitutes   
"discrimination" on grounds of race, religion, age, disability,   
and sex, the most sensitive areas of our national life. Since any   
action can be construed as somehow influenced by them, the   
government can exercise ferocious power over a vast range of   
economic decisions.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


When a business is involved, bureaucrats act as the   
sure-to-win plaintiff's lawyers capable of imposing de facto  
quotas in any business or industry. It has the power to brand   
companies with labels like "racist" and "sexist," and drive them   
to ruin. It is a main reason why race relations are so rotten   
today, and why, more than three decades after the Civil Rights   
Act, everyone feels more victimized than ever.  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Not only has the Congress done nothing to curb this, it is   
preparing to expand government power into the makeup of our   
families. The pretext is a bill making it easier to adopt   
children. There is a $5,000 tax credit, "paid for" by higher   
taxes on business. But the heart of the bill is a provision   
putting the federal government in charge of adoption and   
foster-child services, imposing huge new costs, and robbing   
prospective parents of the freedom to choose.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


In the adoption process, adoptive parents, biological   
parents, and children work directly with public and private   
adoption agencies. After years of experience, agencies have   
learned which matches are likely to succeed, and which are not.   
The criteria are often unquantifiable, but can include such   
factors as race and ethnicity.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


For example, a Vietnamese family may know of some Vietnamese   
orphans in need of permanent loving homes. So long as the match   
is otherwise suitable, the agency will work with the parents to   
accommodate their request. Children are then brought together   
with adoptive parents who will love them and care for them.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


But Washington planners find this intolerable, and so are   
scheming to abolish it. They don't want people to be able to   
specify the race of the children they want to adopt; nor do they   
want an agency to be able to draw on its experience in working   
with parents insofar as race is involved. The planners would   
replace the right of contract with bureaucratic edict.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


In the Washington tradition of antonymous titles, the bill   
is called the "Adoption Promotion and Stability Act." It mandates   
that adoption providers can no longer "discriminate in making a   
placement decision" on the basis of national origin, race, and color.  
The original bill was so draconian it had to be amended to   
say race can be one factor if more than one "qualified" family   
want the child. In fact, the amendment counts for nothing.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Let's say a young mother considers giving up her child for   
adoption. Today, she is allowed, within reason, to specify what   
kind of family she would like her child to be brought up in,   
including the racial makeup of that family. If this bill passes,   
the agency will not be allowed to take her wishes into account.   
Faced with less certainty about her child's future, she will be   
more likely to choose abortion.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The same goes for adoptive and foster parents. If the bill   
passes, they will still be able, for now, to request the sex and   
religion of the child they would like to care for. But any   
request regarding race or national origin will not be considered   
under most conditions. Will the Vietnamese couple be just as   
interested in adopting a white or black child? Of course not, and   
they might just drop out of the process.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


How will the government know whether discrimination takes   
place? In its usual ham-fisted fashion, it will count the   
numbers, establish quotas, and override people's preferences. It   
will substitute private judgment with rule by bureaucrats and   
lawyers, and give the Justice Department veto power over all   
private decisions that affect adoption and foster care.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


This law will also be subject to category creep like other   
civil-rights bills. It's only a matter of time before religion,   
sex, and disability are added to the list. In time, Washington   
will be running the private and state-level child placement   
industry the way it runs its own welfare bureaucracies.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The proponents of the bill make the wildly unproven claim   
that all delays in foster and adoptive placements are due to   
discrimination against minorities. They have demonized the   
National Association of Black Social Workers for seeking black   
homes for black children. Like all liberals bent on social   
engineering, they pursue their plans with a John Brown-like fury   
and blindness to the other side.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


What, then, is the real cause of sluggishness and   
disequilibrium in the system? Federal laws that overregulate the   
industry and prevent a well-functioning market for parental   
rights from emerging. So these revolutionary Republicans, instead  
of repealing the existing government interventions, impose more.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 
The result will be to make adoptive agencies and social   
service providers vulnerable to killer lawsuits from parents who   
experience any delay. "Public-interest" lawyers will also file   
civil suits by the thousands, and tie the placement process in   
knots. In a system already replete with broken hearts, this will   
impose limits on the numbers of organizations willing to be   
involved in the first place.  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The bill will not end up "promoting the adoption of minority   
children," as supporters claim, because Washington can't people from  
deciding not to be adoptive or foster parents, or from choosing  
abortion over childbearing. The more freedom of choice the government  
takes away, the less anyone will want to bear the burden in the first  
place.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


There's a moral principle involved here too. The federal   
government has long managed our associations with regard to race   
at ever more intimate levels, and the results have been awful.  
Now it wants to make the same divisive intervention into the   
makeup of families. What's next? Non-discrimination laws for   
marriage?  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


It's time we begin to trust the judgment of the private   
sector, and local levels of government over federal, and stop   
transferring power to Washington. Unlike Mitsubishi and Hooters,   
the children and parents victimized by civil rights enforcement   
aren't in a position to stage public protests.

<h4>THOMAS A. SCHATZ</h4> 
President<br> 
Citizens Against Government Waste and<br> 
Council for Citizens Against Government Waste<br> 
</center> 
<p> 
Thomas A. Schatz is President of Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW) and the Council for 
Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW). 
<p> 
CAGW was founded by J. Peter Grace and Jack Anderson in 1984 following the release of the Grace 
Commission report. It is a 501(c) (3) nonprofit, educational organization with more than 600,000 
members nationwide. Mr. Schatz is a nationally recognized spokesperson on government waste and has 
appeared on hundreds of radio talk shows from coast to coast, including WBZ in Boston, WGN in 
Chicago, KABC in Los Angeles, WCBS in New York, and WOAI in San Antonio. His national television 
appearances include: "ABC News with Peter Jennings," "CBS News with Dan Rather," "NBC News with 
Tom Brokaw," CNN, CNBC, "Larry King Live," "The McNeil-Lehrer News Hour," and numerous local 
network affiliates. 
<p> 
According to official Office of Management and Budget figures, implementation of Grace Commission 
recommendations saved taxpayers $152.4 billion through 1990, and CAGW estimates another $ 100 
billion have been saved since then. An additional $78 billion will be saved over the next five years from 
recommendations proposed by CAGW in 1993 and $54 billion will be saved over the next five years from 
recommendations proposed by CAGW in 1994. 
<p> 
As President of CCAGW, the 501(c) (4) nonprofit lobbying organization, Mr. Schatz spearheaded the 
expansion of the grassroots Taxpayers Action Network to more than 400 chapters nationwide. Mr. Schatz 
has also testified on government waste issues before committees of the United States Senate and House of 
Representatives. 
<p> 
During his nine years with CAGW, Mr. Schatz has been instrumental in a development program that 
increased membership from 5,000 to more than 600,000. 
<p> 
Prior to joining CAGW in 1986, Mr. Schatz spent six years as legislative director for Congressman 
Hamilton Fish and two years practicing law and lobbying. 
<p> 
Mr. Schatz holds a law degree from George Washington University and was graduated from the State 
University of New York at Binghamton with a BA degree, With Honors, in Political Science. He is 
married to Leslee Behar and has two daughters, Samantha and Alexandra.

<title>Schatz: Radioactive Tax Boondoggle  -- 08/01/96</title>

<h2>Radioactive Tax Boondoggle</h2>

By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz</a><br>
President,<br><a href="/govt-waste/home.html">Citizens Against Government Waste</a> 
 <P></center><hr>
<br> 

It's hard to imagine the government waste watchdog group Citizens Against
Government waste (CAGW), the conservative Heritage Foundation, the
Libertarian Cato Institute, and Taxpayers for Common Cents agreeing on a
policy issue with The Safe Energy Communication Council, Friends of the
Earth, and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. And yet it's true.
These and other philosophically divergent organizations are united in their
opposition to more taxpayer funding for one of the most egregious symbols
of pork-barrel spending: the so-called Advanced Light Water Reactor (ALWR).
<P>
Bringing the budget ax down on the Department of Energy's ALWR program
should be a no-brainer for Congress. The drive to revive nuclear power with
taxpayer subsidies has failed on Main Street, Wall Street, and in the
utilities' executive suites.
<P>
Today, there's simply no domestic market for these reactors, and the
international opportunities are drying up as more governments turn their
backs on this economically-challenged energy source. Every U.S. reactor
ordered in the past 23 years has been subsequently canceled.
<P>
Two independent surveys released earlier in 1996 show that seven out of ten
American voters and nine out of ten utility CEOs don't want new nuclear
plants tax-funded or built, respectively. Most, if not all, forecasting
reports from Wall Street brokerage and investment firms wouldn't argue with
Bear Stearns analyst Daniel Scotto who quipped that the next nuclear
reactor would be built "when Jimmy Hoffa was found alive and well."
<P>
Yet, after spending 60 percent of all U.S. energy research and development
money on nuclear power between 1948 and 1996 (despite the fact that it now
only provides 8 percent of our overall energy needs), Congress is debating
whether to pump more of our tax dollars into the ALWR program.
<P>
Authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT), the ALWR was
originally intended as a five-year program to develop advanced commercial
nuclear reactors for the domestic market. But the program has become a
corporate welfare poster child, financially benefiting major firms such as
General Electric (GE), Westinghouse, and Asea Brown Boveri/Combustion
Engineering. In 1994, these three companies alone had combined revenues of
$73 billion.
<P>
U.S. taxpayers have provided more than $275 million for this program
between fiscal years (FY) 1992-1996. The fifth and final year of funding
ends in September, but the Energy Department has requested an additional
$40 million for FY 1997, and Westinghouse envisions itself on the receiving
end of funding through FY 1999.
<P>
Now, however, even the monolithic nuclear industry is wavering on the
ALWR's worth. In February, GE, one of the primary recipients of tax funds
for the ALWR program, announced that it was abandoning its Simplified
Boiling Water Reactor program (one of the reactor programs within the ALWR
program), which has received more than $50 million in taxpayer subsidies.
GE defended its withdrawal, stating that "extensive evaluations -- have not
established the commercial viability of these designs," a clear-cut
repudiation of the program's original rationale if there ever was one.
Taxpayers will most likely never recover this investment.
<P>
But there's more. Besides lining corporate pockets for dead-end research,
taxpayer funds have also been used to reimburse the above-named companies
for a portion of the fees charged by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) for its costs to license and certify reactor designs. In other words,
taxpayers are covering the fees which were imposed in order to help offset
the costs of the NRC's services.
<P>
The ALWR program was intended to assist in the design of reactors to be
built in the United States. But since there is no domestic market, U.S.
taxpayer-supported reactor designs -- whose certification by the NRC has been
partially subsidized by the taxpayer under this program -- are being marketed
and sold in Japan, South Korea and other countries. This is a violation of
the intent of EPACT, which stipulates that recipients of any ALWR funds
must promise to construct and operate the reactor in the United States.
<P>
Fortunately, a bipartisan coalition in Congress, spearheaded by Reps. Mark
Foley (R-FL) and David Obey (D-WI) has formed to block any proposals for
continued funding the ALWR. Whether these federal purse-watchers will
succeed depends on citizens raising their voices loudly enough for Congress
to get the message.
<P>
Cutting this tax-vacuum would be an unequivocal statement that Members of
Congress are committed to cutting waste and redirecting budget priorities
to the nation's economic good. It's time to get this tax hog out of the
federal trough.

<h2>Finders Keepers</h2>



By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz</a><br>
President,<br><a href="/govt-waste/home.html">Citizens Against Government Waste</a> 
 <P></center><hr>
<br> 
 

  
  
Picture this: You've been living beyond your means and have had to 
borrow a great deal of money over the years just to keep your bills 
paid and family fed.  Finally, after much procrastination and a few 
sleepless nights, you put yourself and family on a regimen, aiming to 
balance your books over the next seven years while still meeting your 
basic needs.  Tackling  the accumulated debt and interest comes next.  
Then one day, a psychic from the CIA tells you that there's a good 
chance -- but not a guarantee -- that you'll come into some money 
during that seven-year period. 
<P>
What do you do?  Do you spend that hypothetical money, reverting to 
the bad habits that put you in this fix to begin with, or resolve to 
stick to your seven-year plan, recognizing the slim margin of error in 
your calculations and questionable reliability of CIA psychics?   And 
if that psychic turns out to be correct, do you balance your budget 
faster, let's say in five years, and begin to reduce your massive 
debt?  Or do you blow the windfall as usual, costing you more money in 
the long run and imperiling the financial security of your family?  
The logical, responsible answer is to do everything in your power to 
balance your budget faster, start paying off your debt, and break 
free. 
<P>
That's what a reasonable person would do, particularly someone who is 
trying to overcome a lifetime of profligacy.  But in the logic-free 
zone of our nation's capitol, the moral of this parable doesn't 
necessarily track.    
<P>
As Congress and President Clinton continue their dance around the 
budget solution, there's talk of "finding" more money, either through 
revamped economic assumptions or a change in the calculation of the 
consumer price index.  And naturally, being a city of addicts, there's 
already talk in some quarters of spending what has yet to be "found," 
despite the fact that the two sides' budget plans are still hundreds 
of billions of dollars apart.  So while economic assumptions are 
always debatable, and the consumer price index is undoubtedly 
inflated, the idea that we can make things right just by juggling the 
numbers sends the message loud and clear that politics as usual 
continues to rule the roost.  For politicians searching for an easy 
way out, and an escape valve for mounting pressures, it is a nearly 
irresistible solution.          
<P>
So steeped is this city in the compulsion to spend, and so blurred can 
rhetoric and reality become, that it's always worthwhile reviewing the 
facts.    
<P>
Doomsayers have led those unfamiliar with Washington lexicon into  
believing that one, the Republican plan cuts spending, and two, does 
so in a way that will adversely affect the country.  Baloney all 
around.  First, spending will increase in each of the seven years even 
under the "radical" Republican plan. And second, the long-term 
economic benefits of getting the nation's fiscal house in order will 
be worth it.    
<P>
If the Republican plan is adopted, the federal government will spend 
$12 trillion over the next seven years -- an average of $1.7 trillion 
annually.  Medicare will increase 6.4 percent annually -- the most of 
any federal program -- and the per-beneficiary increase will be 47 
percent.  The earned income tax credit, which the president says is 
destroyed by the Republican budget, will increase by 150 percent.  
Student loan volume will increase by 50 percent.  Medicaid goes up by 
30 percent.   
<P>
Give, these projections, the real question is:  How much more do we 
really need to spend?  And what can we afford if, like the person in 
our parable, we're carrying around a $5 trillion debt? 
<P>
Already, interest rates have dropped in anticipation of a balanced 
budget agreement.  The effect on families for housing, car payments, 
education, and other expenses is enormous.  A two percent drop in 
rates can mean thousands less each year in such payments. 
<P>
If there isn't a deal, we will be violating one of Thomas Jefferson's 
moral precepts:  "We should consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle 
posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay them ourselves."  
Nobel Laureate James Buchanan recently noted that up until the past 
several decades, balancing the budget was part of our "effective 
constitution," but that "we have lost the moral sense of fiscal 
responsibility to make formal constraints unnecessary." 
<P>
There's a great national debate over "family values."  What kind of 
standards are we setting for future generations?  Without a balanced 
budget, we will pass on a tax rate of 84 percent to our children and 
grandchildren just to pay our bills.  A child born today will pay 
$187,000 in taxes over a lifetime just to pay his or her share of the 
interest on the national debt.  Is that a legacy we can live with?   
<P>
<P>
We can avoid such a fate simply by living within the parameters of the 
Republican plan.   While priorities can always be negotiated, and 
should be negociated, $12 trillion is more than enough money to meet 
the nation's true needs over the next seven years.  And if additional 
funds surface in re-estimates of economic assumptions, let's make the 
moral and just decision to balance the budget faster, start paying off 
the debt, and save the future for our children and grandchildren.

<title>Schatz:  No Virginia, There is no Budget in Washington</title>

<h2>No Virginia, There is no Budget in Washington</h2>


By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz</a><br>
President,<br><a href="/govt-waste/home.html">Citizens Against Government Waste</a> 
 <P></center><hr>
<br> 
 
There is no such thing as a "budget process" for the federal 
government.  
<p>
Any junior executive will tell you that a real budget is a financial 
plan; it controls how much money may be spent, both overall and for 
each spending category, before any checks are actually cut.  The Grace 
Commission called the federal budget "a political document, ... of 
limited usefulness as a vehicle for planning, control or evaluation."  
Here we are 12 years later and, as Yogi Bera said, "it's deja vu all 
over again." 
<p>
Money is often appropriated without regard to revenue, a practice 
which has been taken for granted for years, but which has lead to a 
federal debt of more than $4.9 trillion.  Even with better than 
average odds that Congress will reach a balanced budget by the year 
2002, the debt is still expected to top out at nearly $6 trillion.   
<p>
The government's fanciful accounting practices invite waste, lack of 
accountability, and gross mismanagement.  But the long-term danger is 
that these distorted budget practices seriously imperil all the hard 
work and political courage being demonstrated on Capitol Hill to bring 
the federal spending juggernaut under control.  
<p>
The annual budget battle over appropriations has become an 
exasperating exercise in futility.  This year, thanks to the tenacity 
of House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston (D-La.), and 
many like-minded members of Congress, a significant number of wasteful 
government programs and pork-barrel projects will be purged from the 
13 appropriation bills.  But members who scour the bills looking for 
juicy bits of bacon complain, correctly, that it is the budget system 
itself that allows unwanted pork projects to filter through.   
<p>
In the next phase in the fight for sound government, fiscally 
responsible members of Congress from both sides of the aisle have 
offered budget reform bills to bring federal budget policies in line 
with reality and with private sector practices.  
<p>
A budget reform bill offered by Reps. Christopher Cox (R-Calif.) and 
Steve Largent (R-Okla.) would reconfigure the process from the ground 
up, seeking an end to that mindless annual scramble for scarce federal 
dollars which passes for the appropriations process.  The bill's 
philosophy was summed up when Rep. Cox wrote recently:  "A budget, 
properly used, should provide a framework for the individual spending 
decisions that follow.  The adoption of a budget, therefore, is not 
the proper time to debate those individual decisions."  The 
Cox/Largent legislation would enact a "budget first, spend second" 
provision, reduce the federal budget to a one-page, 19-function 
resolution, and toughen the president's enhanced rescission powers. 
<p>
The spirit of the Cox bill is mirrored in a "truth in budgeting" act 
Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.) will introduce on November 8.  His bill would 
create a more workable and understandable budget process by 
introducing biennial budgeting, creating a reserve (rainy day) fund 
for fiscal emergencies, putting an end to the fanciful concept of 
baseline budgeting, and enforcing sequestration if spending goes over 
enacted budget and entitlement caps. 
<p>
Sen. Connie Mack (R-Fla.) is proposing budget reform as well, 
including a Spending Reduction Commission. 
<p>
All of these efforts finally begin to liberate the federal government 
from baseline budgeting, the foundation of Washington's "weird 
science."  Baseline budgeting is an entrenched accounting gimmick 
which allows Congress and the President to say with a straight face 
that a reduction in the increase of an agency's budget is actually a 
"cut."   
<p>
The proposed changes may seem common sensical, but they represent 
dramatic change to the Kafkaesque world of federal spending.  Congress 
has been loath to make these "easy" choices in the past, even with 
solid bi-partisan support.  It is so much easier to crow about hard-
fought budget savings from program terminations, while still being 
able to take credit for redirecting the money into other programs and 
trust fund accounts.  This "carve and spend" will continue to 
frustrate real efforts to reduce spending unless Congress moves 
forcefully to overhaul the budget process itself.  The lock-box bill 
approved by the House earlier this year, which will permit saved funds 
to go toward deficit reduction, is a big first step.  But a major 
overhaul must follow, and soon. 
<p>
Reform-minded members like Reps. Cox, Largent, and Barton represent 
the next wave in the revolution that began last November.  Budget 
reform must be at the top of Congress' "to do" list for the next 
session.  Anything less than a full frontal assault on congenital 
budget gimmickry and accounting trickery will make a mockery of all 
the hard-fought gains achieved this session and guarantee that we will 
never get spending under control.

<title>Schlafly: Senate Should Reject the Chemical Weapons Convention  -- 8/1/96
</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i>August 1, 1996</i>
<h2>            
Senate Should Reject the Chemical Weapons Convention
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


      The U.S. Senate should reject ratification of the Chemical
     Weapons Convention (CWC), a treaty that purports to ban chemical
     weapons and forbid their production, stockpiling, and use.
     Contrary to its announced purpose, this foolish treaty would
     increase, not eliminate, the risk of chemical weapons use, and
     would seriously damage U.S. national security interests.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Bad guys are deterred by force, the threat of force, or by their
     cold calculation that the costs of evil behavior are not worth
     the risk. Many dangerous countries, such as Libya, Syria, Iraq
     and North Korea, have not signed the CWC and would not be
     deterred by pieces of paper.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     China and Iran, which have significant chemical weapons programs,
     are unlikely to comply. Of particular concern is Russia, which
     has the largest arsenal of chemical weapons; the actions and
     statements of its military leaders confirm that Russia would not
     comply at all.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Even though the CWC would not rid the world of chemical weapons,
     it would impose a terrible regulatory and reporting burden on
     every U.S. company that produces, processes, or consumes a
     scheduled chemical. The CWC would affect U.S. firms that make
     dyes and pigments, insecticides, pharmaceuticals, ceramics,
     nylon, paint and varnish, electronics, textiles, and soap and
     detergent.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The Arms Control and Disarmament Agency estimates that 2,175 U.S.
     companies would be saddled with reporting requirements and data
     declarations; others estimate that the burden will fall on 10,000
     U.S. production facilities. This time-consuming reporting could,
     in turn, produce additional government oversight and regulation
     by agencies such as OSHA, EPA, and IRS.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     No previous treaty has ever subjected U.S. private industry to
     international inspection. CWC is the New World Order closing in
     on American business.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The process of allowing teams of foreigners to investigate,
     inspect and challenge all facets of private U.S. businesses could
     open them up to industrial espionage and the theft of their
     proprietary information. Forcing them to spend unnecessary funds
     to hire more people to fill out more government forms, and submit
     to routine inspections, would reduce their ability to compete in
     world markets.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In addition to the costs to be borne by private industry, the
     treaty would require the United States to pick up the tab for 25
     percent of the costs of implementation and verification at an
     estimated cost of $200 million a year. Other countries would
     probably demand that the United States pay their costs of
     implementation, too.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Of course, the CWC would give birth to a new international
     bureaucracy. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
     Weapons is already headquartered in The Hague with a Conference
     of State Parties, an Executive Council, and a Technical
     Secretariat whose verification responsibilities extend over a
     hundred pages.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Every time we hear trendy slogans such as "global village,"
     "world economy," or "international cooperation," Americans should
     remember that other nations have no familiarity with or
     understanding of our Bill of Rights or our federal structure of
     government with separate state laws. Treaties are customarily
     written as though all power to make and fulfill international
     commitments resides in the head of state who signs the document.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     If the CWC goes into effect, what happens to our Fourth Amendment
     rights? The CWC's Technical Secretariat, without a warrant, would
     be empowered to inspect virtually everything within the premises,
     including records, files, papers, processes, controls, structures
     and vehicles, and to interrogate on-site personnel.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Under CWC, what happens to our First Amendment rights? Freedom of
     Information requests will not be permitted under the proposed CWC
     implementing legislation, so Americans would have fewer rights
     under this treaty than if a U.S. agency, such as the FBI,
     investigated them.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     As implemented by the Clinton Administration, the CWC would have
     a meddling effect in U.S. affairs. It would forbid U.S.
     commanders to use tear gas and other riot-control substances to
     protect our soldiers and minimize civilian casualties.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The CWC is unverifiable and unenforceable. Former CIA Director
     James Woolsey testified on June 23, 1994 that "the chemical
     weapons problem is so difficult from an intelligence perspective,
     that I cannot state that we have high confidence in our ability
     to detect noncompliance, especially on a small scale."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In closed societies, factories making fertilizer,
     pharmaceuticals, or plastics can easily cover up their production
     of chemical weapons. After receiving notification of a challenge,
     a facility has six days to hide the evidence before inspectors
     are admitted.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Small amounts of concealed chemical weapons can be militarily
     very significant. Used against critical military targets,
     chemical weapons can have dramatic consequences.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     To paraphrase a popular bumper strip, when chemical weapons are
     outlawed, only outlaw governments will have chemical weapons. Our
     World War II experience shows that the best way for civilized
     countries to prevent the use of chemical weapons is for the good
     guys to have their own deterrent arsenals of chemical weapons.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In any event, the Senate must not make matters worse by ratifying
     the unenforceable, costly, and probably unconstitutional CWC.

           Self-Appointed Monitors Of Corporate Responsibility
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          The CEO of Cypress in Silicon Valley has just issued an
          eloquent put-down of the social-responsibility
          busybodies who are trying to intimidate corporations
          into selecting their boards of directors on the basis
          of racial and gender diversity. T.J. Rodgers wrote a
          letter to the Sisters of St. Francis in Philadelphia
          who had used their ownership of a little Cypress stock
          to engage in leftwing mischief-making.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Far from being put on the defensive by having a convent
          of nuns lecture him on corporate responsibility,
          Rodgers rejected their arguments as "not only unsound,
          but even immoral." He admonished them that Cypress's
          board of directors "is not a ceremonial watchdog, but a
          critical management function."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Cypress's directors need to have experience as a CEO of
          an important technology company and direct expertise in
          the semiconductor business based on education (usually
          with a Master's degree in engineering science) and
          management experience. Contrary to the nuns' argument,
          Rodgers explained that "a woman's view on how to run
          our semiconductor company does not help us, unless that
          woman has an advanced technical degree and experience
          as a CEO."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Sounds like common sense, doesn't it. "I believe," he
          said, "that placing arbitrary racial or gender quotas
          on corporate boards is fundamentally wrong."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          The nuns had tried to lay a guilt trip on Cypress by
          suggesting that it lacks corporate "morality" and
          Christianity by failing to appoint a board of directors
          with "equality of sexes, races, and ethnic groups."
          Rodgers didn't hedge in his response. "I am unaware,"
          he said, "of any Christian requirements for corporate
          boards; your views seem more accurately described as
          `politically correct,' than `Christian.' "
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
         Then, Rodgers went on to argue that the nuns'
          presumptuous requirements for corporate boards are
          "immoral," which he defined as "causing harm to
          people." He pointed out how all the retirees whose
          pension funds invest in Cypress would suffer if Cypress
          were run on anything other than a profit-making basis.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          The letter from the nuns was so sanctimonious that it
          did not allow for any possibility that a CEO could be
          moral if he disagreed with their position. I found
          myself cheering when Rodgers told the sisters to "get
          down from your moral high horse."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Cypress employees in San Jose averaged $78,741 in
          salary and benefits in 1995. All are Cypress
          shareholders, have a first-rate health-care plan,
          profit-sharing, and other goodies such as gifts of
          personal computers and employee education.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rogers reiterated that "choosing a board of directors
          based on race and gender is a lousy way to run a
          company. We will never be pressured into it. We simply
          cannot allow arbitrary rules to be forced on us by
          organizations that lack business expertise."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rodgers obviously warmed up to the challenge of do-good
          busybodyism. "The political pressure to be what is
          euphemized as a `responsible corporation' today," he
          said, "is so great that it literally threatens the well
          being of every American."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rodgers listed some of the other special-interest
          groups that are harassing corporations about their pet
          issues. These include the complaints that corporations
          are not sufficiently "environmentally conscious," that
          they do business with certain countries, or supply the
          Armed Forces, or pay their CEO too much, or give to
          certain charities.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rodgers cited a Fortune magazine report showing that
          the so-called "ethical mutual funds" that invest
          according to a social-issues agenda, which control $639
          billion in investments, produced an 18.2 percent return
          in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 returned 27.2
          percent. Thus, the investors in the "ethical funds"
          lost 9 percent of $639 billion, or $57.5 billion in one
          year, because they invested on a social-issues basis!
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rodgers lashed out at the current election-year frenzy
          in Washington to institutionalize the so-called
          "corporate responsibility" concepts promoted by Labor
          Secretary Robert Reich and Senators Ted Kennedy, Jeff
          Bingaman and Tom Daschle. Their proposals "provoke fear
          and anger against America's business," and are
          fundamentally wrong.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          One Bingaman-Daschle proposal would grant a low federal
          tax rate of 11 percent to "responsible corporations,"
          i.e., companies that limit the pay of their CEO to no
          more than 50 times the company's lowest-paid employee.
          Such a rule would limit the pay of the CEO of the
          world's most important semiconductor company (Intel) to
          less than that of a second-string quarterback in the
          NFL.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Commenting on the double standards of the "leftist, out
          of touch with reality" Senators, Rodgers asked, "How
          long will it be before Senators Kennedy, Bingaman, and
          Daschle hold hearings on the `irresponsible
          corporations' that pay tens of millions of dollars to
          professional athletes? Or are athletes a `protected
          group,' leaving CEOs as their sole target?"
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rodgers concluded by stating that he stands for
          "personal and economic freedom, for free minds and free
          markets, a position irrevocably in opposition to the
          immoral attempt by coercive utopians to mandate even
          more government control over America's economy." May
          his tribe increase, and may his forthright statement
          embolden other CEOs to speak up, too.

Whatever Happened To Competition in School?
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     When it comes to the Olympic Games, everyone seems to understand
     that competition produces the winners and the record-breakers.
     It's unlikely that the athletes could reach such heights of
     achievement and endurance if they were not competing against
     other athletes who are closely matched in skills and putting
     forth their very best.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Some people, however, are at war against the whole concept of
     competition. They think it is undemocratic, unfair, and elitist.
     It's a sign of the times that, in Cecil County, Maryland,
     basketball is now played by some very unusual rules.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     If one basketball team is ten points ahead of the other,
     additional baskets don't count until the underdog team catches
     up. No record is kept of who scores how many baskets, so no
     player can ever be recognized as the star of the team.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     This system should be called Outcome-Based Basketball because
     it's just like the Outcome-Based Education (OBE) that has spread
     through our public schools like a contagious disease. OBE is
     sometimes called Performance-Based Education.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     OBE's advocates mouth the mantra "self-esteem." Since the lack of
     self-esteem is postulated to be the cause of all social ills
     (crime, illegal drugs, teenage pregnancies, AIDS, and low SAT
     scores), OBE's primary goal is to inculcate self-esteem.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     There is no evidence that lack of self-esteem causes those
     problems, nor is there any evidence that having self-esteem
     causes students to score better in academic subjects. At best,
     teaching self-esteem is a waste of precious classroom time and,
     at worst, it's teaching the wrong lesson that it's okay to feel
     good about doing poorly in school.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Self-esteem should be the reward that comes from achievement and
     hard work. It should be earned. But lack of evidence doesn't slow
     down the self-esteem peddlers because this mantra advances their
     goal of eliminating all competition from the school experience.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Outcome-Based Education has been properly labelled a dumbing-down
     of public school education. But it's even worse than reducing the
     amount of knowledge covered and failing to teach essential skills
     such as reading.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
    The combination of OBE and self-esteem eliminates competition as
     a learning mechanism. This destroys the students' incentive to be
     the best they can be, and it destroys the school's accountability
     because parents have no way to measure what their children are
     doing.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In an OBE school, the traditional A, B, C, D and F are replaced
     by letters that are meaningless in terms of specific academic
     achievement, such as S for Satisfactory (sometimes it just means
     Sometimes) or G for Growth. William Glasser's 1969 book "Schools
     Without Failure" led the charge against traditional grades.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Glasser also argued that giving homework is unfair and elitist
     because A and B students usually do their homework, whereas poor
     students don't, thus widening the gap between those who succeed
     and those who fail in school. He even opposed objective tests
     because they require students to give correct answers, in
     contrast to tests that ask questions for which there are no right
     answers.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The anti-competition movement is galloping across America.
     Schools are getting rid of their honor roll, honors courses,
     class rankings, academic prizes, and even valedictorians.
     Spelling bees are out. If fact, even correct spelling is out;
     it's replaced by inventive spelling (so students can spell words
     any way they want).
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Ability grouping, or tracking, is forbidden as elitist,
     undemocratic, or even racist. Pity the poor teacher who has to
     present a single course of study to eighth graders whose reading
     ability ranges from the second to the twelfth grades. This
     problem is getting worse with the mainstreaming of the learning
     disabled.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     OBE does not allow any student to progress faster or farther than
     the slowest child in the class. This system conceals the fact
     that some children aren't learning much of anything.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     What is the teacher to do with the faster learners after they
     complete the assigned material? They are required to do peer
     tutoring (trying to tutor the slower pupils) or "horizontal
     enrichment." The former is a frustration for all students, and
     the latter is busywork.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Cooperative Learning, in which students receive a group grade, is
     another means of concealing who does the assignment accurately
     and who goofs off. The brighter students soon learn that their
     effort is not rewarded, and the slower students learn that
     there's no reason to try because someone will given them the
     answers.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The testing system has been corrupted. Not only do all students
     score "above average" (a marvel of statistical fakery), but many
     tests are peppered with questions that ask for non-objective
     responses about feelings, attitudes or predictions, or which have
     a built-in bias toward Political Correctness.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The response to the dramatic decline in SAT scores over the last
     two decades has resulted, not in toughening the curriculum, but
     in raising every student's score 100 points, so now students get
     perfect scores even if they have some wrong answers. This is one
     more way of concealing the distinction between average and
     above-average students.

     Competition needs to be restored if schools are to prepare
     students for life. Children should learn early that life is
     competition, and the rewards go to those who work hard, persevere
     and achieve.

Phonics Boom
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     It's many years overdue, but the scandal of widespread illiteracy
     has finally become a topic of general discussion and debate, from
     local newspapers to network TV news. Americans are at last being
     told the tragic fact that the public schools are failing to teach
     children how to read.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Our largest and trendiest state suddenly forced the facts of
     illiteracy into the national news stream. California came in last
     in national fourth-grade reading tests, set up a state task force
     to find out why, held legislative hearings, discovered that the
     state's Whole Language method is a disaster, and earmarked $100
     million for new textbooks and teacher training to switch the
     schools back to phonics.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In order to receive their share of the money, schools will have
     to give students "systematic explicit phonics instruction, with
     phonemic awareness, sound-symbol relationships, and decoding."
     Governor Pete Wilson is even requiring that school districts
     spend their federal Goals 2000 money on reading instruction.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Wilson's spokesman, Sean Walsh, was blunt. "Whole Language was an
     utter failure. Our curriculum taught to kindergarten to
     third-graders, quite frankly, stinks."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The Whole Language system teaches children to guess at words by
     looking at the pictures on the page, to memorize a few dozen
     frequently used words, to skip over words they don't know, to
     substitute words that seem to fit, and to predict the words they
     think will come next. The child who is taught those bad habits,
     instead of how to sound out the syllables, will never be able to
     read big words or become a good reader.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Many schools give high grades and happy report cards to children
     who are good at guessing and memorizing words, so parents don't
     realize that their children are being taught to guess instead of
     to read. Self-esteem is a higher priority than literacy.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     A federal agency called the National Assessment of Educational
     Progress (NAEP) publishes what is called the Reading Report Card
     for the Nation and the States. Its recently released report on
     the 1994 test given to 140,000 students in grades 4, 8 and 12 in
     public and private schools proves that schoolchildren's reading
     skills are not only bad, but are getting worse.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Comparing 1992 and 1994, the NAEP results show a significant
     decline in the percentage of students scoring at or above the
     "proficient level" and at or above the "basic level," and a
     significant increase in the percentage of pupils performing below
     the "basic level." The NAEP tests also show a lack of any
     positive results from the expensive federal Title I program for
     the disadvantaged.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     How did it happen that the entire public school system abandoned
     phonics and substituted a guessing system? It's rather easy to
     date and track the Whole Language system from its official
     adoption by the state of California in 1987, because California
     is a model for other states that want to be "progressive."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     But Whole Language was not a new idea in 1987; it was just a new
     name for the system that was already in widespread use called
     "whole word" or "look-and-say." The mystery as to how that stupid
     system swept the country, starting in the late 1930s, was
     revealed in a report aired the first week of June on National
     Public Radio.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     "Look-and-say" came to dominate the schools as a result of a
     sophisticated marketing plan carried out by Scott Foresman, the
     publishers of the "Dick and Jane" series of elementary school
     readers. Scott Foresman sent slick salesmen to every school
     district to demonstrate how easily children could be taught to
     "read" the inane "See Dick run" stories that had color
     illustrations of Dick, Jane and Spot (the dog) doing whatever the
     one-syllable words described.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     By the 1950s, the Dick and Jane readers were, as Newsweek now
     tells us, "ubiquitous." Rudolf Flesch's 1955 landmark book, "Why
     Johnny Can't Read," fully exposed the fact that this system is a
     cheat on everyone.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The typical first-grader already knows the meaning of thousands
     of big words, such as hamburger, basketball, birthday,
     toothbrush, and even hippopotamus and Philadelphia. But the child
     will not be able to read those words unless he is taught the
     skill of sounding out the syllables. That's what we call phonics.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
    It is encouraging to see that California is making a massive
     attempt to abandon the failed Whole Language system and switch to
     the proven method of phonics. But changing the educational system
     today will be like trying to change the course of an aircraft
     carrier with a rowboat.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Parents who want to make sure that their children are not
     handicapped by the dumbed-down methods used in most public
     schools today should assume the task of teaching their own
     children how to read. It's easy to do if you use intensive,
     systematic phonics. I did it with my six children, and I urge all
     parents to do likewise.

<html><head><title>Schlafly: Reject MFN For Communist China  -- 6/6/96</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><i>June 6, 1996</i><h2>                        
Reject MFN For Communist China
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Bill Clinton's policy of cozying up to Communist China by
     granting Most Favored Nation (MFN) status is in shambles. The
     question of the moment is, will Bob Dole let Clinton dangle on
     the limb of his own mistake or save him from embarrassment by
     agreeing with this shameful policy?<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     It was all so inconvenient. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
     Firearms (otherwise known as BATF, the agency that played a fatal
     game of cops and robbers against Americans at Waco and Ruby
     Ridge) finally did something useful. They arrested Chinese
     Communist agents for smuggling 2,000 AK-47 automatic assault
     rifles into the United States.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The Clinton Administration has such peculiar biases. The
     Administration engaged in hear-no-evil, see-no-evil as long as
     the Chinese Communists merely forced women to undergo late-term
     abortions, locked up citizens who dared to speak out for freedom,
     stole billions (not just millions) of dollars worth of U.S.
     intellectual property, thumbed their noses at signed trade
     agreements, and sold our weapons technology to rogue dictators.
     But when China violated our gun-control laws, that was just too
     much for the liberals!
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The BATF arrest of seven persons in the San Francisco Bay area
     stopped a very profitable Chinese business of selling weapons at
     a 400 percent mark-up to U.S. big-city gangs that want to wipe
     out their rivals. It was a sophisticated worldwide operation that
     must have enjoyed the complicity of the Chinese government.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Those arrested have direct links to China's Defense Ministry and
     Deng Xiaoping's son-in-law. To conceal the source of the weapons,
     the money was laundered through Beijing's state-run bank in Hong
     Kong.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In the 18-month U.S. sting operation, the Chinese discussed with
     our undercover agents the future sale of explosives, anti-tank
     rockets, and shoulder-fired anti-aircraft systems capable of
     knocking planes out of the sky. One Chinese boasted he could
     bring 300,000 AK-47s into the U.S.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Selling all kinds of weapons is big business for Communist China.
     It has sold missiles to Iran and nuclear reactor technology and
     materials to make enriched uranium to Pakistan.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     China's expanding economy is financed by a $34 billion trade
     surplus with the United States that has cost Americans 700,000
     jobs. This trade surplus is partially based on stealing our
     products (computer software, video films, musical recordings,
     compact disks, other intellectual property, books, etc.) instead
     of buying them.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Pirated CDs and CD-ROMs are made in China in an estimated 31
     government-licensed plants. China itself can use only about two
     percent of the CDs produced, so the rest go into the
     international market and cheat U.S. companies out of sales.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     China signed an agreement to stop this theft in February 1995,
     but nothing has changed. China simply thumbs its nose at the
     whole concept of copyrights and trademarks.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     China has made so much money from U.S. trade that it is now
     trying to buy SS-18 strategic missiles, components and technology
     from Russia or Ukraine. For those who've forgotten our worries of
     the Cold War, the SS-18s are the biggies that can reach the
     United States from a launch on the other side of the world.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     China continues to persecute Tibet, use slave labor to produce
     goods for export, and show contempt toward any self-government
     for Hong Kong. China tried to threaten Taiwan's democratic
     election process by firing rockets at the island.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     U.S. big businesses, which want MFN because they lust after
     so-called "free trade" with China, should wake up and taste the
     chop suey that China served the McDonnell Douglas Corporation.
     Douglas pursued China's aviation market with the passion and
     naivete of a teenage suitor, but ended up (in the word of one
     Douglas executive) being "betrayed."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Over a costly 15-year courtship, Douglas gave China 80 years of
     accumulated aircraft-manufacturing experience. That was the
     largest technology transfer in history. Douglas taught China how
     to build commercial planes, trained Chinese engineers, and even
     turned over powerful weapons-producing technology.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Like classic con men, Chinese officials schmoozed Douglas by
     dangling the prospect of multi-billion-dollar aircraft purchases.
     Then China turned around and gave its juicy contract to Europe's
     Airbus.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Hypocrisy about the demands for MFN status has reached new
     heights on both sides. In America, the internationalist claque
     that continually calls for "free trade" ignores the fact that
     China has slapped a 30 percent tariff on goods it imports from
     the United States. In China, the ruling clique threatens to
     "punish" U.S. companies if we dare to criticize the $2 billion
     piracy of our intellectual property.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     It is ridiculous to allow Communist China to enjoy the same
     trading privileges with the United States markets that friendly
     countries have. Congress should reject Most Favored Nation status
     for Communist China, and Bob Dole should show leadership in
     calling for that rejection.

<html><head><title>Schlafly: Pupil Privacy Law Is Needed  -- 5/30/96</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><i>May 30, 1996</i><h2>                        
Pupil Privacy Law Is Needed

</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     The school establishment has suddenly discovered a bill that
     passed the House last year and is pending in the Senate which may
     interfere with plans to build files of personal information on
     public school pupils and their families. The Family Privacy
     Protection Act was noncontroversial when it sailed through the
     House by 417 to 7, but the school establishment has gone into
     panic and sounded phony alarms over a whole page of the May 19
     New York Times.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Designed to protect pupil and family privacy, the bill is
     straightforward in stating that schools may not, without prior
     written parental consent, ask minors to answer questionnaires
     about political affiliations or beliefs, mental or psychological
     problems, sexual behavior or attitudes, illegal or
     self-incriminating behavior, appraisals of other family members,
     or religious affiliations or beliefs.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     That's a reasonable rule because the schools have no business
     eliciting that kind of personal or family information from
     students. But in an era when schools assert their right, without
     parental knowledge or consent, to pass out condoms and to force
     little girls to undress and undergo intrusive genital
     examinations, it looks like the schools want to reject all
     accountability to parents.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The hysteria of the school establishment against this bill is
     encapsuled in the lead sentence in the New York Times news
     article: "Research into illegal drug use by American adolescents
     could be stifled by legislation pending in Congress." This is
     followed by quotations from several Ph.D.s ominously predicting
     that the bill "will leave us conducting the war on drugs largely
     in the dark."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     One of these Ph.D.s who is crying around about how the law would
     "cripple" his surveys of schoolchildren, said sarcastically, "We
     also couldn't find out whether they believe in God, which some
     people think is important." Pardon me, but I don't believe he
     should be allowed to ask public schoolchildren whether or not
     they believe in God. Where is the ACLU when we need it?
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The widespread use of intrusive surveys and questionnaires in the
     public school classroom started in the mid-1970s and resulted in
     the passage of the first Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment in
     1978, sponsored by former university president and Senator Sam
     Hayakawa. The public school establishment was powerful enough to
     prevent regulations from being written until President Ronald
     Reagan demanded them in 1984.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     National Education Association agents in the Department of
     Education and public school administrators nationwide circled the
     wagons against this law. Despite egregious violations, it has
     never been enforced.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Take, for example, the infamous 149-question survey which has
     been given, despite parental objections, to nearly all 6th, 9th
     and 12th grade Minnesota pupils. Parents were up in arms about
     it, not only because it was privacy-invading, but also because it
     assumed that illegal drug use, promiscuity, and suicidal
     tendencies are normal teenage behavior.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Another serious objection was that it encouraged pupils to inform
     on their parents. That sort of interrogation of children should
     not be tolerated in a free society. Here's a typical question:
     "Has drinking by any family member repeatedly caused family,
     health, job or legal problems? If yes, who? (Mark all that
     apply.) Parent who lives with me, Parent who doesn't live with
     me, Brother or sister, Other relative, Other person who lives
     with me." Here's another: "Has drug use by any family member
     repeatedly caused family, health, job or legal problems? If yes,
     who? (Mark all that apply.)" The same options are offered.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Many questions conveyed the notion that the majority of teenagers
     are using illegal drugs. "If you use marijuana, how old were you
     when you started? If you use any other drug, how old were you
     when you started? How often do you get drunk?"
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Some questions interrogated the child about his religion. "How
     often do you attend religious services?" "How important is
     religion in your life?"
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Some questions would be downright traumatic for some children.
     "Have you ever tried to kill yourself?" "How often have you run
     away from home?" "Have you felt so discouraged or hopeless that
     you wondered if anything was worthwhile?"
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Of course, the survey included lots of Peeping Tom sex questions.
     "Have you ever had sexual intercourse (gone all the way)? If you
     have sexual intercourse, how often do you and/or your partner use
     any birth control method? Have you been pregnant?"
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The public schools have no business requiring children to answer
     any of these nosy questions without prior written parental
     consent. To assert that restricting these surveys will hamper our
     "war on drugs" is ridiculous.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The purpose of the pending legislation is to extend the scope of
     the law to all surveys and questionnaires that are federally
     funded, not merely those funded by the Department of Education,
     and also to remove some vague language that has enabled the
     public schools to circumvent the law for the past ten years.
     Senators should say ho-hum to the hysteria of those who might be
     restrained from asking children about matters that are none of
     their business.

What's Going On With Bob Dole's Friends? 
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Why are the so-called Republican moderates undermining Bob Dole's 
     presidential candidacy? Doesn't he have enough problems without 
     his friends planting mines on his road to the White House? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     First, Governors Christine Whitman and Pete Wilson gave cover to 
     Bill Clinton on his veto of the partial birth abortion ban, which 
     was overwhelmingly passed by Congress (with support from Bob 
     Dole) and was building to become a major Republican campaign 
     issue. When Whitman and Wilson said on national television that 
     they support Clinton's veto, they destroyed effective campaign 
     use of this issue by Bob Dole. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Whatever one thinks about the abortion issue, this support of 
     Clinton by two prominent Dole supporters was completely 
     unnecessary and grossly unhelpful to his campaign. Dole had just 
     honored Whitman by naming her one of the two temporary chairmen 
     of the Republican National Convention. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Secondly, we saw the incredible undermining of Bob Dole by his 
     longtime friend and fellow Kansan, Senator Nancy Kassebaum, as 
     well as the other moderates, Senators John Chafee, Slade Gorton, 
     Mark Hatfield, and even Kit Bond. What they did was to join the 
     Democrats on a motion (that passed 52-46) to remove Medical 
     Savings Accounts (MSAs) from Senator Dole's leadership amendment 
     to the Kennedy-Kassebaum health bill. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     MSAs are not only sound policy and very popular, but they are 
     supported by Bob Dole. They help to define the difference between 
     the parties: Republicans support MSAs because they promote choice 
     in doctors and treatment, portability and affordability, while 
     the Democrats oppose them with dishonest class-warfare rhetoric. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Above and beyond the substance of the MSA argument, the Democrats 
     clearly recognized this vote as a crucial Clinton vs. Dole 
     political confrontation. Every single Democrat voted against MSAs 
     and Vice President Al Gore was rushed to the Senate Chamber in 
     case he was needed to break a tie vote. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     The rejection of MSAs in the Senate bill was a rejection of Bob 
     Dole's leadership. When Dole has friends like this, he doesn't 
     need any enemies. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Third, Christian Coalition director Ralph Reed signaled his 
     willingness to accept a rewriting of the Republican Platform 
     plank on abortion. He gave talkative interviews that resulted in 
     front-page news stories in the New York Times for three days 
     running. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Reed may have been trying to help Bob Dole by putting the 
     Christian Coalition's imprimatur on a move long demanded by the 
     moderates, namely, the removal of or watering down of the pro- 
     life plank in the Republican Platform. But his contradictory 
     statements (such as denying that he is trying to rewrite the 
     platform language and the same week releasing a new book that 
     specifically presents new platform language) have the effect of 
     encouraging the pro-choicers to keep the political pot boiling in 
     the media and then push for a prime-time floor fight at the 
     Republican National Convention in San Diego. That is decidedly 
     not helpful to Bob Dole. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Reed's proposed new platform language uses the word 
     "constitutional" in a slippery and deceptive way. Instead of 
     calling for constitutional protection for the unborn and/or 
     overturning Roe v. Wade, he suggests using "legal and 
     constitutional means to protect the right to life." Under this 
     language, all actions would have to be in conformity with Roe v. 
     Wade. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Reed's new book, excerpted this week in Newsweek, also lectures 
     religious conservatives to "shun harsh language" in "Clinton- 
     bashing." That's strange advice in this presidential campaign in 
     which the Democrats are already conducting a no-holds-barred 
     media advertising campaign of Republican-bashing. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Reed is widely credited with clinching the nomination of Bob Dole 
     by using Christian Coalition troops to carry Iowa and 
     particularly South Carolina for Dole. But he's not helping Dole 
     now by fracturing the constituency that Dole desperately needs to 
     be elected. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Fourth, in a Sunday television appearance, one of Bob Dole's 
     closest associates, Senator Al D'Amato, aimed daggers at Newt 
     Gingrich and Pat Buchanan, accusing the former of setting the 
     wrong agenda for the 104th Congress and the latter of being a 
     "philosophical ayatollah." That is hardly the way to unite the 
     party and encourage broad-based support of Bob Dole, and an 
     experienced politician like D'Amato must know this. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Finally, Bill Kristol has weighed in with the argument that Bob 
     Dole can't win. That's one of the most hurtful slogans that can 
     be hung around the neck of any candidate. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     What's going on? Why are the people who were once so determined 
     that Dole be the Republican presidential candidate now sniping at 
     him?

<h2>
The Reincarnation Of Clinton Care
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
schlafly
.html">
Phyllis Schlafly 
</a>

<p><BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One of the most obnoxious features of the Clinton health care
plan (which died the death of a thousand cuts in 1994) was its
creation of a long list of new federal "Health Care Crimes." 
It now appears that the Republicans, in their eagerness to
manifest their total capitulation to President Clinton, have
included an equally obnoxious crime section in their so-called
Health Reform bill (H.R.3160).
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Somehow this section (Title II), which parallels the discredited
and (we thought) defunct Clinton bill, was passed by the House
without anybody discovering its far-reaching ramifications. 
Then, Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of
American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS), read the bill and
discovered that much of this health crime section was copied from
the Clinton bill.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
AAPS is the organization whose lawsuit against Hillary Rodham
Clinton forced her to comply with federal law and make the
records of her Health Care Task Force public.  After two years of
litigation, Hillary's lawyers had to admit that they had lied to
the court in asserting that all members of the Task Force were
federal employees when, in fact, the Task Force included outside
special-interest groups with a direct financial interest in
passing the Clinton health care bill.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Republican Health Reform bill (H.R. 3160) criminalizes what
are called "federal health care offenses."  The definition is
excruciatingly broad:  a violation or conspiracy that involves
"any public or private plan or contract, affecting commerce,
under which any medical benefit, item, or service is provided to
any individual."  "No proof of specific intent to defraud is
required."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bill specifies monetary penalties of "up to $10,000 for each
instance" of "failure to comply with statutory obligations,"
for "incorrect coding," or for providing "a medical or other
item or service that a person knows or should know is not
medically necessary."  Big Brother will decide what health
services are "necessary."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The new crime of "health care fraud" carries fines plus
imprisonment of up to ten years.  "If the violation results in
serious bodily injury," imprisonment can be up to 20 years, and
if death results it can be "for any term of years or for life."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A person who "intentionally misapplies" any assets of a health
care benefit program "shall be fined under this title or
imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both; but if the value of
such property does not exceed the value of $100 the defendant
shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one
year, or both."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Did you get that?  If you misapply a benefit that has a value of
less than $100, you can spend one year in prison and be fined,
too.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Whoever" makes a false statement to a health care plan is
liable to a five-year prison term.  "Whoever" can mean anybody,
patient or provider.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"In any investigation relating to any act or activity involving
a Federal health care offense, . . . [the Attorney General] may
require the production of any records that may be relevant." 
The Republicans' passion to turn over more and more power to
Janet Reno (which started with the Anti-Terrorism bill) is a
curiosity to behold.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Failure to provide health information, "oral or recorded in any
form or medium," to a criminal investigator from any government
agency carries a five-year prison term.  Information extracted
under this provision can be used against the patient if "the
action or investigation arises out of and is directly related to
the receipt of health care or payment for health care.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bill's exotic forfeiture provisions put health care offenses
on a par with racketeering and drug dealing, and are actually
broader than under the Clinton bill.  "The court, in imposing
sentence on a person convicted of a Federal health care offense,
shall order the person to forfeit property, real or personal,
that constitutes or is derived, directly or indirectly, from
gross proceeds traceable to the commission of the offense."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bill requires the Federal Government to "establish a
national health care fraud and abuse data collection program"
and specifies that "the information in this database shall be
available to Federal and State government agencies and health
plans" pursuant to any procedures set by the Secretary of Health
and Human Services (that's Donna Shalala).  This will empower the
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Federal Government to use medical records to prosecute almost
anybody.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These provisions mean the end of patient privacy and
confidentiality of the physician-patient relationship.  Dr.
Orient asserts that they lay the foundation for forcing all
medical professionals to submit electronic information on every
medical encounter to a central computer, a practice that is
already required by a new Maryland law that takes effect this
July.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Maryland law will require all health care professionals to
disclose to the government the details of every patient
encounter, including diagnosis, test results, therapy, charges,
and 32 pieces of demographic data on every patient.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The only Republican part of the Health Reform bill is the section
on Medical Savings Accounts.  The rest of it is ClintonCare.  So,
why are the Republicans fronting for Bill Clinton and Ted
Kennedy?

<h2> 
Books About What's Going On At Colleges 
</h2> 
 
<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Phyllis Schlafly 
</a> 
 
<P> 
Those who just learned about the dumbing down of our best colleges from the slashing  
report of the National Association of Scholars should do their homework by reading some  
of the excellent books written during the last several years.  Allan Bloom's "The Closing  
of the American Mind" was a trailblazer, but it was followed by several more informative  
books that failed to attract the attention they deserve. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Impostors in the Temple" (Simon & Schuster, 1992) is what Martin Anderson, a former  
Columbia University professor and now a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, calls  
many of our nation's academic intellectuals -- that is, people who pretend to teach and  
pretend to do original, important work, but actually do neither.  He says that "the death of  
integrity in the heart of higher education is the root cause of the educational troubles  
which afflict us today." 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Dr. Anderson helps us to understand how it all happened at Stanford, one of the nation's  
most prestigious universities.  He describes how Stanford bilked the federal taxpayers out  
of millions of dollars and played a big role in the Political Correctness movement. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Dr. George Roche, president of Hillsdale College, demonstrates in "The Fall of the Ivory  
Tower" (Regnery, 1994) how the easy availability of federal money channeled to colleges  
and universities has corrupted our entire educational system.  He sets forth chapter and  
verse of why and how this is so. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The flow of taxpayers' money has resulted in a large percentage of students being  
admitted to college who have no business being there at all because they are academically  
or emotionally unprepared.  The high rate of default on student loans is a national  
scandal. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One of America's most distinguished scholars, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution,  
Thomas Sowell gives us a realistic look at the decline, the deception and the false dogmas  
of the U.S. educational system, which he charges is morally and intellectually bankrupt.   
In "Inside American Education" (Free Press, 1993), he exposes the ideological  
indoctrination and double standards about behavior and race practiced at the leading  
universities. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Sowell says that they have presumed to be the conscience of society, while shamelessly  
exploiting college athletes, overcharging the government, organizing price-fixing cartels,  
and abandoning the teaching of undergraduates to student assistants while the tenured  
faculty pursue personal prestige. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Charles Sykes, author of "ProfScam:  Professors and the Demise of Higher Education"  
(St. Martin's Press, 1989), presents a devastating indictment of U.S. universities, which  
he calls vast citadels of waste, ruled with an iron hand by an oligarchy of arrogant,  
tenured professors who are overpaid and underworked. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Sykes names specific universities, professors, dates and places, and asserts that a  
university education is a scam which cheats students, parents, and taxpayers.  He says the  
universities offer more and more courses of less and less importance, including a plethora  
of junk courses referred to by students as "guts" (slang for a course that can be passed  
with no more preparation than gut instinct). 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Here are some examples he cites:  Anthropology of Play, Socio-Psychological Aspects of  
Clothing, Music Video 454, Sport and Political Ideology, Recreation and Leisure, Pocket  
Billiards, and Rock `n' Roll Is Here To Stay. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In his second book, "The Hollow Men -- Politics and Corruption in Higher Education"  
(Regnery Gateway, 1990), Charles Sykes explains the politicization of the college  
courses.  He tells how race, gender and class have been enshrined as the looking glasses  
through which all subject matter must be seen if one is to survive in academia. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Sykes explains how colleges have gone overboard with institutionalized affirmative  
action, sensitivity training, and anti-free speech codes.  The second half of the book is  
devoted to a case study of Dartmouth College, which became a prime example of the  
intolerance of those who preach "diversity." 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Tenured Radicals" (Harper & Row, 1990) is the expression Roger Kimball uses to  
discuss the radical politics of many in academia. His main focus is on the absurdity of  
what passes for scholarship on the campuses, and he describes the unintelligible jargon,  
or "ProfSpeak," which passes for erudition in the academic world. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Kimball explains the deconstructionist movement, which he calls a hoax perpetrated by  
academics in order to create more possibilities for papers, symposiums, specialized  
classes, and university teaching positions. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In "The Closing of the American Heart" (Probe Books, 1990),Ronald H. Nash describes  
how the decline of moral and religious standards over the past 25 years has contributed to  
the collapse of the nation's educational standards.  He charges that moral illiteracy is  
reflected and taught in academia through relativism, positivism, and humanism. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Dinesh D'Souza, in "Illiberal Education:  The Politics of Race and Sex on Campus" (Free  
Press, 1991), explains Political Correctness (P.C.) on college campuses.  He shows how  
P.C. produces closed-mindedness and intolerance, which is to say an "illiberal  
education."  He explains how Political Correctness opposes the teaching of Western  
Civilization and demands that professors give their first attention to race and gender  
issues.

<P><B><A HREF="chpt2.html">Return to Chapter 2</A></B></P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="1">1</A></B></TT>	The 2.9 percent Medicare tax, as
explained above, applies to all income. The 12.4  percent Social Security tax,
however, applies only  to the first $61,600 of income (the reason being that
Social Security is somewhat akin to  an insurance premium; taxing additional
income would have the effect of boosting the  retirement benefits of those who
had higher  incomes during their working years).
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="2">2</A></B></TT>	This section is derived largely 
(though updated) from Robert Rector, &quot;How to  Strengthen America's
Crumbling Families,&quot; Heritage  Foundation <CITE><U>Backgrounder</U></CITE>
No. 894, April 28, 1992.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="3">3</A></B></TT>	Liberal and conservative economists 
agree that both shares of the Social Security tax  are in fact taxes on workers'
wages. See Joseph A. Pechman and Benjamin A. Okner, 
<U><CITE>Who Bears the Tax Burden?</CITE></U>  (Washington, D.C.: The 
Brookings Institution, 1974), pp. 2543.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="4">4</A></B></TT>	Data from the U.S. Bureau of the 
Census. Total pretax income includes the employer  share of Social Security tax
deducted from the  worker's wages. In this case, the median income for  a family
of four in 1994 is $47,012. Adding $3,596 from the employer's share of payroll 
taxes brings the gross family income to $56,608. 
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="5">5</A></B></TT>	<U><CITE>1994 Annual Report of the
Board of  Trustees of the Federal OldAge and Survivors Insurance and Disability
Insurance Trust  Funds</CITE></U>, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  April 12, 1994.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="6">6</A></B></TT>	This is not to suggest that 
politicians should be given power to invest the funds.  Such a policy inevitably
would result in political manipulation, as surplus funds would be  steered to
politically wellconnected industries  and used to bail out businesses in the
states and districts of senior lawmakers.  A governmentcontrolled retirement
system, by definition, must be operated on a  payasyougo basis.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="7">7</A></B></TT> The chart shows a decline in tax 
collections in the early 1980s, but this occurred  as a result of the 19811982
recession (which started, incidentally, before Reagan's  first fiscal year
began). Moreover, this decline  in revenue also took place before there was a
tax cut. The Reagan economic package was  approved in the summer of 1981, but
the tax cut  was phased in over several years and not fully implemented until
1985. The tax burden  actually rose in Reagan's first year in office, as the
minor tax cut in 1981 was overwhelmed  by previously legislated payroll tax
increases and inflationinduced bracket creep  (indexing to protect taxpayers
from inflation did not  go into effect until 1985). The 1982 portion of the tax
cut was more significant, but it  was roughly canceled out by bracket creep and
payroll tax changes.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 --> 
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="8">8</A></B></TT>	The Administration's $300perchild 
credit begins phasing out for families with  incomes above $60,000 and reaches
zero at $75,000  in family income. The credit increases in value to $500 per
child after 1998.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="9">9</A></B></TT>	For taxpayers filing jointly with 
incomes above $110,000, the credit phases out at a  rate of $25 for each $1,000
above the threshold (a range of $20,000), thus fully phasing out  at $130,000 in
income. For families with two children, the two credits are phased out fully  at
$150,000 in income. For single filers, the credit begins to phase out at $75,000
in  income.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="10">10</A></B></TT>	Clinton's 1997 budget has modified 
this provision, thus making more families eligible for his $300 tax credit.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="11">11</A></B></TT> U.S. House of Representatives, 
<U><CITE>Balanced Budget Act of 1995: Conference Report to  Accompany H.R.
2491</CITE></U>, Report 104350, pp. 13211323.

</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="13">13</A></B></TT>	These are 1995 dollar figures using 
the Laurence H. Meyer and Associates macroeconomic model of the United States
economy.
</P>
<P><B><TT><A NAME="14">14</A></TT></B>	This also means that income should 
be defined properly. Provisions which force taxpayers to overstate their income,
such as  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  alternative minimum tax, would be
repealed. Nor should taxpayers be forced to  undercount business expenses. As a
result,  &quot;depreciation&quot; would be replaced by expensing.
</P>
<P><B><TT><A NAME="15">15</A></TT></B>	Taxation is not the only government 
activity that inflates the cost of hiring workers and reduces takehome pay.
Myriad  regulations, mandated benefits, unemployment  compensation, liability
costs, and labor laws  drive up the cost of employment and shrink  workers' pay.
</P>
<P><B><TT><A NAME="16">16</A></TT></B>	This process usually works by 
delaying, reducing, or canceling wage increases. In  most years, additional
investment and training increase worker productivity, making  employees more
valuable and allowing businesses to  increases wages. When these productivity
increases are accompanied by higher taxes, however,  it is government, not the
workers, that captures all the benefits.

Journal, January 31, 1995.
</P>
<P><B><TT><A NAME="20">20</A></TT></B>	In its analysis of the Armey 
proposal, the Treasury Department admitted that &quot;no  attempt is made to
estimate the taxinduced behavioral responses of either individuals  or
corporations. Following the standard revenue estimating conventions used by both
the  Office of Tax Analysis and the Joint Committee on Taxation, the
macroeconomic aggregates,  such as the level of compensation, prices,
employment, and gross domestic product, have  been assumed to be unchanged by
the proposal.&quot;
</P>
<P><B><TT><A NAME="21">21</A></TT></B>	Using $7 trillion as an estimate of 
1995 nominal GDP. The calculations compare GDP  with 5.5 percent nominal growth
to GDP with 6 percent nominal growth (assuming a similar  inflation rate).
</P>
<P><B><TT><A NAME="22">22</A></TT></B>	Assuming taxes would take only 15 
percent of the added output. Since taxes currently consume about 19 percent of
GDP, this  estimate understates the potential supplyside  impact on revenues.
</P>
<P><B><TT><A NAME="23">23</A></TT></B>	In economic and financial circles, 
this concept is known as present value.

</P>
<P><B><TT><A NAME="26">26</A></TT></B>	Some have argued that an amendment is
 not needed because Members recently voted to  change the House rules to impose
a threefifths supermajority. While helpful, however,  this rule easily could be
repealed in the future  by a simple majority vote.

<p> 
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Last winter's budget battle between Congress and the President was seen by most observers as a victory for the President and a defeat for fiscal conservatives in Congress who were attempting to make major reductions and reforms in government spending programs. But when the smoke cleared and the fiscal year (FY) 1996 budget process finally came to a close, it was apparent that while a rhetorical battle was lost, the budget war was won by the fiscal conservatives. And the victory was unprecedented in scope.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

How complete was the victory?  The 104th Congress:<ul>

<p><li>Reduced year-over-year discretionary spending for the first time since 1969.

<p><li>Reduced the number of bureaucrats at 29 of the 39 major government offices between 1994 and 1996.<sup>1</sup>

<p><li>Eliminated over 270 programs, agencies, offices, and projects.

<p><li>Helped reduce the deficit to the lowest level in 14 years. Only President Reagan's FY 1982 budget deficit was lower.

<p><li>Enacted into law more privatizations in just one year than occurred during the entire eight years of the Reagan Administration.

<p><li>Forced a national debate on structural welfare reform and encouraged states to continue to overhaul their welfare systems. Since taking office, Wisconsin's Governor Tommy Thompson has effectively reformed his state's welfare program and reduced caseloads by 40 percent-- reducing the demand for federal as well as state dollars. The 104th Congress included as part of welfare reform legislation much of the Wisconsin plan. Unfortunately, President Clinton chose to veto the bill.

<p><li>Deregulated the agriculture and telecommunications industries. Congress passed a 1996 farm bill that begins to bring an end to costly Depression-era agriculture programs by getting government out of the business of telling farmers what to grow. This was the most sweeping reform in 60 years. Farmers increasingly will be able to grow to meet the demands of the market rather than the federal government. In addition, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 eliminates decades worth of outdated rules and restrictions on the telephone, cable, and broadcast industries. It will expand job and export opportunities within the industry, lower the cost of basic communications services, and free consumers to choose between competing providers of service.</ul><p>



<b>WHAT BUDGET DEFEAT?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although many in Congress have come to believe that they lost the budget war, the facts indicate otherwise. As the final FY 1996 budget reveals, this Congress accomplished an unprecedented reduction and elimination of unneeded federal programs, federal bureaucrats, and federal spending. To be sure, Congress did not close any of the four Cabinet departments -- Commerce, Education, Energy, Housing and Urban Development -- it targeted. Nor did it see its ambitious national reforms in welfare, Medicaid, and Medicare signed into law. But the hundreds of reforms it did accomplish were comprehensive and far-reaching. Indeed, many of its accomplishments were far bolder than even the intentions of the early Reagan Administration, which until now have served as the benchmark for ambitious fiscal restraint.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In the discretionary budget accounts alone, FY 1996 discretionary spending will experience its first decline since 1969 as a result of program terminations and major cuts. More than 270 separate programs, offices, agencies, projects, and divisions were eliminated completely. These include the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, the Office of Travel and Tourism, the Institute of American Indian and Alaska Native Culture and Arts, the Office of Technology Assessment, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Bureau of Mines, the Administrative Conference of the United States, and hundreds of other programs throughout the government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	And whereas Congress fell short in its efforts to terminate such targeted programs as the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Legal Services Corporation, it cut their budgets substantially and forced them to curtail activities. Indeed, even by early Reagan-era standards, the reforms are unprecedented. Examples:<ul>

<p><li>The first Reagan budget proposed to cut the National Endowment for the Arts by 27 percent, but achieved a 17 percent reduction. This Congress cut the Endowment by 38 percent. 

<p><li>Reagan wanted the National Endowment for the Humanities cut by 23 percent in his first budget, but achieved 20 percent. This Congress cut it by 36 percent.

<p><li>Reagan proposed to cut mass transit subsidies by 10 percent; this Congress cut them by 43 percent.

<p><li>Congress cut the Appalachian Regional Commission by 39 percent and the Legal Services Corporation by 33 percent. Both agencies were slated for termination by the Reagan Administration and by this Congress, but both survived, albeit with significant reductions in funding. 

<p><li>HUD's budget was cut by $2.6 billion -- or by 10 percent compared with spending for the previous year. 

<p><li>Both this Congress and the Reagan Administration failed in their plans to eliminate the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which once again demonstrated its impressive skills at self-preservation, but this Congress made a real and deep cut. Reagan proposed a 25 percent cut, but CPB's budget rose $10 million in his first year. This Congress substantially reduced CPB's spending last year through the rescission process, cutting planned spending by $37 million in 1996 and $55 million in 1997.</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


As a result of these and hundreds of other cuts, freezes, and terminations, this year's budget deficit is expected to total $146.3 billion, in contrast to the $193.8 billion expected for this year by President Clinton as part of his budget plan in 1993, and the $196 billion projected in the FY 1996 baseline. Importantly, three-quarters of this deficit improvement is due to the spending reductions enacted by the 104th Congress. As noted earlier, FY 1996's projected deficit will be the lowest since President Reagan's FY 1982 budget.
<p>

<b>HOW CLINTON HAS TRIED TO STOP ENTITLEMENT REFORM</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Obviously, the deficit would have been much lower had Congress been as successful with the federal entitlement programs as it was with the discretionary spending accounts. Unfortunately, multiple vetoes by the President of repeated congressional efforts to enact reforms in major entitlement programs like welfare, Medicare, and Medicaid have left federal spending higher than it could have been and rendered future reform efforts more difficult.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	But in welfare, at least, the congressional emphasis on welfare reform, including its passage by the House as part of the Contract with America, has encouraged many states to press the White House for waivers of current rules to enable these states to reform their welfare systems along the lines proposed by the House and Senate. President Clinton, fortunately, has agreed to many of these waiver requests.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	As a result of these reforms, and despite the lackluster national economy, the number of Americans on welfare has fallen by 1.3 million between 1993 and the present, for an overall decline of 9 percent. <sup>2</sup> Since taking office, Wisconsin's Governor Tommy Thompson has effectively reformed his state's welfare program and reduced caseloads by 40 percent.Unfortunately, President Clinton has blocked the rapid expansion of successful state programs like Wisconsin's to the rest of the nation by vetoing federal welfare reform legislation that would have removed the need for cumbersome waiver requests.
<p>

<b>PRIVATIZATION FINALLY MOVES FORWARD</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Perhaps in no other area was the difference between past and present performance as dramatic as it was in the 104th Congress's success in privatizing government-run enterprises. Spurred forward by the House Speaker's appointment of Representative Scott Klug (R-WI) to head up the House's privatization effort, numerous privatizations have been successfully concluded, often with bipartisan support and White House cooperation.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The Reagan Administration was able to privatize only Conrail and the National Consumer Cooperative Bank, because of intense congressional opposition during the 1980s. But in one year, this Congress has enacted legislation to privatize four major government programs. Although first proposed and developed in the mid-1980s by the Reagan Administration, it took this Congress to pass the legislation (which the President signed into law) to privatize the U.S. Enrichment Corporation, the Naval Petroleum Reserve, and the Alaska Power Marketing Administration. Passed by the House and awaiting action in the Senate is legislation to privatize the government's National Helium Reserve in Texas. Although final transfer prices remain to be determined, the estimated revenues to the federal treasury from these four sales will be several billion dollars.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In addition to these asset sales, this Congress has initiated many contracting out opportunities which will allow the government to provide better services at lower costs. During the first session, for example, Congress enacted legislation to contract out the Internal Revenue Service's debt collection efforts, the General Services Administration's commercial real estate brokerage functions, the special forecasting functions of the National Weather Service, and selective map-making functions throughout the federal establishment.

	Perhaps encouraged by the more favorable privatization environment in Congress, the Clinton Administration dusted off and improved a Reagan Administration proposal -- called Fed Co-Op -- to set in motion an employee buyout of the background investigations functions previously provided by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.<sup>3</sup>  Involving approximately 700 federal employees, and structured as an employee stock ownership plan with a projected 90 percent employee ownership share, the transfer is scheduled to take place in mid-July. Unfortunately, there are concerns that some House lawmakers may attempt to thwart it in an effort to preserve the civil service status    quo.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	More generally, Congress included in this year's defense authorization bill (Section 357 of P.L. 104-106) language that mandates a more systematic appraisal of contracting opportunities within the Department of Defense (DOD). Although Defense has been one of the few government agencies to take advantage of contracting opportunities, much more could be done. DOD estimates that its cost savings through contracting have averaged 31 percent on contract competitions between 1978 and 1994, and that the savings now total nearly $1.5 billion per year. <sup>4</sup> 
<p>

<b>OTHER POLICY CHANGES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Both the telcommunications and agriculture sectors of the economy were the targets of significant legislative reforms that will place more responsibility and decision making in the hands of private participants operating in the competitive marketplace. And just getting underway in Congress are a series of efforts to overhaul the federal government's involvement in virtually all facets of America's national and local transportation systems. Perhaps indicative of the shape this effort will ultimately take are some innovative pieces of legislation that have been or soon will be introduced in Congress. These include prospective legislation that would devolve much of the federal highway program to the states, as well as existing legislation that would privatize the airports, transfer Amtrak responsibilities to regional compacts created by the states, and remove the trouble-plagued Federal Aviation Administration from the Department of Transportation.
<p>

<b>THE UNFINISHED BUSINESS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 As impressive as this Congress's performance was, it has only made a dent in the massive waste and redundancy that pervades the federal government. As noted earlier, largely untouched were the costly entitlement programs for welfare, Medicaid, and Medicare. These should be revisited during the FY 1997 budget process and should be campaign issues at all levels of government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Furthermore, opportunities for extensive and cost-saving privatization remain, with the four power marketing administrations prime candidates for commercialization and self-sufficiency. Potential revenues to the government from their sale have been estimated at between $8 billion and $20 billion.<sup>5</sup>  Other areas for privatization include all facets of government's role in the transportation sector, including airports, air traffic control, highways, mass transit, and Amtrak. And building on the progress described earlier, Congress and the Administration should be more aggressive in seeking contracting opportunities to improve service at reduced costs. As noted in a Heritage study published last year, budgetary savings of at least $9 billion per year could be achieved through contracting.<sup>6</sup> 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	 Finally, and notwithstanding the impressive reforms made in the thousands of discretionary government programs, much more could and should be done. Savings of an additional $20 billion should be the goal of the FY 1997 budget. As a casual reading of the hundreds of reports produced by the government's Inspectors General reveals, waste and mismanagement are still pervasive throughout the federal establishment and have largely survived the first round of budget cuts. Indeed, there is recent evidence to suggest that in response to budget cuts, government bureaucracies have engaged in the traditional "Washington Monument" ploy -- cut services to the public instead of making efficiencies in program overhead.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	For example, the National Park Service has been highly resistant to the use of contractors to provide routine services such as entrance fee collection, janitorial work, and campground management, preferring instead to use more costly uniformed personnel to perform these services. As a result, and in response to limits placed on the growth of its budget, the Park Service has announced a series of service cutbacks in the form of reduced hours and closed campgrounds just as vacation season is getting underway. Such bureaucratic games should not be tolerated by Congress. Lawmakers should require the Park Service to seek savings through management efficiencies rather than service cutbacks. 
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The record of the last year's budget battle clearly demonstrates that, although the tactical victory may belong to the President, the strategic victory belongs to the 104th Congress. Many of its members, particulary the freshmen, arrived in Washington with an electoral mandate to cut the budget. It was a mandate they honored, and in doing so they accomplished the first reduction in discretionary spending since 1969.

<P>
<DD>
The Clinton Administration claims that a declining foreign affairs budget is threatening the ability of the United States to conduct foreign policy. Referring to Congress's attempts to curb wasteful government spending, former Secretary of State Warren Christopher and his successor, Madeleine Albright, have stated that budget cuts have forced the closure of overseas embassies and other diplomatic offices.<SUP>1</SUP>  To deal with this alleged threat to U.S. diplomacy, the Clinton Administration is calling for increased spending in the foreign affairs budget, which includes funding for U.S. embassies, consulates, foreign aid programs, and international institutions like the World Bank and the United Nations.

<P>
<DD>
Secretaries Christopher and Albright are right to want a robust overseas diplomatic presence. Indeed, ensuring that the ability of the United States to conduct foreign affairs is unhindered should be a concern of every Administration. Christopher and Albright are raising a false alarm, however, about cuts in the foreign affairs budget. Funding for U.S. embassies, consulates, and other diplomatic programs is higher in real terms today than it was during most of the 1980s, in the time of the Cold War. In fact, current funding has remained fairly stable for the past few years and is greater than levels in 1991 (see <A HREF="bg1102c1.gif">Chart 1</A>).

<P>
<DD>
If more funding for embassies is needed because of pressing demands -- like the need to open and operate new embassies in the early 1990s in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union -- then there is plenty of money in wasteful and ineffective economic development aid and other non-essential accounts to cover the cost of these new operations. In short, there is no need for an increase in the overall foreign affairs budget.

<P>
<B>THE TRUTH ABOUT THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS BUDGET</B>

<P>
<DD>
Secretary Christopher claims that "spending on international affairs has been slashed by 50 percent [since 1985]."  He also insists that these "budget cuts have forced us to close over two dozen consulates and several embassies."<SUP>2</SUP>  The solution he advocates is the Administration's proposal to increase the overall foreign affairs budget to $19.3 billion in FY 1998, an increase of $1.2 billion.

<P>
<DD>
<B>Real increases.</B> Christopher's assessment that the overall foreign affairs budget has decreased in inflation-adjusted dollars since 1985 is accurate. Close examination of the programs within the foreign affairs budget, however, reveals that embassies and consulates have not borne the brunt of reductions in the foreign affairs budget. In fact, funding for embassies and consulates has increased by 13 percent in real terms since 1985.<SUP>3</SUP>  Other diplomatic activities, such as student exchanges and public diplomacy, have seen only minor fluctuations in funding since 1985 (see <A HREF="bg1102c1.gif">Chart 1</A>).<SUP>4</SUP> 

<P>
<DD>
In addition, the State Department also has seen a sharp increase in its budget. For example, current funding for the State Department, once it is adjusted for inflation, is over 25 percent higher than it was in 1985 (see <A HREF="bg1102c2.gif">Chart 2</A>). In fact, spending in real terms for the State Department has risen steadily since 1987, peaking in 1994 and experiencing only a slight decline since then. Despite this drop, current funding for the State Department remains well above Cold War levels in the 1980s. This situation is a far cry from the budget "hemorrhaging" described by Christopher.<SUP>5</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
<B>Where are the cuts?</B> The foreign affairs budget includes funding for many diplomatic activities and programs. In addition to spending for U.S. embassies and consulates, it supports numerous international organizations, development aid, security assistance, and export financing. In fact, non-embassy spending accounts for approximately 70 percent of the entire foreign affairs budget. Although expenditures on diplomatic programs within the State Department have risen steadily, spending on international financial programs and foreign aid has dropped.<SUP>6</SUP>  Reductions in development aid, security aid, and international financial programs -- not cuts in direct diplomatic funding -- are primarily responsible for the overall reduction in the foreign affairs budget (see <A HREF="bg1102c3.gif">Chart 3</A>).

<P>
<DD>
It is true that increasing demands were placed on the State Department immediately at the end of the Cold War. The dissolution of the Soviet Union required the establishment of a number of new embassies and consulates. The startup costs for these offices, such as purchasing or constructing buildings, mandated increased funding. Congress recognized this need and increased funding appropriately. This spending increase is apparent in the Conduct of Foreign Affairs budget from 1992 to 1994 (see <A HREF="bg1102c1.gif">Chart 1</A>).

<P>
<DD>
The initial costs of establishing these embassies and consulates passed long ago, however. It is unlikely that expenses for embassies and consulates should far outstrip the funding requirements in 1991, which were higher than during most of the 1980s. Funding for embassies and consulates has remained stable for the past three budgets. No cries of critical funding shortages were heard until recently. Therefore, the claim that the relatively modest reductions in funding since 1994 have caused the closure of embassies and consulates is disingenuous.
<P>

<B>THE FAILED LEGACY OF FOREIGN AID PROGRAMS</B>

<P>
<DD>
Instead of seeking to increase funding for the foreign affairs budget, the Clinton Administration should look to eliminate the numerous programs within the foreign affairs budget that are wasteful. The most likely candidate for elimination is economic development aid. Policymakers long have recognized that foreign aid programs are among the most inefficient and wasteful funded by the federal government. The Hamilton-Gilman Task Force Report of 1989, the <I>State 2000: A New Model for Managing Foreign Affairs</I> State Department report of 1992, and even Vice President Al Gore's "reinventing government" initiative concluded that U.S. foreign aid programs are in dire need of reform. These conclusions led Secretary Christopher to recommend in 1995 that the Agency for International Development (AID) be abolished and its activities merged with those of the State Department.

<P>
<DD>
Why eliminate economic development assistance?  The answer is clear: It does more harm than good to fragile, less-developed economies. For example, of the 66 less-developed countries that have received loans from the World Bank for longer than 25 years, 37 are no better off today than they were before they received those loans. Of these 37 countries, 20 actually are poorer than they were before receiving the loans.<SUP>7</SUP>

<P>
<DD>
Neither does foreign aid necessarily advance U.S. interests abroad. In fact, most U.S. foreign aid goes to countries that frequently oppose U.S. interests. For example, two of every three recipients of U.S. foreign aid vote against the United States in the U.N. a majority of the time.<SUP>8</SUP>  If the Clinton Administration and Congress need to find foreign affairs items to cut, AID and economic development aid programs clearly are the best candidates.

<P>
<B>CONCLUSION</B>

<P>
<DD>The United States needs to have a strong diplomatic overseas presence. Congress and the Clinton Administration should work to ensure that U.S. embassies, consulates, and other diplomatic activities are fully funded. But there is no need to increase the foreign affairs budget to keep these embassies open. More than enough funding would be available if the Agency for International Development were abolished and economic development aid ended. Savings from these cuts could be applied to embassy activities, if needed. Secretaries Christopher and Albright were correct to be concerned about funding U.S. diplomatic activities. But they were wrong in thinking that increasing the foreign affairs budget is the only way to achieve this goal.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Within the next few weeks, the U.S. Senate will have an opportunity to achieve genuine reform of transportation policy. But <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:s.00729:">S. 729</a>, a bill that would remove the transportation trust funds from the budget and from meaningful congressional oversight, is flawed and would not lead to needed reform. A preferable alternative would be legislative proposals now being prepared in the Senate that would return the highway programs to the states and allow them to collect the existing fuel tax and use it to finance transportation projects of their choosing. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Sponsored by Senators Trent Lott (R-MS) and Max Baucus (D-MT), the Trust Fund Restoration Act of 1995 (S. 729) would give federal highway spending budgetary exemptions and protections that even Social Security does not now have.<sup>1</sup>  Thus enactment of S. 729 would be a missed opportunity for the Senate to redesign and localize government involvement in areas vital to the health of the economy. At a time when transportation problems increasingly are local in nature, today's centrally directed Eisenhower-era program offers no solutions. S. 729 would do nothing to alter that deficiency.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The House version of the bill (<a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:h.r.00842:">H.R. 842</a> -- surprisingly entitled the Truth in Budgeting Act) passed the House this April. But many of those who voted for it did so in the belief that the bill would die, or at least be purged of its worst excesses, in the Senate. Unfortunately, they and the taxpayers may be very disappointed, because the process in the Senate is beginning to look like a scramble by special interests to obtain additional budgetary privileges. Already legislation has been introduced in the Senate (S.1395), sponsored by Senator William Roth (R-DE), to turn Amtrak into an entitlement by creating for it the Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund. The Fund would be financed by diverting 0.5 cents of the 18.4 cents now collected by the federal fuel tax for the other transportation trust funds. That such a tax could be proposed to finance one of the government's more questionable activities reflects the growing aggressiveness of taxpayer-dependent industries as they try to place a lock on the public's money.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The enactment of S. 729 would be an enormous obstacle to transportation reform. Instead of hiding the program by moving it off budget, Congress should turn its attention to solutions that are local in emphasis, and should work cooperatively with the Budget Committee, the governors, and reformers in the House and Senate to develop a reform package that will better address the transportation needs of the country.
<P>
<b>WHAT IS WRONG WITH S. 729</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Trust Fund Restoration Act (S. 729) would exempt all of the transportation trust funds from all of the key control provisions of the congressional budget process. These include budget caps that limit discretionary budget authority and outlays, pay-as-you-go rules, Gramm-Rudman-Hollings sequestration, and any other statutory budget limitations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Sponsors contend that the special budgetary privileges S. 729 would grant are essential to protect federal highway and other transportation spending from congressional budget cutters who might want to divert the $20 billion-plus in revenues raised by the federal fuel tax to deficit reduction or to other programs. But insulating the trust fund from budget scrutiny would make it more difficult for Congress to set clear budget priorities. Moreover, experience demonstrates that the risk of a congressional diversion of trust fund money to other purposes is overstated. In fact, federal highway programs have benefited from federal spending well in excess of the dedicated fuel tax receipts allocated to the trust fund. Since 1957, total federal spending on highways has exceeded highway trust fund receipts by more than $37 billion, making the diversion of highway revenues to other programs unlikely. <a href="ib225t1.gif">Table 1</a> presents a year-by-year analysis of highway receipts and spending.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Enactment of the bill would set back the prospects for transportation reform, regional equity, and honest budgeting. With the highway trust fund moved off budget, highway spending would be given preferential treatment and, unlike other programs, would be absolved from making any sacrifices in order to achieve fiscal restraint and a robust economy. Specifically:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill would make it more difficult to achieve sound public finance decisions because it would allow lawmakers to avoid hard budget choices. Lawmakers should have to decide whether pork-barrel highway spending should be more important than spending for national security or programs targeted to the needy and disabled. The legislation would allow them to avoid making such choices in the case of highway spending.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What is left of the federal budget would understate federal spending and taxes. By essentially removing highway funding from the normal presentation of the budget, the legislation would understate the size of the federal government. In FY 1996, some $302 billion, or 19.2 percent of spending, was already off-budget. S. 729 would add another $30 billion-$35 billion to that figure.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Highway programs would be removed from ongoing congressional oversight, and the outdated and inequitable allocation of pay-in and pay-out by the states would be preserved. In the current allocation scheme, the 27 donor states that subsidize the 23 recipient states (and the District of Columbia) would remain unchanged. <a href="ib225t2.gif">Table 2</a> presents the states by gain or loss, with several states such as Florida, Georgia, and Kentucky receiving from the trust fund less than three-quarters of the share paid in.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The highway program would be exempted from the budget's discretionary spending caps. This would reduce the annual appropriations process for transportation programs to an empty exercise because any actions taken would not count for purposes of budget scorekeeping or deficit reduction. Furthermore, this diminished congressional oversight would take away the incentive to improve a program that has not changed fundamentally since its origins in the 1950s, and would make more difficult the development and enactment of any of the reform proposals to transfer, devolve, block grant, or give back some or all of the highway revenue and spending authority to the states. Once the program is moved off budget and no longer is subject to annual budget review or periodic authorization, Congress would have fewer scheduled opportunities to review and improve it, and, therefore, fewer opportunities to effect needed reforms.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This final point is critical. Enactment of S. 729 would make it extremely difficult to reform outdated and ineffective transportation policies. Putting the program off budget and no longer subject to regular congressional review, authorization, and appropriation means that several prominent proposals to shift more of the resources and program management to the states would face greater obstacles to serious consideration and enactment. Such devolution is needed. With the interstate highway system completed, and with most transportation problems now largely local in nature, a centralized program operated by a Washington bureaucracy makes no sense.
<p>
<b>AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Rather than weaken the oversight of highway programs and insulate them from budget review, the Senate should be seeking ways to devolve those programs to the states, where local taxpayers and elected officials can better determine how to get full value for the money.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Proposals include the modest reforms endorsed by the Step 21 Coalition (representing 22 states). The Coalition plan would streamline highway program procedures, make more equitable the allocation of funds among states, and preserve the integrity of trust fund receipts, among other goals. But more comprehensive and better targeted to the needs of the states is legislation soon to be introduced by Senator Connie Mack (R-FL). Under Mack's "give-back" plan, all states would be given the right to collect the fuel tax and spend the receipts on transportation projects of their choosing, without interference from the federal bureaucracy or politically influentialspecial interests.<sup>2</sup>  The Mack plan would limit future federal highway involvement to the maintenance and improvement, as needed, of the existing interstate highway system and would limit the federal fuel tax to the revenues needed to meet this specific objective.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Devolution of highway funding to the states is long overdue. Washington's continued involvement in transportation substantially raises the costs of local highway projects. The federal mandates that accompany money from Washington mean that narrow yet influential constituent groups, such as organized labor and highway construction and material supply companies, benefit enormously at huge cost to taxpayers.<sup>3</sup>  One such feature of federal policy that benefits organized labor is the Davis-Bacon Act, which is attached to the highway program. This Act requires that workers on all federally financed highway construction projects be paid wages that often are 20 percent to 40 percent higher than local norms. It is estimated that this provision alone adds $202 million per year in unnecessary costs just to California's highway program.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Spending approximately $20 billion per year in both large and small construction projects, the highway trust fund is far and away the country's largest source of civilian pork-barrel spending. Various interest groups, companies, and industries that benefit from its current mode of operation understandably perceive any movement away from the status quo as a threat to their long-established lucrative relationships with government. This is why lobbyists for construction companies are mounting such an effort to gain passage of legislation to move the trust fund off budget. The Senate should not bow to this pressure. Instead, it should craft legislation that continues oversight and budget control, and begins the transfer to the states of responsibility for highways and the finances to pay for them.
<p>

<b>TECHNICAL NOTES</b>
<p>
<a href="ib225t1.gif">Table 1</a>
<p>
Source: Columns titled General Fund Appropriations, Highway Trust Fund Expenditures, and Total Federal Expenditures - All Highways are from <I>Highway Statistics</I>, as reprinted in a memorandum dated April 15, 1995, from John W. Fischer and William A. Lipford of the Congressional Research Service to the Honorable Nick Smith on the subject of "General fund spending for highways."  Column titled Highway Trust Fund Receipts is derived from <I>Historical Tables, Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 1997</I> (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1996), Table 2-4, pp. 34-39. Column titled Excess Highway Spending is the difference between receipts (col. 3) and total expenditures (col. 4).
<p>
<a href="ib225t2.gif">Table 2</a>
<p>
This presentation and return ratio differs from that presented in Table FE221, which purports to show that all states, except Kentucky, received a greater share of funds than they contribute, an outcome that is mathematically impossible. This DOT misrepresentation of state status is accomplished by comparing actual current fuel tax payments into the fund with prospective spending from the fund, with the latter always larger than the former because it includes interest earnings and unexpended balances in the fund, an apples-and-oranges relationship. Table 1 presents the same information but in a way that compares apples to apples (or grapes to grapes) by measuring the share paid in with the share paid out. For example, in the case of Kansas, the table indicates that its payment into the fund accounted for 1.159 percent of fund revenues but that it received only 0.96 percent of spending, making it a donor state, while Pennsylvania accounted for 4.7 percent of revenues but received 4.9 percent of spending, making it a recipient state. All states in bold type are donor states.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Within the next few days, the 104th Congress will decide whether it will attempt to reform transportation policy or whether it will permanently preserve the status quo. The mistitled <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/1?c104:./temp/~c10421OA::">Truth in Budgeting Act (H.R. 842)</a>, which would move the highway trust fund off budget, would be a missed opportunity for Congress to redesign and localize government involvement in areas vital to the health of the economy. At a time when transportation problems are increasingly local in nature, an Eisenhower-era, centrally directed program offers no solutions, and H.R. 842 would do nothing to alter that deficiency.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Truth in Budgeting Act has nothing to do with truth in budgeting. Its sponsors contend that it is essential to protect federal highway spending from congressional budget cutters who want to divert the $20 billion-plus in revenues raised by the federal fuel tax toward deficit reduction or to other programs. But insulating the trust fund from budget scrutiny would make it more difficult for Congress to set clear budget priorities. Moreover, experience demonstrates that the risk of a congressional diversion of trust fund money to other purposes is overstated. In fact, federal highway programs have benefited from federal spending well in excess of the dedicated fuel tax receipts allocated to the trust fund. Since 1957, total federal spending on highways has exceeded highway trust fund receipts by more than $37 billion, making the diversion of highway revenues to other programs unlikely. <a href="ib223_1.gif">Table 1</a> presents a year-by-year analysis of highway receipts and spending.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Enactment of the bill would set back the prospects of transportation reform, regional equity, and honest budgeting. Specifically, by removing the highway trust fund off budget:
<ol>
<b><li>Highway spending would be given preferential treatment and, unlike other programs, would be absolved from making any sacrifices in the name of fiscal restraint and a robust economy.</b> The bill would make it more difficult to achieve sound public finance decisions because it would allow lawmakers to avoid hard budget choices. Should pork-barrel highway spending be more important than spending for national security or for any of the many programs targeted to the needy and disabled?  Lawmakers should be required to confront such questions and make choices; the bill would allow them to evade that obligation in the case of highway spending.
<p>
<b><li>What is left of the federal budget would understate the federal government's level of spending and taxes, and therefore also understate the size of the federal government.</b> In FY 1996, $302 billion, or 19.2 percent of spending, was off-budget. H.R. 842 would add from $30 billion to $35 billion to that figure.
<p>
<b><li>Highway programs would be removed from ongoing congressional oversight, and the outdated and inequitable allocation of pay-in and pay-out by the states would be preserved.</b> In the current allocation scheme, the 27 donor states that subsidize the 23 recipient states (and the District of Columbia) would remain unchanged. <a href="ib223_2.gif">Table 2</a> presents the states by gain or loss, with several states such as Florida, Georgia, and Kentucky receiving from the trust fund less than three-quarters of the share paid in.
<p>
<b><li>The highway program would be removed from the annual appropriations process and congressional oversight, taking away the incentive to improve a program that has not changed fundamentally since its origins in the 1950s.</b> The diminished oversight that accompanies a shift off budget would make more difficult the development and enactment of any of the reform proposals to transfer, devolve, block grant or give back some or all of the highway revenue and spending authority to the states. Once the program is moved off budget and no longer is subject to annual budget review or periodic authorization, Congress would have fewer scheduled opportunities to review and improve the program, and, therefore, fewer opportunities to subject it to needed reform.
</ol> <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This final point is critical. H.R. 842 would make it extremely difficult to reform outdated and ineffective transportation policies. Putting the program off budget and no longer subject to regular congressional review, authorization, and appropriation means that several prominent proposals to shift more of the resources and program management to the states would face greater obstacles to serious consideration and ultimate enactment. Such devolution is needed. With the interstate highway system completed and with most transportation problems now largely local in nature, a centralized program operated by a Washington bureaucracy makes no sense.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The proposals include the modest reforms endorsed by the Step 21 Coalition (representing 22 states), which would streamline highway program procedures, make more equitable the allocation of funds among states, and preserve the integrity of trust fund receipts, among other goals. More comprehensive and better targeted to the needs of the states is legislation soon to be introduced by Senator Connie Mack (R-FL). Under Senator Mack's "give-back" plan, all states would be given the right to collect the fuel tax and spend the receipts on transportation projects of their choosing, without interference from the federal bureaucracy or the politically influential  special interests.<sup>1</sup>  The Senator's plan would limit future federal highway involvement to the maintenance and improvement, as needed, of the existing interstate highway system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Washington's continued involvement in transportation substantially raises the costs of local highway projects. The imposition of federal mandates means that narrow, yet influential, constituent groups, such as organized labor and highway construction and material supply companies, benefit financially.<sup>2</sup>  One such feature of federal policy that benefits organized labor is the Davis-Bacon Act, which is attached to the highway program. This Act requires that workers on all federally financed highway construction projects be paid wages that often are 20 percent to 40 percent higher than local norms. It is estimated that this provision alone adds $202 million per year in unnecessary costs just to California's highway program.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Spending approximately $20 billion per year in both large and small construction projects, the highway trust fund is far and away the country's largest source of civilian pork-barrel spending. Various interest groups, companies, and industries that benefit from its current mode of operation understandably perceive any movement away from the status quo as a risk to their long-established lucrative relationships with government. This is why lobbyists for construction companies are mounting such an effort to gain passage of legislation to move the trust fund off budget.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In a recent interview, T. Peter Ruane, President of the American Road & Transportation Builders and the leader of the industry coalition backing H.R. 842, claimed that there were 230 strong votes for the bill "and another 40 we think we can deliver."<sup>4</sup>  Taxpayers should hope that Ruane is wrong and that there are enough Members of Congress who realize that H.R. 842 would be an enormous obstacle to transportation reform. Instead of hiding the program by moving it off budget, Congress should turn its attention to solutions that are local in emphasis, and should work cooperatively with the Senate, the states, the House Budget Committee, and the Transportation Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee to develop a reform package that will better address the transportation needs of the country.

This presentation and return ratio differs from that presented in Table FE221, which purports to show that all states, except Kentucky, received a greater share of funds than they contribute, an outcome that is mathematically impossible. This DOT misrepresentation of state status is accomplished by comparing actual current fuel tax payments into the fund with prospective spending from the fund, with the latter always larger than the former because it includes interest earnings and unexpended balances in the fund, an apple to oranges relationship. Table 1 presents the same information but in a way that compares apples to apples (or grapes to grapes) by measuring the share paid in with the share paid out. For example, in the case of Kansas, the table indicates that its payment into the fund accounted for 1.159 percent of fund revenues, but received only 0.96 percent of spending, making it a donor state, while Pennsylvania accounted for 4.7 percent of revenues, but received 4.9 percent of spending, making it a recipient state. All states in bold face type are donor states.

<title>How to Close Down the Department of Energy -- Heritage</title>

<h3><i>HOW TO CLOSE DOWN THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY</i></h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/barry.html">John S. Barry</a><br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder No. 1061<br>
November 9, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.doe.gov">U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)</a> was created as a Cabinet-level department in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter as part of the federal effort to address the energy crisis of the late 1970s. Fearing that international energy shortages were the wave of the future, the President felt a highly visible national agency was necessary to promote energy conservation, control federal supplies of power, and develop alternative sources of energy. However, the OPEC oil embargo then collapsed -- without any assistance from the DOE -- and international oil supplies stabilized. 
<p>
And yet, the department remains. In fact, DOE has grown in tax dollars spent and functions performed -- the result of 15 years of searching for something to do. As Victor Rezendes of the General Accounting Office has testified, "DOE's mission and priorities have changed dramatically over time so that the Department is now very different from what it was in 1977. While energy research, conservation and policy-making dominated early DOE priorities, weapons production and now environmental cleanup overshadow its budget."<sup>1</sup>  Thanks to this continual empire-building, the department's budget has increased by 235 percent, and 85 percent today is spent on activities other than energy resources. For instance, nearly $12 billion is budgeted annually for environmental quality and nuclear waste disposal, with close to another $3 billion earmarked for fundamental science research.
<p>
The Department of Energy not only has strayed from its original mission of energy oversight, but also has failed to conduct efficiently the services it now provides. Vice President Al Gore's National Performance Review reported that due to inefficiencies as high as 40 percent within DOE's Environmental Management program, more than $70 billion could be lost over the next 30 years.<sup>2</sup>  Victor Rezendes testified that "DOE suffers from significant management problems, ranging from poor environmental management... to major internal inefficiencies rooted in poor oversight.... "<sup>3</sup>. These management problems and the inefficiencies that flow from them have been caused largely by DOE's continual efforts to re-align itself and justify its existence.<p>It is time to close the Department of Energy. Senator Rod Grams (R-MN) and Representative Todd Tiahrt (R-KS) have developed legislation that would dismantle the department.<sup>4</sup>  Title I of both bills redesignates the Department of Energy as the "Energy Programs Resolution Agency," modeled after the Resolution Trust Corporation, created by Congress to dispose of the assets of failed thrift institutions closed in the late 1980s. Both bills would establish a three-year limit for closing DOE, privatize Energy's valuable oil reserves and other assets, establish a commission to recommend DOE laboratory privatizations, set new guidelines for toxic waste disposal, and transfer control over the nuclear weapons stockpile to the Department of Defense.
<p>
Under a plan developed by analysts at <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>, DOE's defense-related programs would be transferred to an agency under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense, and its primary research functions would be transferred to universities or the National Science Foundation.<sup>5</sup>  Federal funding for commercially oriented energy supply, research, and development projects would be terminated, and the research responsibility would be transferred to the private sector. All commercial energy functions, including the Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs), Petroleum Reserves, and Uranium Enrichment activities, would be denationalized and sold to the private sector.
<p>
Specifically, under the Heritage Plan, Congress would:
<p><ul>
<li> Transfer all defense-related nuclear weapons functions to a new agency within the Department of Defense. This new agency would have primary management and oversight responsibility for environmental cleanup activities.
<p>
<li> Decrease the Department of Energy's <a href="http://www.em.doe.gov">environmental management</a> budget by 30 percent and adopt as the program's objective the maximum overall reduction in risk to the populace for every dollar spent.
<p>
<li> Establish the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management as a federal corporation with the ultimate goal of full privatization.
<p>
<li> Terminate all Energy Supply Research and Development programs and privatize the government-owned laboratories engaged in this research.
<p>
<li> Terminate all Energy Conservation funding, including state grants and research programs.
<p>
<li> Phase out federal funding for General Science and Basic Research and transfer the laboratories conducting this research to the universities currently operating them.
<p>
<li> Sell the Strategic Petroleum Reserves to the private sector.
<p>
<li> Sell the Naval Petroleum Reserves to the private sector.
<p>
<li> Sell the U.S. Uranium Enrichment Corporation to the private sector.
<p>
<li> Sell the five Power Marketing Administrations to the private sector, using a variety of stock sale approaches.
<p>
<li> Make the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission an independent agency.
<p>
<li> Close down or privatize the <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/">Energy Information Administration</a>.
</ul><p>
Closing the department and making the related reforms would save American taxpayers more than $41 billion over the next five years, including $16 billion in asset sales. By contrast, Secretary Hazel O'Leary's "re-invention" plan would save only $14.1 billion over five years, including $5.7 billion in asset sales. The proposals to close the department developed by Senator Grams and Representative Tiahrt would save more than $17 billion over five years.
<p>
There are two ways to close down a federal department. The first is simply to shift the department's responsibilities to other agencies and throw the old letterhead into the trash. The alternative is to eliminate, devolve, or privatize responsibilities whenever possible, and transfer only essential responsibilities to other departments. This latter approach is the one that should be used with the Department of Energy. DOE's history of failure and ineffectiveness demands nothing less.

<p>
<b>CHANGING MISSIONS AND BUREAUCRATIC GROWTH</b>
<p>
Created in 1977, the Department of Energy has changed missions numerous times over its almost two decades. Its original mission -- administering the complex set of regulations, price controls, and allocation laws established in response to the OPEC oil embargo of 1973-1974 -- was a dismal failure that actually resulted in higher energy costs and increased dependence on foreign oil.<sup>6</sup><p>Ronald Reagan promised during his 1980 campaign to eliminate the Department of Energy. Instead, he changed its mission from energy conservation, imposed through a centralized structure of regulations, to energy promotion by means of market mechanisms. The department also gained responsibility for the production of nuclear weapons during the 1980s because of a belief that production and stockpile management should be controlled by a civilian agency.
<p>
DOE's central mission changed once again with the end of the Cold War. The high level of weapons production was no longer necessary, and world energy supplies remained constant. Ever vigilant about finding a purpose, DOE began to concentrate on environmental remediation of past actions, including cleaning up its own contaminated weapons facilities. DOE's fiscal 1996 budget request makes this change in mission clear. Thirty-nine percent of the $17.8 billion budget request is earmarked for "Environmental Quality," while only 15 percent is for "Energy Resources."<sup>7</sup>  Another large portion of Energy's budget is dedicated to research and development of alternative-source energy supply, including solar, wind, geothermal, and nuclear power generation (see <a href="bg1061c2.gif">Chart 2</a>). Despite this massive effort, petroleum and coal remain the dominant sources of power in America.
<p>
DOE's newest initiative, the fourth change in mission, is the creation of Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs). These "agreements" are contracts whereby the Department of Energy allows individual companies to use federal laboratories, and even conducts research and development, all at taxpayer expense. CRADAs are meant to increase the competitiveness of American companies and support quality jobs at a time when much of the defense-related work completed at DOE's laboratories in the past is no longer seen as necessary. CRADAs thus offer the dual advantage of providing private companies with free research while preventing the closing of federal facilities -- or so proponents argue.
<p>
The Department of Energy's CRADA initiatives are among the most egregious examples of corporate welfare that benefits individual companies at tremendous expense to American taxpayers. According to a recent series on "High-Tech Handouts" in the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>, researchers who once worked for a private company are now employed by DOE but continue to do the same work. The only thing that has changed is that taxpayers are picking up the tab.<sup>8</sup>  Moreover, when this research is successful, individual companies can earn protected trade secrets or patents that often are not available even to the federal government. Millions of American taxpayers thus may be underwriting a single company's market position. <p> The results of most efforts are both disappointing and expensive. For example, the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i> notes that DOE has spent some $792 million on CRADAs between 1992 and 1995. The result has been 46 new companies at a cost of $17 million per company.<sup>9</sup>  Even more disappointing, many recipients of DOE assistance are reducing their research and development budgets and trimming their workforces. General Electric, which earned $4.7 billion in profits in 1994, received $25.4 million in federal assistance between 1990 and 1994. Over the same period, GE cut 80,000 positions from its payroll. Clearly, DOE's CRADA program is not meeting its stated goal of job creation.
<p>

<b>HOW TO CLOSE DOWN THE DEPARTMENT</b>
<p>
There is no legitimate rationale for a Department of Energy. Centralized planning of energy production and distribution, including operation of the Power Marketing Administrations, has proven ineffective and expensive. Mass-scale nuclear weapons production is no longer needed with the end of the Cold War. Environmental remediation efforts have been inefficient and often impractical. And efforts to bolster private industry through CRADAs are expensive, ineffective, and fast becoming a primary source of congressional earmarking and corporate welfare. All defense-related functions now being administered by DOE, including environmental remediation, should be transferred to the Department of Defense. All assets that are commercially viable should be privatized. Whatever remains should be terminated (see Table 1).
<p>
<b>Environmental Cleanup</b>
<p>
The Department of Energy was responsible for the production of nuclear weapons during the Cold War, and the pressure of competing with the Soviet Union prevented environmental protection from being a top priority at weapons production facilities. Today, although production has ceased, the environmental remediation of DOE's facilities remains. The vast majority of contamination problems at the department's nuclear weapons plants involve some level of radioactivity. Since 1989, the department has managed, stored, and cleaned up hazardous wastes produced at the plants under the Environmental Management (EM) program, which has three basic components:  Environmental Restoration, Waste Management, and Facility Transition and Management (created in 1992).
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Move the Department of Energy's environmental management responsibilities to a new independent agency within the Department of Defense.
<p>
<li>Adopt as the program's objective the maximum overall reduction in risk to the populace for every dollar spent.
</ul><p>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  Since its inception in 1989, DOE's Environmental Management program has almost quadrupled its budget to a fiscal 1996 request of $6.6 billion. The General Accounting Office estimates that the total cost of remediation at federal nuclear waste disposal sites will run as high as $200 billion.<sup>10</sup>  However, given DOE's poor performance in the past, this could be only a fraction of the eventual total. DOE also should re-evaluate its original goals and strategies for dealing with this problem. This is not to imply that contamination of these sites is insignificant. To the contrary, the amount of radioactive and hazardous waste at the Department of Energy's nuclear weapons complex is so great that more effective action is absolutely essential.
<p>
The Environmental Management program was supposed to clean up all sites within 30 years. Agreements signed by DOE, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and state regulatory agencies specify requirements and set milestones for achieving those requirements. Unfortunately, however, the costs of cleanup have escalated rapidly, breakthroughs in technology have not occurred at the pace originally estimated, and the nature and scope of the contamination problem simply are not known. "As a result," notes the General Accounting Office, these cleanup "agreements taken together do not reflect a national strategy of targeting resources based on the highest risks to human health and the environment."<sup>11</sup>  It is now clear that DOE will not be able to clean up the sites either within the 30-year time frame or any time soon thereafter.<p>Much of the problem lies with the assumptions that were made in setting these goals. The focus has been on timelines for reducing contamination rather than on the more sensible goal of reducing risk to human health and safety to the maximum extent possible for any given level of funding. This "biggest bang for the buck" approach would save far more lives at far less cost. For instance, if a site poses little threat to the local population, it may be better to delay cleanup until it becomes a higher priority. This would allow funds to be spent on sites that pose a more likely threat. Additionally, since the value of money is a function of time (how far in the future it is spent), cleanups would cost relatively less in the future -- especially if new technologies are invented. Alternative strategies such as land use controls also might encourage more effective cleanup decisions.
<p>
Both the Grams and Tiahrt bills contain solid provisions for prioritizing remediation actions at the various contamination sites. First they would transfer cleanup responsibilities to a civilian office within the Department of Defense. Then clear goals for reducing overall risks to public health would be adopted to ensure that the most dangerous sites are cleaned up first. These sensible reorganization and prioritization plans would ensure an efficient yet effective process of remediation.
<p>
<b>Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management</b>
<p>
The Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) is charged with constructing a permanent repository for the nuclear waste generated at civilian nuclear power plants. In the past, this material has been stored "on-site."  Realizing the danger to residents of surrounding areas, Congress in 1982 passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA), which mandated the construction of a single storage site that could hold all of the nation's nuclear waste beginning in 1998.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Reconstitute OCRWM as a mixed government-private corporation as a first step toward full privatization.<sup>12</sup><p><li>Redefine the new corporation's mission to concentrate on interim rather than permanent storage.<p><li>Establish concrete goals leading to the commencement of storage in 1998.<p></ul>Rationale:  The Department of Energy's efforts to create a safe and permanent repository have been dismal from the start. DOE has spent more than $4 billion just to study the viability of the proposed Yucca Mountain repository in Nevada and estimates that another $2.3 billion will be necessary over the next 15 years. The construction, maintenance, and operation of the future repository will cost an estimated $30 billion. Meanwhile, the General Accounting Office now estimates that storage cannot begin until 2023.<sup>13</sup>  In other words, for every year OCRWM has been in existence, it has fallen a year behind schedule.
<p>
These inefficiencies are attributable primarily to two factors. First, the National Waste Policy Act specifically requires the permanent, rather than temporary, storage of nuclear wastes. This has added great costs to the investigation process and will add even more to the future cost of storage and maintenance. Several proposals over the years, including Senator Grams's legislation and this year's House-passed appropriations bill, require the federal government to consider interim storage.<sup>14</sup>  This would allow storage and waste consolidation to begin in the near future. It also would allow for more detailed research and development into viable options for permanent storage.<p>Second, the program's organizational structure reflects many of the inefficiencies that haunt the Department of Energy in general:  excessively high expenses, scheduling lapses, poor contractor management, and a politically charged environment. Numerous studies over the past decade have commented on these problems and suggested that their cause is OCRWM's position within the Department of Energy. As early as 1984, only two years after the office was created, a report to the Secretary of Energy found that "Location of OCRWM within the Department of Energy makes it vulnerable to changes of policy and senior management as Administrations come and go."<sup>15</sup>  Studies generally have suggested that OCRWM be moved out of the Department of Energy and given the freedom to operate without political constraints.<sup>16 </sup><p>It is widely felt that the dangers presented by the transportation and storage of nuclear waste justify both stringent federal oversight of OCRWM and the timely and cost-effective construction of a nuclear waste repository. In the short term, both goals can be accomplished by creating a mixed government-private corporation. Such an organization would retain government oversight to ensure safety while allowing for efficiencies associated with private-sector incentives. In the long run, full privatization w
ill encourage the most efficient waste disposal by eliminating government interference in day-to-day operations. Safety standards could still be enforced through stringent congressional oversight.
<p>
Neither congressional proposal addresses the future of OCRWM privatization. Instead, control over civilian nuclear waste disposal is given to the Army Corps of Engineers. Given the long history of failure within the Army Corps,<sup>17</sup> it is disturbing that both Senator Grams and Representative Tiahrt would give it such a sensitive responsibility. It also does not seem likely that simply transferring its responsibilities to another government organization will solve the office's structural deficiencies.
<p>
High-Energy Science Research<sup>18</sup><br>The Department of Energy spends over $1.1 billion per year on basic research in high-energy physics, nuclear physics, and other general science programs. Many of these projects, such as the recently terminated <a href="http://www.ssc.gov">Superconducting Super Collider</a>, are considered "big science" because they require large and expensive facilities and teams of researchers.
<p>
The department owns nearly 30 research facilities around the country, nearly all of them managed and operated under contract by universities and private organizations. Of these facilities, 17 direct most of their programming to basic science and technology, high-energy physics, or nuclear physics research. Five are multi-program laboratories like <a href="http://www.anl.gov">Argonne</a> near Chicago; <a href="http://suntid.bnl.gov:8080/bnl.html">Brookhaven</a> in Upton, New York; and <a href="http://www.llnl.gov/">Lawrence Livermore</a> in Berkeley, California. Another 12 are specialized, or "program-dedicated."  These include Fermilab near Chicago; the <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/">Stanford Linear Accelerator Center</a> near Stanford, California; and the Structural Biology and Molecular Medicine Laboratory (formerly known as the Laboratory of Biomedical and Environmental Sciences) at the University of California at Los Angeles.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Phase out over three years all federal funding for general science and basic research.
<p>
<li>Transfer the federal laboratories conducting this research to the universities currently operating them or sell them to private-sector operators. 
<p>
<li>Shift any remaining funding for basic research to the National Science Foundation. 
<p>
<li>Award all funds based on competitive bids.
<p></ul>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  Many of the laboratories now owned by the Department of Energy were established during World War II in conjunction with the Manhattan Project, which resulted in the world's first atomic bomb. Since then, they have "expanded their missions to encompass civilian research and development in many disciplines -- from high-energy physics to advanced computing," reports the GAO; but because of DOE mismanagement, "the multi-program laboratories -- both individually and as a group -- do not have either clearly defined missions or specific implementation strategies that bring together laboratory resources to focus on accomplishing departmental objectives or national goals."<sup>19</sup>  With no defined mission, other analysts report, these laboratories often compete directly with the private sector.<p>More surprising is the amount of money DOE has spent subsidizing private companies. For instance, the department has spent more than $5.2 billion on "technology transfer" programs. Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary defends this by stating, "It's about jobs; it's about creating jobs. If we don't create jobs, then it's a failure."  As two <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i> reporters note, "By O'Leary's own measure then, it's a flop."<sup>20</sup>  Between 1990 and 1994, for example, the federal government, largely through the DOE laboratories, transferred $293.1 million to eight large companies with annual revenues of $700 billion. Yet, over the same four-year period, these eight firms reduced their U.S. payrolls by 329,438 positions and their research and development budgets by $516 million (two dollars for every dollar of government subsidy).<sup>21</sup><p>Numerous studies, including the recent Galvin Commission report, have made recommendations to DOE on how to focus the work of these laboratories, but the department has failed to do so. Indeed, many laboratory managers report that the Energy bureaucracy often stands in the way of scientific progress. These managers "view DOE's day-to-day management as costly a
nd unproductive in meeting the laboratories' missions."<sup>22</sup> <p>The only way to free these laboratories from DOE's bureaucratic micromanagement is to sell them to private research firms or transfer them at nominal charge to the universities currently operating them. This would allow these facilities to forge partnerships with other private technology interests or to pursue basic research independent of the political or budgetary process. 
<p>
Federal funding should be phased out over a three-year period to give these facilities time to find other sources of funding. One option would be to use the $1.6 billion realized from selling the Naval Petroleum Reserve to establish an endowment for university basic research facilities, freeing them permanently from the uncertainties of the budget process.
<p>
Both the Grams and Tiahrt proposals would establish a laboratory closure commission, similar to the present military base closure commission, to study the problem and recommend which DOE laboratories (except for those engaged in defense-related activities) should be closed, privatized, or downsized. It is important that Congress establish strict guidelines for the commission so that facilities which remain within the structure of the federal government engage solely in research directly applicable to federal functions. Such guidelines would mandate that all laboratories, regardless of stated mission, are investigated for inefficiencies and wasteful programs.
<p>
<b>Power Marketing Administrations</b>
<p>
The Department of Energy operates five Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) which sell wholesale electricity generated by 131 dams built and maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. These PMAs (Alaska, Bonneville, Southeastern, Southwestern, and Western Area) sold nearly $3 billion worth of electric power in 1994 -- just under 8 percent of all power generated in the United States.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>End all federal assistance to the PMAs, including direct appropriations and the authority to borrow from the Treasury.
<p>
<li>Sell the Power Marketing Administrations to private investors through a variety of privatization schemes by the end of 1998. 
<p>
<li>Sell the hydroelectric power plants by the turn of the century.
</ul><p>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  After nearly 50 years of taxpayer subsidies, it is time for the five Power Marketing Administrations to become fully private enterprises. Customers have enjoyed hidden subsidies for years because these government-owned utilities have been able to borrow from the Treasury at below-market interest rates and take as long as 50 years to pay back the loans. Of the more than $16 billion lent to the PMAs by the Treasury, only about 25 percent has been repaid.<sup>23</sup><p>PMA electricity is not sold to the highest bidder. Instead, it is sold at varying rates to municipal utilities, cooperatives, industrial users, other government facilities, and investor-owned utilities. Municipal utilities and rural cooperatives are "preference customers," which means they pay for electricity at cost -- often as little as half the rates paid by customers in other parts of the country. Industrial users have a different rate schedule. Aluminum companies, for example, consume as much as one-third of Bonneville's power, and "the rate they pay is, by contract, tied to aluminum prices."  Thus, when aluminum prices fell over the past five years, Bonneville was buying power "for as much as 3.5 cents a kilowatt hour, [but] it had to sell it to those utilities for 1.8."<sup>24</sup> <p>Selling the PMAs is the only way to bring sound business practices to these government-owned utilities. Congress should follow the example of countries around the world that are moving to privatize their state-owned utilities. In 1993, for instance, Argentina, Germany, and the United Kingdom raised a total of $4.4 billion by selling state-owned electric utilities to private investors -- including U.S. investors. 
<p>
The British experience is particularly relevant to the United States. In 1991, the British government restructured its government-owned electricity-generating facilities into four regional corporations and sold them to the public in a stock offering. These companies compete to offer electricity through a national grid system. They also compete with various small producers. The stock offering included preferential pricing for employees as well as discounts and incentives for electricity customers and small investors. Stock also was offered for purchase on foreign exchanges. This strategy of building support for the sale among employees, customers, and small investors made the sale very popular. The stock offering was heavily oversubscribed and yielded over $6 billion for taxpayers.
<p>
When the Reagan Administration failed to get Congress to act on its 1987 proposal to sell the Alaska and Southeastern PMAs, it tried unsuccessfully to reform the PMAs' debt repayment schedules. This effort has continued under the Bush and Clinton Administrations. This year, the Clinton Administration also is renewing the effort to sell four of the PMAs (excluding Bonneville) for a total of about $3.7 billion. The White House says it will work with Congress to develop specific proposals to privatize these assets. President Clinton's fiscal 1996 budget projects that the Alaska sale could generate $83 million. This sale has been in negotiation for more than six years and could be completed quickly if Congress acts to authorize it.
<p>
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimates that the relatively small Southeastern and Southwestern PMAs could be sold for $500 million each.<sup>25</sup>  The Southeastern PMA, which sells less than 2 percent of the power in its region, could be sold swiftly to regional utilities because it does not own or operate any transmission facilities. It simply pays a fee to various utilities to market power through their transmission lines. The Southwestern PMA, which accounts for 4 percent of the energy sold in its region, also could be sold to regional investor-owned utilities.
<p>
OMB estimates that selling the much larger Western Area PMA (WAPA) headquartered in Golden, Colorado, could generate some $2.6 billion. According to the Department of Energy, while WAPA markets about 9 percent of the power in its region, its service area covers 1.3 million square miles, and its wholesale customers provide power to 16 million consumers in 15 central and western states. Because of its large distribution area, WAPA should be broken up and sold in manageable pieces to investors.
<p>
Selling Bonneville (BPA) would be more complicated because of its size and the fact that it provides about 65 percent of the electric power in the Northwest. One method, used successfully by such countries as Britain, would be to sell through a broad-based stock option plan in order to neutralize opposition from the interests served by Bonneville and win popular support from public investors. Stock could be sold at favorable prices to employees, residential customers, environmentalists, fishing and agricultural interests, or others who may feel they stand to lose from privatization. Such a move also might bring support from the many investor-owned and public utilities in the region which reportedly have threatened to build their own power generators to free themselves from BPA's near-monopoly status.<sup>26</sup><p>Both the Grams and Tiahrt proposals call for immediate sale of the Alaskan, Western, Southwestern, and Southeastern Power Marketing Administrations. This would result in savings of roughly $3 billion over the next five years. In addition, both plans transfer control of the Bonneville Power Marketing Administration to the Department of the Interior and direct the Secretary of Interior to conduct a study outlining future courses for Bonneville.
<p>
<b>Energy Supply Research and Development</b>
<p>
The Department of Energy spends nearly $3.7 billion per year on research designed to develop or improve sources of energy. Initiated in response to the OPEC oil embargo to free U.S. consumers from dependence on foreign oil, these projects involve research on renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, and nuclear power, and such non-renewable sources as fossil fuels. Appropriations approved by Congress for fiscal 1995 include, among others, $442 million for fossil energy R&D, $288 million for solar energy research, $37 million for geothermal research, $293 million for nuclear energy research, and $49 million for wind energy systems.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Terminate all federal funding for energy supply research and development, including fossil fuel R&D.
<p>
<li>Privatize all government-owned laboratories engaged in this research.
<p></ul>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  In today's dollars, the federal government has spent over $70 billion on energy research programs since the Department of Energy was created in 1977 and has little or nothing to show for it. The United States imports 30 percent more petroleum now than before the oil shock of 1973, and alternative energy supply methods account for only one percent of all energy produced in this country.<sup>27</sup><p>Much of this DOE-funded research is already conducted by private firms or simply irrelevant to market needs. Electric utilities, for instance, voluntarily fund the $240 million-per-year Electric Power Research Institute at no government expense. Moreover, "the major new technologies for enhanced oil recovery... have come from private industry, not DOE," according to the Congressional Budget Office, and DOE's $9 billion investment in nuclear fission research has gone to waste because the private sector has no interest in building new nuclear power plants. Thus, Energy "has little in the way of commercial applications to show for its investment."<sup>28</sup>  All the federal government's attempts to outguess the energy market have produced are such expensive failures as the Synthetic Fuels Corporation and the Clinch River Breeder Reactor.<sup>29</sup>  Federal funding for renewable and non-renewable energy research and development should be halted immediately.<p>There are seven federal laboratories engaged in Energy Supply R&D research:  one multi-program laboratory (the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory) and six program-dedicated laboratories like the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. These facilities consume over $1 billion of total Energy Supply R&D funds. Congress should move to sell all seven to the private firms which currently operate them or transfer them to the universities with which they are affiliated. Private firms then can choose to continue funding for any research they decide is commercially relevant.
<p>
Both the Grams and Tiahrt bills include a review of these research and development activities by a laboratory closure commission. The Tiahrt plan is bolder because it establishes specific spending reductions for each of the next five fiscal years (a 25 percent reduction in fiscal 1997 and 50 percent reductions in each following year); Senator Grams proposes to leave any reductions to the discretion of the commission. The problem with allowing a commission to review DOE's research activities is that, while it helps remove political pressures from the process, it also fails to take into account the dismal record of these activities. DOE's energy supply research and development should be terminated, immediately and completely.
<p>
<b>Naval Petroleum Reserves</b>
<p>
Established in 1912, the federally owned Naval Petroleum Reserve (NPR) is comprised of two commercial oil fields at Elk Hills (near Bakersfield, California) and Teapot Dome (near Casper, Wyoming) and oil-shale reserves (near Rifle, Colorado).
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Sell the Naval Petroleum Reserves to the highest bidder.
<p></ul>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  There is no longer any compelling national, strategic, or commercial reason for the federal government to own the Naval Petroleum Reserve. These oil fields were set aside by Presidents William Howard Taft and Woodrow Wilson to assure fuel for the Navy as it converted from coal to oil. By and large, they sat idle until the Arab oil embargo of 1973-1974, when Congress decided that NPR oil should be pumped and sold and the proceeds used to ready the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The Department of Energy owns 78 percent of the Elk Hills facility, and a private oil company (Chevron) owns the remaining 22 percent. Overall, the NPR is the equivalent of less than one percent of total U.S. domestic output -- hardly enough to be vital to national security interests.
<p>
Although the NPR generates more than $400 million per year in revenue to the government, studies have found that these fields are operated far less efficiently than comparable privately owned oil fields. The NPR was targeted for privatization by the Reagan Administration in a proposal endorsed by the President's Commission on Privatization in 1988. The Clinton Administration's fiscal 1996 budget also proposes selling the NPR, but Congress so far has failed to act. The Office of Management and Budget estimates that the government's interest could be sold for some $1.5 billion, netting roughly $321 million after deducting the more than $400 million in revenues the NPR produces each year.<sup>30</sup>  Congress should embrace this effort and remove any legislative obstacles to selling these assets as quickly as possible.<p>The Tiahrt bill would transfer responsibility for the Naval Petroleum Reserves to the Department of the Interior and mandate the sale of a significant portion of the reserves to the private sector. The Secretary of Interior would then conduct a study to determine the best course of action concerning the remaining reserves. The Grams proposal, on the other hand, calls for sale of the entire reserve. This approach is preferable because it would result in much larger savings and serve taxpayers better.
<p>
<b>Strategic Petroleum Reserve</b>
<p>
Created by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975, the nearly 600 million barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) is a government-owned stockpile of crude oil available for release in the event of market disruptions such as the Arab oil embargo of 1973-1974. The Department of Energy operates six underground salt dome storage sites on the Gulf Coast of Louisiana and Texas.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Sell the Strategic Petroleum Reserve immediately.
<p></ul>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  The Strategic Petroleum Reserve has become an expensive and obsolete vestige of the regulated oil markets that existed before the Reagan Administration deregulated them in 1981. Over the past 20 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the United States has spent about $4 billion constructing the SPR storage facilities and another $17 billion to fill the reserves. Although Congress has not approved funds to expand the reserve beyond its current level of 592 million barrels, the annual cost of operating these facilities is some $200 million. 
<p>
Since deregulation, the oil market has become increasingly diversified and the futures market, which hedges against price fluctuations, has become highly sophisticated. As a result, interruptions in the world oil supply of the sort that occurred during the Persian Gulf crisis in 1990 and 1991 do not have the same impact on the economy they once did. Moreover, the CBO notes, while the market responded efficiently to the Gulf War interruption, "both the process of deciding to use the SPR and the mechanism for selling the oil may have actually contributed to market uncertainty at the time."<sup>31</sup>. <p>The CBO estimates the SPR's current market value at $10 billion, or about $17 per barrel. However, the sales value may be less because the SPR is suffering water leakage as well as heat and gas buildups, which may present difficulties in extracting the oil. But even a more reasonable purchase price of $7 to $10 per barrel would generate revenues of $4 billion to $6 billion. 
<p>
Both congressional plans to terminate DOE call for partial sale of the Strategic Petroleum Reserves, principally those held at Weeks Island, Louisiana. Representative Tiahrt proposes to transfer control over the other portions to the Interior Department, with the Secretary of Interior responsible for determining whether there is justification for selling further reserves. Senator Grams proposes to transfer responsibility for the SPR to the Department of Defense. The Secretary of Defense then would be responsible for determining what portion of the reserves should be maintained and what portion sold. Whoever is responsible, the goal should be to privatize the maximum amount of SPR possible. The final bill should set strict guidelines to ensure this.
<p>
<b>Uranium Enrichment Facilities</b>
<p>
For some 40 years, the U.S. government ran two uranium enrichment facilities, one at Portsmouth, Ohio, and the other at Paducah, Kentucky. In 1992, the Energy Policy Act transformed this federal program into a wholly owned government corporation (similar to Amtrak) called the United States Enrichment Corporation. The USEC currently produces and markets uranium enrichment services to more than 60 private utilities that own and operate commercial nuclear power plants in this country and abroad. The corporation generates revenues of approximately $1.5 billion annually and, after expenses, returns a "dividend" of roughly $30 million to the Treasury.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<ul><p>
<li>Sell the U.S. Enrichment Corporation to the private sector in FY 1996.
</ul>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  There is no reason for the U.S. government to operate a commercial business, especially one that returns only a small profit to the Treasury while maintaining effective market control over the industry. According to its own promotional material, the USEC serves "approximately 90 percent of the domestic market and about 40 percent of the world market."<sup>32</sup>  Its annual revenues of $1.5 billion would rank it 286th on the <i>Fortune</i> 500 list of industrial firms. <p>Congress should remove the many needless obstacles and impediments placed on the corporation by the 1992 Act so that it can be made more attractive to private buyers and investors and sold in FY 1996 for top dollar. A businesslike enrichment corporation could bring bids of at least $1 billion if freed from oppressive congressional restrictions. Ideally, the two facilities should be sold to different buyers to avoid creating a private monopoly.
<p>
The House already has passed legislation to privatize the U.S. Enrichment Corporation. Similar legislation is pending in the Senate.
<p>
<b>Energy Conservation Research and Grant Programs</b>
<p>
The Department of Energy spends nearly $800 million per year for energy conservation and research. This research is targeted toward improving energy efficiency in various sectors of the economy, such as transportation, industry, private and public buildings, and utilities.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Terminate all DOE conservation research and grant programs.
</ul><p>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  This program funds research and grants that should be financed by the private sector and state or local governments. For FY 1995, for example, Congress approved over $430 million for research targeted toward private industry. This funding includes some $20 million for building systems, $2 million for heating and cooling technology, over $25 million for industrial co-generation, $22 million for materials and metals processing, over $50 million for alternative fuels utilization, $1.2 million for "engine optimization in alternative fuels utilization," $1 million for vehicle systems materials, $1.5 million for light duty engine development, and some $3 million for international market development.
<p>
Congress also earmarked $226 million for state-based weatherization programs, $22 million for state conservation programs, and an additional $29 million for the "institutional conservation program."33  However important these conservation measures may be, they are not properly a function of the federal government. Congress should get out of the business of funding and micromanaging purely private research and purely local responsibilities. <p>Energy Information, Policy, Regulation, and Departmental Administration<br>Some $400 million of the Department of Energy's $18 billion-per-year budget is dedicated to departmental administration, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Energy Information Administration, and the Office of Economic Regulation.
<p>
<b>What Congress Should Do:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Make the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission an independent agency similar to the Federal Communications Commission or the Securities and Exchange Commission.
<p>
<li>Close down or privatize the Energy Information Administration.
<p>
<li>Eliminate all funding for non-defense departmental administration while closing down the Department of Energy. 
</ul><p>
<b>Savings from the Heritage Proposal:</b>
<p>
Rationale:  In testimony before a congressional subcommittee earlier this year, the General Accounting Office warned that "DOE suffers from significant management problems, ranging from poor environmental management of the nuclear weapons complex to major internal inefficiencies rooted in poor oversight of contractors, inadequate information systems, and work force weaknesses."<sup>34</sup>  Although the department has reorganized many times over the years to correct these deficiencies, those efforts have failed. The only recourse for Congress is to close the agency.
<p>
To dismantle the Department of Energy, Congress will have to complete various housekeeping duties such as eliminating over $400 million per year in departmental overhead funding and spinning off entities which can stand alone. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which is charged with regulating certain interstate aspects of the natural gas, oil pipeline, hydropower, and electric industries, easily could be made an independent agency like the Federal Communications Commission. FERC is basically self-financed by the fees paid by regulated industries. Congress should begin a serious debate, however, over the extent to which the federal government should continue to regulate the private energy sector.
<p>
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) is a quasi-independent agency within the Department of Energy intended to collect and disseminate data on petroleum, natural gas, coal, nuclear power, electricity, alternate fuel sources, and energy consumption. All of the activities and functions performed by the EIA are carried out by private firms, newsletters, trade magazines, and industry associations. The EIA should be privatized and all federal funding eliminated.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
The proposals by Senator Grams and Representative Tiahrt would close down DOE, not just re-invent or re-organize it. This is important because it would prevent future Congresses from simply re-inflating the department's funding. In contrast, Secretary O'Leary's re-invention plan maintains DOE's inefficient bureaucracy and perpetuates some of the department's most unnecessary functions. And, although O'Leary's plan would "save" a reported $14.1 billion over five years, a significant portion of these savings are from asset sales. Once these sales are complete, the Department of Energy -- re-invented or not -- will continue to exist at little or no savings to taxpayers. The two congressional termination plans, on the other hand, ensure large savings well beyond the next five years.
<p>
Cabinet-level status should be reserved only for departments that provide core national activities of the federal government. The Department of Energy does not fit this description. There is no role for DOE in energy supply or regulation with the fall of OPEC and a stable international flow of oil. There is no need for massive nuclear weapons production with the end of the Cold War. All that remains of the Department of Energy's core missions are environmental remediation and research and development. The first could be managed more efficiently by the Department of Defense. The second should be the responsibility of private-sector energy providers. Thus, while DOE still performs a few functions that are likely to continue as federal responsibilities, these functions in no way justify continuing the U.S. Department of Energy as an independent department with Cabinet-level status.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
The Department of Labor (DoL) has become one of the most pervasive regulatory agencies in the federal government. Created in 1913, DoL is currently responsible for the administration and enforcement of over 180 federal statutes. This proliferating body of legislation and regulation covers a wide range of workplace activities for nearly 10 million employers and well over 100 million workers, presenting a barrier to the formation of firms and their ability to create jobs.1<p>The 104th Congress has a rare opportunity to initiate fundamental reforms in the administration and enforcement of America's labor laws. If implemented, such reforms could save America's taxpayers $10.5 billion from 1996 to the year 2000 alone. The primary objectives of this effort should be to: 
<p><ul>
<li> Reduce excessive burdens on businesses and job creation while maintaining workplace health and safety; 
<p>
<li> Improve labor market flexibility while maintaining basic employment protections. 
</ul><p>
The best way to achieve these objectives is by closing this Cabinet-level department and moving certain of its key national functions into sub-Cabinet agencies or other departments. Other functions that are not national in scope should be devolved to the states, or in some cases to the private sector. Obsolete, ineffective, and wasteful rules and programs should be repealed or closed down.
<p>
The Department of Labor's programs are organized into seven main functional areas: <p>
1) Unemployment Insurance (UI) and Employment Services (ES),
<p>
2) Job Training Programs,
<p>
3) Workplace Health and Safety,
<p>
4) Private Pension Protection,
<p>
5) Employment Standards,
<p>
6) Economic Statistics, and
<p>
7) Labor Union Oversight. 
<p>
UI and ES form the largest functional area, accounting for around 75 percent of DoL's budget (set at $25.5 billion for FY 1995). The next largest budget function, Job Training Programs, accounts for around 20 percent. 
<p>
Examining these seven areas reveals that the administration and enforcement of American labor laws can and should be reformed, both to achieve the department's underlying objectives of workforce protection, including workplace health and safety, and to reduce the job-killing cost and complexity of today's labor regulations. To do this, Congress should take the following steps:
<p><ul>
<li> <b>Devolve financing and funding for the Unemployment Insurance and Employment Services to the states.</b> This would enable states to decrease the duration of unemployment, reduce payroll taxes, and increase jobs. Devolution should include the Veterans Employment Service, labor market information projects, the one-stop career system concept, and the administration of unemployment insurance. Congress also should repeal the Federal Extended Benefit program and provide incentives for states to overhaul and integrate their employment services with a view to reducing the duration of unemployment payments by moving the unemployed into new jobs more quickly. States also should have the option to begin exploring privatized unemployment insurance. Any remaining federal administrative functions should be transferred to the Treasury Department. 
<p>
<li><b> Consolidate all job training programs for the economically disadvantaged into a state block grant.</b> Congress should combine these programs, including the Job Corps, Senior Community Service Employment Program, Migrant and Seasonal Farm Workers Training, Indian and Native American Employment and Training, and Youth Fair Chance, into a block grant attached to the new welfare block grant recently passed by Congress. This would eliminate a maze of categorical programs and provide states the flexibility they need to develop programs that effectively reduce welfare dependency. States should be required only to focus these resources on means-tested job placement assistance and conduct control group evaluations of their effectiveness. Federal target and categorical requirements should be removed. The minimal federal oversight functions for this block grant should be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services.
<p>
<li><b> Consolidate all other job training programs into a state workforce development block grant.</b> This new block grant for job placement assistance and training would include such things as dislocated worker programs, School-to-Work programs, and Adult Technology Learning programs. Even the Department of Labor recognizes that a block grant would eliminate conflicting rules and administrative structures, remove bureaucracy at every level, and end the wasting of tax dollars.2  The determination of target groups should be left to the discretion of the states. Because the effectiveness of today's training programs is questionable,3 total funding for this block grant should be cut by 50 percent and frozen until scientific studies can prove they are effective. In carrying out these studies, states should be required to have at least one ongoing control group evaluation on programs funded from the block grant. The minimal federal oversight functions for this block grant should be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services.
<p>
<li><b> Reform the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and combine it with the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA).</b> This reform is needed to "refocus the [federal] responsibility for ensuring worksite safety and health on the workplace."4  Merging MSHA with a reformed OSHA is a sensible first step toward improving workplace health and safety, limiting unnecessary government intervention, and reducing inefficient, wasteful government spending.5  Businesses already have much stronger financial incentives than OSHA penalties, such as the costs of lost productivity, workers' compensation, and liability claims,6 to maintain and continually improve workplace safety. Thus, the role of the federal government should be redefined from that of heavy-handed regulator to one of cooperative partner. Congress also should spin off the "new" OSHA as a separate sub-Cabinet agency, similar to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. An independent governing and standards-setting board should be established. National workplace health and safety standards are too important to be determined by a department subject to political influence.  
<p>
<li><b> Transfer the Pension and Welfare Benefit Administration to the Social Security Administration.</b> Responsibility for the oversight of public and private retirement programs currently is spread across three departments.7  Combining the agencies responsible for this oversight would lead to more efficient research and retirement policy coordination. In addition, Congress should spin off the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation as an independent sub-Cabinet agency, fund the PBGC separately, and begin exploring ways to privatize pension insurance.8 <p><li><b>Repeal and nullify outdated labor laws, executive orders, and regulations.</b> Congress should streamline labor regulation by eliminating the heavy burden of outdated or restrictive rules. This means, for example, nullifying Executive Order 11246 and related affirmative action regulations affecting federal contractors and subcontractors; eliminating the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP); repealing the Davis-Bacon Act and Service Contract Act, as well as Section 13(c) of the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964; reforming the Fair Labor Standards Act; and strengthening the Portal to Portal Act of 1947. Congress then should transfer all remaining functions of the Wage and Hour Division to the Justice Department.
<p>
<li><b> Combine the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau within a newly created sub-Cabinet agency, the Bureau of National Statistics.</b> A new Bureau of National Statistics (BNS) would make it possible to develop and carry out a comprehensive, systematic effort to combine surveys and develop economies of scale. It also would be in a better position to undertake the careful evaluation and research needed to make decisions about more efficient survey design and ways to eliminate duplication and reduce paperwork and data collection burdens. Statistical functions of other departments also should be housed within the new bureau to ensure that the government's data collection efforts are insulated from politics.
<p>
<li><b> Close down the Office of the American Workplace and nullify Executive Order 12954 (Striker Replacement).</b> Government promotion of high-performance workplaces actually serves only as corporate welfare and a training subsidy for unions. These activities already are conducted in the private sector through business associations and unions. Congress should transfer labor union oversight and investigative functions, including those in the Office of the Inspector General, to the Justice Department. 
</ul><p>
The 104th Congress has held a number of hearings and introduced a variety of bills to reform and update America's labor laws, and it continues to reassess dozens of labor policy issues that have been neglected for years.9  This year's budget process also has provided Congress with a vehicle for reform. Aside from reforming and consolidating job training programs, the Administration's proposed budget did little to "reinvent" DoL. President Clinton proposed to raise the department's budget authority by over 14 percent and its full-time staff by 304.10  Congress appropriately rejected the President's budget and is proceeding with its own plan to reform the administration of federal labor policy through the budget process. <p>The House recently voted to reduce FY 1996 DoL discretionary spending by 13.8 percent. It also instituted several important reforms. For example, the House budget prohibits funding for implementation of President Clinton's executive order concerning the permanent replacement of striking workers by federal contractors, prohibits the issuance of two unnecessarily burdensome OSHA regulations on ergonomics and fall protection, and bars DoL from promoting "economically targeted investments" (ETIs) by private pension plans. The House also is planning to repeal the Davis-Bacon and Service Contract Acts as part of the budget reconciliation process.
<p>
The Senate Appropriations Committee recently voted to reduce DoL discretionary spending for FY 1996 by 12.6 percent. Although the Senate's DoL budget prohibits implementation of the striker replacement executive order, it does not contain the House's OSHA regulatory provisions or the prohibition on promoting ETIs. Differences between the House and Senate versions will have to be worked out in conference committee.
<p>
As the following study demonstrates, the U.S. Department of Labor has gone far beyond its original mandate to become a burdensome and feared regulatory agency that presents significant barriers to creating jobs and increasing real wages. The proliferation of mandated benefits and workplace requirements makes most small businesses think very carefully before hiring additional workers. Overzealous enforcement has made DoL the enemy of American business. Congress should do what the Clinton Administration promised but failed to do -- reform this overgrown and intrusive bureaucracy. 
<p>

<b>HOW THE DEPARTMENT HAS GROWN</b>
<p>
The Department of Labor was created by Congress in 1913 in response to pressure from organized labor. Its goals, according to the statute, were to "foster, promote and develop the welfare of wage-earners, to improve their working conditions, and to advance their opportunities for profitable employment."  Initially, DoL consisted of four bureaus transferred from the old Department of Commerce and Labor:  the Bureau of Labor Statistics (formerly the Bureau of Labor), the Bureau of Immigration, the Bureau of Naturalization, and the Children's Bureau. These bureaus reflected the department's original focus:  collecting information and publishing reports on employment, wages, and working conditions; reviewing the effects of immigration on the job market; and monitoring the use of child labor.
<p>
In 1918, during World War I, Congress established the War Labor Administration (WLA) to insure adequate industrial production and foster labor peace in defense production industries. The WLA set policies on wages, hours, and working conditions. It recruited women and minorities to work in defense industries. It also sought to encourage better workplace race relations, promote worker safety and health, and address other employment-related problems that might hinder war production. Although Congress moved quickly after the Armistice to end its activities, the WLA's initiatives embodied ideas of the Progressive movement that later would spawn the New Deal, Fair Deal, New Frontier, and War on Poverty. 
<p>
What began as primarily an advocacy, educational, and administrative department over time became a regulatory and enforcement agency. Since 1918 Congress has expanded DoL's regulatory functions considerably, often because of political pressure from social reform movements or organized labor. For instance: 
<p><blockquote>
	During the 1920s, in response to the women's suffrage movement, the Women's Bureau was added to promote the status of and job opportunities for women. DoL also implemented the Immigration Acts of 1921 and 1924 that ended U.S. free immigration policy by imposing a quota system. 
<p>
	Confronted with the depression of the 1930s, Congress passed several laws to protect workers from economic change. The Davis-Bacon Act was enacted explicitly to protect white unionized workers on federal construction sites from competition by low-skilled nonunion workers, chiefly blacks and Hispanics. The Wagner-Peyser Act established the U.S. Employment Service, and the Social Security Act established the Unemployment Insurance system. The Fair Labor Standards Act mandated a minimum wage, overtime requirements, and child labor restrictions.
<p>
	In the late 1940s, DoL underwent many organizational changes. Its immigration responsibilities were transferred to the Department of Justice to consolidate federal immigration functions in the Immigration and Naturalization Service. In the postwar years, the failure of DoL to mediate a wave of strikes prompted Congress to transfer the department's labor conciliation functions to the independent Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, and veterans' reemployment rights became DoL's responsibility as the Defense Department was scaled back. In 1959, concern over the influence of organized crime and other union abuses led Congress to pass the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act to oversee the financial integrity and internal democracy of American labor unions.
<p>
	In the early 1960s, unfounded concern about the impact of technology on the labor force, combined with the War on Poverty, resulted in passage of the Manpower Development and Training Act of 1962. Ten years later, spending on federal job training programs was increased significantly by the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) of 1973. The Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) of 1982 reduced the enormous cost of CETA but did not improve the effectiveness of federal job training programs. 
<p>
	Since the 1960s, pressure from the civil rights movement has led to a variety of equal employment opportunity laws and redundant presidential executive orders to protect certain groups of individuals -- women, minorities, the disabled, the elderly -- such as the Equal Pay Act of 1963, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and Executive Order 11246 as amended.11<p>	In the 1970s, DoL's regulatory and enforcement role expanded dramatically with passage of the landmark Occupational Health and Safety Act and again when responsibility for mine safety and health was transferred from the Department of the Interior. 
<p>
	Concern over the negative impact of federal trade policies on workers prompted Congress to pass the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act in 1974. The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act was enacted in 1988 to provide advance notice of plant closings and mass layoffs to workers and their communities. 
<p>
	During the 1980s and 1990s, Congress has enacted various employee benefits and protections, such as the Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988 and the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. 
</blockquote><p>
Since 1960, the expansion of federally mandated benefits and worker protections has begun to take its toll on business formation and job creation.12  In 1994, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, legally required benefits accounted for 32 percent of all benefits paid to workers on an hourly basis.13  Studies also show that changes in legally mandated benefits are shifted largely to workers in the form of lower real wages.14  Further, the increase in mandated benefits does not include the cost to businesses of complying with workplace safety and health regulations.15  Although well intentioned, these requirements add to the cost of hiring and managing workers and directly affect an employer's decisions about whether and when to hire a worker, which worker to hire, and how long to retain that worker. The rise in nonwage labor costs is important because it is one of the forces leading employers to lay off workers, as well as to utilize part-time, temporary, and contract labor.16<p>Ironically, organized labor has been so successful in persuading Congress to legislate matters that once were the province of collective bargaining that they have nearly driven themselves out of business. And with each Congress, Washington has placed more and more requirements and restrictions on employers and the labor market.17  This growing regulatory burden has made DoL inspectors as feared as IRS auditors and most small businesses very cautious about hiring additional workers.<p><b>RECOMMENDATIONS</b><p>Today's labor market conditions and labor-management relations have changed since most of America's major labor laws were passed. Workers are demanding more flexible hours, working conditions, and compensation packages than current laws and regulations allow. It is time for Congress to reform the administration and enforcement of America's labor laws. Only a fundamental rethinking of DoL and its functions can lead to the formulation of a proper and truly effective federal labor policy. The primary objectives of this reform should be to reduce excessive burdens on businesses and job creation while maintaining workplace health and safety and to improve labor market flexibility while maintaining basic employment protections. 
<p>
The best way to achieve these objectives is by eliminating the DoL as a Cabinet department. Certain key national functions should be carried out by sub-Cabinet agencies or transferred to other departments. Other functions that are not national in scope should be devolved to the states, or in some cases to the private sector. Obsolete, ineffective, and wasteful rules and programs should be repealed or closed down.
<p>
<b>I. REFORM UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND THE EMPLOYMENT SERVICE.</b><p>
Over two-thirds of DoL's budget is consumed by the Unemployment Compensation (UC) Program.18  This program has two main objectives:  to provide temporary and partial wage replacement to recently unemployed workers, and help stabilize the economy during recessions. The UC program is financed by a Federal Unemployment Tax (FUTA) of 0.8 percent19 of the first $7,000 in wages and state unemployment insurance taxes that average 0.9 percent of total wages. The revenue raised by FUTA is used to administer Unemployment Insurance (UI) and maintain a system of Employment Service (ES) offices. Portions of FUTA revenues also fund the federal half of the Extended Benefits Program and federal loans to depleted state accounts. State UI tax revenues fund state UI benefit payments and the state half of the Extended Benefits Program. At the end of fiscal 1995, state accounts in the UI Trust Fund had a balance of $35.6 billion. Like the Social Security Trust Fund, any positive balance in the UI Trust Fund is used to fund other federal programs. General revenues are used to fund federal unemployment benefit programs and allowances such as Trade Adjustment Assistance and NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance. 
<p>
When the UC program was enacted in 1935, Congress intended that it be a federal-state partnership. The federal government was to set broad parameters, provide adequate and equitable funding for state administration, and oversee state law and operations to ensure compliance and conformity. The states were to be responsible for carrying out the program while complying with all federal laws and regulations, as well as their own state requirements. However, the federal government has used the state conformity process to convert the basic program philosophy into a more acceptable ideology and frequently upsets the balance of administrative funding and workloads by dictating that states absorb the costs of administering additional programs.20<p>Over the past decade, federal budget constraints have had a detrimental effect on services provided to unemployed workers by the state UI system and ES offices. Even though FUTA revenues collected for UI and ES administration have been more than sufficient, Congress continues to extend the 0.2 percent FUTA surtax on jobs and limit UI and ES administration appropriations.21  This masks the true size of the federal deficit. The federal government actually uses the UI system to fund programs that lead to longer periods of unemployment for workers22 and unnecessarily high payroll taxes. This is contrary to the primary purpose of the UI system23and reduces real wages.24<p>The UC program should be reformed to limit the federal role, as Congress originally intended, and to restore responsibility and accountability to the states. Studies show that states can decrease the duration of unemployment and thereby reduce payroll taxes and increase jobs.25 <p>What Congress Should Do:<p><b>Devolve financing and funding for the UI system and Employment Service to the states. </b><p>Congress should repeal the temporary 0.2 percent FUTA surtax and increase the FUTA offset26 from the current 90 percent to 100 percent if a state conforms with federal law. States should be allowed to collect one UI tax for administration and benefits. Each state would be responsible, and accountable, to employers for UI payroll tax dollars and for the administration and effectiveness of the UI/ES system. Receipts from the single state UI tax should be deposited into each state's UI account, maintained by the Department of the Treasury. States also should have the option to begin exploring privatized unemployment insurance.
<p>
<b>Repeal the Wagner-Peyser Act and amend FUTA to require states to establish public employment offices in labor market areas designated by state legislatures. </b>
<p>
Each state should have the flexibility to deliver job placement assistance in ways that meet the needs of its employers and job seekers. However, states should be required to ensure reasonable access to services for workers and to register for work all eligible claimants who are not temporarily laid off. Reform must provide incentives for states to explore ways to integrate employment services and reduce the duration of unemployment payments by moving the unemployed into new jobs more quickly. These incentives should include opening up the job placement assistance offered through the state ES offices to private competition and other UI experiments.
<p>
<b>Eliminate the federal extended benefit program and the federal extended unemployment compensation account (EUCA). </b>
<p>
Funds in the EUCA should be transferred to state UI accounts based upon each state's relative share of covered employment. The 1992 amendments that made it easier for states to trigger extended benefits (EB)27 should be repealed. The 1992 change made it easier for states to qualify for extended benefits and encouraged individuals to stay on unemployment benefits even when jobs were available. By basing the trigger for extended benefits on a state's total unemployment rate rather than its insured unemployment rate, Congress also broadened considerably the number of those who can qualify for extended benefits. Those who argued for this change claimed that basing benefits on the insured rate meant that many of the unemployed were not receiving benefits and that the program therefore was not working as intended. But, as pointed out at the time by Labor Department officials, this gap between the number of people who were unemployed and the number collecting benefits is normal and is an intended purpose of the program.28<p><b>Eliminate the Federal Unemployment Account (FUA), which is used to loan money to insolvent state UI accounts. </b>
<p>
 Funds in the FUA come from a portion of the FUTA payroll tax on jobs.29  The federal government uses the FUA to provide loans to states that have depleted their UI accounts during severe recessions. When the FUA is not being used for state loans, the surplus that builds up is used to fund other government programs and amounts to a tax on jobs to reduce the deficit. At the end of September 1995, there will be a $7.4 billion surplus in the FUA. The FUA should be eliminated and its funds transferred to state UI accounts. States that deplete their UI accounts should be able to borrow directly from the U.S. Treasury rather than from a surplus account maintained to offset the federal deficit.
<p>
<b>Repeal the Disabled Veterans Outreach Program and the Local Veteran Employment Representative Program and amend FUTA to incorporate the veteran preferences already in Title 38 of the U.S. Code (Veterans Benefits). </b>
<p>
The administrative efficiency of ES offices could be improved significantly by repealing barriers to the integration of veterans' services with other employment services. As the Vice President's National Performance Review noted in calling for the removal of barriers,30 DoL's Veterans' Employment and Training Service provides for state-employed, federally funded employment specialists to serve veterans in local state employment service offices. However, staff are legally prohibited from helping non-veterans. "So, if a local office is crowded with non-veterans," points out the NPR, "these specialists cannot help out -- even if they have no veterans to serve."  Employment Service staff would be used more efficiently and the public better served by eliminating this requirement.
<p>
<b>Eliminate Trade Adjustment Assistance. </b>
<p>
This program funds payments for unemployment benefits, allowances, and training costs to workers affected by foreign trade imports under the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act (TAA). In addition, the TAA provides for payment of similar benefits to workers adversely affected by NAFTA. As well intentioned as this may be, workers who can prove they lost their jobs because of foreign competition or NAFTA should not receive government benefits that exceed the assistance available to those laid off due to domestic competition.31  In any case, the department's own auditors have concluded that the TAA has not worked as intended, and the new NAFTA-TAA program likely will meet the same outcome:  Instead of providing retraining help, the TAA program has turned into a compensation program.32  Funding for these ineffective programs should be eliminated.<p><b>Permit state legislators to determine ES administrative budgets, payroll taxes, and UI benefits under limited federal guidelines. </b><p> The UI system is an experience-rated and employer-paid payroll tax. It was set up with specific objectives and a designated tax as its funding source. Federal proposals to combine the funding sources for the ES program and job training programs are unwise. Job placement services have different goals, populations, and outcomes from those of training programs. ES offices are supposed to get unemployment claimants back to work quickly, thereby ensuring that employer taxes are as low as possible. Job training programs often do not share that objective. Suggesting that FUTA payroll tax funds be used for anything other than paying unemployment benefits and funding state job placement assistance is merely a backdoor way to introduce a payroll tax for training. Devolving ES funding removes the potential for Congress to dilute the mission of the system and divert funding for other purposes.
The limited federal guidelines should include the following:
<p><ul>
<li>	The single state UI tax for both administration and benefits should be experience rated.
<p>
<li>	Funds should be used only for program administration and weekly benefits and should be capped at levels necessary for proper and efficient administration during periods of high unemployment.
<p>
<li>States should be required to continue cooperative and financial contracts to administer the interstate benefit program.
<p>
<li>	Federal funding for the administration and payment of federal employee UI benefits, military separations, and disaster unemployment programs should be deposited in state UI accounts as needed.
<p>
<li> Federal oversight should be limited to determining whether state laws conform with federal requirements.
</ul><p>
<b>II. CONSOLIDATE JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS INTO BLOCK GRANTS.</b><p>
The current maze of discretionary job training programs accounts for another substantial portion of DoL's budget. Many DoL programs overlap programs in other departments. The General Accounting Office has identified 163 employment training assistance programs across the federal government, spending about $20 billion per year.33  Moreover, "this fragmented system wastes resources and confuses and frustrates clients, employers, and administrators."  For FY 1995, thirty of these programs, totaling $5.8 billion, were funded through DoL.34  The Employment and Training Administration, the primary DoL agency responsible for job training programs, is run by 1,529 employees and accounts for 50 percent of DoL's discretionary budget.35<p>President Clinton, as part of his "Middle Class Bill of Rights" initiative, has proposed significant funding increases in his FY 1996 budget.36  For example, DoL proposed to increase funding for the School-to-Work program by 63 percent and funding for the One-Stop Career Center program by 100 percent. But the Clinton Administration also agrees that federal job training programs are fragmented, overlapping, and lack accountability. Part of the President's initiative is to consolidate and reform 70 job training programs. 
<P>
Because statistics indicate that more education leads to better paying jobs, Congress and others assume that job training programs work. Unfortunately they don't. Rather than focusing on who should have responsibility for job training programs, Congress must first ask itself a fundamental question:  Why should we continue to spend taxpayer money on programs that don't work?37 <p>Job training programs, although well intentioned, have not raised the long-term hourly earnings of participants. They do not achieve this primary goal because there is little, if anything, the government can do to alter what happens when individuals neglect their first 12 years of primary education.38  The billions of dollars spent on government job training and public assistance programs are too much too late. What is needed are more fundamental changes aimed at improving basic education through school choice, strengthening curricula, and completing high school. Reform that focuses on these goals will reduce the demand for government job training programs that do not work.
<p>
Bills have been introduced in both the House and the Senate to reform federal job training programs. The House recently passed the Consolidated and Reformed Education, Employment, and Rehabilitation Systems Act (H.R. 1617), introduced by Representative Howard McKeon (R-CA). The Senate also recently passed the Workforce Development Act of 1995 (S. 143), introduced by Senator Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS). Although both bills improve current law by consolidating some of the federal job training programs into state block grants and increasing accountability, major changes need to be made in conference.
<p>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Consolidate more programs into the block grants.</b>
<p>
S. 143 consolidates only around 80 of the 163 federal employment and training programs and reduces spending by 15 percent. H.R. 1617 consolidates even fewer programs. H.R. 1617 does not include Job Corps, the most expensive federal job training program, or vocational rehabilitation programs. S. 143 marginally reforms Job Corps, but does not consolidate it in the state block grant. However, S. 143 does include vocational rehabilitation programs. 
<p>
 Congress can improve both bills by consolidating the Job Corps, vocational rehabilitation, and the Senior Community Service Employment program into the state block grant.
<p>
<b>Provide maximum flexibility to the states in designing their programs. </b><p>
Overly prescriptive federal requirements should be removed. State and local elected officials are in the best position to allocate block grant funds. There is tremendous diversity among and within the states. What Washington prescribes as the solution for problems in urban areas often does not fit well in places like Utah or Vermont. Prescriptive solutions and fixed allocations of funds will work in some places, but will also be the worst possible solution in many others.39  State and local workforce development boards should be optional, not mandatory. Continuing School-to-Work activities also should be optional and not mandatory.<p>Further, states should have the discretion to transfer funds between the welfare and job training block grants for the purpose of implementing work requirements and job placement assistance programs. This would provide additional flexibility to states and eliminate micromanagement by the federal government. 
<p>
<b>Strengthen accountability with control group evaluations.</b>
<p>
Each state should have at least one control group evaluation of its job training programs ongoing at any given time. Such scientific evaluation should be conducted by using experimental and control groups chosen by scientific random assignment and, at a minimum, should determine whether job training and job placement programs effectively raise the hourly wage rates of individuals receiving training through such programs. Each state should report annually on the status and results of its control group evaluations.
<p>
The addition of state control group evaluations would quickly build a body of evidence on the true effectiveness of job training programs. Few job training programs have ever been subject to rigorous evaluation.40  As a report from the Secretary of Labor points out, "there are many areas where little thorough and reliable evaluation evidence is available."41  The few solid studies that have been conducted generally fail to show any significant increase in the hourly earnings of participants directly related to job training. Historically, performance measures and benchmarks have been the more common but unsatisfactory means of determining whether or not these programs work. The findings from performance measure methods, particularly the negative ones, have been easily manipulated and explained way. Without a requirement for rigorous, control group studies, American taxpayers will never know whether they are funding effective programs or just throwing good money after bad. 
<p>
<b>Scale back the labor market information system.</b>
<p>
Initial labor market information system (LMIS) activities should be restricted to conducting a feasibility study, developing LMIS options, and estimating the cost of those options. The current LMIS provisions in both H.R. 1617 and S. 143 immediately plunge the federal and state governments down an untested and expensive path that may not be feasible. Further, mandating states to create a LMIS at the substate level for which no data current exist will be extremely expensive. The initial information for the labor market information system should be restricted to data readily available from the Census Bureau and other federal and state agencies.
<p>
Further, employers should not be mandated to provide any information. All employer provided information on job openings, application procedures, employment requirements, wages, benefits, and hiring patterns should be strictly voluntary. Any information supplied by either individuals or employers should also be immune from the legal process and should not, without the consent of the individual or employer, be used for any judicial or administrative proceeding. 
<p>
<b>III. REFORM AND RESTRUCTURE WORKPLACE HEALTH AND SAFETY.</b>42<p>Although Congress intended that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) assure all workers safe and healthy working conditions, the effectiveness of these agencies in carrying out their missions is questionable. From rulemaking to enforcement, the regulatory nightmare that businesses face has made OSHA inspectors as feared as IRS auditors.43  Although most employers maintain relatively safe and healthy workplaces, OSHA maintains an adversarial approach to setting and enforcing standards.44  Significant reform is required to redefine the federal government's role in workplace safety and health and "refocus the responsibility for ensuring worksite safety and health on the workplace."45  Vice President Gore's National Performance Review correctly recognized that an army of OSHA inspectors is neither necessary nor likely, given the federal budget situation. A new approach is required to increase workplace health and safety and balance the budget. Merging MSHA with a reformed OSHA is a sensible first step toward improving workplace health and safety, limiting unnecessary government intervention, and reducing inefficient, wasteful government spending. 
<p>
A number of bills have been introduced in the House and Senate to reform workplace health and safety programs. The leading bill in the House is H.R. 1834, the Safety and Health Improvement and Regulatory Reform Act of 1995, introduced by Representative Cass Ballenger (R-NC). In the Senate, Judd Gregg (R-NH) has introduced the Occupational Safety and Health Amendments of 1995 (S. 526), and Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) has introduced the Occupational Safety and Health Reform Act of 1995 (S. 592). Of these three bills, H.R. 1834 represents the most comprehensive OSHA reform. It also is the only bill that consolidates administrative overhead and ends duplicative costs by merging OSHA and MSHA.
<p>
Legislative changes are necessary to enable MSHA to allocate resources more efficiently and OSHA to work cooperatively with businesses -- for example, by making compliance assistance a permanent, central part of its program and mission. Efforts to reprioritize agency spending or administratively reinvent the agencies would change their bureaucratic culture only marginally and do little to consolidate administrative overhead and eliminate duplicative activities. President Clinton offered to reinvent OSHA after the 104th Congress announced its intention to create a more effective and efficient OSHA.46  In addition, President Clinton's proposed FY 1996 budget increased funding for OSHA compliance assistance by 23 percent while increasing overall OSHA and MSHA spending by 8.9 percent. The House recently voted to increase funding for OSHA compliance assistance by 19.2 percent while reducing overall OSHA and MSHA spending for FY 1996 by 12.5 percent. The Senate Appropriations Committee recently approved a 5.0 percent funding decrease for OSHA compliance assistance and a 3.1 percent overall reduction. However, Congress can accomplish much more by fundamentally redefining the role of the federal government so that it recognizes and more effectively uses the incentives businesses already have to improve workplace health and safety.
<p>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Significantly reform OSHA.</b>
<p>
Although executive branch initiatives to reinvent workplace health and safety are welcome, statutory changes are required to redefine the federal government's role and ensure that congressional intent is implemented. Specifically,
<p><ul>
<li>Reform OSHA's regulatory process. <br>
Because OSHA's bureaucratic culture and lawyers have put the search for completely risk-free workplaces and ease of prosecution above common sense, it can take ten or more years to complete a rule.47  OSHA's regulatory process would be more timely and less burdensome if focused initially on hazards that pose the greatest risk to the most workers. Development of compliance directives should be made part of the rulemaking process and tied directly to economic analysis. Far too often, compliance directives are more burdensome than the rules themselves. OSHA also should be required to reassess the actual costs and benefits of its regulations after five years.
<p>
<li>Enhance and expand compliance assistance.<br>
Translating OSHA's confusing jumble of regulations into safer workplaces is difficult at best. Most employers want safe and healthy workplaces, but the Department of Labor is more concerned with prosecuting employers than with providing accurate, reliable compliance information. Explicitly redefining OSHA's mission towards compliance assistance will leverage employers' desire for safety and dramatically improve workplace safety and health. 
<p>
<li> Give first instance warnings for hazards that do not pose an imminent danger.<br>
OSHA continues its adversarial approach to standard setting and enforcement. Many employers are reluctant to call OSHA for assistance in making their workplaces safer for fear of triggering punitive inspections. First instance warnings will remove a major barrier to voluntary compliance.
<p>
<li>Require OSHA inspectors to have some expertise in the industry they are inspecting.<br>
OSHA inspectors are called upon to inspect a variety of workplaces, many of which, like mining, involve complex operations.48  Employers and employees deserve to have their workplaces inspected by qualified persons. 
<p></ul>
<b>Merge the Mine Safety and Health Administration with a reformed OSHA.</b>
<p>
Although OSHA and the MSHA were created separately, workplace injury and illness data no longer justify maintaining these agencies as separate entities with practically the same level of resources.49  Merging MSHA with a reformed OSHA and reallocating federal resources will accomplish two important objectives:  It will eliminate administrative overhead and duplicative costs and increase workplace health and safety in all industries.
<p><ul>
<li> Reforming the Mine Act to require only one inspection per year will enable MSHA to shift its inspection resources from mine operators with exemplary safety records to operators with poor safety records. By focusing on the "bad players," OSHA's new Mine Office will improve mine safety where it is needed most. Mine operators with good safety records will continue to have incentives to remain safe, in addition to fewer inspections and lower workers' compensation costs, and the new Mine Office will be able to use its resources more efficiently to focus on the "bad players."  Further, merging the two agencies will settle jurisdictional questions about enforcement and eliminate the memoranda of understanding that currently exist between OSHA and MSHA. Mine workers and taxpayers will get more mine safety for their hard-earned dollars.
<P>
<li> The Heritage Foundation estimates that consolidating MSHA and OSHA could save up to $510 million over five years.50  Merging MSHA and OSHA would eliminate the need to write two separate health regulations for the same workplace hazard, one for mining and one for everybody else. For example, there is no reason to have two separate Hazard Communication Standards, and noise protection for miners is no different from noise protection for other workers. Regional and administrative offices would be combined, and MSHA's Office of Information and Public Affairs could be eliminated.
<p></ul>
Merging MSHA with a reformed OSHA will not reduce workplace health and safety. No MSHA safety or health regulations would be abolished.51  Each underground mine will be inspected thoroughly at least once a year by qualified inspectors, and all workers will be able to request federal inspections if employers ignore their concerns about unsafe conditions. MSHA's imminent danger closure rule will be maintained, and mine workers finally will be covered by OSHA's health regulations. Focusing resources on compliance assistance will improve the ability of "good players" to translate OSHA and MSHA regulations into safer workplaces. Most important, by requiring only one mandatory inspection per year instead of four, a new OSHA/MSHA will be able to reallocate its resources to focus on improving the "bad players" instead of inspecting mines with good safety records.
<p>

<b>Establish the "new" OSHA as a separate sub-Cabinet agency that functions as a national safety and health standard-setting agency. </b>
<p>
Establishing health and safety compliance programs can be extremely costly and complicated. For employers operating in multiple states, where requirements vary from state to state, developing compliance programs can be almost impossible. There is no justification for different requirements in different states. The risk posed by certain hazards may vary from industry to industry and workplace to workplace, but not from state to state. Therefore, different states do not need different requirements. National workplace health and safety standards should be developed exclusively at the federal level.
<p>
National workplace health and safety standards are too important to be determined in a department that has been, and continues too be, subject to political influence. Independence and objectivity are crucial. The potential costs and benefits are too high for politics to play any role. The "new" OSHA should be a separate sub-Cabinet agency, similar to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. An independent governing and standards-setting board should be established. Its members would be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for staggered six-year terms. The board would be responsible for standards promulgation, oversight of a peer-review process, and issuance of compliance directives. It also would report its activities to Congress twice a year and be subject to congressional oversight hearings.
<p>
<b>IV. REFORM PRIVATE PENSION PROTECTION.</b>
<p>
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) was enacted in 1974 to protect the assets in employee pension plans that provide workers with retirement benefits promised by their employers. The Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration (PWBA) is the DoL agency that administers and enforces ERISA. ERISA protects the integrity of assets by requiring administrators of private pension and welfare plans52 to comply with strict fiduciary responsibility standards.53  It also requires administrators to provide participants with easily understood summaries of their plans, to file those summaries with PWBA, and to report annually on the financial operation of plans and the bonding of persons charged with handling funds and assets. Jurisdiction is shared by the PWBA, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). Generally, PWBA has authority over Title I of ERISA,54 the IRS has authority over Title II,55and PBGC has authority over Title IV.56
<p>
PWBA is responsible for overseeing 720,000 pension plans and 4.5 million health and welfare plans in the private sector. ERISA-covered private pension plans cover over 88 million working Americans and their dependents and hold approximately $2 trillion in assets. Over 100 million workers are covered by employer-sponsored health and welfare plans. Three-quarters of PWBA's $65 million budget and 582 FTEs (full-time equivalent employees) is dedicated to enforcement focused on compliance with fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA. PWBA audits plans and conducts criminal and civil investigations. In 1993, the government carried out 6,033 investigations. 
<p>
President Clinton proposed to increase PWBA's budget by 17.1 percent. The House recently voted to reduce PWBA's FY 1996 spending by 7.5 percent and the Senate Appropriations Committee approved a 5.2 percent reduction. The House budget bill also prohibits the Department of Labor from promoting economically targeted investments with respect to private pension plans covered by ERISA. It specifically prohibits both the implementation of last year's PWBA Interpretive Bulletin and the funding of any Economically Targeted Investment Clearinghouse. The Senate Appropriations Committee deleted this House provision.
<p>
The primary focus of ERISA legislation this year is health insurance reform. In the House, Representative Harris Fawell (R-IL) has introduced the ERISA Targeted Health Insurance Reform Act of 1995 (H.R. 995), which would provide for health insurance portability, increased participation, improved plan solvency, and other consumer protections for workers. Senator Kassebaum has introduced the Health Insurance Reform Act of 1995 (S. 1028), the provisions of which are a subset of H.R. 995. S. 1028 was approved by the Senate Labor Committee.
<p>
A few bills reforming ERISA's pension provisions have been introduced in Congress. The most comprehensive bill, the Pension Simplification Act of 1995 (H.R. 2037 and S. 1006), has been introduced by Representative Rob Portman (R-OH) and Senator David Pryor (D-AR). These identical bills would create alternative methods for satisfying nondiscrimination provisions, repeal the family aggregation provision, repeal 5-year income averaging for lump-sum distributions, repeal the $5,000 exclusion of employees' death benefits, simplify the method for taxing annuity distributions under certain employer plans, and target access to pension plans for small employers.
<p>
The House has passed H.R. 1594, introduced by Representative John Saxton (R-NJ), to place restrictions on the promotion of economically targeted investments in connection with employee benefit plans by the Department of Labor and other federal agencies. A similar bill (S. 774) has been introduced by Senator Connie Mack (R-FL).
<p><blockquote>
	Responsibility for the oversight of public and private retirement programs currently is spread across the Departments of Labor, Treasury, and Health and Human Services. Transferring PWBA to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) would lead to more efficient research and retirement policy coordination. Combining PWBA with HHS also would be a good first step toward privatizing Social Security.57
</blockquote><P>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Abolish the Economically Targeted Investment Clearinghouse.</b>
<p>
In 1994, DoL established the Economically Targeted Investment Clearinghouse (ETIC) to provide information on investment opportunities to pension plan managers. This program is DoL's way of encouraging pension plans to invest in areas of the economy that bureaucrats and politicians feel are underfinanced by private capital markets. It is misguided and jeopardizes the safety of pension plan assets.58  Tax dollars should not be used as another form of corporate welfare to market public investment choices to pension plan managers. If an investment, public or private, provides a good opportunity to pension plan managers, they will allocate plan funds accordingly. 
<p>
<b> Eliminate the Office of Inspector General's independent investigative authority.</b>
<p>
The experience and expertise for investigating fraud and abuse involving employee benefit plans reside in the PWBA. The existence of competing enforcement authorities within the DoL creates confusion and leads to duplication of effort. In recent years, PWBA has increased its efforts to bring criminal cases. As a result, PWBA investigators not only have expertise regarding how plans operate, but also know how to work criminal cases.
<p>
<b>Remove ESOPs from Title I (fiduciary standards) of ERISA.</b>
<p>
Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) are hybrid benefit plans with two often competing goals. They are designed to increase employee ownership in companies and thereby improve productivity. They also are treated as retirement plans, with participants allowed to defer taxes on the value of their stock until it is withdrawn at retirement. Although ESOPs are governed by ERISA's fiduciary rules, several tax code sections give them special treatment not available to other retirement plans. Because the nature and financing of ESOPs are not always compatible with ERISA's rules, PWBA has struggled to accommodate ESOPs under the rules without damaging the fiduciary requirements that generally work well for other retirement plans. The result has been confusing and complicated rulings and legal standards. Congressional intent clearly has been to foster employee ownership. Trying to incorporate ESOPs into an Act designed to protect retirement income will only undermine this goal.
<p>
<b>Transfer the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration to the Social Security Administration, spin off the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation as an independent sub-Cabinet agency, and begin exploring ways to privatize pension insurance. </b>
<p>
This would combine the agencies responsible for oversight of public and private retirement programs and result in more efficient research and retirement policy coordination. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is a semi-independent, wholly owned government corporation modeled after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and guided by a board of directors. Congress should fund the PBGC separately and begin exploring ways to privatize pension insurance.59 
<p>

<b> V. ELIMINATE OBSOLETE WORKPLACE STANDARDS.</b>
<p>
The Employment Standards Administration (ESA) administers and directs programs under a variety of federal labor laws and executive orders. The Wage and Hour Division: <p><ul>
<li>Administers and enforces federal minimum wage, overtime, and child labor provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act; 
<p>
<li>Determines prevailing wage rates for federal contracts subject to the Davis-Bacon and Service Contract Acts;
<p>
<li>Registers farm labor contractors and enforces worker protections of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act; and
<p>
<li> Enforces provisions and restrictions of the Employee Polygraph Protection Act. </ul>
<p>
The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs administers and enforces Executive Order 11246, as amended, which requires federal contractors and subcontractors to take affirmative action in hiring. The Office of Workers' Compensation Programs administers the three basic federal workers' compensation laws:  the Federal Employees Compensation Act, Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, and Black Lung Benefits Act.
<p>
Today's economy is fundamentally different from when most of America's major labor laws were passed. Labor market conditions and labor-management relations have changed, but America's labor laws have not. Workers are demanding more flexible hours, working conditions, and compensation packages than current laws and regulations allow. The heavy burden of outdated and restrictive workplace rules reduces job opportunities and real wages. The proliferation of mandated benefits and requirements now makes most small businesses think very carefully before hiring additional workers and is one of the forces leading employers to utilize part-time, temporary, and contract labor. 
<p>
The House of Representatives recently voted to reduce ESA's FY 1996 spending by 12.2 percent.60  The Senate Appropriations Committee has approved a 9.9 percent reduction. Both bills prohibit funding for implementation of President Clinton's executive order concerning the permanent replacement of striking workers by federal contractors, and the House plans to repeal both the Davis-Bacon and Service Contract Acts as part of the budget reconciliation process.
<p>
A number of bills to reform America's labor laws also have been introduced in Congress.61  The House recently passed the Teamwork for Employees and Management Act (H.R. 743) to allow employers to create employee involvement committees. A similar bill (S. 295) has been introduced in the Senate by Nancy Kassebaum.
<p>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Nullify Executive Order 11246, as amended, and all affirmative action provisions in federal law.</b>
<p>
Executive Order 11246, as amended,62 and its implementing regulations prohibit federal contractors from discriminating against employees or job applicants because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin and requires them to take affirmative action to ensure equal opportunity for protected groups. Contractors must develop a written plan covering each of their establishments that includes remedial steps to correct underutilization of available women and minorities.
<p>
Federal contractors and subcontractors already must comply with existing civil rights laws without the executive order. Laws requiring non-discrimination in employment are enforced through agencies at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of Justice. There are other, more equitable ways to expand employment opportunities for all Americans without requiring preferential hiring simply because individuals belong to certain groups. In addition, the regulations to implement Executive Order 11246 impose 20.4 million hours of paperwork (9,795 full-time, year-round workers) on federal contractors and subcontractors, the single largest DoL paperwork requirement.
<p>
A recent Supreme Court decision on affirmative action concluded that "the federal government can no longer make decisions based on the race of the individual except when there is a compelling governmental interest."63  Concurring, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote, "In my view, government can never have a 'compelling interest' in discriminating on the basis of race in order to 'make up' for past racial discrimination in the opposite direction."  Further, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote, "Government cannot make us equal; it can only recognize, respect, and protect us as equal before the law. That these programs may have been motivated, in part, by good intentions cannot provide refuge from the principle that under our Constitution, the government may not make distinctions on the basis of race."
<P>
<b>Repeal the Davis-Bacon and related Acts and the Service Contract Act.</b>
<p>
The Davis-Bacon Act was enacted during the Depression explicitly to prevent low-skilled nonunion workers -- chiefly blacks and Hispanics -- from competing for federally funded construction jobs.64  Unfortunately for these workers, it has succeeded. This year's budget process may be the only real opportunity to put an end to this Depression-era law that contributes to racial discrimination, needlessly costs taxpayers billions of dollars a year, stifles productivity, and subsidizes special interests. If only the facts were at issue, there would be no need for debate -- the Davis-Bacon Act would be repealed. However, repeal is threatened once again by intense pressure from special interests seeking to preserve their generous subsidies. Congress must withstand this pressure, act in the interests of all American workers, and repeal the Davis-Bacon Act. 
<p>
The Service Contract Act (SCA) artificially inflates the cost of federal service contracts by as much as $500 million per year and, like Davis-Bacon, creates an unfair barrier for many unskilled entry-level workers, who tend to be poor and minorities. DoL has long been criticized for the way it operates under this law. Despite two amendments,65 the SCA continues to suffer from statutory ambiguity, administrative problems, arbitrary requirements, and capricious enforcement.66  The General Accounting Office has recommended repealing the SCA because of DoL's "inability to administer the act efficiently and effectively" and because "it is impractical, in our opinion, to make 'prevailing wage' determinations under the act in a consistently equitable manner."67  Outdated by extensions of the Fair Labor Standards Act to service workers, the SCA has become an unnecessary and costly bureaucratic burden that should be repealed.
<p>
<b>Reform the Fair Labor Standards Act to allow employers to offer flexible schedule and compensation options.</b>
<p>
The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) was enacted to protect unskilled, low-pay workers. However, in today's economy where both parents likely are working, its rigid and inflexible provisions hurt more than help. The FLSA deprives workers of the right to order their daily lives on and off the job to meet the responsibilities of work and home. For example, under the FLSA a worker who wants to work 35 hours one week  in order to attend a child's parent-teacher conference, in exchange for working 45 hours the following week, either must forgo five hours of pay or have an employer willing to pay overtime the second week. Congress should extend to private workers the same freedom that federal employees have -- flextime -- and enable employers to offer flexible schedule and compensation options to their workers.68  
<p>
<b>Reform the National Labor Relations Act to remove restrictions on the ability for employers to create employee involvement structures.</b>
<p>
Employee involvement (EI) structures are a way to involve workers in business operations to improve productivity, safety, and customer service. Under current law, however, the only discussions of workplace issues that are clearly legal between employers and employees are those that occur in traditional collective bargaining arrangements. Employers can listen to their nonunion employees but cannot respond to their views without risking litigation and significant legal costs. Further, the Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations noted that the most legally vulnerable EI structures are "those that take a broader, more systemic approach to participation that the evidence suggests have the greatest long-term, positive effects on economic performance."69  Congress should reform the National Labor Relations Act to exempt EI structures formed to address issues of quality, productivity, safety, and customer service.  
<p>
<b>Transfer immigrant worker oversight and enforcement functions to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</b>
<p>
In the late 1940s, DoL's immigration responsibilities were transferred to the Department of Justice to consolidate federal immigration functions in the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Since then, the federal government has shifted some of its immigration responsibilities to employers70 and added new DoL enforcement requirements.71  Responsibility for immigration policy once again is fragmented. Transferring DoL's immigration functions to the INS would combine the responsibility for federal immigration programs in one agency and facilitate more efficient immigration policy coordination.
<p>
<b>Transfer any remaining ESA programs to more appropriate departments or sub-Cabinet agencies.</b>
<p>
Legal enforcement of the Fair Labor Standards Act should be transferred to the Justice Department. Responsibility for federal workers' compensation laws and black lung benefits -- both primarily health-related income assistance programs -- should be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services. Responsibility for all employment discrimination complaints should be consolidated in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
<p>
<b>VI. GIVE GREATER INDEPENDENCE TO THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS.</b><p>
The American statistical system is one of the most decentralized data-producing systems in the world. Eleven specifically statistical federal agencies spend more that $1 billion annually. Further, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has found more than 70 individual agencies spending more than $500,000 a year for statistical activities and estimates that the federal government spent at almost $2.7 billion in FY 1994 for statistical operations.72
<p>
The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is the primary federal data-gathering agency in the broad field of labor economics and prices. It has no enforcement or regulatory functions and operates somewhat independently from DoL. The BLS collects, processes, analyzes, and disseminates data relating to employment, unemployment, and other characteristics of the labor market. It also publishes data on consumer and producer prices and workplace health and safety. Most of the data are collected by voluntary surveys conducted by the BLS and the Bureau of the Census, or on a cooperative basis with state agencies.
<p>
Change is needed. The current structure of the federal statistical system is inefficient and ineffective.73  The problems with the U.S. statistical system result directly or indirectly from fragmentation across the federal government. The system has neither the advantages that come from centralization nor the efficiency that comes from strong coordination of a decentralized system. As currently organized, it will be hard-pressed to meet the data demands of a technologically advanced and increasingly global economy.
<p>
The House recently voted to reduce BLS spending for fiscal year 1996 by 1.3 percent. The Senate Appropriations Committee recently approved a 6.1 percent reduction. Both bills double the amount appropriated for revising the consumer price index (CPI).
<p>


What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Transfer the BLS into a new sub-Cabinet Bureau of National Statistics along with the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis.</b>
<p>
Consolidating the Census Bureau, the BLS, and the BEA in a centralized system is "the most effective solution to the problems of the federal statistical system."74  A new Bureau of National Statistics (BNS) would make it possible to develop and carry out a comprehensive, systematic effort to combine surveys and develop economies of scale. The BNS also would be in a better position to undertake the careful evaluation and research needed to make decisions about more efficient survey design and ways to eliminate duplication and reduce paperwork and data collection burdens. Incorporating the Bureau of Economic Analysis into the BNS is essential if the new bureau is to influence priorities for the broad array of statistical information required for the national income and product accounts. Reforming the system will assure a much better use of the tax dollars currently being spent on statistics.
<p>
Three major concerns need to be addressed. 
<p>
1) The BNS should be run by an independent Board of Directors, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate for a fixed term similar to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.
<p>
2) To ensure that the public's response to voluntary surveys is not jeopardized, the BNS should be given complete legal confidentiality for all information collection activity. Data sharing arrangements with other agencies, for statistical purposes only, could be maintained under carefully controlled procedures approved and administered by the BNS Board.
<p>
3) Any administrative savings should stay within the agency to improve the quality and quantity of the nation's statistical information. Providing accurate information to the public and their state and local representatives is an important function of the federal government. 
<p>
<b> VII. ELIMINATE THE OFFICE OF THE AMERICAN WORKPLACE.</b><p>
The Office of the American Workplace (OAW), created in 1993 by Secretarial Order, is responsible for administering and directing discretionary workplace programs that encourage the development of "high performance" workplaces.75  OAW also is responsible for administering statutory programs to certify employee protections of various federally sponsored transportation programs, overseeing the financial integrity and internal democracy of American labor unions, and assisting unions in improving their organizational and administrative effectiveness. Labor Secretary Robert Reich recently has assigned OAW the task of implementing President Clinton's executive order prohibiting the permanent replacement of striking workers by federal contractors. 
<p>
OAW carries out these functions through two offices:  the Office of Workplace Programs (OWP) and the Office of Labor-Management Standards (OLMS). In FY 1995, of OAW's total budget authority of $31.4 million and 400 employees, $7.4 million went to OWP and $24.0 million to OLMS. For FY 1996, the President requested $41.8 million, or 33 percent more. Both the House and the Senate Appropriations Committees have voted to eliminate OWP and transfer OLMS to DoL's Employment Standards Administration. 
<p>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Eliminate the Office of Workplace Programs. </b>
<P>
In addition to setting up a clearinghouse for information on high performance workplaces, OWP provides funds to unions to train labor leaders on what constitutes a high performance workplace. However well intentioned this may be, the federal government should not subsidize businesses and unions to teach them about the concept of "high performance" workplaces. This is more appropriately a function of business associations, chambers of commerce, and labor unions themselves. It is corporate and union welfare and should be eliminated.
<p>
<b>Eliminate the Office of Labor-Management Standards.</b>
<p>
Nor should American tax dollars subsidize unions to "assist" them in improving their organizational and administrative effectiveness. These functions should be eliminated, the number of full-time equivalent positions in OLMS should be reduced significantly, and OLMS field offices should be eliminated. The investigative and union oversight functions of the office should be transferred to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the Department of Justice.76
<p>
<b>Repeal Section 13(c) of the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964. </b>
<p>
Section 13(c) of the Urban Mass Transportation Administration Act of 1964 gives public transit the most restrictive labor environment in America. To receive federal funds, local public transit agencies must pay employees up to six years of severance pay if their jobs are eliminated as a result of efficiency improvements. No other workers enjoy such special privilege. Should public transit agencies pursue service improvements that lead to fewer workers, their mandated 13(c) liability can surpass the federal funds they receive.77  Although many local governments are trying to improve their public transportation systems through competitive contracting and allowing private sector suppliers to operate, Section 13(c) discourages or blocks these efforts. 
<p>
Section 13(c) also adds to public transit costs and discourages efficiency by giving labor unions special privileges. Before a public transit agency can receive a federal grant, DoL must certify that special protective arrangements for local transit workers have been made. DoL generally interprets this to require negotiation of special labor agreements between the public transit agency and its union.
<p>
Public transit agencies want desperately to improve service and lower costs. At the same time, however, unnecessarily high labor costs make them unable to withstand a long period without federal funding. Section 13(c) has created this "Catch 22" for most public transit authorities and should be repealed. 
<p>
<b> VIII. STREAMLINE DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT.</b><P>
The Departmental Management (DM) appropriation provides funding for a number of different programs that manage, set policy, and oversee its implementation at DoL. This includes the Office of the Secretary and Deputy Secretary, the Solicitor's office, the Bureau of International Labor Affairs, the Civil Rights office, and the Women's Bureau.
<P>
In FY 1995, DM's total budget authority was about $155 million and 2,548 employees. Over half the budget, $82 million, went to legal services and adjudication, and $26 million went to executive direction. For FY 1996, the President requested $173.1 million, or almost 12 percent more. The House recently voted to reduce DM spending for FY 1996 by 13.2 percent. The Senate Appropriations Committee recently approved a 7.6 percent reduction. The House substantially downsized the Bureau of International Labor Affairs, noting in its report that the bureau's activities are primarily discretionary and could be carried out by the Office of the Trade Representative or the State Department. 
<p>
What Congress Should Do:
<p>
<b>Eliminate the Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB), the Women's Bureau, the Civil Rights office, and the National Occupational Information Coordinating Committee. </b>
<p>
The Bureau of International Labor Affairs, Women's Bureau, Civil Rights office, and National Occupational Information Coordinating Committee either duplicate existing federal functions or perform unneeded functions. 
<p>
The Bureau of International Labor Affairs coordinates the Department's international responsibilities, including relations with international organizations, estimating the impact of trade proposals, and ensuring compliance with worker rights provisions in U.S. trade law. These functions duplicate those carried out by the U.S. Trade Representative, the Department of the Treasury, and the Department of State.
<p>
The purpose of the Women's Bureau is to promote "the welfare of wage earning women and [seek] to improve their working conditions, to increase their efficiency and to advance their opportunities for profitable employment."78  The mission of the Department of Labor, including the Secretary, is to promote the employment opportunities of all Americans. There is no need for a separate bureau devoted to women, just as there are none devoted to other minorities, such as African Americans, Native Americans, or Asian Americans. 
<p>
The Civil Rights office ensures compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as well as other regulatory nondiscrimination provisions in programs receiving financial assistance from DoL, and promotes equal opportunity in these programs and activities. It also makes sure that all Department of Labor employees and applicants are treated equally. There should not be a separate appropriation for this activity within the department. All agencies within DoL should ensure that their programs are carried out in a nondiscriminatory manner. Individuals who believe they have been discriminated against by the department can file complaints under existing laws enforced by the Justice Department and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
<p>
Despite what federal officials may think, the National Occupational Information Coordinating Committee is not a necessary federal function. After funding for job training is consolidated into state block grants, the states should be given the option of setting up their own committees, in the event they decide that such committees would be useful, and funding them out of their block grants.

<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
Today's economy is fundamentally different from when most of America's labor laws were passed. Labor market conditions and labor-management relations have changed, but U.S. labor laws have not. Workers are demanding more flexible hours, working conditions, and compensation packages than current laws and regulations allow. Further, proliferating workplace legislation and DoL regulations to enforce them present a significant barrier to the creation of businesses and jobs, as well as to increases in real wages. It is time for Congress to reform the administration and enforcement of America's labor laws, and this means a fundamental rethinking of both the Department of Labor and federal labor policy. 
<p>
The primary objectives of this reform should be to reduce excessive burdens on businesses and job creation while maintaining workplace health and safety and to improve labor market flexibility while maintaining basic employment protections. The best way to achieve these objectives is by closing down the agency as a Cabinet-level department. If the recommendations in this study are implemented, $10.5 billion can be saved for the taxpayer from 1996 to 2000.
<p>
	Cabinet-level status should be reserved only for departments that provide core national activities of the federal government. The Department of Labor does not fit this description. Administering unemployment insurance, three-quarters of DoL's budget, is a state function and should be devolved to the states as a first step toward privatization. Ineffective federal job training programs should be consolidated into state block grants and rigorously studied. OSHA should be significantly reformed, combined with MSHA, and set up as an independent sub-Cabinet agency free from political influence. America's statistics would be improved by combining the BLS with the Bureau of the Census as another sub-Cabinet agency. Obsolete, ineffective, and wasteful rules and programs should be repealed or closed down. What remains of the Department of Labor, less than 2 percent of its budget, then could be transferred to more appropriate Cabinet-level agencies like HHS, Treasury, and Justice. There is no reason for these remaining functions to be conducted by an independent department with Cabinet-level status.

The surtax was passed in 1976 to restore depleted state UI accounts and was supposed to expire in 1987. The surtax has been extended four times, primarily to fund extended benefit programs, since 1987 and now is supposed to expire in 1998.<p>

<li>    The balance in the Employment Security Administration Account will be $2.4 billion in September 1995. This is $1.01 billion more than the statutory limit. There is also a $7.4 billion balance in the Federal Unemployment Account that has been built up using surplus FUTA payroll taxes.<p>

This study concluded that extending the duration of UI benefits from six months to one year will increase the mean duration of unemployment by four to five weeks. Examples of federal programs that increase the duration of UI benefits are the Extended Benefits Program and Trade Adjustment Assistance.<p>
<li>    In today's economy, the primary purpose of the UI/ES system is to move workers whose jobs are permanently lost into new ones as quickly as possible.<p>
 <li>   Daniel S. Hamermesh, "New Estimates of the Incidence of Payroll Tax," <i>Southern Economic Journal</i>, Winter 1979. Research on the incidence of taxation generally has concluded that payroll taxes are borne predominantly, if not completely, by labor in the long run through lower real wages.<p>
<li>    Bruce D. Meyer, " Policy Lessons from the U.S. Unemployment Insurance Experiments," National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper No. 4197, October 1992. The willingness and ability of states to explore innovative ways to reduce UI duration is evident from the number of state UI experiments that have been wholly state funded. <p>
<li>   The actual gross FUTA tax rate is 6.2 percent. However, employers in states with federally approved UI programs (all 50 states) may credit 5.4 percent (90 percent FUTA offset) against the 6.2 percent tax rate, making the net FUTA tax rate 0.8 percent.<p>
 <li>   The 1992 amendment allowed states to trigger EB based on a certain percentage of total unemployment rate (TUR) instead of an adjusted insured unemployment rate (IUR). The IUR is computed by dividing the number of people claiming UI benefits by the number in jobs covered by UI. The TUR is the ratio of all unemployed workers to all workers in the labor force in that state. Eight states (Alaska, Connecticut, Kansas, Maine, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington) have approved the use of TUR triggers.<p>
<li>    Benefits generally are paid to workers with substantial labor force attachment who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own -- not to workers who quit their jobs voluntarily, who were fired for cause, or who have had no recent employment, such as those who are entering or reentering the labor force. Some of the difference between the insured unemployment rate and the total employment rate is due also to the exclusion of self-employed, certain agricultural labor and domestic service workers, railroad workers, and certain seasonal camp workers from collecting UI benefits.<p>
<li>    FUTA funds are deposited indirectly in the FUA when the EUCA and Employment Security Administration Account (ESAA) have reached their statutory limits. The ESAA is used to finance the administrative costs of the employment security program and should be phased out. Funds in the ESAA should be allocated to state UI accounts for the administration of state UI programs.<p>
<li>    <i>From Red Tape to Results</i>, p. 80.<p>
<li>   The TAA provides benefits to workers for 78 weeks, while the vast majority of other laid-off Americans, who qualify only for unemployment insurance, receive just 26 weeks of benefits.<p>
<li>    In its 1993 semiannual report to Congress, the Department of Labor Inspector General (OIG) discovered in a nine-state audit of the program that "After 19 years of operation, neither ETA nor the states know whether the TAA program is effective" in achieving its original goals of helping workers find suitable employment. The OIG found that only one in ten former participants "found new training-related employment that paid or had the potential to pay suitable wages."  Although the Act requires that participants enroll in approved training courses, " participants who did not wish to attend training were almost always granted waivers without losing entitlement allowance." <p>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
	"Ideas have consequences." This simple truism became the battle cry of the Reagan Revolution of the 1980s. But it was true long before Ronald Reagan's term in the White House, and it is no less true today. America still needs the ability to explain its policies and to educate people around the globe about American values and the principles of freedom. Because so many in the world yearn to enjoy the freedom which the United States represents, the world still needs desperately to hear America's voice. 
<p>
	Reconvening this week after the August recess, Members of Congress should remember that although ideas have consequences, they will be impotent and inconsequential if they cannot be heard in the global marketplace of ideas. Congress will soon complete work on appropriations bills that provide funds for foreign operations and international broadcasting. In its zeal to cut wasteful and unnecessary government spending, the Republican majority is poised to cripple the Voice of America, even though VOA is both America's primary means of conveying ideas and information overseas and a cost-effective and strategically effective component of U.S. foreign policy. 
<p>
	 The congressional raid on U.S. government international broadcasting is an unfortunate convergence between Members who believe foreign affairs accounts are politically attractive targets for budget slashing and the Clinton Administration, whose lack of a coherent foreign policy means, among other deficiencies, inadequate support for international broadcasting. As a result, the 104th Congress is about to reduce the Voice of America's budget by as much as $54 million, a small amount in terms of the federal budget, yet a cut which will have disproportionate, far-reaching consequences. It could silence America's most effective voice in the global marketplace of ideas, even though VOA's benefits -- potential and actual -- far exceed the modest amount in the Administration's FY 1996 budget request ($395 million).
<p>
	Before embarking upon a budget-cutting course that is penny-wise but pound-foolish, Congress needs to take a closer look at the vital role VOA plays in foreign policy and public diplomacy. Instead of subjecting VOA to a false economy, Congress should provide enough funds to ensure that it remains the nation's international broadcasting flagship.
<p>

<b>IDEAS FUEL DEMOCRACY AND FREE-MARKET REFORM</b>
<p>
Social scientists never tire of explaining that today is the Age of Information. Television is ubiquitous. The transistor has made cheap portable radios common even in the world's poorest nations. Multi-spectrum radio broadcasting, proliferating cable, satellite, and direct broadcast television, microwaves, computers and fax modems, and other means of high-speed transmission have linked the world as never before. In the modern world, information dissemination and content have become indispensable instruments of state power. 
<p>
	 Information is no longer neutral; it has "strategic" value, as recent history demonstrates. In the victory of America and the West over Soviet Communism, military power kept the "Evil Empire" contained. But it was ideas and information, not bombs and bullets, that ultimately brought the Soviet edifice crumbling down. 	
<p>
	 However, if it is technologically the Age of Information, politically it is the Age of Chaos. The end of the superpower condominium has unleashed potent new forces kept contained by 45 years of Cold War. Today sub-national, tribal, ethnic, and religious conflict are battering peace and stability in the world as new nations and new ideologies struggle to be born. In this dangerous and uncertain world the interests of the United States will be challenged in ways Americans cannot now imagine. The ability to convey ideas and information will remain a necessary component of American foreign policy. America must be able to shape the course of the world through a voice that encourages the forces of freedom and discredits the forces of oppression.
<p>
	Perhaps it is self-evident, but in this era of dramatic global change it bears repeating that human behavior is determined by what one believes. There is a flow to history and culture; and its wellspring is the inner life of the mind -- thoughts, attitudes, and beliefs, and the passions they engender. This is especially true of the corporate actions of men and women, such as political decisions. The results of their thoughts flow through their hands or from their tongues and into the external world. Why else do dictators expend such immense efforts to control the content and flow of information?. What is usually the first objective of a <i>coup d'etat</i>? The answer is obvious -- radio and television stations. 
<p>
	 It is important to remember that the VOA did not begin as a weapon of the Cold War or in response to Soviet Communism. It was launched in 1942 at the beginning of World War II to counter Nazi propaganda, to reassure America's allies, and to give hope to people struggling against tyranny. Today the Voice of America is the nation's sole worldwide broadcasting service, reaching 100 million regular listeners over a network of shortwave, AM, and FM stations in English and 46 other languages. During the Persian Gulf War, VOA was America's only means of rebutting Saddam Hussein's propaganda aimed at the people of Iraq and was a key voice in reaching the nations of the Allied coalition.
<p>
	 VOA told the peoples of Nazi-occupied Europe during the darkest days of World War II:. "The news may be good or bad. We will tell you the truth.". Today VOA still follows this mandate, as required under its Charter (Public Laws 94-350 and 103-415), which obliges VOA to provide "a consistently reliable source of news and information" based on accuracy, balance, comprehensiveness, and objectivity.
<p>
	The accuracy and objectivity of America's radio voice are having a profound impact on nations emerging from 45 years behind the Iron Curtain. The Open Media Research Institute surveyed 400 leaders in government and politics, the military, religion, higher education, media, and private enterprise in the former Soviet Union, including the Baltic States, and in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania. According to this survey approximately 18 percent of the elites of these nations are regular listeners to VOA programming. In the Baltics, over 40 percent of decision-makers interviewed were regular listeners. Nearly three-quarters of the respondents felt strongly that Western radio broadcasts were still needed despite the new freedoms enjoyed by their own news media.1<p>	The importance of getting America's message to the elites of emerging nations simply cannot be overstated. President Lech Walesa of Poland and President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic have publicly confirmed the role which America's international broadcasting, including the VOA, has played in building democracy in their countries. In Ukraine, VOA's "Window on America" is said to be the most popular radio program in the country.
<p>

	VOA's example of free, uncensored news and objective, balanced features encourages the development of a free press among the listening nations, even when the Voice presents a less than flattering portrait of America. The example is strengthened by VOA's policy of maintaining a clear distinction between editorials, which speak in the name of the U.S. government, and news programming. 
<p>

	 The Cold War with the Soviet Empire may be over, but a cold war of a global nature -- the struggle over which ideas legitimize human governance -- is not over. The ideals of representative and limited government, of free enterprise and free institutions, have prevailed for the time being over Marxism-Leninism in much of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, but by no means have they been accepted everywhere in the world. Most of the world's people still live under some sort of despotism or suffer from revolution and civil war.
<p>

	The VOA is America's force projection in this continuing global struggle between competing political principles and social values. The United States is under no obligation to convert the entire world to America's system of beliefs, but it is widely acknowledged that democratic nations are more peaceable and less likely to challenge U.S. interests than dictatorships. Both advocates of a foreign policy based on national self-interest and those who stress the moral component of foreign policy can support a vigorous, information-rich public diplomacy that makes the world friendlier and more compatible with American interests. As long as America can engage in this global cold war of ideas with information instead of military force, the struggle can remain "cold."
<p>

	Even the Kurds -- embattled on all sides and fighting among themselves -- believe the broadcast word is mightier than the sword in building an independent nation. Instead of using scarce resources to buy arms, Kurds are creating a London-based television service to beam Kurdish-language programming to Europe and the Middle East as a "better weapon to win a homeland" for their people.2 <p><b>INFORMATION AS A TOOL OF U.S. GLOBAL STRATEGY </b><p>Today's world contains rogue states and hostile nations whose main weapon is the well-disseminated lie -- lies about America's goals, interests, methods. To perpetuate themselves, these hostile regimes depend on propaganda, first to control their own populations and then to justify aggression abroad. It is an essential feature of modern dictatorships, one which they have in common despite differences in geography and culture, to consolidate power by controlling public opinion without having to answer to any traditional consensus or transcendent definition of right and wrong. 
<p>

	 Many Russians now freed from the yoke of Communism have remarked that the most hated feature of the Soviet regime was not the possibility of arrest and imprisonment in the Gulag, but the pervasive falsehoods that touched every aspect of life and tainted everything they touched. This kind of morally inverted society built on propaganda can be altered only through rebuttal by trustworthy, countervailing information over time. The only antidote to falsehood is truth, but truth is impotent unless America has the means to convey it into the domain of the lie.

	Today the threat of Soviet Communism has receded, only to be replaced by a new threat. By now it is universally acknowledged that revolutionary Islam represents one of the main challenges to democracy and American interests in the world -- not Islam <i>per se</i>, but the revolutionary movement which draws legitimacy from a militant and politicized interpretation of Islamic theology. 
<p>

	 The vast majority of the world's Muslims are not part of radical movements. Indeed, the governments of moderate and friendly Muslim countries are the primary targets of Islamic radicals. Today revolutionary Islamic regimes have ample money and access to the latest information technology. In this global contest for hearts and minds, VOA is the most potent means America has to combat the rising tide of a revolutionary ideology in which Mohammed has replaced Marx. 
<p>

	 Muslim revolutionaries realize the value of information as a tool of their strategy. Radio Tehran broadcasts daily in 23 languages, in English and European languages as well as languages native to the Middle East and the Muslim regions of the former Soviet Union. Significantly, Radio Tehran broadcasts in Serbo-Croatian to Bosnia, constantly reinforcing the theme throughout all of its coverage area that the United States is the faithless enemy of Islam and that America has imperialist designs on the Persian Gulf and the oil-rich Middle East. Though these charges are false, there are enough points of reference in the message to make it plausible to Tehran's audience and give the falsehood a political impact. 
<p>
	 VOA's daily presence through its Arabic and Farsi services is balancing the picture and countering Iran's daily radio diet of anti-Western propaganda. VOA's 100-kilowatt AM transmitter in Kuwait will be upgraded to begin transmitting next year at 600 kilowatts and will reach all of Iraq and most of Iran, where the Voice already has an 11 percent listenership. America's message to Iran also sustains hope among those who suffer persecution at the hands of the mullahs, like members of the Baha'i and Christian faiths. In this part of the world where America has had to fight to defend its vital interests, VOA gives an accurate picture of a free society which respects all religions and treats Islam respectfully, reporting, for example, that Islam is the fastest-growing religion in the United States. 
<p>

	In the Balkans, VOA's shortwave and medium-wave AM stations around the periphery of the zone of conflict provide a thorough blanket of coverage. Broadcasting three hours a day in Serbian and one hour daily in Croatian, VOA is the largest international broadcaster in the region and enjoys a 32 percent listenership in Sarajevo. It also broadcasts in Albanian to Kosovo, another potential flashpoint in the Balkans. 
<p>

	The recent NATO air strikes against Serbs in Bosnia provoked bitter denunciations in Belgrade and in Serb-controlled Bosnia. In Moscow the NATO air campaign against Russia's traditional allies also prompted vocal condemnation. With their tight control of news media, Yugoslav and Bosnian Serb leaders stir up ethnic hatred and keep violent passions high. They black out all information about Serb atrocities and war crimes charges in the West. Disinformation and falsehoods are a major part of their overall strategy. Without the VOA there would be no voice explaining U.S. and Allied actions to the people most involved or rebutting the false charges the Serbs use to legitimize their aggression.
<p>

	VOA recently began a refugee hotline as part of the Serbo-Croatian service. It offers broadcast facilities to reach separated family members in the Balkans, who can call a VOA telephone number and leave a message on the Serbo-Croatian line. VOA then broadcasts the message to reach separated family members. Numerous families have been reunited through this service. 
<p>

	This is more than a humanitarian gesture, one whose exact value is impossible to quantify. If American soldiers ever have to enter Bosnia, for example, as part of a NATO operation to cover the withdrawal of the U.N. Protection Force, America may find out how much it is worth. It is conceivable that the goodwill engendered by this service will save American lives if that day does come.
<p>
	In another volatile region of the world, VOA is broadcasting in Korean to counter the propaganda of the Stalinist North on the Korean Peninsula. In China, VOA is America's link to the most populous nation in the world. China's emergence as a global power and America's relations with the Chinese will be among the defining issues in the 21st century and will affect the future structure of world politics. It is absolutely essential for the U.S. to maintain an active presence there. The audience for VOA's Mandarin service has grown to include 70 percent of China's college students since the 1989 massacre in Tiananmen Square. Such programs as the "Harry Wu Watch," after the arrest of the human rights activist, and "China Forum" generate more than 4,000 faxes and letters to VOA per month from Chinese listeners. 
<p>

	VOA's Tibetan service recently expanded its broadcasts from a half hour to two hours a day. It is the only independent news source for the Tibetan-speaking areas of the world. In fact, the communist regime in Beijing devotes considerable efforts to jamming the VOA's Chinese and Tibetan broadcasts. Devoting scarce resources to jamming attests eloquently to VOA's effectiveness.
<p>

	In Myanmar, better known as Burma, the democratic opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi recently was freed by the ruling military junta after nearly six years of house arrest. The only reliable sources of this news were the VOA's Burmese language service and the BBC. 
<p>

<b>Surrogate Radios</b>
<p>

In evaluating the role of broadcasting in global strategy, it is important to distinguish between the VOA and the so-called surrogate radios -- Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), Radio Free Asia, and Radio Mart, which broadcasts to Cuba. The mission of the surrogate radio services is to tell listeners what is happening in their own country, to provide information which their own radios would provide if their countries were free. This difference in missions is a matter of U.S. law. The surrogates also have a vital mission, but they do not explain or defend U.S. government policy; nor do they present U.S. values and institutions. That mission is unique to VOA. 
<p>

	 Under the International Broadcasting Act of 1994, federal funding for RFE/RL will end after 1999. And when Fidel Castro's grip on his island prison ends, as it inevitably must, federal funding for the Office of Cuban Broadcasting and Radio Mart probably will end. But there still will be a need for VOA to perform its role as America's voice to the world. 
<p>

	 Ultimately, no information strategy can be a substitute for adequate military power. Force of arms will always be the final argument when nothing else suffices. But it is far better to shape the world's events in advance, if possible, through "soft" means like information. Using broadcasting successfully as a tool of global strategy can create conditions of friendship and convergence of interests that make conflict unnecessary and give America options other than the last resort of armed force. 
<p>


<b>MYTHS ABOUT THE VOA AND U.S. GOVERNMENT BROADCASTING</b>
<P>
Critics of the U.S. government's international broadcasting programs propagate five myths to justify public neglect of the VOA or reduction of its resources.
<p>

<ul>
<li><b>Myth #1: The VOA can be privatized.</b>
<p>
The VOA provides both a means of public diplomacy to promote America's values to the rest of the world and an official voice for the U.S. government to explain and defend its policies. In other words, VOA is an instrument of policy, not just a source of entertainment. Private entities simply cannot carry out this function. Moreover, the VOA's network of facilities is extensive, operating in many remote corners of the world. It is inconceivable that private operations would have the inclination, resources, expertise, or profit-making incentive to take over such an extensive network. In the 1980s the U.S. government invested heavily to upgrade the facilities for international broadcasting. It would be a waste of that investment to curtail VOA's scope just when the return on that investment is beginning to be realized.
<P>

<b><li>Myth #2:. We have CNN and do not need the VOA.</b>
<p>
CNN does not reach an audience as wide, diverse, and strategically targeted as VOA's --. in their own languages. CNN does not provide the same content or policy-significant information; nor does it adequately explain or defend the positions of the United States. In fact, CNN's popular "World Report" program actually does the reverse. Its correspondents feed policy-significant information from foreign governments to the U.S. and other audiences.
<p>
<li><b>Myth #3: The Cold War is over, so the VOA is unnecessary.</b>
<p>
Those who make this assertion have a fundamental misunderstanding of the difference between VOA and the surrogate radios like Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Mart, which are products of the Cold War. VOA is more necessary than ever to give America a voice in the highly competitive global marketplace where the struggle for democracy and freedom is still being waged. Other nations, many unfriendly to America, are speaking effectively into this marketplace. The revolutionary regime of Iran is a notable example. Why should America now choose not to engage in this vital war of ideas?
<p>

<li><b>Myth #4: Government broadcasting has plenty of fat; all government broadcasting should be cut.</b>
<p>
Since 1992 VOA has reduced its broadcast staff by 25 percent, cut direct broadcast hours from 1,080 to 850 hours weekly, abolished or converted numerous language services, eliminated 14 senior management positions, and cut 170 other line positions to meet mandated budget reductions. VOA is now at a core operating level. Any further cuts will force VOA to eliminate entire language services to critical world regions.
</ul><p>
It can be argued that the need for surrogate radios will diminish over time if and when democracy, accompanied by freedom of information, takes hold in existing dictatorships and formerly totalitarian countries. But VOA needs to stabilize at a funding level commensurate with its vital mission, and not be subjected to further cuts. As stated in a recent Wall Street Journal editorial, "If Congress wants to cut federal broadcasting, the better target is domestic public TV, for which a multitude of commercial alternatives do exist."3 <p><b>EFFECTIVE BROADCASTING REQUIRES ADEQUATE FUNDS</b>
<p>
	The Administration's FY 1996 budget request for VOA is $395 million. But VOA faces a $10 million reduction from the 1996 request mandated by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the State Department authorization bill. 
<p>
	The Foreign Relations Committee report accompanying the authorization bill acknowledges that budget authority for international broadcasting (not counting the separate radio facilities construction account) in the Foreign Relations Revitalization Act of 1995 is 21 percent below the operating level in 1994 ($487 million). In other words, VOA already is operating at the margins because the agency chose to absorb past funding cuts by reducing staff and broadcast hours across the board in order to keep critical language services on the air. 
<p>
	If Senate appropriators agree to the $385 million recommended by the Foreign Relations Committee, VOA will have to reduce direct broadcasting from 850 to 715 hours per week, eliminate another four language services, and end all shortwave transmissions to Latin America.
<p>
	The situation on the House side is even more bleak. The House Appropriations Committee marked up its State Department appropriations bill before the August recess, providing $341 million, or $54 million below the FY 1996 budget request. The committee's report acknowledges that a cut of this magnitude "could mean a reduction of at least 400 personnel, and the possible cessation of broadcasting in as many as 20 languages. These reductions come on top of the major reorganization/downsizing that occurred because of the 1994 Act (the International Broadcasting Act of 1994), which has resulted in staffing reductions of 900 at RFE/RL and 350 at VOA."
<p>
	If outlays fall to this level, the VOA in effect will cease to be a global broadcaster. America's voice will fall silent in vital corners of the globe as VOA scales down to a narrow regional focus, like Radio Australia or Radio Netherlands. 
<p>
	A cut of this magnitude will allow only 535 hours of weekly broadcasting in about 20 languages, with greatly diminished English transmissions in three of six key global regions. VOA would lose about half of its estimated direct broadcast global audience. 
<p>
	As it completes work on the State Department appropriations bill, Congress should keep in mind that the Clinton Administration's FY 1996 budget request for international broadcasting was inadequate from the start and represents a substantial cut from prior year operating levels. At a bare minimum, House and Senate appropriators should fund the VOA at the $385 million recommended by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
VOA embodies the importance of democratic culture and shared values, not just raw economic interests or military power, as a basis for international relations. America has a natural advantage in promoting U.S. interests and values in the world, unlike dictatorships which have to lie, since most people aspire to the values America represents. 
<p>
	The importance of moral leadership in the world by precept, by reasoning, and by sharing information is vital. It enables America to shape the world without having to use heavy-handed, intrusive means. Broadcasting America's values and views to 100 million people in critical areas of the globe for $395 million per year is money well spent, and a bargain at the price. To cut VOA further is indeed, in the words of VOA Director Geoffrey Cowan, the unilateral disarmament of the Information Age.
