<p>

&quot;<font size=+3>T</font>he Defense of Marriage Act is a powerful 
antidote to the destructive trend that has gripped this country at the 
hands of some injudicious judges.&quot; -- Gary Bauer, FRC president, 
before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on July 11, 1996.

<p>

On July 12, the House of Representatives approved the Defense
of Marriage Act (DOMA) by an overwhelming vote of 342 to 67.
The bill defines marriage for federal purposes as &quot;the union
of a man and a woman as husband and wife.&quot;  It also asserts
the power of Congress to interpret the Full Faith and Credit Clause
of the Constitution to protect the other 49 states if Hawaii legalizes
homosexual &quot;marriage&quot; as expected later this year.

<p>

<center><h3>Senate Action Soon</h3></center>

<p>

As of press time, DOMA was slated for Senate action before the
August 3 recess.  Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) has threatened
to attach an amendment to the bill that would grant homosexuals
special workplace protection.  This could kill DOMA, since the
Kennedy amendment is an unacceptable, back-door way of enacting
federal gay rights legislation.  Calls are needed to Capitol Hill
to urge legislators to &quot;pass DOMA pure.&quot;

<p>

The swift consideration of DOMA is testament to the hard work
of thousands of pro-family activists who have pressed Congress
to act.  FRC's government relations staff report that Capitol
Hill has been inundated with calls and letters supporting DOMA.

<p>

On June 24, leaders of 11 state family policy councils allied
with FRC and Focus on the Family spoke in support of DOMA at a
Washington press conference that drew national and regional press
coverage.

<center><i><font size=+2>
"URGE LEGISLATORS TO<br>
PASS DOMA PURE"
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

On July 3, FRC hosted a Capitol Hill briefing on DOMA with eight
experts who analyzed the faulty research on homosexuality and
addressed the importance of traditional marriage in law, culture,
education and adoption.  Speakers included author Dr. Jeffrey
Satinover,  Transformation Ex-Gay Ministry leader Anthony Falzarano,
Amherst Professor of Jurisprudence Hadley Arkes, FRC cultural
studies director Robert Knight, social work specialist Brenda
Destro, adoption expert Mary Beth Style, former school principal
and author Linda Page, journalist Peter LaBarbera, and Gary Bauer.

<p>

<center><h3>Briefing Highlights</h3></center>

<p>

The two-hour briefing ran live on C-SPAN, which repeated it three
times during the next two days.  Millions of Americans learned
facts about homosexuality and the homosexual political agenda
that are routinely omitted from media coverage.  Here are some
excerpts:

<p>

<b>Jeffrey Satinover, M.D.</b>, former Fellow in Psychiatry and Child
Psychiatry at Yale:  &quot;Two profoundly mistaken ideas have
sunk deeply into public sentiment where they exert a powerful
influence in the shaping of public policy as it relates to family,
sexuality and marriage.  1) Homosexuality is genetic, and that
consequently, 2) Homosexuality is unchangeable.  Neither idea
is true, and in fact there is a mountain of scientific evidence
to the contrary.&quot;

<p>

<b>Hadley Arkes</b>: &quot;Every argument for gay marriage is an argument
that would support polygamy.  The gay activists may not have the
remotest interest in promoting polygamy, but ... they have the
most profound interest...in discrediting the notion that marriage
finds its defining ground in 'nature.'  We can count on the fact
that there will be someone, somewhere, ready to press this issue
by raising a challenge in the court....&quot;

<p>

Anthony Falzarano: &quot;I speak to you today not just as an
observer of this movement, but as one of them.  I am a former
homosexual.  I lived that lifestyle from the time I was 17 until
I was 26.  I entered the gay lifestyle thinking that there really
wasn't any choice for me.  What I didn't realize is that although
I didn't choose to be homosexual, I did not have to be gay.  I
had a choice.... Many of us are sick and tired of a lifestyle
that initially seems very freeing but eventually puts us in all
kinds of bondage and eventually will kill us....&quot;

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>Bill Emerson, RIP.</b>  A strong champion of the sanctity of
life and the family, Rep. Bill Emerson (Mo.) died of cancer June
22.  Emerson was universally admired by his colleagues and popular
with his constituents.  His public career was sparked by service
as a Congressional page at age 16.  The flag-waving families who
lined his funeral route and the members of Congress who paid him
tearful tribute during a July 12 memorial service offered praise
to his memory.  Emerson's quiet service was marked with integrity
and devotion.

<p>

<b>Istook Tries.</b> On July 11, the House passed the 1997 funding
bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and
Education. Defeated: a pro-family amendment offered by Rep.
Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) that would have required written parental
consent before a teenager receives any services, including abortion
referrals, under the Title X federal family planning program.
The House also defeated an attempt by Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.)
that would have allowed federally-funded human embryo experiments.
Current law prohibits such research on live human embryos.

<p>

<b>Unaccountable.</b> The House and Senate passed separate health
reform bills last spring with bipartisan support, yet no compromise
has been reached.  Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) has been holding
the bill hostage by refusing to let the Senate leadership appoint
conferees.  Kennedy opposes medical savings accounts (MSAs), which
were contained in the House bill but narrowly defeated by the
Senate.  He has vowed to continue stalling until the leadership
appoints a majority of conferees opposed to MSAs. If Kennedy
succeeds, much-needed reforms (in access and ability to keep insurance
when changing jobs) will go by the boards.

<p>

<b>Jubilee Pits.</b> &quot;Come, Holy Spirit&quot; -- with those
words, Rep. Bob Dornan (R-Calif.) took the floor of Congress on
June 27 and defended his Christian faith, biblical sexual morality,
and FRC's role in exposing the homosexual &quot;circuit&quot;
party in a federal building in April. Dornan made the remarks
in response to a personal attack by fellow Rep. Steve Gunderson
(R-Wis.).  For a full transcript of Rep. Dornan's remarks as they
were printed in the <I>Congressional Record</I>, call 1-800-225-4008.

<p>

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p><a name="fdabortion">

<b>FDA Variety Store.</b> In a highly unusual move, the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) Reproductive Drug Advisory Committee
initiated hearings on two new abortion drugs -- hearings not solicited
by a drug manufacturer.  On June 28, the FDA committee decided
that increased dosages of oral contraceptives were &quot;safe&quot;
and &quot;effective&quot; for use as an abortifacient &quot;morning-after
pill.&quot;  Pro-abortion groups urged the FDA to force reluctant
manufacturers to relabel oral contraceptives for post-coital use.
On July 19, the same FDA committee considered approving RU-486
for use in the US.  FRC attended both hearings and  publicly opposed
both FDA actions.

<p>

<b>China MFN.</b> The Clinton administration prevailed in renewing
China's &quot;most favored nation&quot; (MFN) trade status for
the coming year.  On June 27, an effort to revoke China's MFN
status failed in the House of Representatives by vote of 141 to
286.  However, the House did pass a second, non-binding resolution
(H. Res. 461 by vote of 411 to 7) which called for hearings and
possible legislation to punish China for its military intimidation
of Taiwan, weapons sales, and human rights abuses.  FRC supports
hearings and opposes MFN for China because of its myriad human
rights abuses.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Five-ring Political Circus.</b> The 1996 Olympics in Atlanta
were, sadly, misused to advance the homosexual agenda.  The Olympic
torch run bypassed Cobb County, Georgia, and Greenville County,
South Carolina, because officials there passed resolutions opposing
homosexuality.  The torch was actually hidden in a van and driven
through Greenville County during the night.  Meanwhile, the Clinton
administration lifted the ban on HIV-infected immigrants for the
Olympics, just as was done earlier for the Gay Games in New York.
It's not known whether other infectious diseases got equal opportunity.

<p>

<b>First Advocate.</b> In a first-ever presidential interview
with a homosexual magazine, President Clinton told <I>The Advocate</I>
(June 25) that his administration &quot;has taken more steps than
any previous in bringing the gay and lesbian communities to the
table.&quot;  Los Angeles-based Liberation Publications, which
publishes <I>The Advocate</I>, also owns Alyson Publications,
a Boston-based publisher of <I>Heather Has Two Mommies, Daddy's
Roommate, Daddy's Wedding</I> and books about sado-masochistic
sex with children.  One book gives advice for homosexual pedophiles
on how to avoid prosecution.

<p><a name="marijuana">

<b>MUM's Not the Word.</b> California's &quot;Medical Use of
Marijuana&quot; initiative will appear on the November ballot.
International &quot;decriminalization&quot; promoters who have
bankrolled this initiative claim it will provide &quot;compassionate
use&quot; of marijuana without prescription for people with cancer,
AIDS and glaucoma, but the initiative allows use for &quot;any
other illness&quot; and would virtually legalize possession and
cultivation for anyone, including children.  The federal government
rejects smoking marijuana as a medicine because it has serious
physical and psychological consequences.  Physicians wishing to
prescribe THC, marijuana's active ingredient, have the FDA-approved
drug Marinol.

<h3>FRC: Ready and <i>Abel</i></h3>

<p>

The Supreme Court will decide this September whether to hear the
first challenge to the Pentagon's new ban on homosexuals in the
military.  This appeal was prompted by the high court's recent
ruling that Colorado cannot constitutionally bar &quot;special
rights&quot; laws for homosexuals.

<p>

On July 1, 1996, former Navy Lieutenant Paul Thomasson, who was
discharged for proclaiming, &quot;I am gay,&quot; asked the high
court to hear his case.  He challenged both the law passed by
Congress and the Clinton administration's regulations on homosexuality
in the armed forces.

<p>

Thomasson lost his challenge in both the federal district and
appeals courts.  The appeals court hearing was noteworthy because
it included oral argument presented on behalf of the Family Research
Council.  FRC had filed two briefs in this case, both of which
thoroughly exposed the administration's illegal plans to use the
military to legitimize homosexuality.

<p>

Thomasson's attorney said his appeal decision was influenced by
the high court's <I>Romer v. Evans</I> ruling, which struck
down Colorado's &quot;special rights&quot; amendment.  He claims
that the judicial landscape has improved greatly with <I>Romer</I>.
Writing for the Supreme Court's minority in the <I>Romer</I>
decision, Justice Antonin Scalia said there is &quot;no foundation
in American constitutional law&quot; for the court's ruling.

<p>

It's expected the Clinton Justice Department will favor the appeal
request.  If the court accepts <I>Thomasson</I>, oral arguments
will likely be held this fall with a decision next spring.  The
military's ban should be upheld -- if the Supreme Court relies
on the constitution.

<p>

FRC's Military Readiness Project (MRP) has participated in 12
homosexual court cases so far.  Should the <I>Thomasson</I> case
be heard, the MRP will file an amicus brief and ask the high court
for time to make oral argument.

<p>

Meanwhile, also on July 1, 1996, the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit returned the <I>Abel et al. v. Perry</I> case
to federal district court directing that judge to determine whether
the military can constitutionally exclude soldiers who engage
in homosexual conduct.  The lower court previously ruled that
the First and Fifth Amendment rights of the six service members
in <I>Abel</I> were violated when the military sought to discharge
them based solely on their <I>admission</I> of homosexuality,
without regard to actual conduct.

<h3>Ban the Postcards!</h3>

<p>

The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act passed the House of Representatives
and the Senate and was vetoed by President Clinton on April 10,
1996.  The House will first attempt to override the President's
veto shortly after Labor Day. A two-thirds majority of those
present and voting is required to override.  If the House vote
is successful, the Senate is expected to make an override attempt
shortly thereafter. These are crucial pro-life votes.

<p>

On June 29-30, the nation's Catholic bishops sponsored a massive
pro-life postcard campaign (in local churches) to members of Congress
to urge support for the override.  It is expected that millions
of postcards will flood Capitol Hill in the next month or two.
The House Post Office has reportedly hired extra workers to deal
with the heavy influx of cards.

<p>

The Clinton White House is not waiting for the cards to react,
however. Administration officials at the Pentagon attempted to 
silence Catholic chaplains on military bases by issuing a directive 
forbidding them to mention the postcard campaign in church. They 
claimed it involved &quot;partisan political activity,&quot; a 
claim belied by the fact that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban was 
passed overwhelmingly by bipartisan majorities in both houses of 
Congress.  Many Catholic service members and their families believe 
that they were illegally denied the guidance of their priests and 
bishops on this vital issue. A legal defense fund which specializes 
in religious liberty cases is reportedly planning to file suit on 
behalf of military chaplains who believe that their First Amendment 
rights were violated.

<p>

FRC urges concerned citizens to call on their legislators to override
the veto by talking with them personally, especially at local
&quot;town meetings&quot; during the August congressional recess.
Calls and/or letters to the members' district offices are also
encouraged.  Please continue to educate your friends and neighbors
about partial-birth abortions by writing &quot;letters to the
editor&quot; to local newspapers, participating in radio talk
shows, etc.

<center>
<font size=+2><b><i>The Court's Conscientious Dissenter</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer
</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>J</font>ustice Antonin Scalia is making a name for himself 
as a conscientious objector to a Supreme Court run amok.  He is heard 
most often from the dissenting side these days, frequently accompanied 
by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Associate Justice Clarence Thomas.
His dissents are noteworthy -- some would say notorious.  Justice
Scalia has an uncanny knack for cutting through the majority's
sophistry and sloppy self-justification to make a stunning legal
defense of American tradition, true democracy, plain old common
sense and decency.

<p>

Scalia shines the light of truth on &quot;this most illiberal
Court, which has embarked on a course of inscribing one after
another of the current preferences of the society (and in some
cases only the counter-majoritarian preferences of the society's
law trained elite) into our Basic Law.&quot;  He believes that
it is &quot;no business of the courts (as opposed to the political
branches) to take sides in the cultural war.&quot;  We at FRC
believe the same, and Scalia's measured umbrage is our vicarious
voice.

<p>

In response to special rights gained by the well-funded gay lobby
in several Colorado cities, voters across the state approved a
constitutional amendment that would prevent any person from getting
such legal privileges solely on the basis of their homosexuality.
The Court majority said that the amendment was unconstitutional
because it was obviously born of hatred against gays, despite
what the Coloradans say.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>
THE COURT UNASHAMEDLY<br>
OVERSTEPS ITS AUTHORITY.
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

Scalia retorted that &quot;[t]he Court's portrayal of Coloradans
as a society fallen victim to pointless, hate-filled 'gay-bashing'
is so false as to be comical.&quot;  He also deplored the sinister
effect of the Court's &quot;verbally disparaging as bigotry adherence
to traditional attitudes.&quot;  Scalia charged the majority with
&quot;tak[ing] sides in the culture wars,&quot; specifically,
choosing &quot;the views and values of the lawyer class from which
the Court's Members are drawn&quot; and supporting this choice
&quot;by inventing a novel and extravagant constitutional doctrine.&quot;

<p>

The Court unashamedly overstepped its authority, he wrote: &quot;Amendment
2 is designed to prevent piecemeal deterioration of the sexual
morality favored by a majority of Coloradans, and is not only
an appropriate means to that legitimate end, but a means that
Americans have employed before.  Striking it down is an act, not
of judicial judgment, but of political will.&quot;

<p>

Scalia took up his pen again in the case challenging the male-only
admissions policy at the Virginia Military Institute:  &quot;Since
it is entirely clear that the Constitution of the United States
-- the old one -- takes no sides in this educational debate, I
dissent....Today the Court shuts down an institution that has
served the people of the Commonwealth of Virginia with pride and
distinction for over a century and a half.&quot;  To do that,
it &quot;sweeps aside the precedents of this Court, and ignores
the history of our people.&quot;

<p>

In one of the last cases of the term, Justice Scalia rhetorically
shook his head: &quot;The court must be living in another world.
Day by day, case by case, it is busy designing a Constitution
for a country I do not recognize.&quot;

<p>

Those are stark words from the bench, words befitting the steady
dismantling of legislative prerogatives today's &quot;conservative&quot;
Supreme Court is engaged in.  But Scalia is no doomsayer.  A recent
report of a celebration of his first 10 years on the bench with
his present and former law clerks noted that, despite his angry
dissents, Justice Scalia is a happy man with a sense of hope.
Apparently he knows, as we know, that ours is not in the winning,
but in the trying.

<a name="budget"><center><h1>KEEPING BUDGET<br>
REFORM ON TRACK</h1></center>
<font size=+3>W</font>hite House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta and Senior Counselor
George Stephanopoulos know the drill well. They are using today
the same tactics they employed in 1990 when they successfully
maneuvered President George Bush into breaking his &quot;no new
taxes&quot; pledge. Today, they decry &quot;a train wreck&quot;
they say will occur if Congress makes spending cuts stick. 
<p>
First, some background. The U.S. Government will begin the 1996
Fiscal Year October 1.  Congress has spent the last nine months
paring down Clinton budget requests, eliminating billions in future
wasteful spending, and pushing for a balanced budget by 2002.
<p>
House Republicans earlier this year passed a FY 1996 budget resolution
that calls for a balanced budget by FY 2002.  They tried to cut
federal taxes by $354 billion over the same seven-year period,
but Senate liberals limited tax relief to  $245 billion. Clinton
and his  congressional supporters vigorously denounced both the
proposed tax cuts and the 2002 balanced budget target. 
<p>
<center><h3>Media's False Picture</h3></center>
<p>
Journalists describe the major difference between Congress and
the president as a dispute over whether to balance the budget
in a seven-year or ten-year period.  However, the Congressional
Budget Office's (CBO) analysis of Clinton's  proposed budget found
a $209 billion shortfall in the year 2005 -- the very year that
he claims to achieve a balanced budget.  His ten-year proposal
also produces <i>$2 trillion in new federal debt</i>.
<p>
Liberal critics of the GOP budget plan attack the tax cuts, claiming
that they favor the rich or that they will gouge Medicare.  They
claim the tax cuts will &quot;explode the deficit,.&quot;  But
more than half (55 percent) of the House-passed tax relief is
dedicated to the $500-per-child tax credit.  And approximately
three-quarters of this tax credit is slated to go to families
with incomes less than $75,000;  nearly five million families
at the lowest levels will be freed from federal income taxes.
Senate GOP leaders have strongly suggested that the final composition
of the tax package will be very &quot;family friendly.&quot;
<p>
Conservatives see savings in the cuts in discretionary spending
programs and welfare reform.  They also note that Medicare spending
is projected to <i>increase at twice the rate of inflation</i>
even as reforms are instituted to restrain the rate of growth.
 The argument that tax cuts &quot;explode the deficit&quot; is
answered by pointing out that <i>tax revenues</i> actually increased
by more than the rate of inflation during the 1980s.  If spending
increases had been held to the rate of inflation, we'd have a
budget surplus today. 
<p>
Not a penny can be spent unless both houses approve. This gives
the GOP tremendous leverage to set conditions on the use of taxpayers'
money. Funding battles are also battles over abortion, federal
subsidies for pornographic art, the gay agenda and liberal legal
activism. Congress has an obligation to use its &quot;power of
the purse&quot; to protect the legitimate interests of the American
family.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>BUDGET "TRAIN WRECK"<br>
WON'T HAMPER ESSENTIAL<br>
SERVICES</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><h3>A Contest of Wills</h3></center>
<p>
Who will blink first, Bill Clinton or Congress?  Both sides may get
through October by short-term "continuing resolutions," but by early November,
the Treasury's authority to borrow money will expire.
 Congress can then apply conditions to legislation to raise the debt ceiling. 
If the budget dispute is not resolved by then, a real clash will occur. But 
<i>essential services</i> like mail delivery, air traffic control and Social
Security checks will continue during this dispute. Doubtless there will
be a great hue and cry from the liberals who see their funds disappearing.
<p>
A government shutdown poses great risks for liberal interest
groups.  What happens if a few weeks go by and the public
doesn't miss the &quot;services?&quot;  That would provide a very
powerful argument for reducing spending even further. Our national
debt and much of our cultural decline have been the products of
several decades of reckless government spending. If it takes a
 liberal &quot;train wreck&quot; to get our country back on track,
that may be a small price to pay.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>
<p>
<a name="porn"><b>Calculating Moves.</b> The cyberporn debate has gone behind closed
doors during Congress' recess.  FRC has participated in several
meetings to work on a package to address this menacing aspect
of exciting new communication technology.  Later this month, Congress
will make final decisions about bill language.  Lawmakers should
stand firm in their commitment to enact strong laws against this
exploitative material, and not be swept in by the liberals' false
promise of &quot;parent-empowering&quot; software.  The software
might help, but it is no more a substitute for strong pornography
laws than bullet-proof vests are a substitute for laws against
homicide.
<p>
<b>Saving Health Care.</b> The Clinton health care plan is dead but the
issue of health care reform is still alive.  Escalating health
care costs are one of the biggest threats to the current system.
Congress is likely to consider  H.R. 1818, introduced by Reps.
William Archer (R-Texas) and Andrew Jacobs (D-Ind.), to allow
tax-free medical savings accounts in which families or individuals
set up a special account for lower-level health care expenses,
typically around $2,500.  The benefit is the account is tax free,
portable, and can carry over from year to year for future health
needs. HR 1818 has 90 cosponsors. In the Senate, Chuck Grassley
(R-Iowa) has taken the lead in pushing the medical savings account
concept.     
<p>
<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Quarterback Kemp.</b> The 14-member commission on taxes headed by
former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp, is
expected to give its report to the congresssional Republicans
 in October.  The commission examined a flat tax plan (with no
deductions), a national sales tax, and other proposals to simplify
the tax code.  Pro-family advocates will be especially interested
in how the commission handles tax treatment of families, charitable
contributions, and home ownership.
<p>
<b>New Security Order.</b> President Bill Clinton Aug. 4 signed an Executive
Order barring the federal government from denying security clearances
to homosexuals.  The 13-page order &quot;establishes a uniform
Federal personnel security program&quot; for all federal employees
to include members of the military and commercial contractors.
 It states, &quot;No inference...may be raised solely on the basis
of the sexual orientation of the employee.&quot;  Homosexuality
has long been a red flag for national security officers performing
background investigations  because it is so often linked to known
security risks, such as drug and alcohol abuse, promiscuity and
violence.
<p>
<b>Gay Asylum, Yes. Moms, No.</b> While Mrs. Clinton talked about advancing
women's rights during the Beijing conference, 13 Chinese women
were being imprisoned by the United States and awaiting deportation
back to China. Their crime?  Fleeing China's forced abortion policies.
 Even though these Chinese women will face extreme punishment
in slave labor (Lao Dai) camps or even death if they are returned
to China, Bill Clinton has refused to grant them asylum.  In a
reversal of the Reagan-Bush immigration policy, Clinton declared
that forced abortion was no longer grounds for political asylum.
He has instead extended asylum to homosexuals fleeing &quot;persecution.&quot;
<p>
<a name="polls"><b>Polls Go South.</b> Recent public opinion polling suggests 
that Americans are not altogether pleased with Congress. A <i>Wall Street 
Journal/NBC News</i> poll found that 53 percent of respondents <i>disapprove
</i>of Congress' performance and only 36 percent approve, while
a <i>New York Times/CBS News</i> poll found a 56 percent disapproval
rating and a 31 percent approval rating for Congress.  Interestingly,
however, according to a <i>Times Mirror</i> poll, the Republican
party is ahead of the Democratic party by a greater margin than
when they swept Congress last November -- 50 percent to 43 percent.
 Taken together, these results suggest that Americans are less
satisfied with the pace of change than the direction of change.

<h3>Children's Defense?</h3>
<p>
<font size=+3>W</font>hile President Bill Clinton's anti-smoking campaign grabbed
headlines, his administration went to court against a South Carolina
university hospital's very successful mandatory drug testing/treatment
program for pregnant cocaine-addicted women. Mothers who refuse
treatment for themselves and their unborn children would face
arrest and jail time. The program works. Most women stayed drug-free
during their pregnancy. Still, Clinton's aides charged that South
Carolina's program was punitive and violated the addicted mother's
&quot;privacy rights.&quot;  Is the health and well-being of unborn
children less important than those who already born?
<p>
<a name="aids">Then there is the issue of 7,000 deliveries per year in U.S.
to HIV-infected women. About 2,000 of these infants are infected
with HIV. Rep.Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), who is a medical doctor, and
Rep. Gary Ackerman (D-N.Y.) plan to offer an &quot;infant testing&quot;
amendment to the Ryan White Care Act (H.R. 1872/S. 641) that would
require states -- in order to qualify for federal Ryan White Care
funding -- to pass laws requiring every newborn be tested for the
HIV virus if mother does not (voluntarily) undergo prenatal
testing.  The amendment would require the test results to be told
to mothers, and it also encourages HIV counseling, testing and
treatment of pregnant women.
<p>
According to Dr. Coburn, his amendment is an important step in
combating AIDS.  &quot;In fact, studies have shown that the rate
of transmission of the virus from mothers to children can be reduced
by two-thirds if the drug AZT is administered during pregnancy,
labor and the first six weeks after birth,&quot; Coburn explains,
&quot;Knowing the status of the baby right away would allow treatment
and counseling to begin immediately and prevent an uninformed
mother from transmitting HIV to her baby through breast feeding.&quot;
<p>
Presently, 45 states require up to <i>nine</i> mandatory generic
newborn tests, such as syphilis and hepatitis, but not HIV. As
a public health issue, the incidence of AIDS in infants requires
that common sense become public sense.

<h3>Defending our Defenders</h3>
<p>
<font size=+3>F</font>RC has filed an <i>amicus curiae</i> (&quot;friend of 
the court&quot;) brief with the U.S. Supreme Court in the &quot;Amendment 2&quot;
case.  Media reports contend that <i>Romer v. Evans</i> will decide
whether the Constitution allows Colorado to &quot;discriminate
against&quot; homosexuals. Wrong. The case is really about
whether the people of Colorado may decide not to grant special
protected legal status to this &quot;class&quot; of persons.
 The Supreme Court justices will hear oral argument in the case
 Oct. 2.    
<p>
<a name="gay">In the military, homosexual servicemen have begun filing lawsuits
to block their discharge.  FRC is working on the following cases:
<ul>
<li>In <i>Philips v. Perry</i>, FRC filed the winning brief calling
for the dismissal of a case filed by a homosexual sailor seeking
to block his discharge.  In the case, Philips admitted past sexual
misconduct and his intention to engage in future misconduct. 
The federal district court dismissed Philip's case, and FRC is
preparing another brief arguing against his appeal.  
<p><li>A federal district court June 9 upheld the military's policy
on homosexuality in <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i>.  The ruling was
based upon the pre-1993 exclusion policy, not on the Department
of Defense's  (DoD) new &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; regulations.
 This is significant.  The Clinton administration has argued that
its 1993 change in policy was necessary to avoid constitutional
problems, but the Thomasson ruling shows that the &quot;old
rules&quot; were constitutionally sound.  Thomasson has appealed
this ruling to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, and FRC has
filed a brief supporting the constitutionality of the old policy.
</ul><p>
The <i>new</i> DoD regulations were the subject of a challenge
in the case of <i>Able v. U.S..</I> The federal district court
judge in Able ruled that six service members' First and
Fifth Amendment rights were violated when the military sought
to discharge them solely based on their open admission they were
homosexuals, and ruled that the Pentagon was enjoined from discharging
them.  Attorney General Janet Reno has appealed the ruling, but,
given the Justice Department's  lackluster performance so far,
FRC does not anticipate a vigorous effort at the appeals court
level.  FRC has filed an <i>amicus</i> brief setting forth all
of the key arguments for prohibiting service by avowed homosexuals
which the Clinton administration has ignored. FRC's efforts have
been undertaken by the Military Readiness Project, a joint task
force of FRC and senior retired military leaders.

works of literature.  See enclosed reply card for information

<a name="gary"><center><b><font size=+2><i>Dumb and Dumber?</i></font></b><br>
by Gary L. Bauer</center>
<p>
School's back. The bumper stickers on buses remind us to be careful
of the youngsters. Time was when accidents going to and from school
were the main worry of parents. No more. Today, we have concerns
about violence and drugs in schools. Many parents are troubled
by efforts in school to undermine the values and beliefs the kids
are taught at home. And, of course, there's OBE. Outcome-based
Education is the latest in a long line of educational fads that
have dumbed down American classrooms. 
<p>
<center><h3>&quot;Re-structuring&quot; SATs</h3></center>
<p>
Now, it seems, even the SATs have been affected. The Scholastic
Aptitude Tests have been  an important measure of how well our
young people are doing.  I remember during my service as President
Reagan's Undersecretary of Education how we pointed to the 85-point 
skid in SAT scores (1960-80) as indisputable proof of educational
decline. We even prodded a sluggish education establishment to
cough  up the extensive data we published as &quot;the Wall Chart.&quot;
That chart demonstrated that many of the states which spent the
least per pupil nonetheless produced students with the highest
scholastic aptitude. Was I unpopular with the bureaucrats!
<p>
Despite a 93 percent spending hike in the 1980s, the education
establishment continued to crank out under-prepared graduates.
So the SATs have been subjected to steady criticism from liberals.
Finally, the College Board has responded. With great fanfare,
education leaders announced that this year's scores were -- UP!
That <I>would</I> be great news except for some inconvenient truths.
First, this is a new and improved SAT test. They call it SAT I,
but its real name should be <i>SAT-lite.</i> It has fewer
questions, but it allows students 30 minutes more to finish. The
designers of SAT-lite have thrown overboard the more challenging
antonyms section, making it easier to score high on the the verbal
portion of the exam. Oh, and it's now OK to use a calculator.
No more unfair advantages to those grinds who memorized their
times tables! 
<p>
Test-makers say  they have changed the SATs in order to keep
up &quot;with what and how students are learning today.&quot;
What and how students learn today is increasingly determined by
President Bill Clinton and Education Secretary Dick Riley under
their ill-conceived &quot;Goals 2000&quot; legislation. Of course,
the College Board disclaims any attempt to dumb down the SATs.
But they are funded by the U.S. Department of Education. We could
hardly expect them to bite the hand that feeds them. With these
new SAT-lite test results, the Clinton administration will be
able to reassure concerned parents: &quot;See, our reforms are
working!&quot;  But this is the same team that called the State
of Ohio on the carpet last year for requiring high school graduates
to pass an eighth grade-level test. The Clinton administration
said those tests might be racially discriminatory.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><h3>Excellence the Goal</h3></center>
<p>
Make no mistake: pro-family Americans don't want kids
to fail in school. We believe that a stress on solid academic
basics, giving special needs children the extra help they may
require, is the best way to progress. We believe in competition
and a commitment to excellence. We know that parents are the key
to real education progress. And we think parents should be able
to choose the safe and challenging school that meets their childrens'
needs. We don't believe it helps anyone artificially to try to
build up a child's self-esteem by lowering the standards. Minority
children, as well as special needs kids and rural kids, can achieve.
The pursuit of excellence helps everyone.

<li><b>Charitable Giving.</b> Congress to consider several promising tax
measures to <b>expand capacity of private sector</b> to meet welfare
needs by encouraging charitable giving.  FRC backs both an above-the-line
deduction for non-itemizing taxpayers who donate to charity <I>and</I>

efforts <b>targeted at teens</b> and other unmarrieds. Pattern of funding

diseases. <b>Sen. Dan Coats</b> (R-Ind.), responding to  alarming trend,

<p><hr size=5 noshade><p>
<a name="un"><h2><i>UN:  Bound for Beijing</i></h2></center>
<p>
<font size=+3>F</font>rom Sept. 4-15, 1995, the United Nations (UN) will hold
its Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China.  The United
States will be sending a delegation to the conference -- despite
the objections of pro-familiy advocates.  First Lady Hillary Clinton
was originally slated to attend, but at latest word will not,
due to China's imprisonment of American human rights activist
Harry Wu.
<p>
<center><h3>Bracketing the Family</h3></center>
<p>
This conference purports to advance women's rights.  However,
many pro-family groups, including FRC, oppose the Beijing conference
agenda for the very reason that it denigrates women and families,
reflecting a radical feminist agenda.  For, not only is the conference
being hosted by a country with a long track record of abusing
women (e.g., female infanticide, coercive abortion policies),
but the platform document:
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>"<font size=+3>M</font>OTHER" IS BRACKETED<br>
FOR REPLACEMENT.</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<b>Denigrates motherhood and traditional family life.</b> For example,
the word &quot;mother&quot; has been bracketed throughout the
entire platform so that it might be changed to the term &quot;caretaker.&quot;
 Similarly, the word &quot;family&quot; has been bracketed for
change to &quot;household.&quot;  Bracketed sections indicate
that delegates could not agree in advance on the text.  These
sections are to be debated in Beijing.  In addition, the word
&quot;family&quot; almost always appears in a negative context,
i.e., in relation to domestic violence or female oppression.
<p>
<b>Devalues the husband-wife relationship to a mere power play.</b>
  Consider paragraph 198 of the platform:  &quot;Inequality in
the public arena can often start within the family when power
relations between men and women are unbalanced with discriminatory
attitudes and practices within the family.  The unequal division
of labour and responsibilities within households based on unequal
power relations also limits women's potential...&quot;  Thus,
rather than acknowledging marriage as a cooperative partnership,
the platform pits one mate against the other.  Notably, the words
&quot;wife&quot; and &quot;husband&quot; are never used.
<p>
<b>Leaves the term &quot;gender&quot; open for interpretation.</b>
 &quot;Gender&quot; appears more than 200 times in the platform
document.  But when asked to define the term, the UN rejected
the suggestion that there are two genders: &quot;male&quot; and
&quot;female.&quot;  The UN also rejected the definition of &quot;gender&quot;
as &quot;the socially-constructed roles which society assigns
to men and women.&quot;  In feminist literature, this definition
means that gender is subject to change and there exists a spectrum
of genders, perhaps even five (e.g., male heterosexual, female
heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, and transsexual).  Instead,
the UN decided that &quot;gender&quot; was to be understood &quot;in
its commonly accepted meaning.&quot;  The definition battle will
be a major focus in Beijing.
<p>
<b>Undermines parental authority in reproductive health decisions.</b>
 The platform repeatedly states that governments should &quot;emphasize
the role and responsibility of adolescents in sexual and reproductive
behavior through the provision of appropriate services and counseling[.]&quot;
 While occasionally mentioning the legal responsibility of parents
for their children, the platform refuses to recognize parental
authority regarding their children's reproductive health.
<p>
<b>Promotes abortion and contraception as reproductive &quot;rights.&quot;</b>
  In the tradition of previous UN conferences in Cairo and Copenhagen,
the Beijing platform urges governments to &quot;take action to
ensure that women's sexual and reproductive rights are fully recognized
and respected&quot; (paragraph 232).  In fact, the platform elevates
reproductive &quot;rights&quot; above all other rights, stating
that &quot;the ability of women to control their own fertility
forms an important basis for their enjoyment of other rights&quot;
(paragraph 98).
<p>
<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>
<p>
Contact your representative and senators, either in Washington
or at their in-state office.  Tell them to speak out against the
Beijing conference, publicizing its violations of women's fundamental
dignity.

<h3>On The Hill</h3>
<p><a name="issues">
<b>The House Holds.</b> Before adjourning for its August vacation, the
House of Representatives passed two amendments to curb U.S. promotion
of abortion overseas.  Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) led the fight
to prevent U.S. funding of groups that seek to overturn the anti-abortion
laws of sovereign nations.  The Smith amendments would also deny
U.S. aid to the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) if it continues to
participate in China's coercive population control program.  Sen.
Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) intends to offer the same amendment to S.
908, the State Department authorization bill.
<p>
<b>Pro-Family Sendoff.</b> U.S. delegates to the Beijing Women's Conference
received pro-family instructions from the Senate on August 1.
 Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex.) offered an amendment which
called on the U.S. delegation to promote a representative perspective
on the value of motherhood and the traditional family.  The amendment
also urged the delegates to define &quot;gender&quot; classically,
as in &quot;male and female, the two sexes of the human being.&quot;
 Pro-family delegates and observers participating in pre-conference
negotiations at the UN headquarters in New York were energized
by passage of the resolution.
<p>
<b>Pop Aid Bust.</b> The foreign aid bill passed by the House in July
will make it more difficult for the Clinton Administration to
carry out its population control agenda.  The &quot;development
assistance&quot; account, which has traditionally provided hundreds
of millions of dollars each year for international population
projects, was substantially reduced and a separate account was
dedicated to child survival and disease prevention efforts.  Pro-family
forces will now try to persuade the Senate to go along with the
reduced anti-population money.
<p><a name="alphabet">
<center><h3>The United Nations at Half-Century: A Primer</h3></center>
<p>
<font size=+2>T</font>he messages of congratulation poured in from all over the
world.   President Truman thanked Almighty God for bringing the
world community so far in its search for peace.  South African
Prime Minister Jan Christian Smuts called its Charter &quot;not
a perfect document, by any means . . . But at least it is a good,
practical, workmanlike plan for peace.&quot;  As he presided over
the final vote to create the United Nations, taken on June 25,
1945, Britain's Lord Halifax expressed the hope that the delegates
had taken part &quot;in one of the great moments of history.&quot;
<p>
To carry out its charter, the United Nations has, over time,
created an alphabet soup of commissions and agencies.  Some of
these entities have social and economic missions; others have
military missions.  Recently, peacekeeping activities by UN agencies
in such trouble spots as Somalia (UNISOM), Haiti (UNMIH) and the
former Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR) have raised serious questions about
the world body's effectiveness and its proper role.  
<p>
The UN has grown with the decolonization of major European
powers and the breakup of the Soviet empire. The major bodies
of the UN have different functions. The UN's annual budget is
$4 billion. The U.S. contribution, according to our Mission to
the UN, is between $1 billion and $1.5 billion.  UN documents
are printed  in the five official languages: English, French,
Spanish, Chinese and Russian.   Unless otherwise indicated, the
UN body described below is headquartered in New York.
<p>
<b>The General Assembly.</b>  The largest UN body, the General Assembly
is comprised of 185 member states.  Each member has one vote in
the General Assembly.  The General Assembly has authorized many
of the key UN agencies which have a direct impact on families.
 These include the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD),
the UN Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA), the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF), and the UN Development Fund for Women
(UNIFEM).
<p>
<b>The Secretariat.</b> This body is headed by the Secretary-General,
who reports to the General Assembly.  He supervises executive
functions of the UN.  The Secretary-General has traditionally
been selected from the ranks of the &quot;non-aligned&quot; nations.
 Boutros Boutros-Ghali (Egypt) currently serves in the post.
<p>
<b>The Security Council.</b>  The Security Council consists of 15
members.  Five of these -- Russia, China, the U.S., Britain and
France -- have veto powers over council actions.  The Council
is charged with responding to threats to peace.
<p>
<b>The Economic and Social Council.</b>  The 54 members of this
body are elected to terms by the General Assembly.  It is responsible
for UN efforts in the economic and social areas.  It includes
many specialized agencies.  Among them are the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO, Rome), the World Health Organization (WHO,
Geneva), the International Labor Organization (ILO, Geneva), the
very influential International Monetary Fund (IMF, Washington),
the newly created World Trade Organization (WTO), and the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO,
Paris). 
<p>
<b>The International Court of Justice (World Court, The Hague,
Netherlands).</b> The 15 judges are elected to nine-year terms by
the General Assembly and the Security Council.  Questions are
decided by majority vote.  All members of the UN are members of
the World Court, as are non-members Switzerland, San Marino and
Liechtenstein.

<center><h2><font size=+3>P</font>OLICY <font size=+3>U</font>PDATE</h2></center>
<p><a name="convention">
<font size=+3><i>The</i></font> United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child
(UNCRC) was approved by the UN General Assembly on Nov. 20, 1989.
 It was in force on Sept. 2, 1990 after the 20th nation ratified
it.
<p>
The United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Madeleine
Albright, signed the treaty on Feb. 16, 1995.  President Clinton
has said that the U.S. will spell out its interpretation of the
Convention with a statement of  &quot;reservations and understandings&quot;
that will go to the Senate.
<p>
A treaty becomes law in this country if the U.S. Senate ratifies
it by a two-thirds vote (67 Senators, if all are present).  This
has not yet happened and seems unlikely because Sen. Jesse Helms
(R-N.C.), a strong opponent of the Convention, is chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which must review it.
<p>
In fact, on June 14, Helms introduced S. R. 133.  This resolution
expresses the sense of the Senate that &quot;the primary safeguard
for the well-being and protection of children is the family, and
that, because the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the
Child could undermine the rights of the family, the President
should not sign and transmit it to the Senate.&quot;  Twenty-three
Senators are cosponsors.
<p>
As an international treaty, the UNCRC would be co-equal with
federal statutes, and possibly the United States Constitution.
 If the United States were to ratify the treaty as it stands,
it would become not only an international obligation, but also
a domestic obligation potentially regulating the most intimate
details of American family life. 
<p>
Several articles in the Convention grant children new rights
independent of their parents and families.  In the U.S. today,
children's rights are, in effect, held in trust by their parents.
 Under the Convention, children would hold those rights themselves.
 Conceivably, taking a child to church, when he would rather not
go, could be a violation of the child's right to freedom of religion
(Article 14); telling a child to turn off the television could
violate the child's right &quot;to seek, receive, and impart information&quot;
(Article 13), and so forth. 
<p>
The Convention on the Rights of the Child is a risk America's
families do not need -- and cannot afford -- to take.
<p><hr><p>
<a name="march"><center><h3>The UN and the Family: Major Documents</h3></center>
<p>
<font size=+2>T</font>he United Nations was founded in the shadow of the Second
World War, a renewed attempt by the victorious democracies to
establish an international body to safeguard the peace and promote
human rights.  From the beginning, with the drafting of the UN
Charter and related documents such as the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, the UN has attempted to give voice to the common
aspirations of the world's people.  Only within the past two decades
has the UN expanded its agenda in ways that pose direct threats
to the traditional family.
<p>
Here are some major landmarks in the history of UN advocacy
regarding marriage and the family:
<p>
<b>Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</b> Article 16 asserts
the right &quot;to marry and to found a family,&quot; provides
that marriage must be entered into &quot;freely&quot; by the spouses,
and defines the family &quot;as the natural and fundamental group
unit of society . . . entitled to protection by society and the
state.&quot;  The Declaration was adopted by the UN General Assembly
in 1948.
<p>
<b>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.</b>
 The Covenant, which is in treaty form, promotes special measures
to protect the family, mothers, and children.  Article 10 repeats
the definition of family in the <b>Universal Declaration</b> and calls
for &quot;the widest possible protection and assistance&quot;
to the family. Addresses such issues as family leave and child
labor.
<p>
<b>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</b> Article
23 of the Covenant uses the same definition of family as the <b>Universal
Declaration</b>, and requires nations that have ratified the Covenant
&quot;to ensure equality of rights and responsibilities of spouses
as to marriage[.]&quot;
<p>
<b>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
Against Women.</b> Article 12 introduces language requiring nations
to ensure access to health care, including family planning.  Like
the <b>Universal Declaration</b>, it speaks clearly of &quot;men&quot;
and &quot;women&quot; in these contexts.  Article 16 enumerates
eight specific rights as regards marriage, with emphasis on equality
of rights regarding children and property and the &quot;right
to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of
their children[.]&quot; The United States has not ratified this
Convention.
<p>
<b>International Year of the Family (IYF).</b> First proposed in
1987, the year was actually celebrated in 1994.  In the best modern
UN mode, Secretary General Boutros-Ghali announced that &quot;[t]here
is no single definition of a family.  There is no one model.&quot;
 An IYF document, &quot;The Changing Family Structure,&quot; lumped
together everything from &quot;polygamous&quot; and &quot;community&quot;
families to &quot;biological&quot; and &quot;adoptive&quot; families.
 &quot;Same-sex&quot; families also get equal footing in the document.
<p><hr width=65%><p>
<h3><center>NGO: FRC and the UN</center></h3>
<p>
&quot;NGO&quot; is one of the most commonly heard terms in
UN-speak.  It stands for &quot;Non-Governmental Organization,&quot;
and refers to private associations specifically recognized and
consulted by the United Nations.  Examples include the International
Red Cross, Amnesty International, Greenpeace, and Planned Parenthood.
 NGOs are first mentioned in the UN Charter of 1945 as important
resources for the General Assembly and the various commissions
it creates to address specific issues.
<p>
NGOs may be international or merely national in scope.  Their
number is large (some 1,500) and growing.  The presence of UN
Headquarters in New York City has given New York-based NGOs a
considerable advantage in lobbying the UN on a daily basis.  Some
NGOs, like WEDO, led by former Congresswoman Bella Abzug and a
major participant in UN conferences on population and the environment,
are almost fully funded by foundation money.  Others are grassroots-oriented.
<p>
NGO status can be permanent or temporary, allowing a group
access to the UN generally or merely to specific conferences.
 The Family Research Council was granted NGO status for the world
population conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1994.  FRC has
also obtained NGO status for Beijing (<i>see earlier article</i>).  This status
does not allow FRC to vote on the Beijing Plan, but it <i>will</i> make
us more effective eyes and ears for the American family.

<center><b><font size=+2><i>What So Proudly We Hail?</i></font></b><br>
by Gary L. Bauer</center>
<p>
Americans have historically sacrificed for peace. We went
to war twice in this century for the peace and freedom of Europe.
 Americans fought and died defending the independence of Korea,
Vietnam, Grenada, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.  Most recently, Americans
have shouldered the burden of famine relief in strife-torn Somalia.
The American people and their government respond generously to
natural disasters. 
<p>
America has taken a leading role in supporting the United
Nations, too.  From 1945 on, the U.S. provided the greater part
of UN funding and support.  President Kennedy defended the world
organization when the Soviets tried to hamstring it with a three-man
troika in place of its single Secretary-General.  That formula
would have guaranteed paralysis -- which is what the Soviets really
wanted.
<p>
Despite this record, the UN has often been a three-ring circus
of anti-Americanism.  The U.S. has regularly been denounced as
&quot;imperialist&quot; and a &quot;war monger&quot; during what
passed for UN debates.  Efforts to empower the nations of the
&quot;South&quot; by levying confiscatory assessments on the free
industrial democracies of the &quot;North&quot; have been popular
among all too many members of the General Assembly.  Third World
delegates have cheered the so-called New World Information Order,
which is nothing more than a dignified name for press muzzling
by tinpot despots. 
<p>
Still, Americans have remained largely willing to tolerate
the UN as an important forum for international discussion.  For
the sake of peace, we have gone the extra mile.  Recent stories
about UN diplomats who have run up thousands of parking violations
in New York City and who have stiffed the Big Apple's merchants
to the tune of millions have struck nerves, however.  No warm
and fuzzy talk of &quot;cultural disparities&quot; should cover
the obvious truth:  a ripoff is a ripoff.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+3>UN E</font><font size=+2>XPANSION</font> 
 <font size=+3>T</font><font size=+2>HREATENS</font><br>
<font size=+3>U.S. S</font><font size=+2>OVEREIGNTY</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
This corruption is far less troubling than the new trend
toward building an army of &quot;blue helmets&quot; to police
the world.  UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has moved
aggressively since the collapse of the Soviet Union to assert
a new doctrine of sovereignty. <i>Sovereignty</i>. That's a key word
and concept.  Americans recognize it better by referring to our
founding document, the Declaration of Independence.  That document
set forth our right to stand &quot;among the powers of the earth&quot;
as a free and equal nation.
<p>
The Secretary General's expansive view of UN authority is
not just an opinion.  The UN fielded only two peacekeeping missions
in its first five years, but it has dispatched the blue helmet
19 times in the past four years.  Many have greater ambitions
still.  Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, a communist, is
pushing a worldwide environmental initiative which sees a major
role for the UN.  Former French President Francois Mitterand,
a socialist, advocates the creation of a &quot;UN Legion&quot;
to give military teeth to the UN's resolutions. 
<p>
Veteran liberal Ronnie Dugger would go even further.  He
writes in <i>The New York Times</i> that if the member states are unwilling
or unable to man a UN Legion, the UN should accept volunteers
from the recognized Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs).  These
private groups are playing an increasing role in UN activities.
 The <i>Rainbow Warrior</i>, the Greenpeace ship that has confronted
whalers and nuclear test personnel, might be the first of a whole
fleet under the Dugger plan.
<p>
All of these suggestions come at a time of growing UN military
focus.  The UN Department of Peacekeeping has expanded from a
staff of 23 to more than 350 today, with a modern &quot;situation
center,&quot; staffed 24 hours a day.  What are the limits to
this mushrooming role?
<p>
As we watch the UN's Beijing Conference on Women, we should
each ask ourselves:  what if an army had the power to enforce
the resolutions passed by these delegates?  Would Americans remain
free and independent? I once considered such questions idle speculation.
 Not anymore.

</center>

Robert H. Knight examines cutting-edge social issues that affect and 
are affected by cultural values.  Of special interest are federal 
policies relating to arts funding, sex-related topics and education, 
censorship and freedom of expression, as well as the role of public 
interest groups and the media.  Mr. Knight wrote, produced and 
directed the 1994 FRC video documentary about Alfred Kinsey, <I>The 
Children of Table 34.</I>

<p>

Prior to joining FRC, Mr. Knight headed a similar program as Senior 
Fellow for Cultural Policy Studies at the Heritage Foundation.  
That program examined federal policies that undermine the traditional 
values of family sovereignty, religious freedom, property rights, 
individual responsibility and the idea of limited government.

<p>

While at Heritage, Mr. Knight authored studies on the 
<A HREF="/townhall/FRC/insight/is95a1cu.html">National Endowment for the 
Arts</A>, the U.S. Labor Department's regulatory disputes with the 
Salvation Army, the federal role in early childhood education, and 
the debate over the exemption of women from military combat roles. 
He testified before the U.S. Senate's Labor and Human Resources 
Committee in July 1994 as well as the Presidential Commission on the 
Assignment of Women in the Armed Services in 1992, and was an expert 
witness in the 1993 Colorado legal case dealing with Amendment 2, 
which barred cities from extending special civil rights protections 
based on sexual orientation.  He also testified in January 1995 before 
a House Appropriations subcommittee concerning the Corporation for 
Public Broadcasting and at a CPB public hearing in Washington in 
January 1994.

<p>

Before joining Heritage in September 1990, Mr. Knight was a Media 
Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, where he 
researched and began writing a book on cultural relativism.

<p>

Mr. Knight was a news editor and writer with the <I>Los Angeles 
Times</I>, where he worked for seven years prior to his Hoover 
fellowship.  During his 15 years in journalism, Mr. Knight has 
written for <I> The Wall Street Journal, National Review, Chicago 
Tribune, Philadelphia Inquirer, Baltimore Sun, Washington Times, 
San Francisco Chronicle, Orange County Register</I> and other 
publications.  He has appeared on the <i>CBS Evening News, NBC 
Nightly News</i>, ABC's <i>World News Tonight</i>, ABC's 
<i>Nightline</i>, CNN's <i>Crossfire</i>, NPR's <i>All Things 
Considered</i>, CNN's <i>Sonya Live</i>, CNBC'S <i>McLaughlin</i>, 
NBC's <i>A Closer Look</i>, NPR's <i>Fresh Air,</i> a PBS special 
on the arts and other television and radio broadcasts.

<p>

Mr. Knight worked for the <I>Fort Lauderdale News/Sun Sentinel</I> 
as a weekend project coordinator and copy editor, with the 
<I>Maryland Gazette </I>as assistant editor and the <I>Annapolis 
Evening Capital</I> as a reporter, and as a reporter and later 
editor of the <I>Maryland Coast Press</I>.

<p>

Mr. Knight has a Master's degree and a Bachelor of Science degree 
in political science from American University in Washington, D.C.

<center><h1>SHREDDED BLISS</h1></center>

<p>

<font size=+3>I</font>n 1888, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that marriage 
is &quot;the foundation of the family and of society, without which there 
would be neither civilization nor progress.&quot;

<p>

Because of its crucial role, marriage has a special status within
the culture and the law.  Its essence -- the joining of one man
and one woman in an exclusive legal, sexual, economic and spiritual
bond with the procreation of children as a desirable and common
result -- had not been seriously challenged for thousands of years.

<p>

<center><h3>Hawaiian Havoc</h3></center>

<p>

Now, a tiny segment of a tiny fraction of the population -- the
homosexual activist community -- is on the verge of radically
redefining marriage and family.  If they succeed, all distinctions
based on sex may fall, and the worst aspects of the rejected Equal
Rights Amendment will be imposed.  Homosexuals will gain the &quot;right&quot;
to adopt children; schoolchildren will be taught that homosexual
sex is the equivalent of marital love between husband and wife;
businesses will be forced to subsidize homosexual relationships;
churches will be pushed outside the civil law; and government
power will be wielded against anyone who holds the biblical view
of homosexuality.

<p>

In August, a Hawaiian court is expected to strike down that state's
law limiting marriage to &quot;one man and one woman.&quot;  The
case, <i>Baehr v. Lewin,</i> was brought by three same-sex couples
who charged the state with &quot;discrimination&quot; for not
granting them marriage licenses.  Despite widespread opposition
within Hawaii (recent polls show that 71% of Hawaiians oppose
same-sex &quot;marriage&quot;), homosexual activists hope to impose
their agenda through compliant courts.

<p>

Because the U.S. Constitution's Full Faith and Credit Clause calls
for states to honor each other's laws, homosexuals are planning
to fly to Hawaii, &quot;marry,&quot; and return to the mainland
to claim &quot;married&quot; status.  About 25 states now have
efforts underway to protect marriage, and three of them -- Hawaii,
Utah and South Dakota -- have enacted new laws protecting marriage.

<p>

In Washington, a bill is being drafted to bind the federal government
to a &quot;one-man, one-woman&quot; definition of marriage.  Tentatively
titled the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), the bill would protect
the military, Social Security,  and all federal agencies from
radical redefinition of wedlock.

<p>

<center><h3>Full Court Press</h3></center>

<p>

The marriage battle is being fought while several other key cases
involving homosexuality are being decided in the nation's courts.
The Supreme Court is expected to rule soon in a key Colorado
case in which voters had passed a constitutional amendment to
bar any city or county from enacting special rights based on sexual
orientation.  About a dozen cases challenging the military's ban
on homosexuality are being heard around the nation.

<p>

In Georgia, a federal appeals court ruled in favor of a lesbian
fired from her job at the state attorney general's office after
she announced that she had  &quot;married&quot; her lover.  Bear
in mind that the attorney general is required to defend Georgia's
sodomy law.  In  New York, the state's high court opened adoption
proceedings to homosexual couples and unmarried heterosexual couples,
thus devaluing marriage and jeopardizing children.

<center><i><font size=+2>
TWENTY-FIVE STATES MOVE TO<br>
PROTECT MARRIAGE.
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

The pattern is clear:  homosexual activists are using the courts
to get what they cannot achieve through democracy.  But the courts
do not operate in a vacuum.  U.S. Supreme Court justices noted
that one factor that affected the <i>Casey</i> decision upholding
<i>Roe v. Wade</i> was the court's public image.  Amherst legal
scholar Hadley Arkes notes that if Americans boldly defend marriage,
the courts may hesitate to radically redefine it.  If the states
pass marriage protection bills, and Congress enacts DOMA, the
judicial assault on traditional morality could falter.

<p>

<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>

<p>

Call your Congressman and Senators and ask that they cosponsor
the coming Defense of Marriage Act.  The Capitol Hill switchboard
is 202-225-3121.

<p>

Call state legislators and ask them to support your state's marriage
protection bill, or if there isn't yet such a bill, ask them to
sponsor one.

<p>

Educate yourself about the threat to marriage today -- from mistaken
public policies and cultural decay.  Consult the enclosed reply
card for information on new resources that defend this embattled,
but essential institution.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>Border Order.</b>  H.R. 2202 by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.),
and two competing Senate bills, Alan Simpson's (R-Wyo.) S. 1394
and Spencer Abraham's (R-Mich.) S. 1535, each seek to reform immigration
policy.  FRC deplores nativist rhetoric and supports provisions
which reflect the following principles:  (1) Illegal immigration
must be halted; America should not reward those whose first act
in this country is to break the law, and (2) America must remain
a country that welcomes legal immigrants, with appropriate safeguards
for our national sovereignty.

<p>

<b>Red Letter.</b> President Clinton went on record in a Feb.
28 letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah),
saying he will veto the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act when it
reaches his desk.  Mr. Clinton claims the legislation is unacceptable
because it does not protect a woman's life or &quot;health.&quot;
FRC responded by saying, &quot;That President Clinton would veto
a ban on a procedure characterized as four-fifths infanticide
and one-fifth abortion shows his clear disregard for the value
of human life.&quot;

<p><a name="gamble">

<b>Gambling Gambit.</b> On March 5, the House of Representatives
passed legislation to establish the National Gambling Impact and
Policy Commission.  The nine-member commission would conduct a
two-year study and report its findings to states, Congress and
the president. &quot;[T]his legislation creates no new regulations
and imposes no new mandates on gambling or state and local governments,&quot;
said its sponsor, Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.).  The sole purpose,
he added, is to help communities make informed decisions on gambling
questions.  Senate consideration is next.

<p>

<b>Healthy Debate.</b> On April 18-19 the Senate will debate
a health insurance reform bill sponsored by Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.)
and Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.).  The bill, which President Clinton
supports, does <I>not</I> contain medical savings accounts (MSA's),
and would give Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala
the power to ensure that state health insurance plans conform
with the &quot;goals&quot; of the bill, including &quot;comprehensive
coverage.&quot;  A related House bill, sponsored by Rep. Dennis
Hastert (R-Ill.), is expected to contain MSA's, no new taxes,
and no defined comprehensive benefits package.

<p>

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Teens and AIDS.</b> A new study released by the White House
advocates more efforts to reduce the spread of AIDS among teenagers.
Twenty-five percent of Americans infected with AIDS each year
are under the age of 20.  The report calls for more explicit AIDS
education and HIV testing without parental notice.  Meanwhile,
a House-Senate conference committee on the Ryan White Care Act
reauthorization is deadlocked over an amendment by Reps. Tom Coburn,
M.D. (R-Okla.) and Gary Ackerman (D-N.Y.) to require AIDS testing
of newborns.  The Clinton administration opposes the requirement.
FRC supports it.

<p><a name="prayer">

<b>Wing and a Prayer.</b> The Department of Transportation is
at odds with a DOT employees' group over whether a prayer and
fellowship group can label homosexual behavior a sin.  The 50-member
Christian organization has waited more than 14 months for official
status because it rejects a &quot;nondiscrimination&quot; clause
that includes sexual orientation.  Group leaders say they welcome
homosexuals, but cannot agree to give them leadership positions
or sanction actions they consider sinful.  Meanwhile, DOT has
already given preferential treatment to GLOBE, the Gay, Lesbian
or Bisexual Employees group.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Court-Assisted Suicide.</b> The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled March 7 that Washington state's ban on assisted
suicide is unconstitutional.  The next day, a Michigan jury acquitted
Dr. Jack Kevorkian on charges of assisting in the suicide of two
individuals, the second time he has been exonerated.  Judge Stephen
Reinhardt, writing for the Ninth Circuit's 8-3 majority, directly
linked the ruling with <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, the 1973 case that
established abortion on demand.  Decision by Washington state
officials on an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court is pending.

<p>

<b>Damsels in Distress.</b> A new Population Reference Bureau
study confirms what Massachusetts and California have already
found:  about two-thirds of births to teenage girls are fathered
by men age 20 or older.  In addition, a 1994 Alan Guttmacher Institute
report found that six of 10 girls who had sex before age 15 were
coerced by males an average of six years their senior.  As more
girls grow up without fathers to protect their honor, their search
for a father figure leaves them more vulnerable to predatory males.

<p>

<b>Grave But Stable?</b> Another Population Reference Bureau
report reveals both positive and negative trends among U.S. families.
Good news is that the divorce rate has leveled off, the growth
rate of single-parent families has been halved, and more two-parent
families with children have formed. However, the report also shows
that the U.S. still has the world's highest divorce rate and that
single-parent families are increasing three percent annually.
Census reports such as these sometimes reflect only a change in
demographics, not a genuine attitudinal shift.

<h3>FRC Soldiers On</h3>

<p>

FRC's Military Readiness Project (MRP) was present on March 4
in Seattle, Washington when the ACLU and the Clinton Justice Department
once again misrepresented the military's homosexual law.  In the
case of <i>Philips v. Perry</i> which involves a homosexual sailor
who admitted to misconduct, Justice's attorney told a three-judge
appeals court panel that what the military has is a &quot;homosexual
accommodation law.&quot;  In fact, it has always had an exclusion
policy.

<p>

The government cited as evidence the fiction that some homosexual
service members have successfully convinced administrative boards
that being homosexual does not mean that they will engage in
illicit conduct.  At the hearing the ACLU asserted that homosexuals
can legally serve, and then argued that the <i>Philips</i> case
was really about discrimination.  Unbelievably, it took a judge
(a Bush-appointee) to highlight the fact that Philips had admitted
to homosexual sex with &quot;a dozen&quot; men.

<p>

The MRP has participated in five federal appeals court cases.
Most recently, on March 15, it joined the <i>Richtenberg v. Perry</i>
case which involves an Air Force captain who declared himself
a homosexual.  Like the others, he seeks to invalidate the law
and the Pentagon's regulations.  This case may present another
opportunity for the MRP to make oral arguments, as it did last
December in <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i>. The MRP will defend the
underlying law, and the Clinton Justice Department will defend
the faulty &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; implementing regulations.

<p>

Two cases soon to be decided, <i>Abel v. U.S.A.</i> and <i>Thomasson</i>,
are competing for the attention of the Supreme Court.  Decisions
in both cases are expected this spring, and one of them will be
appealed to the high court this summer with oral arguments likely
during the court's next term.

<p>

Meanwhile, a new administration could discard Clinton's faulty
&quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; regulations and require the
Justice Department to defend the law before the Supreme Court.
In any event, major news on this issue is only months away.

<h3>Rx for the Drug War</h3>

<p>

On Feb. 15, FRC hosted a national drug abuse prevention strategy
meeting.  Nationally known experts from diverse backgrounds and
regions came together to develop an eight-part action plan.  The
participants agreed:  the drug scourge is getting worse, and something
must be done to reignite grass-roots anti-drug efforts.

<p>

The strategy has a two-part prevention focus:  use of mind/mood-altering
drugs is dangerous to the individual and society, and comprehensive
community-based prevention is the most viable solution to the
drug crisis.

<p>

Drug education must begin at home.  The strategy calls for drug
education resources to be tied to accountability.  Drug abuse
messages must be congruent and consistently broadcast through
every educational setting (homes, schools, workplaces, communities
and media).

<p>

Law enforcement must identify all users and impose consequences
on abuse.  It must also create systematic accountability for funding
and success rates.  Key to the strategy is leadership.  Leaders
at all levels must speak clearly and serve as role models.

<p>

Grass-roots citizen action is vital.  Accountability for drug
abuse prevention must be locally based, and citizen groups must
have power over funds to make their programs work.  The media
must stop glamorizing drugs and provide truthful alternative messages.
The strategy calls for an annual report on media handling of
the drug prevention message.

<p>

Treatment for abusers should be delivered at the point of need
with accountability.  This includes providing appropriate long-term
treatment.  Finally, the strategy calls for reallocating available
drug funds with strict standards.  This year the federal government
will spread $13 billion across 140 programs with little accountability.

<p>

FRC wants the strategy to influence each political party's presidential
platform and all future drug-related legislation.   It provides
a federal model for the drug war that focuses the government on
supply interdiction and passes responsibility and fiscal authority
for prevention and treatment to local communities.

<p>

FRC's short-term goal is to have drug abuse recognized as a national
crisis. America must aim to cut current abuse levels at least
in half by the year 2000.  The long-term goal is the eradication
of drug abuse.

<font size=+2><b><i>Bashers, Bombers and Bigots</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer
</center>

<p>

Several years ago, radical homosexual members of the ACT-UP group
invaded St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City and desecrated
the Host.  Millions of Christians around the world believe that
Christ is really present in the sacrament of communion.  America
has had, tragically, anti-Catholic riots in its history.  &quot;Know
Nothing&quot; mobs even dumped one of the stones intended for
the Washington Monument into the Potomac because it had been generously
donated by the pope.  But Act-Up's church invasion set a new low
for efforts to offend the deeply held religious beliefs of a whole
community.

<p>

In suburban Washington, D.C., the Montrose Baptist Church has
twice been the site of suspicious fires.  No one has been charged
with arson, but church members have cited the congregation's strong
pro-life stance and its high profile during the 1992 Maryland
abortion referendum as making it a likely target in liberal Montgomery
County.

<p>

Now we have even more disturbing evidence of hatred in action.
At least 25 black churches have been hit in a new wave of arson
in California and a number of southern states. This form of bigotry
cannot be tolerated. That is why I have joined with a group of
black, Jewish, Catholic and evangelical Christian leaders to call
for prompt hearings by the Judiciary Committees of the House and
Senate.

<p>

The current wave of church bombings began on April 4, 1993.  That
was the 25th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr.  The pace of these attacks has picked up since January,
1995.  There is evidence of a pattern here, a pattern that suggests
a conspiracy to violate our civil rights laws. There is every
reason for the federal government to act.

<p>

It does not matter what motivates the haters.  Whether it is a
<i>Hamas</i> suicide bomber who catches Bus No. 18 in Jerusalem,
or a racist who wants to terrorize black Christians peacefully
worshipping here at home, terrorism is evil and we must mobilize
against it.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center>
<i><font size=+2>WE MUST MOBILIZE AGAINST<br>
TERRORISM.</font></i>
</center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

This is also a good time to reassert the real meaning of the First
Amendment. The right of the people to the &quot;free exercise&quot;
of religion is a precious one, bought with the blood of patriots
and martyrs.  Millions of our American ancestors came to this
country seeking this right above all others.

<p>

It does not help the cause of religious tolerance when the federal
government itself treats religion as a suspect classification.
Christian employees of the Federal Aviation Administration are
still finding their request to start a prayer group stiff-armed
by bureaucrats who welcome gay activist groups (see 
<a href="#news"><I>Newswatch</I></a>).

<p>

Moreover, the Clinton administration has recently moved to squelch
tuition assistance which has been provided since 1929 for Americans
serving in Ecuador.  The parents who chose the Alliance Academy,
a Christian school, were evidently pleased with the quality of
education provided and the spiritual and moral guidance their
children received there.  But now, with the opening of a completely
secular private school in Ecuador's capital, Quito, parents have
been told to enroll their kids in this private school or forego
the assistance the U.S. government has long provided.

<p>

Anti-Semitism, anti-Catholicism and racism have no place in our
sweet land of liberty. Nor does the disdainful view of too many
that religion itself is to be discouraged. As Irving Kristol has
wisely noted:  &quot;The real danger is not from a revived Christianity...but
from an upsurge of antibiblical barbarism that will challenge
Christianity, Judaism and Western Civilization together.&quot;
To which, I say: &quot;Amen!&quot;

<li><b>Prospects for welfare reform remain uncertain.</b>  Despite
bad advice from National Governors Association to follow President
Clinton's cues and abandon illegitimacy, Congressmen Jim Talent
(R-Mo.) and Tim Hutchinson (R-Ark.) continue to <b>insist that
children need two-parent families.</b>  Father absence is leading
cause of welfare dependency.  Talent and Hutchinson hope to reinsert
family cap, which would <b>freeze existing cash benefits for women</b>
who bear additional children while on welfare, and to strengthen
work requirements. <b>Family Research Council supported Talent-Hutchinson</b>

<p>
<font size=+3>I</font>n a sweeping victory for families, Congress recently 
passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, including provisions protecting
children from computer pornography.  The Telecom Act extends current
child protection laws to cyberspace, using the court-approved
&quot;indecency&quot; standard to keep patently offensive material
away from minors.  The cyberporn provisions punish only knowing
violations, while preserving existing electronic mail privacy
laws.
<p>
The significance of the new law's computer porn section cannot
be overstated.  It represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity
to set ground rules for the next great communications medium.
Pornographers have been flooding this promising technology, and
the new Telecom Act comes not a moment too soon.
<p>
<center><h3>ACLU Logs In</h3></center>
<p>
The American Civil Liberties Union has filed suit to strike
down the computer pornography section as unconstitutional.  Clearly,
the ACLU is fighting a losing battle.  Time and again, the courts
have upheld the constitutionality of &quot;indecency&quot; restrictions
in other contexts, most recently regarding dial-a-porn services.
FRC will file its own brief in response to the ACLU challenge.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>ACLU FIGHTS A<br>
LOSING BATTLE</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
The battle now shifts to the Clinton administration, whose
resolve in defending the law is questionable.  Last April, President
Clinton voiced concern that children &quot;may be exposed to things
on computer, which in some ways are more powerful, more raw and
more inappropriate than those things from which we protect them
when they walk in a 7-Eleven.&quot;  Clinton declared, &quot;I
do not believe in any way, shape or form that we should be able
to do on e-mail, or through the electronic superhighway anything
beyond what we could elsewhere.  I think the First Amendment has
to be uniform in its application.&quot;
<p>
However, in recent days the Clinton administration has appeared
to retreat from this resolve.  The floundering is reminiscent
of the notorious <I>Knox</I> case, where the administration tried
to weaken the federal child pornography law it was bound to defend.
Although Congress rebuffed that attempt, fear remains that the
administration might try a similar tactic again.
<p>
Objections to the new cyberporn law have less to do with
free speech than with arrogance and greed.  The &quot;online elite&quot;
know that if this new medium is to be truly open to a diverse
community, all members of that community will deserve respect,
including children.  Even with the new law, parents must be ever
vigilant in ensuring that cyberporn remains off-limits to their
children.
<p>
<center><h3>Nixing PX Porn</h3></center>
<p>
FRC continues to fight pornography on other fronts.  Last
month at the Supreme Court, FRC filed a legal brief in <I>Alliance
for Community Media v. F.C.C.</I>, a case challenging the regulation
of pornographic programs on cable television access channels.
The challenged law would simply give private cable operators
the ability to limit indecent programs.  It would relieve operators
of the current law requiring them to show everything, no matter
how offensive. In their lawsuit, the plaintiffs charge that restoring
a cable operator's right to decide against airing indecent programs
amounts to indirect government censorship.  FRC supports the right
of private cable operators to reject &quot;nude talk shows&quot;
and &quot;amateur porn hours&quot; on access channels.  Oral argument
at the Supreme Court was set for Feb. 21.
<p>
Pornography in the military has been another flashpoint.
For years, the U.S. military has been the nation's largest porn
purveyor, stocking military exchanges with tax-free smut worth
millions of dollars.  Not surprisingly, in recent years the military
has been plagued by sexual misconduct and assault.  New Jersey
Rep. Christopher Smith is drafting a bill to prohibit the sale
of pornography at military facilities worldwide.
<p>
<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>
<p>
Over the last few months, tremendous progress has occurred
in the fight against pornography, thanks largely to grassroots
support.  Your continued involvement will help keep these gains
intact.  Insist that child protection laws apply consistently
to all areas of society, including the Internet.  Urge your members
of Congress to support the pending Smith bill on military porn.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>
<p><a name="believers">
<B>Forsaken Brethren.</B>  FRC President Gary Bauer testified
on Feb. 15 before the House Subcommittee on International Operations
and Human Rights regarding anti-Christian persecution overseas.
Bauer testified that this persecution takes many forms, from
harassment of worshippers to, in Ethiopia, actual crucifixion.
Abuses seem to be especially prevalent in certain Moslem countries.
Bauer called for a more coherent response from the U.S. Government
and from U.S. religious leaders:  &quot;How much longer,&quot;
he said, &quot;can we allow persecuted Christians overseas to
call out, 'Why have you forsaken us?'&quot;
<p>
<B>CAREERS Update.</B>  The National Governors Association recently
released a statement urging final passage of the CAREERS bill
(H.R. 1617) within 30 days.  Progress in a House-Senate conference
committee to combine CAREERS with the Senate's Workforce Development
Act (S. 143) has been slow due to major differences between the
bills, which would consolidate job training programs.  The bills'
extensive Labor Market Information System and implementation of
a skill certificate system could threaten workers' economic freedom.
Governors favor consolidation, which gives them more authority
over state job training and economic development.
<p>
<B>Pro-Life Progress.</B> A short-term spending bill signed by
President Clinton on Jan. 26 included three pro-life measures.
They are:  a ban on federal funds for the experimental creation
of human embryos; a ban on federal funding of abortions for prison
inmates, except in the case of rape or life of the mother; and
a compromise restriction on international population funds.  The
compromise will bar funding until July 1 for organizations that
perform or promote abortions overseas, but allow funding thereafter
at reduced levels from 1995 spending.  Pro-life members of Congress
continue to seek permanent restrictions.
<p>
<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>
<p>
<B>Innocent as Charged.</B> After a more than year-long federal
grand jury investigation, the Clinton Justice Department has found
no evidence of a national conspiracy to attack abortion clinics.
However, Attorney General Janet Reno has vowed to continue the
probe, and Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) has called for congressional
hearings on the issue.  Meanwhile, federal and state prosecutors
have used the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) act
to charge two peaceful pro-lifers, sidewalk counselors Carmen
Vazquez and Bobby Riley, with &quot;obstructing&quot; and 
&quot;interfering&quot; with women seeking abortions.
<p>
<B>Drug Fighter.</B> President Clinton has selected a get-tough
soldier to lead our nation's battle against drugs.  During his
State of the Union address, Clinton announced his decision to
tap Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey to replace drug czar Lee Brown,
who is now teaching in Texas.  Gen. McCaffrey is an expert on
narcotics trafficking who returns to Washington from a command
in Panama, where he has overseen U.S. cooperation with Latin American
and Caribbean nations on drug intelligence and interdiction since
February 1994. Drug abuse among American youth con-tinues to
rise.
<p>
<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>
<p><a name="baer">
<B>Baer Backs &quot;Mule.&quot;</B> Federal Judge Harold Baer,
Jr. provoked a firestorm Jan. 24 when he threw out the drug trafficking
conviction of Carol Bayless.  Bayless was driving a car with 80
pounds of cocaine and heroin in the trunk. Two accomplices ran
when police observed them.  Judge Baer,  a Clinton appointee,
said: &quot;Residents in this neighborhood tend to regard police
officers as corrupt, abusive and violent.  Had the men not run
when the cops began to stare at them, it would have been unusual.&quot;
Bayless had confessed to being a regular drug courier (&quot;mule&quot;).
<p>
<B>PC &quot;Volunteers.&quot;</B>  Mandatory voluntarism takes
the spirit out of serving, argue many parents and secondary school
students.  Graduation requirements for &quot;volunteering&quot;
are prompted by Goals 2000, which encourages community service.
But what some programs call service is actually political activism.
Others exclude religious service activities.  The conflict over
mandatory service may soon reach the U.S. Supreme Court if a New
York decision upholding a service requirement is appealed.  Federal
parental rights legislation (S. 984, H.R. 1946) could provide
a remedy by defining parental authority in school matters.
<p>
<B>Army Salvation.</B> An Army wife, Tambra Hartmann, lost her
license to run a home-based day-care service on a military post
because she said grace with the children over meals and played
Christian music.  The children's parents selected the service
in part because it was faith-based.   Last November, the U.S.
Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Army overstepped
its authority and violated the families' First Amendment freedoms.
The Army has changed the regulation to permit faith elements
as long as child-care providers inform parents of that fact before
enrollment.

<h3>Wedding Bans</h3>
<p>
Acting before Hawaiian courts mandate homosexual &quot;marriage,&quot;
which may occur in July, pro-family activists nationwide are working
to protect the definition of marriage.
<p>
In California, the state assembly voted 41 to 31 on Jan.
31 to prohibit the recognition of same-sex relationships as marriage.
A tougher vote is expected in the liberal Senate.  Utah enacted
a law in 1995 that defines marriage as the union of &quot;one
man and one woman&quot; and bars recognition of same-sex nuptials.
Other states considering such measures: Alabama, Alaska, Colorado,
Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island,
South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and Washington.  In Maine,
a marriage protection bill was introduced but withdrawn after
a lesbian legislator withdrew her own homosexual rights bill.
In Nebraska, a bill legalizing same-sex marriages has been introduced.
<p>
At the national level, a federal bill is being written to
reinforce the &quot;one-man, one-woman&quot; definition in all
policies, including Social Security and the military.  The tentative
title is the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), and a sponsor was
being sought at press time.
<p>
The gravity of the situation cannot be overstated.  If homosexual
&quot;marriage&quot; becomes law in Hawaii and is imposed on all
other states through the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution,
businesses will be forced to subsidize homosexuality, schoolchildren
will be taught that homosexuality is equivalent to marital sex,
and churches will be pushed into a religious &quot;ghetto,&quot;
where pressure will mount for conformity to civil law.  Redefining
marriage would redefine the family, giving homosexuals an uncontested
&quot;right&quot; to adopt children.
<p>
Citizens can do two things to preserve marriage:  1) contact
your state legislators and urge them to support current legislation
or to introduce a bill protecting marriage; 2) ask your congressman
and U.S. Senators to cosponsor the eventual federal bill.  The
Capitol Hill switchboard number is (202) 225-3121 or (202) 224-3121.

Marriage (513) 733-8908.

<h3>Wobbling on Welfare</h3>
<p>
The promise to &quot;end welfare as we know it&quot; remains
a popular talking point, but on Jan. 9 President Clinton vetoed
the welfare bill passed by congressional Republicans.
<p>
The nation's Governors have now advanced their own welfare
reform package, and regrettably they have chosen to abandon serious
attempts to reduce illegitimacy.  The House and Senate agreed
last year to prohibit states from using federal funds to increase
welfare payments to women who bear additional children while on
welfare, but would have allowed states to opt out of the prohibition.
<p>
While erasing the focus on illegitimacy, the Governors proposed
<I>adding</I> an extra $4 billion in child care funding.  Their
recommendation would increase spending on day care 49% more than
current law, without spending a penny on abstinence programs to
help reduce out-of-wedlock births.  The emphasis on child care
is ironic, since the Governors also moved to weaken the work requirements
passed by congressional Republicans.
<p>
In a letter to House colleagues, Congressman Jim Talent (R-Mo.)
argued that the last time Congress adopted a welfare plan proposed
by the Governors, a Democrat from Arkansas rode to the White House
partly on the strength of his pledge to fix the mess.  If the
Congress listens to the Governors' advice this year, it will have
committed itself to spending over half a trillion dollars to subsidize
fatherlessness through cash benefits, day care, job training,
and other services.
<p>
A recent FRC poll shows that three out of four Americans
believe that welfare encourages illegitimacy and, by a ratio of
two to one, that reducing illegitimacy is more important than
merely encouraging single mothers to support themselves.  A hefty
84% of Americans support a family cap, and an overwhelming majority
believe that work requirements should focus last on mothers with
preschool-aged children.  Both provisions would help reduce the
Governors' incentive to capture new federal dollars for child
care -- and would allay our concerns about leaving children, yet
again, at the mercy of public institutions.

<center><font size=+2><b><i>Foster Has a Future</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer</center>
<p>
In his State of the Union Address on Jan. 23, President Clinton
made an appeal to pro-family Americans.  He talked about balancing
the budget, reforming welfare, attacking drug abuse, and reducing
the rate of teen pregnancy, among other things.  For Drug Czar,
the President made a choice American families warmly applauded,
Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey.  Now comes Clinton's Teenage Pregnancy
Czar, and the ovation is over:  Dr. Henry Foster, Planned Parenthood
advocate extraordinaire and failed nominee for Surgeon General,
is back in the saddle.
<p>
Almost a year ago, President Clinton tapped Dr. Foster to
replace Joycelyn Elders as Surgeon General, saying that he wanted
Foster's Nashville-based teen pregnancy program, &quot;I Have
A Future,&quot; replicated throughout the nation.  But part of
the reason Foster was rejected as Surgeon General was that his
program, like all contraceptive-based programs, proved a dismal
failure.  According to an evaluation by the Carnegie Corporation,
a program underwriter, participants in &quot;I Have a Future&quot;
actually had <I>higher</I> rates of sexual activity than those
outside the program.
<p>
This is not the kind of leadership that America wants or
needs to help combat teen pregnancy.  This is not the kind of
program that will help reach the President's stated goal of reducing
the teen pregnancy rate by one-third over the next 10 years. 
And this is surely not the kind of approach that will help our
children grow up to be responsible and mature adults.
<p>
The research is crystal clear.  Teenagers' best safeguard
against having or causing an out-of-wedlock pregnancy is to have
two loving parents involved in their lives.  But it's also important
to create a culture where the values that parents teach their
children are reinforced outside the home.  Several abstinence
programs have done just that, with excellent results.
<p>
For example, only 1.1 percent of participants in the Washington,
D.C.-based <I>Best Friends</I> program became pregnant, as opposed
to 25 percent of other girls in the city.  The abstinence curriculum
<I>Teen-Aid</I> helped to reduce the teen pregnancy rate in Jacksonville,
Florida, by 35 percent just three years after it was implemented.
Examples of other successful abstinence programs abound.
<p>
Tragically, the President has chosen to support ideology
over progress.  The Foster task force has been christened the
&quot;National Campaign to Reduce Teen Pregnancy.&quot;  Reducing
pregnancy among unmarried teens is a laudable goal.  But to reach
it we must have a sustained reversal of the sexual activity that
haunts the young with unprecedented rates of pregnancy, abortion,
disease and emotional heartbreak.  Unfortunately, the Foster
group has already admitted that it intends to promote contraception
rather than abstinence.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>CLINTON CHOOSES IDEOLOGY<br>
OVER PROGRESS</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
While raising children well is a tough job, it's not impossible.
In truth, the teen pregnancy rate has been declining for the
last two years because more teens are choosing abstinence despite
all of the federal projects and cultural pressures promoting the
contrary.  Statistics published by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention show that the drop in teen pregnancy rates reflects
a rising number of teens choosing to abstain from sex.
<p>
The familiar Scripture says, &quot;Train up a child in the
way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it.&quot;
(Proverbs 22:6).  Last June the U.S. Senate reviewed Dr. Foster's
credentials and told the President this <I>isn't</I> the way
we should go.  But the President has refused to turn from his
old friend.  So now it appears that Henry Foster has a future

now looks a little bleaker.

This month marks a departure from the usual format of <i>Washington Watch</i>. While most families are beginning summer vacations from school, Congress is entering the heart of its regular legislative schedule.  This special issue of <i>Watch</i> is designed to bring you up to date on what FRC regards as the most important pro-family policy measures pending on Capitol Hill.
<p>
On the inside pages, you'll find a convenient "scorecard" on the legislative achievements of the 104th Congress.  You may want to keep a copy handy for future reference.  Feel free to duplicate copies of these pages as you see fit for your neighbors or your church.
Bulk copies of this issue of <i>Watch</i> are available on request.  Just dial 1-800-225-4008 for information.
<p>
And remember -- for current pro-family legislative information, updated every Friday, dial FRC at 1-202-783-HOME (a toll call).
<p>
<i>Watch</i> will return in its regular format in July.  In the meantime, drop me a note and let me know how well <i>Washington Watch</i> is serving your need for timely facts and findings about how the family fares in national policy. 
<p><hr width=50% size=3><p>
<font size=+2><b><i>Dear Reader:</i></b></font>
<p>Late last year, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> asked me to write an essay on what pro-family Americans expected from the new Congress.  I was happy to do so, even though I had to begin my article with a concession.  The concession was this:  the new Congress should keep the promises made in the Republican Contract with America -- most of which involved economic and structural reforms -- then turn to the social agenda:  reversing the breakdown of the family, defunding our grossly mismanaged (and too often simply gross) arts agencies, protecting the sanctity of human life, reforming the education mess.
<p>
In the last four months, the pro-family movement has helped to implement a lot of reforms related to the budget and the economy.  Now it's time to deal with issues related to our families and values.  Patience may be its own reward, but in public policy, too much patience can be poison.  In my two decades in Washington, I have witnessed only a handful of opportunities for progress on a pro-family platform.  We are now in the midst of such an opportunity.  We can move forward and see dramatic policy change to strengthen the family unit morally, socially and economically.
<p>
Or we can see the opposite.  Because just as this opportunity is upon us, so too is there unprecedented danger to the family.  Every parent in America senses this fact.  To read a daily newspaper is to be bombarded with a hail of horrors.  To look at our nation's illegitimacy rate -- and to understand its correlation with youth crime -- is to recognize that America may be just a decade away from an explosion of street violence.  To see the staggering toll of abortions, the pressures on our court system to sanction euthanasia and assisted suicide, and other anti-life trends, is to know that the nation is perilously close to complete dissolution of the Judeo-Christian consensus that has sustained it through the centuries.
<p>
A wise veteran on Capitol Hill put our situation to me bluntly.  For the first time since it has been his job to understand the pulse of the American people, he cannot tell which way this nation is headed.  In the next five years, he said, anything seems possible, from a religious and pro-family renaissance to an utter collapse of traditional values that brings on drug legalization, homosexual marriages, and all-pervasive pornography.  
<p>
Life and death truly have been set before us.  Which way we will choose?  What follows in this special edition of <i>Washington Watch</i> is an effort to lay out an agenda for <i>the way of life</i> -- an American way of life.  My hope is that you will share these pages with your friends, your neighbors and those with whom you attend church.  Each of us has the responsibility to take a clear look at the alternatives that lie before us -- before the window of opportunity is shut.

<p>
<i>Introduction:  The architecture of family freedom is no accident, even if, once upon a time in America, government officials almost instinctively adopted policies to protect family stability and promote civic character.  Today, both deliberate and unintentional assaults upon the family have multiplied.  But the structure of the family is written on the heart of humanity.  Lawmakers can ignore that God-given structure, but they cannot erase it.  Here are ways that the 104th Congress can help to restore family-friendly public policy</i>.
<p>
<a name="life"><center><h3>Restoring the Sanctity of Human Life</h3></center>
<p>
<b>1. The Civil Right to Life.</b> Four members of the House, two Democrats and two Republicans, have introduced constitutional amendments to restore the right to life of children before birth.  Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) has introduced S. 320, the "Unborn Children's Civil Rights Act."  It would put Congress on record as declaring, among other things, that the U.S. Constitution sanctions no right to abortion and that <i>Roe v. Wade</i> was improperly decided.  It would also bar any federal funding or promotion of abortion, and provide for an expedited right of appeal to the Supreme Court when any abortion restriction is found unconstitutional by a lower court.  These proposals do not merely "modify" the abortion right, they would give protection to unborn children for the first time in 22 years.
<p>
<b>2. Members Against Dismemberment</b>. As a first step toward providing constitutional protection for unborn children, Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.) and Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) will offer legislation to ban "partial birth abortions," which involve the heinous D&X procedure performed on unborn children 20-26 weeks of gestation.  Hearings are scheduled this month in the House Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on the Constitution.
<p>
<b>3. "Lady Liberty" Means No to Forced Abortions.</b> The Clinton administration has shown blatant disregard for fundamental human rights by overturning previous administrations' asylum policy for families fleeing China's coercive "birth quota" system, with its forced abortions and sterilizations.  Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) recently attached language to the foreign aid bill (H.R. 1561) to restore the previous policy.  By record vote of  240-181 on the same bill, the House voted to deny U.S. foreign assistance dollars to non-governmental groups that perform or provide abortions, or that lobby other nations to repeal their laws restricting abortion.  The same measure would also require the United Nations Population Fund to end its involvement in China's draconian family planning program -- or lose all U.S. funds.  H.R. 1561 should pass the House as is, and the Senate should agree.
<p>
<b>4. Adopt Adoption Assistance.</b> In an effort to encourage adoption by lowering financial obstacles, the House of Representatives has passed a budget provision which allows taxpayers a $5,000 credit for qualified adoption expenses.  The Senate did not include the adoption assistance measure in their budget measure, passed on May 25.  An amendment offered by Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) that included the credit was defeated on May 23 by vote of 69-31.  The differing budgets now go to a House-Senate conference, and FRC will be working to ensure that the adoption credit survives in the final bill.  Adoption is the <i>option of choice</i> for dealing with crisis pregnancy.
<p>
<b>5. No Abortion Mandate</b>. Rep. Pete Hoekstra (R-Mich.) will introduce legislation to prohibit the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) from requiring hospital ob/gyn residency programs (including religious hospitals) to train or refer medical students to perform abortions, lest they lose accreditation.  At stake are federal  Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement dollars.  Subcommittee chairman Hoekstra also scheduled a June 14  hearing in the House Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee to examine ACGME's coercive policy.
<p>
<a name="education"><center><h3>Empower Parents for Education</h3></center>
<p>
<b>6. Be True to Our Schools.</b> At last, serious efforts are under way to dismantle the U.S. Education Department.  The House budget resolution withdraws funding for the department.  In addition, the House Education Task Force's "Back to the Basics Education Bill" returns authority to the state and local level.  This is a high-priority issue for FRC; action could come in Congress within several months.  The decline in American education parallels the rise of the Department of Education; it's time to test the linkage in reverse.
<p>
<b>7. Be True II.</b> The House has taken one small swipe at Goals 2000, the omnibus education legislation that transferred unprecedented education authority from localities to Washington, D.C.  Last month, the House passed H.R. 1045, which would eliminate NESIC, the equivalent of a national school board set up by the law.  Congress should now repeal <i>all</i> of the intrusive programs instituted by Goals 2000.  Kudos to Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who has raised the issue in the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee, and to Gov. George Allen of Virginia, who has refused to accept Goals 2000 funding for his state.  We have to free our children from the control of the national education bureaucrats and their allies at the National Education Association.
<p>
<a name="purse"><center><h3>Protect the Family Purse</h3></center>
<p>
<b>8. Pro-child Tax Credits.</b> The $500-per-child tax credit helps relieve the tax burden on American families.  The House of Representatives has passed a tax bill that includes the $500-per-child credit and has also included it in its budget resolution.  Unfortunately, the credit's fate in the Senate is uncertain:  key Republican senators are raising doubts about the bill, and the Senate budget resolution passed on May 25 omitted it.  The Senate should change course and act to protect the family budget as it works to fix the federal budget.
<p>
<b>9. Don't Forget Health Reform.</b> Rep. Bill Archer (R-Tex.) has drafted legislation, not yet introduced, to change the income tax code to permit individual Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs).  These MSAs would give individuals and families greater control over their health care decisions, resulting in your family having coverage even if you change jobs, decreased costs, and broadened access to health care services.  FRC has joined a coalition of pro-family groups to promote such legislation.  The effort in 1994 to turn over health care to the government -- socialized medicine -- was defeated.  Sound reform is more critical now than ever.
<p>
<a name="wilderness"><center><h3>Tame the Cultural Wilderness</h3></center>
<p>
<b>10. Ban Homosexuality in Uniform.</b> Most Americans thought the military homosexual issue was resolved when Congress passed a reform bill in 1993.  Wrong.  The Clinton administration ignored the text of the law when it wrote the implementing regulations, effectively lifting the ban anyway.  Now the administration is using the federal courts to get around public opinion and scuttle the ban by building a losing case in the Supreme Court.  New legislation is imperative.  None is pending, but FRC's Military Readiness Project, with senior advisers former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Thomas Moorer and former Marine Corps Commandant Robert Barrow, is seeking Congressional support for appropriate amendments to the 1996 Defense Authorization Act.
<p>
<b>11. Porn-Free Cable TV.</b> With the encouragement of FRC, Reps. Tony Hall (D-Ohio) and Chris Smith (R-N.J.) have introduced legislation that would require cable TV operators to provide basic cable packages free of pornography.  Meanwhile, pro-family groups are working on alternatives to Sen. Jim Exon's (D-Neb.) Communications Decency Act of 1995, S. 314.   Exon's bill is a well-intentioned attempt to restrict transmission of pornography via computer, but may actually make it more difficult to prosecute.
<p>
<b>12. Porn-Free PXs</b>. Under current policy, military exchange managers are responsible to select magazines based on sales volume, customer preferences, and, in the case of pornographic material, whether or not it fits the definition of "obscenity" outlined in the 1973 Supreme Court case of <i>Miller v. California</i>.  The services oppose removing so-called "soft-core" pornography from exchange shelves because of the threat of legal action from the ACLU.  President Clinton has the unilateral authority to remove pornographic material from military stores.  He should do so, and Congress should adopt a resolution urging that action upon him.
<p>
<a name="misguided"><center><h3>Reform Misguided Federal Programs</h3></center>
<p>
<b>13. True Welfare Reform.</b> The full Senate should vote on a measure to restore the anti-illegitimacy provisions that were adopted by the House but then eliminated by the Senate Finance Committee on May 25.  The critical provisions are:  a restriction on federally funded cash benefits for adolescent unwed mothers; a "cap" on benefits  to mothers who bear additional children while on welfare; and bonus payments to states that succeed in reducing their illegitimacy rates without increasing the number of abortions.
<p>
<b>14. X Out Title X.</b> Title X of the Public Health Service Act -- a program which funds family planning projects throughout the country -- has been a dismal failure, especially among teenagers.  Since it began in 1970, out-of-wedlock births, pregnancies, and abortions among teenagers have all risen sharply.  Sexually transmitted diseases have multiplied in variety and are on the rebound as well.  Last year, Title X received $194 million in your tax money.  This summer, FRC will work to change that figure to zero.  Planned Parenthood will be poorer, but adolescent well-being should flourish.
<p>
<b>15. Cures, Not Activism.</b> Federal taxpayers spend billions on AIDS through the Ryan White Care Act. Unfortunately, much money now goes to groups promoting homosexuality to school-children through "AIDS education." The Act is the single largest source of funds for homosexual activism. A Washington, D.C., recipient, the Whitman-Walker Clinic, endorses "safe" bathhouse sex (with condoms) and holds gay political seminars. Basic reform is needed.
<p>
<a name="ideas"><center><h3>Other Family-Friendly Ideas</h3></center>
<p>
<b>16. Women at Arms.</b> The Clinton administration has conducted an aggressive campaign to thrust women into military combat.  Women can now be assigned to more than 80 percent of all military positions -- many combat-related.  Meanwhile, Congress has failed to host hearings to examine the recommendations of the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, which opposed many of the recent changes.  The administration, with Congressional neglect, has advanced a feminist agenda without regard for readiness.  Congress should convene hearings and prepare legislation that puts readiness first.  If they don't, someday soon your daughter could be drafted.
<p>
<b>17. Off the Dole.</b> The Integrity in Government Act (H.R. 1130), sponsored by Rep. Bob Dornan (R-Cal.), would limit federally funded persons or organizations, such as contractors and advocacy groups, from lobbying Congress for more funding.  It would also prohibit lobbyists from receiving federal funds.  The legislation would not apply to recipients of entitlements and would not restrict the ability of individual citizens to communicate with their elected representatives.
<p>
<b>18. Revitalize Drug Abuse Prevention.</b> Drug abuse among teenagers has increased significantly in recent years.  This change is attributable to a resurgence of pro-drug sentiment in popular culture, less-than-effective prevention programs, and President Clinton's silence on the issue.  The administration's drug strategy focuses on "harm reduction" -- treatment for chronic drug users and less enforcement.  Meanwhile, Congress is considering cuts in drug prevention programs.  Any long-term solution requires parental involvement, community programs, and strong national leadership.  New legislation is needed to address this plague. 
<p>
<b>19. Liberate the Arts.</b> The House passed a budget resolution (H. Con. Res. 67) on May 18, providing no funds for the National Endowment for the Arts or the National Endowment for the Humanities.  The resolution also ends funding for public television after three years.  A separate bill (H.R. 1557), passed by a House committee on May 10, would phase out the endowments by 1999.  Meanwhile, several senators have introduced S. 856, a bill that would keep the NEA alive.  FRC and other pro-family forces favor total defunding.  Artists need their freedom -- and so do taxpayers.
<p>
<b>20. Restore Religious Rights.</b> Rep. Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) is heading a congressional coalition in drafting an amendment to the U.S. Constitution which would restore to individuals and groups the right to speak and express their religious beliefs.  The language of the amendment is not yet final, but it is expected to include provisions preventing the government from prohibiting prayer or other forms of religious expression wherever non-religious expression is permitted.  The amendment is also likely to ban discrimination against or denying benefits to groups on account of their religious identity or ideas.  No more second-class status for this First Amendment freedom.
<p>
<b>21. Restore Parental Rights.</b> Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) and Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) are working on legislation to prohibit the government from interfering with the right of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their children.  Such a law would, for instance, support parents who want to opt their children out of offensive sex education programs.  State constitutional amendments to protect parental rights have also been introduced in over half of the states.  Public policy cannot put families first if it does not empower parents.
<p>
<b>22. Defund Anti-Family Legal Activism.</b> Pro-family groups are calling for defunding of the Legal Services Corporation.  The $415 million per year program purports to provide legal services to the poor but often engages in politically motivated legal assaults on the family.  Since 1974, taxpayers have given LSC $5 billion, some of it used for things like obtaining cable TV for prisoners, fighting welfare reform, seeking public abortion funding, and forcing states to fund sex-change operations.

<a name="meaning"><center><h3>The Meaning of Family</h3></center>
<p>
On the grounds of the U.S. Capitol there is a small cluster of crab apple trees, one of the most moving monuments in all of Washington.  The cluster was planted on June 12, 1952 in memory of the Sullivan brothers, five sons of Iowa who died in 1942 during an attack upon the <i>U.S.S. Juneau</i> in the Solomon Islands.
<p>
After this devastating tragedy, the U.S. Navy changed its policy allowing service by family members on the same vessel.  Never again would a single American family lay, simultaneously, so "costly a sacrifice on the altar of freedom." (A. Lincoln)
<p>
In 1942 the contributions of American families -- the meaning of <i>family</i> -- to our nation's well-being and survival were never in question.  Today, as the accompanying <i>Blueprint</i> shows, our nation is at grave risk of forgetting all that the courage and faithfulness of families have given this land.
<p>
As Americans commemorate the family during this month of June -- from  
celebrations honoring the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, to Father's Day -- Congress could give the nation no greater gift than to make pro-family legislation a priority.
<p>
FRC's writers and analysts are working overtime to bring the best family policy analysis to print.  Our recently expanded Government Relations staff is responding to an over-rising tide of requests for information.  Your partnership with us in this effort is essential.  FRC deeply appreciates your prayers and financial support.  If you can remember FRC with an additional gift this month, thank you.  Please use the enclosed reply card.

<P>
	I am not the kind of guy who normally takes part in feminist "consciousness-raising" efforts.  But I am participating in Take Your Daughter to Work Day today because I have an eight-year-old daughter whose self-esteem matters a great deal to me.
<P>
	For the uninitiated, Take Your Daughter To Work Day is an annual event dreamed up by the Ms. Foundation in response to research showing that girls' self-esteem often plummets during the fragile pre-teen and early adolescent years.  By exposing young girls to successful women in the workplace, organizers hope that girls will learn to think more highly of females in general and of themselves in particular.
<P>
	I have a great day planned for my daughter, Allison.  This morning, I plan to take her by the offices of two women whose job it is to meet regularly with members of Congress and other public officials.  Then, I plan to have her talk with a young woman who just finished graduate school at Johns Hopkins University and is now serving as a health policy analyst.  At lunch, she'll chat with a woman who does some public speaking, and another who crunches numbers in our accounting department.  Finally, in the late afternoon, Allison is scheduled to meet with a woman who used to practice law and now manages a bevy of staff writers.
<P>
	I am sure all of this will be interesting to Allison.  But the time I am most looking forward to is the ride home.  For it is then that I plan to point out to my daughter that some of the exciting tasks carried out by my female colleagues in the workplace are tasks my wife performed in jobs she held prior to motherhood.  She used to meet regularly with congressmen and senators.  She used to do some writing and public speaking.  And she has a Phi Beta Kappa key from hr college days.
<P>
	After I remind my daughter of these things, I plan to turn to her and look her in the eye and say, "Allison, you must be a very special young girl.  Your mother could be using her talents and skills in all sorts of jobs in the workplace, but she has chosen instead to use them at home teaching you.  She must love you very, very much and think you are very, very important."
<P>
	Somehow, I think that at that moment my daughter' self-esteem will rise to a level heretofore unimagined by the organizers of Take Your Daughter to Work Day.  And for that I owe debt of gratitude to my wife, whose esteem-building job as a mother at home rarely receives the public esteem it deserves.
<P>

<center><h1>TYRANNY IN ROBES</h1></center>

<p>

<font size=+3>O</font>n May 20, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling 
whose destructive power may rival the infamous <I>Roe v. Wade</I> 
(1973) decision.

<p>

In <I>Romer v.  Evans</I>, the court voted 6-3 to strike
down a voter-approved amendment to Colorado's constitution that
would have prevented homosexuality from being added to civil rights
laws by the state and local governments.  The people of Colorado
had voted for Amendment 2 in response to adoption of homosexual
rights laws in several cities, including Denver and Aspen.  The
amendment took no rights away from homosexuals, merely ensuring
that homosexuality would not receive preferential treatment.

<p>

<center><h3>800,000 Bigots?</h3></center>

<p>

Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority, concluded
that the voters were motivated only by &quot;animus&quot; toward
homosexuals, seeking to deny them access to the political process.
In effect, he called more than 800,000 Coloradans &quot;hate-filled
bigots&quot; for withholding a powerful legal weapon from homosexual
activists.

<p>

In a scathing dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia said the ruling
has &quot;no foundation in American constitutional law and barely
pretends to. ... Amendment 2 is designed to prevent piecemeal deterioration
of the sexual morality favored by a majority of Coloradans ... striking
it down is an act, not of judicial judgment, but of political
will.&quot;

<p>

Scalia noted that under the court's reasoning, polygamists
could demand redress because they are disadvantaged by state laws
prohibiting polygamy.  He asked whether the court had somehow
concluded that polygamy was a greater social harm than homosexuality.
Scalia also noted that the majority had completely ignored the
1986 <I>Bowers v. Hardwick</I> case, which established that states
can criminalize sodomy.  If states can do that, he wrote, then
surely they can deny &quot;preferential treatment&quot; to a class
that defines itself solely by its willingness to engage in that
behavior.

<p>

Homosexual activists celebrated the <I>Romer</I> ruling.
Conservative activist Paul Weyrich and Colorado for Family Values
President Will Perkins called for impeachment of the six majority
justices, who include Reagan appointee Kennedy, Sandra Day O'Connor
(Reagan), David Souter (Bush), John Paul Stevens (Ford),  Stephen
Breyer (Clinton) and Ruth Bader Ginsburg (Clinton).  Other leaders
raised the question of judicial term limits and of activating
Congress' constitutional power to limit which cases the Supreme
Court can rule upon.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>
"NOT JUDICIAL JUDGMENT,<br>
BUT POLITICAL WILL."
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

The court did stop short of elevating &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
to the same level of protection as race, ethnicity and other traditional
civil rights categories.  But the legal effect may be less than
the cultural effect.  Within hours of the decision, a lesbian
attorney in Florida said the court had ruled that homosexuality
could not be taken into account in child custody cases.  The court
did no such thing, but such broad interpretations can now be expected
to be routinely advanced in homosexuality-related cases.

<p>

<center><h3>Pass DOMA Now</h3></center>

<p>

Citizens who believe in traditional morality and the rule
of law must now rally around the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA),
a federal bill that defines marriage as &quot;the union of one
man and one woman as husband and wife&quot; and allows states
to ignore out-of-state marriage licenses issued to homosexual
couples.

<p>

Liberal judges in Hawaii are expected to legalize homosexual
&quot;marriage&quot; as early as September, and homosexuals are
preparing to fly to Hawaii, get &quot;married,&quot; and claim
marital status in their home states.  Given the Supreme Court's
usurpation of power in Colorado, passage of DOMA (H.R. 3396) and
(S. 1740) is imperative.  DOMA will reassert the constitutional
authority of Congress, send the courts the message that America
will not surrender to homosexual activists, and secure marriage
against radical redefinition.  So far, 11 states have passed bills
protecting marriage, but DOMA is needed immediately to protect
the federal code and state marriage laws.

<p>

<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>

<p>

Call or write your senators and congressman and urge them
to sponsor DOMA, not merely pledge to vote for it.  The Capitol
Hill switchboard is 202-225-3121.  Addresses:  U.S. Senate, Washington,
D.C.  20510; U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, D.C. 
20515.  Also, ask your state representatives to pass a marriage
protection law at the state level.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>Medicare Package.</b> The Medicare trustees issued a report
on June 5 indicating that Medicare Part A (payment for hospital
costs) may become insolvent by 2001.  The Part A trust fund lost
$2.6 billion in 1995.  The trustees recommended that an independent
commission develop a long-term strategy. Congress passed a budget
last year which limited projected increases in Medicare spending
to an annual average of 6.4 percent.  President Clinton vetoed
that plan and insists that Congress enact his more limited proposal.
An election year resolution of this issue is unlikely.

<p>

<b>No Relief in Sight.</b> Family tax relief continues to receive
consideration on Capitol Hill, even as the presidential candidates
float various tax cut plans.  Congressional leaders may include
the child credit in a package with welfare and Medicaid reform,
or include it as part of a separate tax package.  President Clinton
threatens to veto any bill that contains the Republicans' proposed
Medicaid reforms, but it does not appear that he will sign the
tax cuts without comparable cuts in spending.  Sounds like another
&quot;Catch-22&quot; situation.

<p><a name="privacy">

<b>Preventing Predators.</b> The Children's Privacy Protection
and Parental Empowerment Act of 1996 was introduced by Congressman
Bob Franks (R-N.J.) on May 22. The purpose of this bill is to
empower parents to further protect their children from child predators.
The bill would allow parents to learn what information commercial
vendors have obtained about their children, where the information
originated, and where it has been distributed.  People who prey
on children should not be able to purchase, receive, sell, or
in any way handle personal information about children.

<p>

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p>

<b>No Federal Cradle.</b> Many news stories on the Stand for
Children rally sponsored by the Children's Defense Fund asked
the same questions FRC raised at a press conference the day before
the event:  Is more spending on failed federal programs really
helping children?  Or are liberal advocacy groups just using children
as props to make one last stand for big government?  FRC argued
that strong parents are still the best advocates for children.
Society's role is to help rebuild healthy communities that strengthen
the hands of those who rock the cradles.

<p>

<b>Dues Under Duress.</b> A new House Republican task force on
labor policy has recommended legislation that would protect union
members from being forced to pay dues to fund partisan politics.
In the 1994 election, 40 percent of union members voted for conservative
candidates while union chiefs generally backed liberals.  Giving
workers an option to restrict their dues to collective bargaining
purposes is an obvious way to protect the integrity of representative
government while protecting workers' interests -- and putting
hard-earned dollars back in the pockets of American workers.

<p>

<b>Justice Denied.</b> Some black youngsters in a Washington,
D.C. suburb were almost denied the chance to see how faith and
hard work can pay off in America.  Supreme Court Justice Clarence
Thomas was publicly disinvited to speak at a student awards ceremony
in early June when a school official threatened to disrupt the
event.  Although the school board ultimately voted to reinvite
Thomas, the whole spectacle sent a troubling message to students,
who, fortunately, ultimately got to hear Thomas's powerful message
of personal virtue and equality before the law.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Globe</h3></center>

<p><a name="beijing">

<b>Costly Habitat.</b> From June 3-14 in Istanbul, Turkey, Habitat
II, the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements, built
on the anti-family agendas of previous U.N. conferences, this
time focusing on the environmental and economic challenges of
rapid urbanization.  Urging more efforts to implement that agenda,
Clinton Secretary of State Warren Christopher called for a moratorium
on further U.N. world conferences.  And none too soon.  A recent
General Accounting Office study found that the U.S. Government
spent a whopping $5.9 million on the U.N. Conference on Women
held last September in Beijing, China.

<p>

<b>Rewarding Tyranny.</b> On June 3, President Clinton formally
announced his intention to extend &quot;most favored nation&quot;
(MFN) trade privileges to China.  Unless Congress quickly opposes
Clinton's stand, China will continue to enjoy low tariffs on exports
to the U.S.  FRC opposes extending China's MFN status not only
because the U.S. runs a trade deficit of $34 billion every year
with China, but especially because of China's myriad human rights
abuses, such as forced abortion and sterilization policies, exploitation
of prisoners as slave laborers, and systematic persecution of
Christians.

<p>

<b>Wirth Stumbles.</b> During a Senate Foreign Relations Committee
hearing June 4, chairman Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) put two questions
to witness Timothy Wirth, Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs.
Citing Hillary Clinton's speech during the U.N. Beijing conference,
where she strongly denounced sex selection abortion and mandatory
abortion, Helms asked Wirth if the Clinton administration would
support legislation outlawing sex selection abortion in the U.S.
and admitting refugees fleeing China's coercive abortion policies.
Wirth could not answer either question directly, saying there
were &quot;other implications&quot; which needed to be considered.

<h3>Parental Rights Vote Near</h3>

<p>

The recent pro-big-government &quot;Stand for Children&quot;
rally in Washington, D.C. had little in common with the growing
grass-roots parental rights movement, except for its focus on
children.  The Family Research Council's message to rally participants
was that government programs can never provide what children vitally
need -- parents raising them with love and direction.  Which is
to say, parents are irreplaceable.

<p>

With public school officials handing condoms to pre-teens,
it is no wonder that the parental rights movement has captured
the public's attention.  Parents across the country are finding
their voice against intrusive state and federal governments.
At the state level, parents are supporting constitutional amendments
which protect the right of parents to direct the upbringing and
education of their children without unwanted government infringement.
At the federal level, parents are supporting the Parental Rights
and Responsibilities Act of 1996 (PRRA), which simply codifies
Supreme Court rulings that parents have a fundamental right to
raise their children which the government must respect.

<p>

That parents, not government, should have the primary responsibility
and authority in raising their children seems beyond dispute.
Yet, the ubiquitous ACLU and their education counterpart, the
National Education Association, have weighed in with heavy protests.
They are fond of presenting hypothetical &quot;horror stories&quot;
of child abuse they claim the PRRA will permit, yet the bill specifically
excludes abusive parents from its protection.

<p>

In contrast to these theoretical concerns, real-life instances
of outrageous government violations of parents rights persist.
If the PRRA were law, parents in Pennsylvania would probably
not have had to file suit against the East Stroudsburg public
school for forcing their sixth-grade daughters to undergo vaginal
examinations without their knowledge or consent and over the tearful
protestations of the girls.  This flagrant usurpation of the right
of parents to make health care decisions for their children would
not be tolerated under the PRRA.  Without it, the Pennsylvania
parents have little certainty of success.

<p>

A vote on the PRRA is expected before August.  Call 202-225-3121
and urge your congressman and senators to vote for the PRRA (H.R.
1946; S. 984).  For information on state initiatives, contact
Of the People at 703-351-5051.

<h3>Indecent Opinion</h3>

<p>

The District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania
has ruled against provisions of the Communications Decency Act
(CDA), the first major anti-pornography legislation for cyberspace.
This is a sad defeat with ominous implications for the burgeoning,
new &quot;global community.&quot;  The Clinton Justice Department
will appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.

<p>

The CDA was passed as part of the Telecommunications Reform
bill in February 1996.  It seeks to protect children from sexually
explicit material on the Internet by prohibiting adults from knowingly
sending or displaying &quot;indecent material&quot; to kids.
It imposes criminal penalties for violation of the law.

<p>

The ACLU and a coalition of liberal groups and on-line service
providers filed the challenge to the CDA in Philadelphia.  A similar
challenge was filed in New York and is still pending.  The Family
Research Council and the National Law Center for Children and
Families submitted 400 pages of legal argument and exhibits on
behalf of anti-pornography groups defending the CDA.  Judge Delores
Sloviter, a Carter appointee, headed the Philadelphia three-judge
panel which heard testimony this spring from ACLU and government
witnesses.

<p>

The CDA uses the time-tested standard of &quot;indecency&quot;
to draw the line between material that is appropriate for adults
but not for children.  &quot;Indecent material&quot; is defined
as material depicting or describing sexual or excretory activities
or organs which, in context, is presented in a patently offensive
manner.  The Supreme Court has ruled that adults have a First
Amendment right to receive indecent material and share it with
other adults, but no right to foist it upon children.  The indecency
standard has protected children in the broadcast television, radio,
and telephone media.

<p>

At closing arguments in Philadelphia, it was clear that the
ACLU was not simply quarreling with this particular law, but was
advocating no restrictions whatsoever on the dissemination of
computer pornography to children.  The Philadelphia court was
openly hostile to the Justice Department and its defense of the
CDA, and its ruling absurdly implies that the advancement of Internet
technology depends upon unfettered exhibition of sexual material
to children.

the other day.  That's not so unusual, since we receive many calls
and letters from active duty military.  But Captain Panzera's
card came to us from <I>Antarctica.</I>

<p>

That's a dramatic example of how far and wide the
message of FRC is traveling these days.  It's not at all unusual
for us to host meetings with pastors from Southern Africa, champions
of religious liberty from Russia and pro-family leaders from Canada,
Australia and New Zealand.  The international interest in Family
Research Council is a reflection of the global nature of the threat
to the family.

<p>

I always try to give encouragement to our friends from abroad.
They often report feeling &quot;overwhelmed&quot; by a tide of
pornography, drugs, abortion and sexual misconduct.  I share with
our allies some of the expanding array of communications tools
we use to get our message out.  In trying to support them, I find
that <I>I</I> am uplifted. Let me share with you, a regular reader
of <I>Washington Watch,</I> the growing array of devices we have
used in the fight for faith, family and freedom.

<p>

As Americans reduce their reliance on the liberal talking
heads of TV network news, radio has filled the gap.  Sure, there
are the Howard Sterns and Don Imuses, but well-informed pro-family
callers to radio talk shows shatter the media myths about our
movement.  My nickname for conservative programs broadcast from
our nation's capital is &quot;Radio Free Washington.&quot;  I'm
proud that Focus on the Family's news and information feature,
<I>Family News in Focus</I> (FNIF), is broadcast to hundreds of
religious stations every day.  FNIF's Washington bureau, and its
veteran chief, Carl Ramsey, are good neighbors to FRC.

<p>

My daily radio commentary, which bears the same title as
this newsletter, keeps many of you informed of late-breaking
stories and my perspective on the issues.  You can call our FRC
toll-free line at 1-800-225-4008 to obtain a listing of 
participating stations in your community.

<p>

FRC's <I>Legislative Hotline</I> is easily reached by dialing
1-202-783-HOME.  It's available 24 hours a day and is put together
each week (or more frequently as events warrant) by our top-notch
government relations staff.  You can also receive the text of
the <I>Hotline</I> via FAX.  Just call our Government Relations
department at 1-202-393-2100.

FRC's staff includes some intrepid &quot;cybernauts&quot;
who are using the latest technology to make sure we are represented
on the Internet.  Our site is located at: http://www.frc.org.
I confess I'm a bit &quot;low-tech.&quot; My word processor is
located under my hat, and I carry my printer around in my shirt
pocket.  But for those of you who find that the world begins with
a keyboard, our Internet site should please you.

horns with Rep. Barney Frank).  And CBS-TV's <I>Face the Nation</I> 
gave me yet another opportunity to tout the Defense of Marriage
Act (DOMA).  As gratifying as these major media appearances are,
it's good to know that FRC isn't dependent on others to spread
our message.  We have our own means of getting the word out.
And that word is clearly reaching the ends of the earth.

<p><hr size=5 noshade><p>
<a name="compact"><center><h1>An American Compact</h1></center>
<p>
<font size=+3>O</font>ne year after the Republican Contract with America, 
FRC President Gary Bauer has written a book in which he announces &quot;A 
Compact with Our Fellow Americans.&quot; Like the GOP Contract,
this Compact is an effort to put down on paper the goals of a movement. 
It follows in the long tradition of &quot;getting it in writing&quot; which 
has characterized our people's history, from Magna Carta to the U.S. 
Constitution.  Like the Contract, too, it contains 10 key items and invites 
supporters to sign on.
<p>
But the Compact differs in that it seeks to go beyond reforms to be enacted 
by Congress. Rather, it emphasizes actions which Americans can take in their 
homes, churches and communities, even if reform is thwarted in Congress. 
The Compact also differs in that any American, regardless of party ties, 
can freely subscribe to it.  The &quot;Compact with Our Fellow Americans&quot; 
touches on what Alexis de Tocqueville called the &quot;habits of the heart&quot;
which define and preserve us as a free people.
<p>
<center><h3>What We Want</h3></center>
<p>
The Compact is part of Gary Bauer's new book, <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams:
A Vision for America</i>. The book is being published this month by Focus 
on the Family. <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</i> is an effort to go directly to 
Americans, to appeal to their hearts, <i>without the reinterpretation and
distortion of the major media</i>. It seeks to answer the question so often 
asked by brusque reporters, but which is also asked with sincerity by many 
of our fellow citizens:  &quot;What do you people want?&quot;
<p>
Bauer states the case for a pro-family America.  He tackles head-on
not only the issues which shape our political choices, but, more importantly, 
those cultural questions, beliefs and actions which determine whether our 
American experiment in ordered liberty will survive at all.  Despite
the facts that we are not at war and that Wall Street's Dow Jones
Index has been daily reaching new highs, most people think our country is 
on the wrong track.
<p>
Bauer recently spoke to this anxiety when he told Dan Rather: &quot;I 
want to see an America where I don't have to worry about date rape when my 
daughter goes out for the first time at college. I want an America where, 
when a young man pledges to love and honor her for the rest of their lives, 
there is a good chance he means it.  I want a country where children come 
first again and where virtue is honored, a place where values matter and 
the American Dream is still real.&quot;
<p>
<i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</i> is not just a policy manual.  It goes behind
today's headlines and tomorrow's talk shows to explore the reasons why 
conservatives defend the family as the fundamental unit of society. It 
describes in detail what this nation would look like if the pro-family
cause were to triumph.  It seeks to summarize the aspirations of families 
and to quell the fears of citizens who have been urged by the polarizing 
media to view &quot;family values&quot; with grave suspicion.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>&quot;MOVE BEYOND<br>
BREAD-ALONE POLITICS...&quot;</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
Even though the book includes over 100 public policy recommendations,
it ultimately resists the temptation to put &quot;our trust in princes,&quot; 
as if the cure for America's ills could be found in Washington. It challenges 
our national leadership to move beyond &quot;bread-alone&quot; politics.  It
includes some thoughtful questions for citizens to ask all candidates
who seek power over us, giving pro-family Americans the chance to shape 
public debate.
<p>
<center><h3>Getting the Word Out</h3></center>
<p>
Look for <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams: A Vision for America</i> at your local
Christian bookstore, or use the enclosed card to order from us.  Urge your 
neighborhood group, your church, your public library to obtain copies. 
Share them with family and friends who may be sympathetic but skeptical. 
This is a year of decision.  The decisions that are made will shape the world 
our children inherit.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>
<p>
<b>Kinsey's Pedo-File.</b>  U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Tex.) has introduced
a bill, with over 40 cosponsors, calling for federal investigation into the 
infamous Kinsey sex studies.  The &quot;Child Protection and Ethics in 
Education Act&quot; also calls for a cut-off of federal funds to programs 
that use the Kinsey research uncritically.  Media attention continues
to build regarding Kinsey Institute Director John Bancroft's admission that 
a key table on child sexuality was based on the records of a single pedophile. 
FRC has publicly called on the Institute to identify all of its pedophile 
sources.
<p>
<b>In the Dark.</b> What had originally been slated as a House hearing
to expose &quot;the homosexual agenda in schools&quot; turned into a 
mostly watered-down exercise on &quot;parents, schools and values.&quot; 
The Dec. 5 and 6 hearing drew little media coverage.  Virtually
ignored was shocking testimony by avowed lesbian Claire Connelly of 
Ventura County, California, who gave evidence that millions of taxpayer 
dollars' worth of AIDS programming is being hijacked by homosexual activist
groups. The hearing was held by the House Subcommittee on Oversight
and Investigations.
<p>
<b>Not with My Kid.</b>  A hearing was held in November on the Family
Privacy Protection Act (H.R. 1271), which requires researchers to get 
written parental permission before administering surveys to children. 
FRC's Robert Knight supported the bill in testimony before the Senate 
Committee on Governmental Affairs.  Knight said the law is needed because 
some researchers are prying into family matters and/or asking children 
graphic questions about sex. The FRC video about Alfred Kinsey, <i>The 
Children of Table 34</i>, was submitted to the committee to illustrate 
research run amok.
<p><a name="abortion">
<b>Life Gains.</b> On Dec. 7, the Senate passed the Partial-Birth Abortion
Ban Act, 54-44.  Since the Senate-passed version has been amended slightly, 
a final version still must be approved by the House, possibly by the end of 
January.  After final congressional approval, the bill will go to
President Clinton, who threatens to veto it.  While thousands of Americans 
are calling the White House about this legislation, it is also important to 
educate your neighbors by writing letters to the editor and calling talk 
radio programs.
<p>
<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Slippery Summit.</b> Ever since the 1989 governors' education summit
in Charlottesville, Va., produced the National Education Goals and 
prompted Goals 2000, Americans are rightly suspicious of such gatherings. 
When word got out last summer about a follow-up meeting to recommit to 
the national goals, the ensuing uproar scuttled the meeting. Now a summit 
is scheduled for March 26-27 in Palisades, New York.  Business leaders
have been invited to join governors to discuss opportunities for participation 
in the Goals 2000 school restructuring. Unfortunately, a new partner in a bad 
venture won't improve it.
<p>
<b>Holiday Spirit.</b> On Dec. 19, Andrei Codrescu, a commentator on
National Public Radio's <i>All Things Considered</i>, said this about 
the Christian concept of Rapture: &quot;The evaporation of four
million who believe in this crap would leave the world a better
place.&quot;  The taxpayer-funded NPR issued an apology. The week 
before Christmas, NPR also devoted considerable air time to commentators 
who tried to debunk Christianity.  And it was business as usual over 
at PBS, which re-aired the sexually explicit homosexual series <i>Tales 
of the City</i>.
<p>
<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>
<p><a name="npr">
<b>New Allies?</b> While the fate of the GOP's $500 per child tax credit
remains tied up in the budget deadlock, the National Parenting Association 
(NPA), a liberal academic group, has begun to lobby for pro-family tax cuts. 
On Dec. 15, an NPA youth violence task force hosted testimony
from representatives of Promise Keepers, the Christian pro-fatherhood
group that reached 826,000 men in 1995.  Meanwhile, a new Heritage Foundation 
study shows that the Clinton family tax cut covers 23 million fewer children 
than the GOP proposal.
<p>
<b>Maine Rebounds.</b> Pro-family forces have won a big victory in the
Pine Tree State.  For the first time in 20 years, Maine legislators won't 
face homosexual rights legislation in 1996.  An openly lesbian state 
senator withdrew the bill, citing the need for &quot;healing&quot;
on the issue.  But the real reason was the bill's certain defeat.  In 
November, voters narrowly rejected a statewide referendum that would 
have struck down local gay rights laws.  Outspent 10 to one, pro-family 
forces still snagged 47 percent of the vote, sending lawmakers a message.
<p>
<b>Saving Marriages.</b> Divorce reform is gaining momentum in the new
year.  Michigan and Iowa are among states likely to consider bills that 
reintroduce the fault concept in contested cases where children are present. 
Randy Hekman, head of the Michigan Family Forum, a member of the Association 
of State Policy Councils, points out that under current law, &quot;I can 
divorce my wife of 26 years with less difficulty than I can fire a 
secretary I hired last week.&quot;

<p><a name="porn">
<h3>Cyberprogress</h3>
<p>
At the end of 1995, staff members for the House and Senate
conferees on the large telecommunications deregulation bill came to 
agreement on strong pornography restrictions, but only after a series 
of tough negotiations.  Leaving pornography unrestricted in cyberspace 
would be like leaving a loaded gun on a playground.  If the &quot;telecom
bill&quot; is passed, the anti-cyberporn language will help parents protect 
their children by making pornography inaccessible by children.
<p>
Highlights of the cyberporn provisions as negotiated include:
<p><ul>
<li>Use of a court-approved indecency standard, defined in
the bill as an <b>&quot;image or other communication that, in context, 
depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by 
contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or 
organs&quot;</b>;
<p>
<li>Indecent communications are available to adults but <b>barred
to children</b>;
<p>
<li>People are liable only for <b>knowing violations</b> of the law;
<p>
<li>Online service providers are not liable for violations beyond areas 
they own or control;
<p>
<li>E-mail privacy laws are left unchanged;
<p>
<li>Those making good faith efforts to keep pornography away
from children have a defense against prosecution.
</ul><p>
Contrary to much of the current rhetoric from civil libertarians,
the anti-cyberporn provisions could not be used to find Shakespeare or 
any other serious work of literature or art to be indecent. Adults with 
common sense do not confuse art and literature with patently offensive
materials which degrade women, harm children, and corrupt men.
Under the indecency standard, the courts will be obliged to evaluate 
material in its proper context.
<p>
A few other provisions of the bill remained unresolved as <i>Watch</i> 
went to press. Congressional leaders should make every effort to conclude 
these matters as soon as possible, so that we do not risk losing the 
opportunity to protect our children from the cultural poison of cyberporn.
<p>
FRC's legal policy director took part in the negotiations leading to 
these provisions.  In the past, telecommunications reform has happened once 
a generation. FRC will continue to monitor this legislation in the days 
to come.

<h3>FRC: Ready and Abel</h3>
<p>
FRC's Military Readiness Project (MRP) is challenging the Clinton
administration's military personnel policies in the courts.  On Dec. 5, the 
MRP had the rare privilege to make oral arguments before the U.S. Circuit 
Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., in the case of <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i>. 
Thomasson is an avowed homosexual who wants the military's ban declared 
unconstitutional.  The MRP defended the law's intended meaning, while
the U.S. Justice Department hid behind the Clinton administration's faulty 
regulations.  A decision is expected in April.
<p>
Last summer, the MRP filed a brief in <i>Abel et al. v. U.S.A.</i>, which
involves six avowedly homosexual service members.  This case was scheduled 
for oral argument in the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan on Dec. 
19.  That hearing was delayed after a Clinton-appointed judge was reminded 
that he had made a biased comment about the issue.  The hearing was re-set 
for mid-January with a decision expected this spring.  This case will
compete with <i>Thomasson</i> for a high court hearing next year.
<p>
On other fronts, the MRP worked with key members of Congress
to close a loophole in President Clinton's regulations on homosexuals. 
In response to Hill queries, the Pentagon's general counsel wrote a 
memo to the services clarifying Clinton's &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; 
regulations which say that &quot;sexual orientation&quot; is not a bar to 
military service. The memo was necessary because last summer a Navy 
administrative board used the faulty regulations to retain an avowed lesbian 
who promised to avoid homosexual acts.
<p>
Meanwhile, on Dec. 15, the MRP filed a Supreme Court brief in
<i>U.S.A. v. Commonwealth of Virginia</i> (the Virginia Military Institute 
case).  The Clinton administration wants the high court to impose a 
&quot;strict scrutiny&quot; standard which would make all classifications 
by gender very hard to defend legally.  With high court approval, this would 
amount to back-door adoption of the Equal Rights Amendment, reviving old 
debates about everything from the Boy Scouts to unisex bathrooms. It would 
also remove most gender-based exemptions in the military, like women serving
in infantry units.  The FRC brief argues that gender classifications
should be subject to a less exacting standard.

by Gary L. Bauer</center>
<p>
<font size=+3>J</font>ust before Christmas, Family Research Council hosted 
an important event in Washington.  It was a one-day conference, with 
distinguished speakers like authors Michael Novak and Dr. Marvin
Olasky.  The conference was devoted to the tragedy of poverty, with a 
close look at the tricky question of welfare reform.
<p>
I'm more convinced than ever that we must look with new eyes at
the scale of this tragedy.  It's really not enough to say that certain 
kinds of welfare reform will cause suffering.  We have to come to terms 
with the degree of suffering that is happening right now -- and not just 
suffering from material want, but from the sense of purposelessness that
saps the human spirit.
<p>
Those of us who believe most fiercely in the durability of traditional
values are precisely the ones to stand up now and say that every individual 
has qualities that no welfare system should be allowed to destroy. FRC 
recognizes that the best and most compassionate help comes from
private individuals who build personal relationships and offer
material support simultaneously. A hand-up not a handout. The premise is 
that needy individuals are not &quot;clients,&quot; but fellow human
beings.
<p>
America cannot implement neat, clean, top-down policies that will
jumpstart a network of caring in every community.  Instead, each of us must 
take direct action to heal the hurt -- not at the ballot box, but in our 
neighborhoods and communities as we minister daily to needy individuals.
<p>
One happy byproduct is that our own children, by watching our
example, will grow to appreciate what is great and good.  Even strong 
parents depend on the interplay of thoughtful neighbors to help pattern 
right habits of the heart.
<p>
FRC is taking the initiative to encourage a new ethic of caring
because, I believe, social conservatives are the very people who have the 
idealism and initiative to build up a new network of helping institutions. 
As we have begun to speak out, we have discovered that the scale of the
crisis is an unprecedented opportunity for us to demonstrate, in full 
technicolor action, a fundamental truth:  Traditional values are traditional 
because they are functional.

<center><i><font size=+2>TRADITIONAL VALUES<br>
ARE<br>
FUNCTIONAL VALUES</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
When nothing else moves the needle, God's ways work.  His love
binds up wounds.  Our service to those who are hurting is one of the most 
obvious means we have at our disposal to let earth know what heaven looks like. 
God's love looks most beautiful, in fact, against a backdrop of despair.
<p>
Dr. Virgil Gulker, founder of Kids Hope USA, tells a story about
one small step in a child's journey to God.  Kids Hope USA aims to link adult 
volunteers in one-to-one relationships with at-risk children. This Christmas 
season, one volunteer took &quot;her child&quot; to see a Christmas pageant
at her church that included a living nativity.  As Mary, Joseph,
and the baby Jesus took their places, the child Amanda turned to her new 
friend and asked with wide eyes, &quot;Is this real?&quot;  The volunteer 
replied, &quot;Oh yes, Amanda, it's very real.&quot;
<p>
That moment almost undoubtedly left a mark on Amanda's soul. In time, 
I suspect, she will be much more likely to regard that scene as real 
because one of God's loving servants was sitting by her side.

Freshmen members of the House of Representatives are in the media
glare as the budget dispute continues between Congress and the White House. 
The first-termers have been called both &quot;principled citizen 
legislators&quot; and &quot;inflexible extremists.&quot; What's the 
reality?
<p>
Nearly all of the freshmen have strongly endorsed term limits
and committed to do what they think is right, regardless of short-term 
political consequences. They want a balanced budget and tax relief for 
America's families.  Their insistence on these policies led to stronger 
agreements with the Senate than first seemed possible.  They have been 
just as tough in negotiations with the White House.
<p>
Moreover, despite President Clinton's opposition, the freshmen
have helped to restore two abortion limitations that were overturned 
during the last Congress: limits on abortion funding through federal 
health insurance programs and a ban on elective abortions in overseas 
military hospitals.
<p>
Freshmen House members also helped sidetrack a bill to fully fund
the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA).  Their efforts forced the House 
leadership to zero out NEA funding within two years.
<p>
The principles of this freshman class will be further demonstrated
in 1996 as they strive to move parental rights and religious liberties 
legislation through Congress. They are truly making a difference on issues 
vital to pro-family Americans.

<center><h1>CONGRESS ADVANCES PRO-FAMILY AGENDA</h1></center>

<p>

<font size=+3>F</font>rom defending marriage to fighting to prevent the 
killing of the unborn late in pregnancy to presenting an unprecedented
balanced budget with family tax relief, the 104th Congress took
historic steps for America's families, according to Family Research
Council President Gary Bauer.

<p>

<center><h3>Missions Met</h3></center>

<p>

To be sure, the 104th Congress did not achieve all of its
objectives.  But the addition of a large group of conservative
freshmen substantially changed the legislative agenda.  These
freshmen apparently had an impact on national policy even before
they took office.  On Nov. 10, 1994 -- two days after the election
that reversed control of Congress -- the Justice Department abandoned
its two-year effort to weaken the interpretation of a child pornography
statute.  According to a new book by former Surgeon General Joycelyn
Elders, the election results also prompted the administration
to reverse a decision to provide clean needles to drug addicts.

<p>

The new chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the
Constitution, Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.), was in the forefront
of congressional initiatives to defend the traditional definition
of marriage and ban partial-birth abortions.  Canady held very
illuminating hearings in his subcommittee, helping to set the
stage for overwhelming House approval of the Defense of Marriage
Act and the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban.

<p>

Sen. Don Nickles (R-Okla.), the Senate sponsor of the Defense
of Marriage Act (DOMA), fended off an effort by Sens. Ted Kennedy
(D-Mass.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and others to attach the
Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) and other pro-homosexual
amendments to DOMA.  The Human Rights Campaign, a major homosexual
rights advocacy group, took credit for developing this amendment
strategy to &quot;derail&quot; the Defense of Marriage Act, which
they alleged was &quot;hate-driven.&quot;  Nickles and Majority
Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) negotiated an agreement that provided
for a clean vote on DOMA, followed by an up or down vote on Sen.
Kennedy's ENDA proposal.

<p>

An overwhelming majority of senators agreed with the argument
that marriage was not instituted to 'discriminate' against homosexuals,
but rather to unite one man and one woman and provide a strong
foundation for the nurturing of children.  President Clinton signed
DOMA into law at 12:50 a.m. on Sept. 21.  Despite last-minute
phone calls from the president to wavering senators, the Kennedy
homosexual jobs proposal came up one vote short, 49-50.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>
"THE 104TH CONGRESS<br>
TOOK HISTORIC STEPS."
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

Congress produced strong majorities in favor of the Partial-Birth
Abortion Ban, but on Sept. 26 the Senate fell eight votes short
of the two-thirds majority necessary to override a veto.
Despite administration objections, Congress did succeed in enacting
five pro-life provisions as amendments to spending bills.  One
of these measures protects medical schools from the loss of federal
funds if they refuse to provide abortion training. Another restores
a limitation on funding of abortions through federal employees'
health insurance programs.

<p>

<center><h3>More Vetoes</h3></center>

<p>

Several new anti-pornography bills were enacted and signed
into law by the president, but they will face difficult battles
in the courts.  Congress passed a balanced budget and family tax
relief package, but it was vetoed.  A modified welfare reform
package was enacted into law after stronger measures were twice
vetoed.

<p>

Line-item veto authority was provided to the president, effective
January 1997.  Vice President Gore suggested on a weekend news
program that this would give the administration leverage to press
Congress to liberalize welfare policies.

<p>

Since every new Congress starts with a clean slate, the policies
enacted during the past two years will be subject to revision
by the next Congress and president.

<p>

<center><h3>Whose Children Are They?</h3></center>

<p>

Parents, have you encountered
incidents where your rights to parent your children have been
infringed upon, at schools or elsewhere?  Please send all stories
to the attention of FRC congressional liason Jacqueline Halbig,
who is compiling these incidents as part of a research project.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>FDA Checks Parents.</b> House Commerce Committee Chairman
Thomas J. Bliley (R-Va.) recently held hearings into why the FDA
refuses to allow the marketing of an Atlanta mother's drug testing
kit to parents who want to test their children.  FDA regulations
label the kit (a plastic cup and a shipping box) as a &quot;Class
III&quot; medical device, equivalent to an MRI or  pacemaker.
Even though businesses and athletic teams use the same kit, the
FDA claims it &quot;is concerned about issues such as anonymity,
confidentiality, coercion, and family discord.&quot;  Will the
same considerations govern FDA rulings on RU-486?

<p><a name="ex-gay">

<b>Hope for Homosexuals.</b> On Oct. 10, FRC co-sponsored a press
conference for the Second Annual Coming Out of Homosexuality Day
(Oct. 11) and the new support group, Parents, Family and Friends
of Ex-Gays (PFOX).  Hosted by Michael Johnston, a former homosexual
who is HIV-positive, the event was taped for C-SPAN.  FRC Cultural
Studies Director Bob Knight also spoke, along with <I>Lambda Report</I>
editor Peter LaBarbera, the Philadelphia Family Policy Council's
Bill Devlin, Tom and Ann Taylor, who have a homosexual son, and
ex-homosexuals Anthony Falzarano and Jane Boyer.

<p>

<b>Refuge for Abortion Victims.</b> Several immigration provisions
were rolled into the FY 1997 Omnibus Appropriations package, including
a humanitarian measure which allows people fleeing from coercive
abortion policies to seek asylum in the United States.  Effective
immediately, asylum may be granted for up to 1,000 people per
year who have been forcibly aborted or involuntarily sterilized,
or have a well-founded fear of persecution under coercive population
control policies. This restores a similar policy which was effective
under the Reagan and Bush administrations.

<p>

<b>Immigrants and AIDS Treatment.</b> Congress dropped a provision
in its immigration legislation preventing taxpayer-funding of
HIV-AIDS treatment for legal and illegal aliens.  Rep. Lamar Smith
(R-Texas) and Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.), chairmen of House and
Senate immigration subcommittees, said the change could encourage
&quot;thousands of HIV-infected aliens to seek asylum in the U.S.&quot;
Despite a 1993 law barring admission of HIV-positive immigrants,
earlier this year the White House directed the Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) to consider granting asylum to HIV-positive
individuals.

<p>

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Elders on Drugs.</b> As Surgeon General, Joycelyn Elders called
for a drug legalization study, favored giving needles to
addicts and advocated marijuana as medicine.  On Oct. 9, she blamed
the new teenage drug epidemic on easy-to-get marijuana and then
said pot &quot;probably causes very little problem to anyone.&quot;
Marijuana can be addictive, damages the immune system, causes
respiratory diseases and mental disorders, and impairs coordination
and judgment.

<p>

<b>Gagging Chaplains.</b> Air Force Reserve chaplain Fr. Vincent
Rigdon has filed a federal lawsuit against the Secretary of Defense
(<I>Rigdon v. Perry</I>) for interfering with his religious liberty
and free speech by issuing a &quot;gag order&quot; that bars religious
leaders from discussing specific legislation in sermons or counseling.
In June, a Pentagon directive to Catholic military chaplains
prohibited them from &quot;participating or urging others to participate&quot;
in a nationwide postcard mailing to Congress which supported a
vote to override the veto of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.

<p>

<b>Bork's Beatitudes.</b> Will America survive?  Not without
strong churches, says Robert Bork, respected jurist and author
of the controversial new book <I>Slouching Towards Gomorrah: 
Modern Liberalism and American Decline.</I> Bork contends that
the loss of reliable standards of right and wrong has resulted
in a &quot;loss of nerve, which means the community cannot summon
the will to suppress&quot; many social ills such as pornography
and crime. &quot;The Church which ought to be shaping and influencing
culture is instead being influenced by culture,&quot; Bork says.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Insulting Hispanics.</b> Apparently, the Enola Gay controversy
taught the Smithsonian Institute little.  Hispanic Heritage Month,
which ended on Oct. 15, featured Andres Serrano, best known for
his vulgar and anti-Christian art.  (His creations include a crucifix
immersed in a jar of urine.)  The Hispanic community lacks not
for serious artists.  Selecting Serrano &quot;because of the body
of his work&quot; reveals the politically correct values of the
Smithsonian.  Such art merits no taxpayer money.  The real irony
is that Serrano would receive no support if his works glorified
Christian symbols.

<p><a name="pentagon">

<b>PX Porn Challenge.</b> Now that the sale of pornographic materials
at military stores has been prohibited, <I>Penthouse</I> publisher
Bob Guccione is challenging the 1997 Defense Authorization Bill,
claiming it is unconstitutional.  Guccione's magazine alone earned
$1.16 of the $4.6 million in 1995 sales at the Pentagon's worldwide
chain of tax-supported stores.  Mr. Guccione's real gripe with
the new law may be its threat to his revenues.  Getting the U.S.
government out of the porn business has been an accomplishment
10 years in the making.

<p>

<b>BULLETIN --</b> In education news, the CAREERS bill (H.R. 1617)
died with the closing of the 104th Congress.  The issue of job
training reform will most likely be raised again in the 105th
Congress next year.

<h3>Katy Bar The Schoolhouse Door To Parents</h3>

<p>

Parents effectively lose their right to direct the upbringing
of their children when they drop them off at school, according
to one federal court judge.  Earlier this year, Judge Melinda
Harmon, appointed by President Bush, ruled that Katy Independent
School District in Texas did not violate parents' rights by allowing
Child Protective Services to interrogate a student without notifying
his parents, nor by instructing him to lie to his parents about
the incident.

<p>

Take, for example, the case of 6-year-old Jonathan Prevette,
who last month kissed a classmate in Lexington, N.C.  Such incidents
have a long history in schoolyards across America and, until now,
were brushed off as childhood innocence, or reprimanded by teachers
and principals after discussing the situation with parents.  But
this time it was called &quot;sexual harassment.&quot;  The &quot;culprit&quot;
was suspended for a misdemeanor he can't even spell.

<p>

What prompted such a response?  Perhaps it was a nudge from
the U.S. Education Department, which this summer distributed guidelines
urging schools to set up sexual harassment policies.  Schools
were warned that under Title IX &quot;gender equity&quot; provisions
for federally funded programs, they may be held liable for letting
&quot;sexual harassment&quot; among students go unnoticed.

<p>

With even admiring looks now considered &quot;sexual harassment,&quot;
it is no wonder a school would seek cover from lawsuits by laying
down a blanket prohibition against anything remotely affectionate.
Ironically, the very same federal Education Department has promoted
sex education schemes that push condoms and the like on boys and
girls at even younger ages.

<p>

Such cold, heavy-handed responses to children like Jonathan
Prevette will continue if federal court decisions shut parents
out and let a remote and liberal federal education bureaucracy
hand down one-size-fits-all policies.  Embracing parents, on the
other hand, would result in the improved discipline and academics
many schools now seek in vain.

<h3>A Duty to Die?</h3>

<p>

The Supreme Court has accepted two important cases concerning
doctor-aided suicide.  In <I>Glucksburg v. Washington</I>, the
Ninth Circuit federal court &quot;found&quot; a constitutional
&quot;liberty&quot; right for terminally-ill patients to be killed
by their doctors.  Judge Stephen Reinhardt explained that his
reasoning is &quot;identical&quot; to the Supreme Court abortion
cases of <I>Roe v. Wade</I> and <I>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</I>.
These poisonous precedents live on, defending the destruction
of life.

<p>

The other case creates a constitutional right to be killed
by a doctor, not based on &quot;liberty&quot; but &quot;equality.&quot;
The Second Circuit federal court in <I>Vacco v. Quill</I> declared
that the New York law against causing or assisting suicide was
unconstitutional because it discriminates among terminally-ill
people.  According to the court, refusing artificial life support
and getting a lethal injection are equivalent, and since the former
is permitted, the latter may not be prohibited.

<p>

If these decisions are not overturned by the high court,
a &quot;right to die&quot; may soon become a &quot;duty to die&quot;
for those most in need.

<p>

A recent report on the Netherlands euthanasia experience
by Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.) provides a compelling context
for the current debate on doctor-assisted suicide in America.
Euthanasia of the terminally ill in the Netherlands has been
expanded since its inception in 1973 to permit the killing of
healthy people experiencing psychological distress.  Voluntary
euthanasia has given way to involuntary euthanasia, called &quot;termination
of the patient without explicit request.&quot;  In 1990, 1,000
people in the Netherlands were killed without their consent, 140
of whom were fully competent.

<p>

FRC is part of a broad coalition of groups urging the Court
to overturn the lower rulings, drafting <I>amicus</I> briefs detailing
the right of society to forbid euthanasia, and recounting the
tragedy of pre-Nazi Germany, where mercy killing was thought to
be the compassionate response to the plight of physically or mentally
disabled people, &quot;life unworthy of life.&quot;  Germany has
learned from its horrific mistakes, and now calls mercy killing
a crime against humanity.  Pray that the Supreme Court will not
sacrifice the lives of the infirm as they have done the lives
of the unborn.

<font size=+2><b><i>An Exercise of Citizenship</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer
</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>E</font>veryone needs to belong, to identify with something 
larger than self.  For some it is religion, for some it is a social 
construct, and for virtually all, it is national identity, citizenship, a
precious commodity involving rights, duties, and privileges.
I for one cannot imagine what it would be like to be the fabled
&quot;man without a country&quot; -- a man without citizenship.

<p>

Millions of people have left friends, family and their native
lands to immigrate, often at great personal risk, to the United
States.  Why?  Inscribed on the Statue of Liberty are the words,
&quot;Give me your tired, your poor; your huddled masses yearning
to breathe free. ...&quot;  That's it.  They come here for freedom.
Freedom of opportunity, of religion, from oppression, to raise
their families, to educate their children, to associate with friends
of their choice, and to achieve the American Dream.  They have
come because America is the land of the free.

<p>

Becoming an American involves more than a labeling process.
It implies adopting our language, customs, and national as well
as historical traditions.  It requires swearing allegiance to
the Constitution of the United States, renouncing fidelity to
any foreign state, and expressing willingness to serve this nation
as required by and under the law.

<p>

Recently, however, the process of becoming a U.S. citizen
has been &quot;dumbed down.&quot;  In the last 12 months, according
to published accounts, the Immigration and Naturalization Service
has conducted a full-court press to naturalize more than 1.2 million
new citizens.  Congressional hearings reveal that in the process,
longstanding rules have been bent, the citizenship test has been
simplified, citizenship has been granted to people who could not
speak English and, in many cases, criminal background checks may
have been bypassed.

<p>

Despite denial by the INS, evidence suggests that in at least
one case, hundreds of tests were submitted all of which were completed
in the same handwriting.  Extensive testimony before the Senate
Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration alleges a White House-initiated,
election-year effort to dramatically accelerate the naturalization
of new immigrants prior to Nov. 5.

<p>

The blessings of this land have not been bought cheaply.
Millions have paid the ultimate price while defending our way
of life.  To grant citizenship cheaply to anyone who applies or
for political advantage is an insult to those who have served
this nation.

Every American is endowed with the God-given right to life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  Among the privileges are
the freedom to participate in the social, economic, political,
religious and cultural aspects of the community.  No wonder people
around the globe aspire to come to our shores!

<p>

Rights are important, but there are obligations crucial to
the survival of a free society.  Citizenship imposes broad responsibilities
on our nation, our community, our neighbors and our families.
One of the most cherished of these is the obligation to vote.
This democratic republic will survive only if it is truly representative
of all the people, and that requires broad participation in the
political process.

<p>

Sadly, far too few Christians go to the polls.  Abraham Lincoln
believed elections to be so important that he offered furloughs
to soldiers who wanted to vote. Edmund Burke said, &quot;All it
takes for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.&quot;
Now is not the time for any of us, whatever our heritage, to
lower the standards of good citizenship.  After all, we are men
and women <I>with</I> a country -- a country that needs us more
than ever.

<center><h1>THE LEAST OF THESE</h1></center>

<p>

<font size=+3>D</font>oes increased social spending equate with better 
childhoods? For lack of a better answer, both Republicans and Democrats 
have been inclined to say &quot;yes.&quot;  Social spending by the
federal government for children and families has increased dramatically
since 1960, far exceeding the rate of inflation.  Yet, almost
all indicators suggest that child well-being today lags behind
what it was three decades ago.

<p>

Social spending advocates expect government to substitute
for mothers and fathers.  But noted child psychologist Urie Bronfenbrenner
has written that what a child needs more than government programs
is the &quot;irrational emotional attachment&quot; of fiercely
loving parents.

<p>

It's time to acknowledge that government can't buy love for
children any more than money can buy happiness for adults.  What
children really need are a mom and a dad.

<p>

<center><h3>Parents, Not Programs</h3></center>

<p>

Rather than winking at government's encroachment on families,
Congress should move quickly to pass pending parental rights legislation
(S. 984; H.R. 1946).  The legislation would neither create new
rights for parents nor repeal child abuse laws that protect children.
The new law would simply protect parents' rights to decide what
is best for their children without excessive interference from
Washington.

<p>

Having affirmed the central importance of parents, government
does sometimes have a role to play in helping parents.  One good
example is &quot;Megan's Law,&quot; which Congress has just passed
and the President has signed.  The new law requires states to
notify local law officials when convicted sex offenders are released
from prison and requires the police to notify the public when
a dangerous sex offender moves into the neighborhood.

<p>

<center><h3>Yes to Adoption</h3></center>

<p>

The community, of course, must step in to provide for children
who have no parents of their own.  But the importance of parents
remains the same -- or is even greater -- for children who are
alone.  The best government can do is to speed these children
into loving homes where loving parents are waiting.

<p>

&quot;The Adoption Promotion and Stability Act of 1996&quot;
(H.R. 3286), passed by the House but not yet by the Senate, offers
hope for vulnerable children currently free to be adopted.  In
the United States alone, there are over 50,000 foster children
awaiting adoption.  Over 20,000 children have been waiting for
a family for years.  The new legislation includes a $5,000 
non-refundable tax credit for qualified adoption expenses (for both 
domestic and international adoptions).  In order to eliminate unnecessary 
waiting periods for minority children in foster care, the legislation
also prohibits the use of racial considerations if they cause
a delay or denial of an adoption placement.

<p>

New adoption incentives will help some children; but Conna
Craig, President of the Institute for Children, argues that only
an overhaul of the foster care system will save children like
John.  A skinny kid who loves baseball, John has been waiting
for a home for nearly all of his 10 years.  Legally free to be
adopted since he was three, John's childhood is fast slipping
away.  He needs policymakers to understand that every child needs
a mom and a dad.

<p>

<center><h3>It Takes a Pro-Family Village</h3></center>

<p>

Even strong two-parent families require strong communities
to help pattern for children right habits of the heart.  When
so many children are languishing without families of their own,
community becomes all the more important.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

<center><i><font size=+2>
STAND FOR CHILDREN?<br>
STAND FOR FAMILIES.
</font></i></center>

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

&quot;The American Community Renewal Act of 1996,&quot; spearheaded
by Republican Congressmen James Talent (Mo.) and J. C. Watts (Okla.),
will strengthen communities more than any government handout
ever could by offering tax incentives for charitable giving, public
housing reform, and an end to government regulations that stifle
economic development in depressed neighborhoods.  By rebuilding
communities, we will strengthen the hands of parents -- and restore
some of childhood's lost innocence.

<p>

It's fair to admit that it takes a village.  Just as long
as we really mean a local &quot;village&quot; that preserves parent
autonomy, instead of a federal fiefdom that chains both children
and families to an all-powerful state.  Standing for children means
standing for families first.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>Senate Shake-Up.</b> Robert Dole leaves the Senate on June
11, freeing him of the need to navigate the Senate's procedural
obstacles.  Dole's departure has also set off a chain reaction
of races for top leadership posts in the Senate.  Majority Whip
Trent Lott and Republican Conference Chairman Thad Cochran are
vying to succeed Dole, with most insiders predicting a Lott victory.
GOP Policy Committee Chairman Don Nickles is running unopposed
to succeed Lott in the number two position of Whip.  Both have
advocated limited government, traditional family values, and the
sanctity of life.

<p>

<b>Suicide with Dignity?</b> The House Judiciary Subcommittee
on the Constitution recently held a hearing on assisted suicide.
The hearing followed two new federal circuit court decisions
legalizing &quot;physician-assisted suicide.&quot;  Witnesses
discussed the legal and moral ramifications of the rulings.  The
Ninth Circuit based many of its arguments on the <I>Roe</I> (1973
abortion decision) interpretation of &quot;privacy,&quot; overturning
a law approved by Washington State voters to ban assisted suicide.
The Second Circuit overturned a similar New York law. Several
members of Congress are writing legislation to reverse or restrict
these flawed decisions.

<p>

<b>Aiding Babies.</b> Congress has passed a measure under the
Ryan White Care Act to reduce the transmission of AIDS from pregnant
women to their babies.  The provision promotes voluntary counseling,
testing and treatment for pregnant women and the testing of newborns
for HIV.  Testing of newborns for HIV will be required if states
have not reduced the number of infected infants by 2000.  This
issue had been in deadlock for months because of opposition by
certain homosexual and feminist groups.  They argued that it could
lead to expanded mandatory AIDS testing and infringe on a woman's
&quot;right to privacy.&quot;

<p>

<b>PX Porn.</b> The House of Representatives' 1997 Defense Authorization
Act bans future military sales of pornography.  Last year the
Pentagon sold 12.6 million copies of 219 different pornographic
magazines, earning $4.3 million.  Military customers pay less
than the market price and pay no tax.  Government vending of pornography
sends the message that profiting from material that demeans women
is okay.  But common sense and science show that readily available
porn encourages, rather than discourages, episodes like Tailhook.
Senate action is next.

<p>

<b>Gambling Loses.</b> Pro-family forces, overcoming a well-financed
gambling industry campaign, secured Senate committee passage
of legislation to create a Gambling Impact and Policy Commission
(S. 704) on May 14.  The House passed similar legislation (H.R.
497) on March 5.  The unanimous Senate vote eases the way for
final congressional approval.  The Gambling Commission, which
has been granted subpoena power, will evaluate the industry's
impact on families, businesses and society.  The Commission will
submit recommendations for Congress and the states and will provide
insight into the consequences of legalized gambling.

<p>

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Bioethical Lapse.</b> President Clinton will soon appoint
15 members to his National Bioethics Advisory Commission.  The
commission's role is to &quot;identify broad principles to govern
the ethical conduct of research.&quot;  A White House office released
a revealing list of potential nominees.  Among the extreme views:
a Harvard Medical School professor who advocates legal changes
in the definition of death so that organs can be harvested for
transplantation before brain death occurs, and a Yale lawyer who
argues that parents who withhold birth control from their adolescent
children commit child neglect.

<p>

<b>Racial Reconciliation.</b> Family Research Council recently
hosted a meeting of African-American leaders in Washington, D.C.,
to discuss projects for racial reconciliation.  Among the goals
of the meeting was to reaffirm FRC's desire to address the specific
needs and concerns of all families, regardless of race or culture.
Participants explored how FRC and other family organizations
can more effectively fulfill the pro-family mission and help to
heal ethnic divisions in modern America.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Sleet, Snow, and Frosty U.S. Attorneys.</b> On May 9, the
U.S. Postal Inspection Service successfully busted a nationwide
child pornography ring, despite the refusal by U.S. Attorney Janet
Napolitano and others to cooperate.  Napolitano, a Clinton appointee,
reportedly refused to authorize a search warrant for the operation
because she felt it improperly targeted homosexual men.  However,
inspectors were able to obtain the search warrant from local authorities.
Senators Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) have asked
Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate Napolitano to determine
whether she wrongly impeded the sting.

<p>

<b>Pro-life Planks.</b> Twelve Catholic and Protestant pro-life
leaders (including Gary Bauer) have signed a public pledge supporting
the current Republican platform language on legal protection for
unborn children.  While most media stories have focused on 
&quot;inside-the-beltway&quot; Republican skirmishes over this language, 
many pro-life Democrats are disturbed about their party's entrenched position 
favoring abortion on demand. Some 40 pro-life House Democrats are urging
party leaders to rewrite the 1996 platform to support at least
some protection of prenatal life.

<h3>FRC: Friend of the Family</h3>

<p>

The battle for pro-family policy is increasingly being fought,
not only in the halls of Congress, but in the courts.  In many
cases, groups opposing pro-family policies take advantage of liberal
courts, avoiding public and congressional debate of controversial
issues.  FRC has filed amicus curiae (&quot;friend of the court&quot;)
briefs in many cases, several of which are highlighted and described
below.

<p>

FRC has been active in defending anti-pornography laws in
cases like <I>ACLU v. Reno</I>.  In this case, FRC acted
as co-counsel defending the Communications Decency Act.  Our brief
defends the constitutionality of the Act, which is designed to
prohibit the knowing distribution of pornography to children.
No matter the outcome, all parties anticipate that the case will
ultimately go to the Supreme Court.

<p>

FRC has also been vocal in pro-life cases around the country.
Most recently, FRC filed an amicus brief in <I>Shenck v. Pro-Choice
Network</I>, a case to be heard in the Supreme Court in October
debating the constitutionality of court-ordered, 15-foot &quot;floating
bubble zones&quot; around patients entering and exiting abortion
clinics.  These &quot;zones&quot; are specifically intended to
prevent peaceful demonstrators from talking to anyone going in
or out of an abortion clinic.

<p>

In <I>United States of America v. Commonwealth of Virginia</I>,
FRC has co-sponsored a brief defending the right of the Virginia
Military Institute to admit males only and to continue receiving
government funds.  This case holds implications for all publicly
supported single-sex schools, whether military or not, across
the country.

<p>

<I>Romer v. Evans</I> (the &quot;Amendment 2&quot; case)
was decided on May 20.  FRC filed an amicus curiae brief asserting
that the Supreme Court of Colorado wrongly negated the people's
right to pass laws that deny special rights to homosexuals.  The
6-3 Supreme Court decision means that pro-family voters are effectively
precluded from winning on this issue at the state level, at least
insofar as a measure binds lower political jurisdictions.

<p>

Melinda Paras, spokeswoman for the National Gay and Lesbian
Task Force, commented that the decision drives a &quot;stake through
the heart&quot; of ballot measures sponsored by pro-family groups.
FRC is examining options for a legislative response to <I>Romer,</I>
and the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution has
promised to hold hearings.

<h3>Free Needles for Junkies?</h3>

<p>

A major media push is under way, using government reports,
to prove that giving clean needles to drug addicts slows the 
spread of the AIDS virus without encouraging illegal drug use. 
But the evidence is inconclusive and should not be used to 
start dangerous needle give-away programs.

<p>

Two of the three medical doctors on the leading and much-cited
government needle study say that needle exchange programs (NEPs)
&quot;are not the panacea their supporters hope for.&quot; They
favor more drug treatment rather than exchanges.

<p>

A 1993 law permits the government to use federal funds to
support exchanges if they can be scientifically shown to slow
the AIDS virus without increasing drug abuse.  So far, however,
needle studies are problem-plagued.  They rely on self-reporting
by addicts, downplay sexual transmission of the AIDS virus, generally
ignore the impact on communities near exchange sites, trivialize
the drug problem and never measure HIV seroconversion rates, the
only true indication of effectiveness.

<p>

Philip Lee, assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services
and a former needle researcher, has expressed concern that NEPs
&quot;may send a mixed message about drug use.&quot;  There are
75 NEPs now operating in 55 U.S. cities without federal funds.
These programs provide free drug-injecting supplies, condoms,
advice on shooting drugs properly, warnings about bad heroin,
and counseling that sometimes leads to treatment.

<p>

Lee Brown, President Clinton's first drug czar, said he &quot;can
find no compelling reason&quot; to fund NEPs.  Barry McCaffrey,
the nation's new czar, has said, &quot;The problem is not dirty
needles; the problem is heroin addiction.&quot;

<p>

&quot;Our goal should be to eliminate drug abuse,&quot; says
Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.), &quot;not to find a cleaner, safer
way to do it.&quot;  Dr. James Curtis, director of the Department
of Psychiatry, Harlem Hospital Center, says exchanges are &quot;poor
medicine&quot; and &quot;promote a breakdown in law and order.&quot;

<p>

Although the science is inconclusive, expect AIDS activists
and pro-drug legalization forces to pressure the federal government
to approve funds for NEPs.

<font size=+2><b><i>Renewing Our Vows</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer

<p>

<font size=+3>I</font>n announcing his support for the just-introduced 
federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana had
this to say:

<p>

&quot;The definition of marriage is not created by politicians
and judges, and it cannot be changed by them.  It is rooted in
our history, our laws, our deepest  moral and religious convictions,
and our nature as human beings.  It is the union of one man and
one woman.  This fact can be respected or it can be resented.
But it can't be altered.&quot;

<p>

If someone had told me five years ago that we would find
ourselves in 1996 defending marriage as the union of one man and
one woman, I would have asked him if he wanted me to take him
to my leader -- jokingly, of course.

<p>

Yet this idea of opening marriage to homosexual couples,
which seems more suited to another planet, is stalking the land.
Prompted by an impending court decision in Hawaii, legislators
in more than 30 states are rushing to protect their marriage statutes.
As of this writing, 11 states had enacted marriage protection
laws. 

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

<center><i><font size=+2>
ELEVEN STATES HAVE ACTED TO<br>
PROTECT MARRIAGE.
</font></i></center>

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

At the federal level, the Defense of Marriage Act was introduced
in the House on May 7 by Reps. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) and Bob
Barr (R-Ga.) and in the Senate on May 8 by Don Nickles (R-Okla.).
It is being endorsed by a slowly growing list of Congressional
sponsors, but many more are needed -- and swiftly, as the Supreme
Court decision in <I>Romer v. Evans</I> illustrates (<I>See</I> 
&quot;Courtwatch,&quot; page 3).

<p>

This is the most important pro-family legislation in many
years.  If marriage falls, it will begin a domino effect that
will totally redefine families within the law and culture.  For
starters, children will be taught in school that homosexuality
is the moral equivalent of marital love, businesses will be forced
to subsidize homosexual relationships, and churches that uphold
biblical morality will find themselves outside the civil law.

<p>

On Mother's Day, I debated Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) on
<I>This Week With David Brinkley.</I>  I reminded Mr. Frank that
it was fitting that we were discussing this on Mother's Day, since
our celebration of motherhood is one of the most powerful expressions
of just why the idea of homosexual &quot;marriage&quot; is so
dopey.  But it is more than dopey; it is dangerous.

<p>

If unelected judges in Hawaii are able to impose their will
on the rest of the nation through the Constitution's Full Faith
and Credit Clause (which compels the states to recognize each
other's licenses and records), then what's safe?  If two men can
marry, why can't three men?  Or two men and a woman?  Or a man
and a boy?

<p>

During our debate, Frank made the usual unfounded charge
that his opponents are motivated by &quot;hatred&quot; and 
&quot;prejudice.&quot; He repeated what has become homosexual activists' 
key argument against DOMA:  it is unnecessary.  Homosexual 
&quot;marriage&quot; is still illegal all over the U.S.  In other words, 
Barney Frank and friends want us to wait for a judicial defeat before we 
take the field in defense of marriage.  I'm sorry, but that's not good
enough. Marriage is the God-given foundation of society, and if
we let it be ruined, our children will rightly hold us responsible.

<p>

During the Battle of Britain, when things looked darkest,
Winston Churchill told the English people to &quot;never give
up.  Never, never, never, never give up.&quot;  Well, friends,
not only won't we give up defending marriage, we cannot give up.
I urge you to call or write your senators and congressman now
and press them to sponsor DOMA. Next Mother's Day, I don't
want to be debating a triumphant Barney Frank and his newly married
&quot;spouse.&quot;

<p><hr width=50%><p>

On May 19, the Family Research Council placed a full-page ad in 
<i>The Washington Post</i> with the tag line, "Let's Save Marriage, 
Before the Whole Cake Crumbles." The ad summarized the arguments for 
preserving the institution of marriage as a legally binding 
relationship between one man and one woman. <b>For a copy of the ad,

In 1994, Miss Hansen joined the Family Research Council's Media
Department to facilitate the networking of information between
television, print, and radio contacts and FRC's Policy Experts.
Hansen's communication skills are a factor in FRC's rapidly growing
media presence in Washington, D.C. and nation-wide. 

<p>

Her responsibilities at FRC include handling all broadcast media
requests in the area of news and talk radio as well as planning
outgoing radio tours of FRC policy experts. In addition, Hansen
associates with television and print contacts along with the Director
of Communications in order to clearly present FRC's pro-family
message far and wide. As an effective spokesperson on politics,
policy, and the media, Hansen helps FRC in generating up to a
thousand clips a month and daily broadcast interviews.  

<p>

Hansen also works extensively on the media strategy for FRC's
special projects, such as the &quot;Save Sex&quot; campaign, 
<I>Let Freedom Ring: A Basic Outline of American History</I>, <I>The
Children of Table 34</I> video, and <I>A Family Fourth: Independence
Day and Other Celebrations</I>.

<p>

Hansen's experience includes work in a sports marketing firm
and in the development of athletic ministries. Native of Southern
California, Hansen graduated from Princeton University in 1994
receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in English.

Senior Policy Adviser<BR>
Submitted on May 2, 1995 to the<BR>
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee,<BR>
Senator Nancy Kassebaum, Chairman</H3>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
MADAM CHAIRMAN, DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE, I am pleased to have the opportunity to offer the testimony of the Family Research Council on the nomination of Dr. Henry W. Foster to be Surgeon General of the United States.  The Family Research Council is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization dedicated to analysis of the impact of public policy on the traditional family.  We place particular emphasis on the ways in which society can preserve and strengthen the two-parent family, and maximize the benefits that stable, intact family structure can confer on this nation's economic vitality, social well-being and spiritual strength.
<P>
     We believe that the position of Surgeon General of the United States now, more than ever, requires an individual who understands these dimensions of public policy.  Evolu- tion of the office of Surgeon General in the past two decades has diminished its direct policy-making and admini- strative role.  Evolution of the nature of many of the public health threats facing this nation today has magnified the importance of the Surgeon General's office in articulat-ing the essentials of healthy behavior.  The intersection of individual health and moral responsibility has never been more obvious.
<P>
     For this reason, it is critical that the office of Surgeon General be occupied by a person who has worked comfortably within that intersection.  That person must possess a clear, and consistently expressed, vision of public health.  He or she must be alive to the profound ethical dimensions of health issues in the late 20th century, and have a proven track record of responding cor-rectly to issues as they arise, not merely riding with the tide of public or professional opinion.  In short, he or she must be a leader, not a follower, intellectually and instinctively true to the highest standards of ethical behavior in medicine.  
<P>
     As a threshold matter, a Surgeon General must know and be able to articulate who he is and what he believes.  From the very beginning, when President Clinton announced his choice of Herny Foster on February 2, this nominee has been unable to articulate from one day to the next a consistent account even of his own career.  At every turn, members of this committee, of our own organization, and of the press have elicited from Dr. Foster and the administration new and revised accounts of various dimensions of his creed and his practice.  To this day, not one of these accounts fully squares with the other.  To this day, not one of these accounts amounts to a full disclosure by the nominee regard-ing his personal involvement in the most wrenching health policy questions of our time.
<P>
     The course of this nomination resembles a tent in spring rain.  Touch its soggy canvas anywhere and more revelations seep through.  It is hard to imagine an individual who has been implicared in more major public health controversies than Dr. Foster.  From the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, to involuntary sterilization of men-tally handicapped women, to the performance of abortions and advocacy of abortion on demand, to distribution of condoms and other birth control devices to children, to the school-based clinic debate, to involvement with radical sex education programs, Dr. Foster has been on the cutting edge -- and nearly always on its wrong side.
<P>
     As this testimony is written, it is impossible to say with assurance that he hasn't <B> always </B>been on the wrong side, because nothing of what is known about Dr. Foster's role in each of these controversies is the result of the nominee's frank and full disclosure.  Everything that is known about them is the result of examination of the nominee's record and repeated questioning of that record by others, our-selves included.  The Administration has been reluctant to take the first step to volunteer accurate information about any of the issues that have placed this nomination in jeopardy.
<P>
     Before discussing those issues in detail, I want to make one final point.  This nomination has not been, and is not being, "Borked."  No one has led an advertising campaign distorting the nominee's record, impugning his character, or implying dreaded, unnamed consequences for the nation if he takes office.  No one has scrolled through a list of his tastes in videos. The debate over this nomination is first and foremost about profoudnly important questions of public policy, and this nomination is in difficulty first and fore-most because the nominee himself has been unable to provide a consistent and accurate account of where he has stood and what he has done regarding these questions.  Even Robert Bork's most vociferous opponents will agree, I think, that he did not leave anyone in doubt about the authenticity of his beliefs.
<P>
     Doubt, on the other hand, is the essence of Dr. Foster's nomination.
<P>
<B> Biographical Omission</B>
<P>
     The difficulty with Dr. Foster's nomination began with the refusal of the White House to share with the public, and with this committee, his basic philosophy.  The biography of Dr. Foster released by the White House mentioned his chron-ological affiliations, but totally ignored his lifelong ties to Planned Parenthood.  That this would be the occasion for controversy can hardly be something the Administration would not recognize.  The <I> Chronicle of Philanthropy </I>has noted on several occasions that the Planned Parenthood Federation of America is among the top 10 most frequently objected to "charities" in the United States.  The <I> Chronicle </I>has reported that no nonprofit in the United States is more commonly eschewed through "restricted" gifts to the nation's United Way agencies.
<P>
     The reasons are simple, and to express them is to belie the White House's claim that Dr. Foster is a "mainstream" nominee.  The nominee claims that he is committed to absti- nence as the primary approach to sex education.  Planned Parenthood has led the ideological and legal assault on abstinence education programs in the United States.  The nominee claims that he desires to make abortion "safe, legal and rare."  But he has served as a "Public Policy Advocate" for the Planned Parenthood Federation during a time when its national leadership had dedicated itself to opening 75 abortion clinics across the United States<I> merely to meet a numerical goal consonant with the 75th anniversary of its founding</I>.
<P>
     Dr. Foster has sought to portray himself as an advocate for the family, and for parent-child communication.  But during his time as an official of Planned Parenthood of Nashville, that organization filed suit against a Tennessee law requiring parental consent for abortion.  Far from being a strict statute, that law provided for a judicial bypass procedure by which teenagers could seek abortions under court auspices without parental involvement.  Such an arrangement was not liberal enough for Planned Parenthood, which has led the national legal fight to exclude parents from involvement with their minor children's abortion decisions.  Again, this is not a mainstream position -- Americans support parental consent for abortion by margins of 2-1 or 3-1.  Parents themselves show an even higher rate of support for such laws.
<P>
     It is possible that Dr. Foster was and is ignorant of these positions taken by organizations with whom he has been associated for nearly two decades.  But it is not likely. Ignorance is a valid defense in some circumstances, but it is not a valid credential for someone who seeks to become the "nation's doctor," and the leader of a national crusade against teenage pregnancy.
<P>
     The American people had a right to know of Dr. Foster's association with this organization and its ideas.  The White House had no right to omit it from the biographical informa-tion it provided the Congress and the nation.
<P>
<B> Tuskegee Institute</B>
<P>
     "Ignorance" is also the nominee's defense against the circumstantial evidence, and the direct testimony of one individual, Dr. Luther McRae, that, as Vice President of the Macon County Medical Society in 1969, Dr. Foster partic-ipated in a Public Health Service briefing on the infamous Tuskegee syphilis experiments.  It is not in dispute that Dr, Foster spoke out against the experiments in 1972, when they were publicly revealed in media accounts.  It is pre-cisely that public expression of outrage that provoked the reaction of Dr. McRae, who has stated that he is willing to testify to this committee under oath that Dr. Foster was indeed present at the meeting on May 12, 1969 where PHS officials sought the "surrogate informed consent" of the MCMS for continuation of the Tuskegee Study.<P>
     McRae is categorical, and here is what he told Carl Ramsey of Family News in Focus:
<P>
<UL> The most striking thing about it, when
         the news broke . . . I saw on television
         and read in the papers that Dr. Foster 
         was involved in the public outrage about
         the study having been conducted.  And I
         was struck by that, in that I knew he was
         at the meeting . . . I asked myself why
         Henry didn't go ahead and say something at
         the meeting that night in 1969. Because he
         had every opportunity, nobody had a muzzle
         on him.i</UL><P>     McRae is also specific, recalling where Dr. Foster sat.  Moreover, he holds no animus against his colleague and believes -- in contrast to my view -- that he would make an excellent Surgeon General.  This fact lends added weight to his assertion regarding Dr. Foster's knowledge of the Tus-kegee experiment in 1969.
<P>
     Dr. McRae insists that Henry Foster did know about the existence of the experiment.  But it is equally important to recognize that he should have known, and that the May 12 meeting at a restaurant outside Tuskegee was not his only opportunity to inform himself about a PHS study that had been under way for nealry four decades.  First, the study had been described in the medical journals; as an obstetric-ical chief working in a county with one of the nation's highest rates of syphilis (indeed, this was one reason PHS originally chose Macon County as the site of the nontreat-ment study), at perhaps that county's most prominent ob-gy
center, Dr. Foster would have reason to be well read in the literature of venereal disease.
<P>
     Dr. McRae has noted, as does James Jones' account of the Tuskegee experiment, Bad Blood, that PHS officials supplied the Macon County Medical Society with a list of the individuals "participating" in the study, to assure that they would not obtain treatment, particularly antibiotics, by other means from local physicians.ii  Given the "zeal," as Jones puts it, with which PHS officials pursued the cooper- ation of Macon County physicians, it seems unlikely that distribution of this list to the Vice President of the Society's Vice President would be overlooked.<P>    Jones also points out that in 1970the PHS "also reestablished something of its former working relationship with medical personnel at John A. Andrew Hospital."  A representative of PHS, Dr. Joseph G. Caldwell, met with the hospital's administrator and medical director and contracted to have the surviving men's X-rays taken there in the hospital's new facility.  Again, it is possible that the presence of PHS officials, and the conduct of examinations of the syphilitic men, in the facility where he was chief of obstetrics would have entirely escaped the notice of Dr. Foster.  
<P>
     Assuming as much, however, it is hardly a flattering protrayal of Dr. Foster's engagement with public health issues when the most significant events of his time took place in his immediate vicinity, with the cooperation of the Medical Society of which he was Vice President, without his taking cognizance of them.  Such a lapse may not amount to much for a physician who simply desires to continue his work serving the general population; it is a fatal failure of responsibility in an individual who claims to have the ability to serve as the nation's top spokesman on public health.  Dr. Foster says that he did not know of the exper- iments.  The key is that nearly all his colleagues did, that at least one says that he himself did, and that, in any case, he should have known.
<P>
<B> Dr. Foster and Abortion</B>
<P>
     On the issue of abortion, Dr. Foster has taken the fifth.  That is to say, he has taken at least five posi- tions on the number of abortions he has performed or guided to completion.  He has misstated not merely his own involvement in abortion, but inaccurately described the guidelines on medical education under which, he claims, a study of prostaglandin suppositories was conducted during his tenure at Meharry Medical School.  Worse, he has used language in documents officially released by the Department of Health and Human Services that finesses the question of his involvement in abortion.  These finesses put his vera-city not merely in question, but in grave doubt.  
<P>
    Let me summmarize:<P>
<UL> <B> Late January.  </B>A White House official informs<BR>
      Chairman Kassebaum that Dr. Foster had per-<BR>
      formed one abortion during his medical career.<BR>
      ("Foster Says He Performed Abortions,"<I> The Wash-<BR>
      ington Post</I>, Feb. 4, 1995).
<P>
 <B> February 3, 1995.  </B>The Department of Health<BR>
       and Human Services releases a statement by<BR>
       Dr. Foster which states, " I believe that I<BR>
       performed fewer than a dozen pregnancy term-<BR>
       inations." (Statement by Dr. Henry Foster,<BR>
       Nominee for U.S. Surgeon General.)
<P>
 <B> February 6, 1995.  </B>The International Foundation<BR>
       for Genetic Research/Michael Fund releases a<BR>
       transcript, first disputed by the White House<BR>
       but then acknowledged to be genuine, in which<BR>
       Foster states, "I have done a lot of amniocen-<BR>
       tesis and therapeutic abortions, probably near<BR>
       700." (Department of Health, Education and Wel-<BR>
       fare, Office of the Secretary, Ethics Advisory<BR>
       Board, Meeting V, Friday, November 10, 1978<BR>
       Seattle, Washington, p. 180, 197).
<P>
       The Foundation also releases a story from the<BR>
       November 1980 <I> ObGyn News </I>describing an abortion-<BR>
       pill study conducted by Dr. Foster at Meharry on<BR>
       behalf of Upjohn Pharmaceuticals that resulted in<BR>
        59 completed abortions on patients in the trial.     <BR>
<P>
 <B> February 8, 1995.  </B>Appearing on ABC's<I> Nightline</I>,<BR>
        Dr. Foster acknowledges performing 39 abortions, but<BR>
       notes that this does not include any abortions he<BR>
       may have performed before 1973.  Foster tells Kop-<BR>
       pel that this total also does not include the 59<BR>
       abortions carried out under the trial he super-<BR>
       vised, because he did not personally perform them.</UL>
 <P>
     Thus, in little more than a week, Dr. Foster deployed five different versions of his record regarding abortions.<P>
Volatility like this makes the Mexican peso look stable by comparison.  It prompted even the spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, Avis LaVelle, to remark, "The next time we utter a number [of Foster's abortions], it won't be based on Dr. Foster's recollec-tions."iii  But if you take a closer look at the February 3 statement released over his name, it appears amply crafted to disguise the information that was released on February 6 by the International Foundation for Genetic Research.<P>     As <I> The Washington Times </I>pointed out on February 7, Dr. Foster's artful February 3 statement offered circumlocu- tions regarding his term as chief of service at Tuskegee and Meharry.  Of the "wide variety of medical procedures and research" performed at both, "all," he wrote, "were in accordance with the law and educational requirements."iv  As the <I> Times </I>observed, "Abortion . . . has been legal for many years, and thus had Dr. Foster performed hundreds of abortions as chief of service - as opposed to acting in his capacity as a private physician - that fact would not have been actually lied about, given the statement's careful wording."
<P>
     The same can be said about the prostaglandin supposi- tory trial, which Dr. Foster was compelled to elaborate upon the following night in his exchange with Ted Koppel.  There he launched the "educational requirements" explanation, citing alleged accreditation requirements as the justifi- cation for seeking grant money to test the abortion suppos- itory for Upjohn.  There are two issues here.  One is the intended evasion by Dr. Foster of a full accounting of his abortion activity in his February 3 statement.  The second is his misunderstanding -- or possible evasion -- regarding the rationale for the prostaglandin trial.
<P>
     As chief of obstetrics at two major medical instituti- tions, Dr. Foster surely should have known that nothing in the then-extant accreditation guidelines from the Accredi-tation Council for Graduate Medical Education required any medical school to offer training in performing abortions, much less to conduct trials of experimental abortion drugs.  In relevant part, the guidelines state that:
<P>
<UL> Resident education [in obstetrics and<BR>
         gynecology] must include, but not neces-<BR>
         sarily be limited to the following:<BR>
<P>
         1. Obstetrics<BR>
         a. The full range of obstetrics, includ-<BR>
            ing high-risk obstetrics and medical<BR>
            and surgical complications of pregnancy.</UL>
<P>
     Arguably this standard could be interpreted as requiring training in the management of complications resulting from botched abortions, although the term "abor-tion" (or any euphemism for it) is nowhere mentioned in the standards.  Even under this reading of the standard, however, it would clearly be unethical for a program to arrange for a botched abortion to give the residents a training opportunity.  Conducting a trial of a new drug (one that never did reach the market) would just as clearly be an unethical way to fulfill such an obligation.
<P>
     But the bottom line is that no such obligation existed in the late 1970s when the trial was conducted, nor does one exist now, when Dr. Foster cites it as justification for Meharry's participation in the Phase 2 trial and uses it as a mask for a major abortion activity he obviously did not want disclosed.  It is only an added insult to common knowl- edge when Foster continues to cite this erroneous account of accreditation requirements to justify a project that was clearly taken on because of Dr. Foster's lifelong commitment to abortion.
<P>
     Finally, it should be pointed out that as of the date of this testimony, March 24, 1995, a complete accounting of Dr. Foster's activity on behalf of abortion is still not in the public record.  He has specifically excluded revelations regarding any abortions he may have performed prior to 1973, when he began his association with Meharry.  His basis for the exclusion is the unavailability of records prior to that date.  Given how well Dr. Foster's "recollections" have served him and the administration on other issues, it's just as well.
<P>
<B> Involuntary Sterilization</B>
<P>
     Dr. Foster's involvement in the possily involuntary sterilization of four mentally handicapped women is the only controversial issue in his background that was placed before the public by action of the White House.  Its discovery, however, was inevitable, as Dr. Foster himself described the prcedures in an article entitled "Removal of the Normal Uterus" in the <I> Southern Medical Journal </I>in 1976.v  Dr. Foster states in the article only that he had "begun to use hysterectomy in patients with severe mental retardation.  Hysterectomy," he noted, "can be done <I>eithe</I>r [emphasis added] for sterilization or to eliminate the menses[.]"vi<P>     Whatever the presumed indication for the procedure, obviously hysterectomy eliminates both fertility and the menses.  This is important because hysterectomy carries significantly higher risks to the mother than the conven-tional means of sterilization (salpingectomy, i.e., removal of the Fallopian tubes).  As Stephen Trombley's valuable history of coercive sterilization makes clear, the United States in the early 1970s experienced a "sterilization explosion."vii  At least part of the impetus for the proce- dure (besides the desire of Planned Parenthood and other population control groups to promote permanent methods of sterilization, particularly on eugenic grounds) was the desire to provide medical students with the opportunity to perform hysterectomies.viii<P>
     This "sterilization explosion" did not go unnoticed or unopposed.  In fact, by 1973 the Health Research Group, affiliated with Ralph Nader's Public Citizen, Inc. had pub-lished a major report on sterilization abuse.  The report documented the sudden rise in sterilization, particularly targeting the indigent, the uneducated and the young, and called for federal regulation, especially to ensure informed consent.
<P>
     This report provided the statistical and anecdotal basis for federal interest in sterilization reform, but as Trombley writes, the report attained its full effect "only after the problem of sterilization abuse was heightened by the personal tragedy of the Relf family."ix<P>     Interestingly, the Relf case took place in Alabama in 1973.  Once again a major public health controversy brewed virtually under Dr. Henry Foster's nose, without his being aware of it, and at a time when had begun to perform hyster- ectomies.  The Relf case deserves a brief synopsis.  A poor balck family living in Montgomery, the Relfs had three daughters, ages 12 to 16.  At the behest of the local family planning service, the three girls were injected with the contraceptive drug Depo-Provera.  In March 1973, the oldest girl, Katie was taken, without her parents' consent, to a family planning clinic, where an IUD was inserted over her objections.
<P>
     A series of events then brought the remaining two girls, along with their mother, to a local hospital, where the mother, unable to read or write, was induced to place an "X" on a document authorizing them, without hr knowledge, to be sterilized.  A subsequent effort by the family planning service to sterilize Katie failed.  
<P>
     That summer, the Relf case came to the attention of Sen. Edward Kennedy, who on July 10, 1973 invited the Relfs to his office.  By happenstance, Sen. Kennedy's committee was at that same time engaged in the hearings on health care and human experimentation spawned by the Tuskegee incident.  The Relfs proceeded to file suit against the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, resulting in a judgment requiring the federal government to issue guidelines providing for the protection of minors from sterilization and for informed consent.
<P>
     Contemporaneous with <I> Relf </I>was the <I> Wyatt </I>case, in which a federal court declared unconstitutional an Alabama law that permitted the sterilization of mentally retarded inmates of state institutions.  Although compulsory steril-ization remained legal in many states during the 1970s, the issues raised by the Health Research Group and debated in the federal courts in Alabama had risen to national prominence two to three years before Dr. Foster's article appeared in<I> the Southern Medical Journal</I>.  Despite this fact, Foster's article makes no mention of these develop- ments, and betrays no awareness of any kind that, even in his own state, he was part of a rapidly dying consensus that such sterilizations as he had "begun" to perform were med- ically and morally unacceptable.
<P>
     As columnist Charles Krauthammer wrote on February 17, the circumstances surrounding these surgical sterilizations (why higher-risk hysterectomies were performed, whether informed consent was obtained, and from whom) involve serious questions.  The apologia that Foster performed only four such sterilizations does not answer these questions; in fact, as Krauthammer notes, "It breyas an obvious discomfort with what Foster did.  It reinforces the sense that the moral climate of the 1970s was not nearly as alien as some pretend and that even in that ancient time surgically sterilizing the retarded was a morally troubling act."x<P>    I only note in passing that Dr. Foster's first account of abortions he performed was one.  Once again, Foster failed to notice a major public health controversy that sprang up largely as a result of incidents just down the road from the institutions he helped to lead.<P><B> I Have a Future</B><P>     The plausibility of Dr. Foster's commitment to abstinence as his first priority in educating young people about sexuality was discussed above.  One example should suffice.
<P>
     In 1987 the Planned Parenthood Federation of America distributed a report written for it by Marie Haviland-James, apparently affiliated with Michigan Planned parenthood.  The report was an ideological assault on "Sex Respect," one of the most venerable abstinence education programs in the United States.  The following account of the Haviland-James report appears in an analysis of sex education programs written and published in 1991:
<P>
<UL> The Haviland-James report provided guidance<BR>
       to Planned parenthood sex educators opposing<BR>
 <I> Sex Respect </I>and seeking its removal from the<BR>
       schools.  The memo urged opponents of <I> Sex <BR>
       Respect </I>to argue that it "violates the separa-<BR>
       tion of church and state" and risks litigation<BR>
       from the American Civil Liberties Union {whose<BR>
       late counsel, Harriet Pilpel, once represented<BR>
       both organizations].  It charged that the pro-<BR>
       gram is faulty because it contained "many refer-<BR>
       ences . . . to a 'spiritual' dimension of sex-<BR>
       uality; contained use of the word 'baby' for<BR>
       fetus"; expressed "bias . . . against people<BR>
       who are sexually active and unmarried"; "com-<BR>
       pared stealing of money continually with con-<BR>
       tinued sexual activity'; contained " a descrip-<BR>
       tion of a woman haunted by guilt"; omitted <BR>
       "pro-choice material"; and, of greatest inter-<BR>
       est, included "unsubstantiated claims" such as<BR>
       "abstinence has future benefits for teens" and<BR>
       "because of the special nature of human sexual-<BR>
       ity, there's no way to have premarital sex <BR>
       without hurting someone."  The memo concluded<BR>
       that <I> Sex Respect </I>"appeals . . . to the lowest <BR>
       common denominator of mentality."xi</UL><P>     Once again, the most chartible interpretation that can be put on Dr. Foster's involvement with an organization that takes this aggressive a stance against abstinence education is that he is wholly unaware of it.  Fortunately, there is more direct evidence of Dr. Foster's approach, which is at best "abstinence-plus," with the abstinence part thrust with embarrassment up his sleeve.
<P>
     The Family Research Council has obtained a copy of the eight-page brochure produced by Foster's "I Have a Future" program to introduce the program.  Over a couple of thousand of words of text, the word "abstinence", or its equivalents is not mentioned once.  The phrase, "delaying the initiation of sexual activity," common in all true abstinence materials, is not mentioned once.  On the other hand, the brochure repeatedly stresses the objective of the program to enhance "contraceptive availability," to address the problem of "poor" "contraceptive practices," and to promote "distribution of contraceptives."xii<P>     Efforts by the Council and the media to obtain a full copy of the "I Have a Future" curriculum have been rebuffed.xiii  If the currciulum is as its sponsors say it is, this reaction to public curioisity is itself curious.  In fact, one would expect that, upon his elevation to Surgeon General, Dr. Foster would proudly promote the "I Have a Future" curriculum as a model abstinence program.  His pride should be just as great before this committee votes.<P><B> Conclusion</B><P>    These are but a few of the issues that attend the nomination of Dr. Herny Foster.  Ther common link is that in 1995, the United States deserves to have in this position of authority an individual with a clear vision of the public health consequences of personal behavior, an abiding commit- ment to marriage and the family, an alertness to the ethical dimensions of today's contemporary controversies in medicine and public policy, an unblemished record of candor and truth-telling to the American people, and a concern for every mother and child.  
<P>
     Henry Foster has shown that he is not that person.

<title>Gary Bauer's May, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

May 15, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

You probably read about the incredible speech Supreme Court Justice 
Antonin Scalia delivered at a prayer breakfast in early April at 
the Mississippi College School of Law in Jackson. Scalia delivered 
a stirring defense of the role of Christians in public life. The 
reaction was a prolonged standing ovation. But there was no ovation 
for the speech inside the Washington Beltway, where FRC fights 
every day on behalf of your family, or among America's cultural 
elite.

<p>

&quot;Justice Scalia: Defender of the Faith,&quot; sneered the
headline in the <I>International Herald Tribune.</I>[1]

<p>

The speech &quot;clearly undermines public confidence in [Scalia's]
objectivity regarding religious controversies,&quot;[2] said Barry
Lynn of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State.

<p>

&quot;This is a disturbing view for a Justice to have,&quot;[3] said
Elliott Mincberg, legal director of Norman Lear's group, People for
the American Way.

<p>

The speech should have set off &quot;alarm bells,&quot;[4] charged
political columnists Jack Germond and Jules Witcover.

<p>

In a few pockets of liberalism outside the beltway the reaction
was even harsher:

<p>

Humor columnist Art Buchwald fired away: &quot;When a Justice
is hearing a case, no secular person can feel comfortable with
a member of the court who is thinking, 'If this lawyer doesn't
believe in the &quot;burning bush,&quot; he has a serious constitutional
problem.'&quot;[5]

<p>

<I>Des Moines Register</I> writer Donald Kaul, suggested that
Scalia &quot;occupies the outermost reaches of the right of the
court (some days you can only reach him by dogsled).&quot;[6]

<p>

What words could have possibly sparked such -- there's no other word
but <I>scornful</I> -- reactions from so many elements of the working
press? Scalia spoke to the crowd of 650 fellow Americans about the 
difficulty of upholding Christian beliefs, especially a belief in miracles,
in our increasingly secular society. He pointed out that the word
&quot;cretin,&quot; or &quot;fool,&quot; is derived from the French
word for &quot;Christian,&quot; and added:

<p><blockquote>

<i>To be honest about it, that is the view of Christians taken
by modern society. Surely those who adhere to all or most of these 
traditional Christian beliefs are to be regarded as simple-minded.</i>[7]

<p>

The &quot;worldly wise,&quot; he went on:

<p>

<i>just will not have anything to do with miracles . . . [they
assume] that everything from Easter morning to the Ascension had to 
be made up by the groveling enthusiasts</i> (the disciples - ed.) 
<i>as part of their plan to get themselves martyred.</i>[8]

</blockquote><p>

In the midst of this cynicism, he concluded, &quot;We must pray
to endure the scorn of the sophisticated world.&quot;[9] Justice 
Scalia's prayers came not a moment too soon. Those
who immediately attacked the speech, calling it contrary
to American tradition and inconsistent with his role as a judge,
seemed blissfully unaware that they were only confirming the truth
of what he said.

<p>

One professor of constitutional law at American University in
Washington, D.C., blasted the speech and remarked, &quot;We expect
our Supreme Court justices to be the most secular of our public
servants.&quot;[10] <b><i>We</i></b>? Where in our
Declaration of Independence and Constitution is it written that
judges must be less endowed with a sense of religious conviction
than other officials? The professor could only have been speaking
for that group of Americans who agree with <I>his</I> own expectation.
Most Americans <i>still</i> believe that every citizen, regardless
of their religious belief, is equal before the law. It is that
very equality -- the right of Christians to bring their full convictions
into the public square -- that Justice Scalia, and we at FRC, believe is 
under attack.

<p>

Don't let me leave the impression here that Scalia was without
defenders. Among them was syndicated newspaper columnist Cal Thomas,
who eloquently reminded readers that it was a rather
well-known &quot;public servant,&quot; Abraham Lincoln, who said,
&quot;But for this Book [the Bible], we would not know right from
wrong.&quot;[11]

<p>

Is there a difference between Presidents and Supreme Court Justices
in this regard? Our history and tradition say otherwise. The
Supreme Court begins each day of oral argument with the bailiff
stating, &quot;God save this honorable court.&quot; As you enter
the Supreme Court building, there is, on the right side of
the portico, a statue of Moses holding aloft the tablet of the
Ten Commandments.

<p>

The critics say, &quot;Those are mere symbols, devoid of meaning.&quot;
They believe that Scalia crossed a line that Justices must never 
cross -- expressing his religious faith. But once again, they 
don't know our history! Justices of our Supreme Court have time 
and again pronounced themselves about religious faith in general 
and Christianity in particular.

<p>

John Jay, the first Chief Justice, said in 1777:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Providence has given to our people the choice of their rulers,
and it is the duty, as well as the privilege and the interest, of a 
Christian nation to select and prefer Christians for their rulers.</i>[12]

</blockquote><p>

Imagine any public official saying something similar today! No
Christian leader or politician would echo Jay's observation today,
but the point is, such beliefs were not extraordinary among the
men and women who founded this nation. Daniel Webster is esteemed
as one of the five greatest senators in U.S. history, by resolution
of the Senate.[13] At the bicentennial of the Pilgrims' landing at
Plymouth Rock in 1620, Webster's keynote address included these
words:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Our ancestors established their system of government on morality
and religious sentiment. Moral habits, they believed, cannot safely be 
trusted on any other foundation than religious principle, nor any 
government be secure which is not supported by moral habits. Whatever 
makes men Christians, makes them good citizens.</i>[14]

</blockquote><p>

In July 1835, when Chief Justice John Marshall died, the Liberty
Bell was rung, sustaining the crack that is one of the keys to
its fame.[15] Are American traditions affronted by the fact that the
Liberty Bell, one of a handful of supposedly secular American
&quot;shrines,&quot; bears the words of Leviticus 25:10: &quot;Proclaim
liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof&quot;?
In 1852, Justice John McLean wrote a letter asserting that &quot;Aside
from Revelation, darkness rests upon the world and upon the future.
The Bible has shed a glorious light upon the world.&quot;[16]

<p>

To all of these examples, dozens more could be added, from
Lincoln to McKinley to Coolidge, to TR and FDR, to John F. Kennedy,
to Jimmy Carter, to Ronald Reagan. Candid assertions of the importance
of religious beliefs to democratic institutions transcend partisan
divisions. It was Justice William O. Douglas, perhaps the Supreme
Court's leading liberal for nearly four decades, who wrote
that, &quot;We are a religious people whose institutions
presuppose a Supreme Being.&quot;[17]

<p>

In short, what Justice Scalia said is in keeping with
a long line of statements by American jurists and statesmen. But
what about the substance of what he said? Do Christians face any
special level of scorn in modern society? Sadly, I believe they
do. Among the Beltway publications, the liberal <I>Washington Post</I>
published the most hostile appraisal of Scalia's speech. Of course, 
just a few years ago, they printed a front-page story suggesting 
that Christian voters are &quot;poor, uneducated and easily led.&quot;

<p>

Just a few weeks ago, the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> printed a cartoon
showing a crucified Bob Dole. A crown of thorns was depicted lacing
his head, with the crown composed of letters spelling out, &quot;Christian
Coalition.&quot;[18] That same paper, on Easter Sunday, refused to
print the regular Johnny Hart comic strip called &quot;B.C.&quot;
because it referred positively to the Resurrection of Christ.
&quot;B.C.&quot; was out, and PC, political correctness, was in!

<p>

Perhaps the real scourges in our society today are reserved for
sincere religious believers <I>of any kind</I>. Consider what
happened to Marian P. MacDonald and Teen Challenge. Marian spent
32 years building an outstanding record as a public school teacher
in Greensboro, North Carolina. She was forced to resign her post
last month under pressure from the school system. The reason?
She invited members of Teen Challenge to one of her health and
physical education classes. Teen Challenge is an extremely effective
drug rehabilitation organization that incorporates religious principles
in its program.

<p>

The visiting teens told MacDonald's class they believed God had
helped them overcome drug abuse, but added, &quot;We are not here
to push our religion off on anybody.&quot; Apparently, that disclaimer
was not enough. The school principal sent a note home to parents
apologizing for the teens' &quot;insensitive comments.&quot; An
investigation followed, and MacDonald was essentially fired.[19] 
Stories like this are all too common.

<p>

I believe that Justice Scalia, whose sense of fairness and level
of scholarship are without match in the federal judiciary, has paid
religion the high compliment of taking it seriously. As I reported
to you last month, Christian convictions <I>are</I> cause for
persecution in many lands around the globe. Bigotry against
Christians in American, by comparison, seems mild; but that bigotry
is real nonetheless. Moreover, the aggressive, secularizing forces
in our nation today are committed to keeping you and me out of 
government, law, and the public debate on all the great issues.

<p>

True religious tolerance <i>is</i> the American way. But Justice
Scalia's critics would have you believe that the sanctity of human
life, traditional marriage, equal access of religious speakers
to the public square, and dozens of other ideas are merely a religious
creed and not the common code of civilization. In a healthy society,
Scalia's articulation of his private thoughts in the setting of
a private prayer breakfast would not have been news. That
they are news at all tells us a great deal about the crisis facing
America today.

<p>

I can assure you that, with your help, the Family Research Council
will continue to speak calmly, but passionately, in behalf of
moral values and true religious liberty. We hold with Daniel Webster
that good Christianity and good citizenship go hand in hand. And
we invite all Americans of goodwill to join with us in honoring
and preserving the values of family, faith and freedom.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. We'd love to hear from you this month. Many of you are already
aware of the &quot;Compact with Our Fellow Americans&quot; included
in my book <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams.</I> The Compact is designed
to renew the spirit of cooperation among our citizens. Its final
provision states, &quot;In our personal lives, we promise to honor
the Creator, who made us and endowed us with such unalienable
rights as life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We will
practice our faith on a daily basis and will gather with others
to worship regularly. Without resorting to coercion or vilification,
we will encourage faith, and the fruits of faith, in others.&quot;

<p>

Just check the enclosed reply card if you would like a free copy
of the Compact, suitable for framing. Thank you for your support
of our efforts on behalf of America's families and for reading
my letter this month. God bless you.

<title>Gary Bauer's December, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

December 6, 1996

<p><br><br>

<ul><ul>

<i>It was a great comfort to feel, all during the
last days when affairs looked doubtful, that no matter how things
came out the really important thing was the lovely life I have
with mother and with you children and that compared to this home
life everything else was of small importance from the stand point
of happiness.

Theodore Roosevelt<br>
from a letter to his son Kermit<br>
1904</i>

</ul></ul></ul></ul>

<p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

Christmas comes to Washington, D.C., much the
same way it comes to your hometown.  Street lights come on earlier,
stores stay open later, there are smiles on more faces, and bell-ringing
members of the Salvation Army brave the cold and take up their
posts.  Around the city seasonal decorations are hung from every
pillar and post, multi-colored bulbs burn in windows and on trees.
Fervent prayers for safe travel go forth, as we remember Christmases
past and eagerly anticipate the arrival of family members, including
sons and daughters from college or military assignments around
the globe.

<p>

Yes, Christmas comes to Washington as it does
to every other city, but it comes here with a rather peculiar
force.  Partly it's because of the history of our nation's capital,
but even more significantly, I think, it's because of the political
nature of this city.  Throughout most of the year, an air of aggressive
secularity reigns in Washington.  Faith is not absent here, but
it too often takes a backseat to the public business being conducted.
Not so at Christmas-time, however.  As an anonymous writer once
noted about Christmas in Washington, &quot;Officially, the government
of the United States does not celebrate religious holidays.  Unofficially,
of course, it does.&quot;

<p>

That &quot;unofficial&quot; celebration of the
birth of Christ has irresistible power.  The white columns of
government buildings are festooned with wreaths and ribbons.
Christmas trees are lit at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.
On the open Ellipse just south of the White House the National
Christmas Tree stands proudly, established by President Calvin
Coolidge and lit every year since 1923.  Each year, thousands
of visitors come to visit the tree and to see the life-sized Nativity
scene that even the Scrooges at the ACLU have been unable to dislodge.

<p>

On one occasion our National Christmas Tree
was nearly darkened -- not by church-and-state lawyers, but by
the nightmare of a nation at war.  On December 7, 1941, Japanese
forces attacked Pearl Harbor.  America entered the war and Nazi
Germany and Fascist Italy declared war upon us.  In those first
days of the conflict blackouts were declared along the East Coast
as American leaders feared the worst.

<p>

In Washington, too, a blackout was ordered.
Our military and the Secret Service compiled a list of actions
they wanted taken to protect the Executive Mansion and the Congress,
including even the repainting of the White House in standard Army
Air Corps camouflage.  President Franklin Roosevelt resisted many
of their recommendations, rightly sensing that they would seriously
depress the indomitable American spirit.  But one security demand
made him bristle the most:  <I>no Christmas Tree on the Ellipse</I>,
the agencies said, <I>it would be too obvious a target</I>.

<p>

But Roosevelt refused to give in, and on Christmas
Eve, 1941, President and Mrs. Roosevelt stood on the south portico
of the White House and threw a switch to light the National Christmas
Tree, as a national radio audience tuned their receivers.  In
the midst of the blackout, the tree provided the only light for
miles around.  Beside the Roosevelts on the portico stood Winston
Churchill, who had traveled secretly to Washington and arrived
only that morning to encourage his American partners.  That night,
the British leader delivered a message that captured the essence
of the symbol Roosevelt was defending in lighting the tree.  Churchill
spoke to (and for) all Americans when he said:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Let the children have their night of laughter . . . Let us
grown-ups share . . . in their unstinted pleasures
before we turn again to the stern tasks and the formidable
years that lie before us, resolved that by our sacrifice
and daring these same children shall not be robbed
of their inheritance or denied their right to live in
a free and decent world.</i>

</blockquote><p>

Today, of course, the clouds of war are not
gathered on every side.  But Churchill's words, and the meaning
of Christmas, retain all of their urgency.  Sacrifice and daring
are still needed in this fight, fought with words of persuasion
and prayers of petition, for the right of our children and our
grandchildren to live in a free and decent world.  If I have any
goal at the Family Research Council, it is to continue to frustrate
the Scrooges and the nay-sayers by keeping the lights burning
brightly on the Christmas trees of family, faith and freedom all
throughout this great land.

<p>

Christmas truly is the feast of childhood.
On this holy day, we mark the event where our God in heaven came
to us as a child, with a message that we must come to Him as children
if we want to see His face.  The words of Teddy Roosevelt that
I quoted at the beginning of this letter offer us another reminder
of the meaning of our work in this life.  Teddy was a remarkable
president, but an excellent book about him called <I>A Bully Father</I>
reminds us of the priorities that ruled his life even in the midst
of political turmoil. Teddy Roosevelt placed his family first,
no matter what the season.

<p>

His ardent devotion to conservation led him
to refuse to place a freshly cut Christmas tree in the White House.
But during his White House years he turned a blind eye when his
sons carried a tree up into the residence and hid it in their
closet.  On Christmas morning, his letters to his children reveal,
he rejoiced in the family custom of gathering in his and Edith's
bedroom as the six children romped and peered into their stockings
and opened their presents.  These events recalled for TR &quot;just
such a Christmas&quot; as he had known in his youth, and it was
&quot;just such a Christmas&quot; he endeavored to reproduce exactly
for his own family.

<p>

This Christmas season, I'm sure your family
has its own traditions to relive, customs you seek to renew time
and time again.  It doesn't really seem to matter what they are:
large or small, children remember and treasure each one.  My prayer
is that you will enjoy each and every moment that you have together.

<p>

For my family, Christmas will be particularly
special this year.  For a short while, life once again will be
exactly as it was ... Carol and me coming down the stairs each
morning to find all of our children under our roof.  Our daughter
Elyse will be home from college after a long semester.  She hasn't
chosen a major yet, but increasingly she feels drawn toward political
science and law.  On campus, she really enjoys her involvement
in the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.  Our high school sophomore,
Sarah, is learning to drive.  In addition to that excitement,
every Tuesday she and a dozen classmates gather at our house at
6:30 in the morning to pray and share their love for God and His
Son Jesus Christ.  Our son, Zachary, just celebrated his 10th
birthday.  He continues to grow in his faith, while he uses his
God-given talents and abilities to play every sport possible.
His soccer season just ended and basketball practice has already
begun.

<p>

Now that I have filled you in on my family,
it occurs to me that we would like to have an update from you, too. 
A few years ago, I asked readers of my monthly letter to send us
a family picture and tell us about their family.  We still treasure
the pictures and letters we received.  With permission, many of
those letters and the incidents they relate have found a place
in one of our publications, like <I>Reunion</I> or <I>Let Freedom
Ring</I>, or in the military exhibit at our new location in 
Washington.

<p>

If you have a moment -- perhaps while you're
sending out your Christmas cards or in the quieter days after
Christmas -- could you send us an updated photograph and tell
us how your family is doing?  If you haven't written before or
are new to my letters, we're all the more anxious to learn something
about you and your family.  Your photos and letters mean a lot
to all of us at FRC.  They remind us, just as Teddy Roosevelt's
letter to Kermit does, why we're here and whom we represent. They
also remind us that our happiness rests on a foundation that no
one can take away.

<p>

Thank you for all you do in partnership with
us to help build and preserve that &quot;free and decent world&quot;
of which Churchill spoke.  Next month, I'll be writing to share
with you the specific policy steps we will be pursuing with the
105th Congress to help achieve that &quot;world&quot; -- steps
to protect the sanctity of human life, to clean up our polluted
culture, to ease the economic pressures on families, and to promote
education reforms that help ensure that every child hears the
kind of historical truths that are recounted in this letter.

<p>

From all of us at FRC to all of yours, both near
and far, we wish you a peaceful and blessed Christmas.  May God
be with you this holiday season and throughout the coming year.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S.  End-of-year gifts represent a major portion
of the funds the Family Research Council receives from our supporters.
As you consider the gifts you intend to make this Christmas,
I sincerely hope you will consider FRC worthy of your continued
support.

<title>Gary Bauer's August, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

August 13, 1996

<p><br><br>

<ul><ul>

<i>He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might
he giveth strength. Even the youths shall faint, and be weary; and 
the young men shall utterly fall. But they that wait upon the Lord 
shall renew their strength; they shall mount with wings as eagles; 
they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not 
faint.</i>

</ul></ul>

<p><center>

<i>- Isaiah 40:29-31</i>

</center><p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

While watching the Olympic games last month, I couldn't help
but recall these poignant words from the prophet Isaiah.  These
verses play a pivotal role in the classic film <I>Chariots of
Fire,</I> the true story of Scottsman, Eric Liddell, an Olympic
runner.  Liddell recites this passage from Scripture at a church
service held on a day he was supposed to run a race in the Paris
Games. <I>Chariots of Fire</I> tells how Liddell, a dedicated
Christian, refused to run on the Sabbath, standing by his personal
conviction in the face of intense pressure from the future King
of England and others.

<p>

Even though my athletic ability won't get me into the Olympics,
I must tell you that these hectic summer months have all of us
at Family Research Council (FRC) running hard.  Time and again,
we are led back to God's promise that He will renew our strength,
that he will enable us to effectively run the race and that His
strength will never fail.  FRC's staff has truly been pressed
to the limit in recent days, and just like Olympic athletes, we
have experienced the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
Let me share with you, some of the many hills and hurdles FRC
has encountered.

<p>

This month, the major events requiring our attention are the
conventions of national political parties.  The Republicans met
first in San Diego, followed by the National Taxpayer's Party,
Ross Perot's Reform Party, and finally the Democrats.  The Libertarian
Party has already nominated its presidential candidate.  As a
non-partisan organization, FRC continues to focus its energies
on providing each of these parties with a detailed agenda for
families. As I reported to you last month, FRC has advocated
the pro-family agenda in a wide variety of public forums and we
will continue to do so regardless of  the response we receive
from party leaders and the media elite.

<p>

As you read this, chances are I'll be returning to Washington
after having taken the pro-family message to the GOP Convention
in San Diego.  We have urged each of the nation's political parties
to make America's families a priority.  We want Democrats, Republicans,
and the smaller &quot;third parties&quot; alike, to see &quot;family&quot;
<b><i>not</i></b> in terms of election cycles, but in terms of daily
responsibilities and everyday needs.  We have urged them all to
adopt platforms that strengthen marriage, recognize the sanctity
of human life, cut taxes for families, and to pay increased attention
to the cultural decay undermining our society.

<p>

In San Diego, I addressed a rally at Sea World designed to urge
the GOP to uphold its commitment to the sanctity of life, to lower
taxes on families and to work for economic opportunitiy and growth.
I made our case to convention delegates and to the national media,
who always crowd these events.  In the weeks before the conventions,
my schedule was crammed with appearances on network and cable
talk shows to discuss the issues at stake during this election
year.  Incredibly, FRC was cited more than 1,500 times in the
print media nationwide in June.  Needless to say,  FRC Press Secretary,
Kristi Hamrick and her quality staff are incredibly busy.

<p>

For my part, there was CNN's &quot;Inside Politics&quot; to discuss
the GOP platform plank on abortion, an appearance on &quot;Crossfire&quot;
with former Gov. Carroll Campbell to discuss the presidential
campaign, another visit to the weekly commentary show, &quot;The
Capital Gang,&quot; an interview with Ollie North on his daily
radio show and numerous other media opportunities.

<p>

Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, FRC has provided in-depth research
and related resource materials to lawmakers who are concerned
about the attack on traditional marriage. Our recent full page ad in
<I>USA Today</I>, which I described in my June letter, was just 
the opening move in our effort to inform citizens
about the potential impact of an expected court decision in Hawaii.
This decision would recognize same-sex marriages and potentially
impose similar recognition on other states.

<p>

To most Americans, I suspect, the reason that one man/one woman
marriage is so vital to the survival of our society almost goes
without saying.  But in these times, people need regular, convincing
reminders about the fundamentals.  That's why FRC recently hosted
a briefing on Capitol Hill, which gathered together a group of
distinguished scholars, physicians, and public policy experts
to discuss the far reaching implications of  &quot;same sex&quot;
marriage.  The briefing was carried live on C-Span, and was re-aired
several times during the next 24 hours.  As a result, millions
of Americans had the opportunity to join with legislators and
congressional aides to see and hear the powerful testimony that
was presented.

<p>

The arguments against homosexual marriage are convincing and
familiar -- so familiar, in fact, that many of us have forgotten
how to effectively articulate them.  FRC's briefing brought together
people like adoption expert Mary Beth Style, former homosexual
Anthony Falzarano (who now leads Transformation Ex-Gay Ministries
in Washington, D.C.), Amherst Professor of Jurisprudence Hadley
Arkes, psychiatrist and former Yale University Fellow, Jeffrey
Satinover, and FRC's own Bob Knight, each of whom drove home the
essential values that are at stake in this debate. <i>(To help
you understand and articulate the arguments, FRC has condensed
this briefing into an hour-long video -- see the enclosed
reply card for information on how to obtain a copy for your church
or action group.)</i>

<p>

One week after the briefing, I found myself in the thick
of things again as I testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee
in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).  Disappointingly,
most of the senators who attended are very liberal and they are
also in favor of allowing same-sex marriages.  Before I testified,
Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.), a primary opponent of DOMA, used the
hearing to attack the bill.  His central point was that marriage
laws traditionally have been made by the states, and that DOMA
would violate the principle of &quot;federalism,&quot; which says
that Congress will not interfere with the powers of state government.
Unbelievable! Ted Kennedy, quoting &quot;states rights,&quot;
while he has been the major proponent of bigger and bigger government
here in Washington. Maybe cows really can fly!

<p>

Kennedy left before I testified, but as I was finishing my remarks
he returned to the hearing room, so I couldn't resist a jab.
&quot;Senator Kennedy,&quot; I said, &quot;this is the first
time in your career you've made such an outstanding defense of
federalism.&quot;  The usually somber hearing room broke into
raucous laughter, and the liberal senator from Massachusetts sank
back into his chair speechless.  The irony is, DOMA makes a powerful
statement in support of the right of each state to ignore the
radical judicial inventions of other states.  It's true federalism
all the way.

<p>

On the day after my testimony, the full House of Representatives
voted for DOMA 342-67.  This 5-1 margin of victory makes it clear
that DOMA <b><i>is</i></b> mainstream and that the aggressive ambitions
of the homosexual lobby <b><i>are not</i></b>.  In the coming days, FRC
will continue scrambling to help ensure that DOMA passes the Congress
without amendments and goes to the president for signature.  We
intend to do everything we can to send the Hawaii courts -- and liberal
judges everywhere -- a powerful message.

<p>

Here are several other fronts on which FRC has been fighting
for America's families:

<p><ul>

<li>FRC Director of Legal Policy, Cathleen Cleaver, has been in
the thick of the raging debates over computer pornography, cable
porn, and social issues from assisted suicide to religious liberty.
Cathleen played a key role in the recent adoption of the Communications
Decency Act, a bill passed by Congress earlier this year that
will help keep distributors of computer porn away from our children.
A federal court in Philadelphia struck down this law, but Cathleen
has begun work on FRC's legal brief to the Supreme Court, which
is likely to hear the case this fall.

<p>

FRC is also fighting for the right of citizens to offer sidewalk
counseling to women seeking abortions.  Cathleen prepared a brief
to the Supreme Court in the <I>Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network</I>
case and she is working with other lawyers to prepare oral arguments
to be made before the Court. Two major assisted suicide cases
are also getting our attention.  Either one could lead to a landmark
Supreme Court ruling which would protect human life, or put millions
of elderly and handicapped Americans at risk.

<p>

Finally, Cathleen is taking her effective debating skills before
some very tough audiences, and more than holding her own.  This
summer she has debated cable porn with Elliott Mincberg of People
for the American Way. She also locked horns over computer porn
with the government relations director of America On-line (a
longtime lawyer for the porn industry.) The computer porn debate
was shown on C-Span to a national audience.

<p>

<li>Robert Maginnis, FRC Policy Analyst has continued to spearhead
our Military Readiness Project. Bob came to FRC from the U.S. Army,
following his retirement, with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.
Together with Melissa Wells-Petry, the Armed Forces' acknowledged
expert on the policy banning service in the military by homosexuals,
Bob has guided FRC's work this summer on three major court cases
regarding the ban. One of these cases, <I>Thomasson v. Perry</I>,
may soon be considered by the U.S. Supreme Court.

<p>

Bob has been working diligently on the drug issue as well, and
one glance at the trends will tell you how urgent this is.  In
the past three years, drug abuse has spiraled, especially -- and
most disturbingly -- among elementary school-age children using
gateway drugs like marijuana.  Bob recently attended a major
international drug conference in Sweden, and in early August he
met with Gen. Barry McCaffrey, President Clinton's drug czar,
to lay out FRC's specific concerns.

<p>

<li>Then there's Marty Dannenfelser, FRC Director of Government
Relations, and his excellent staff who have worked long and hard
on the effort to override the Clinton veto of the partial-birth
abortion ban. A vote in Congress, on this issue, is expected
soon after Labor Day. Marty's experienced team also played a
major role in the passage of a new bill which creates a national
commission on gambling, working in conjunction with our friend,
Congressman Frank Wolf (R- Va.).

<p>

<li>FRC has also been blessed to have the talents of Bob Morrison
and Jennifer <i>A</i>. Marshall on education issues, Jennifer
<i>E</i>. Marshall (that middle initial is not a misprint -- the
mail-sorting staff at FRC has its hands full!) on welfare reform
and voluntarism, Ryan Dobson (Jim Dobson's son) on youth issues,
and Steve Knudsen, our new director of state and local affairs,
who helped put together our recent press conference with state
family policy councils to endorse laws barring same-sex marriage.

</ul><p>

These are just a few of the activities that have kept FRC moving
at a sprinter's pace this summer. I wish I could tell you more
about the work of each and every member of our dedicated staff
members in Washington, D.C. and in Holland, Michigan, where our
constituent services and information systems teams are located.
FRC's team is top-notch, and it includes you, our beloved supporters.
Working together, we can make a significant difference in the
future of our country... in the way our families, our children,
and our grandchildren will spend their lives.

<p>

Thank you for all you do to help keep FRC moving forward. Your
involvement in our work is essential to our success.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. While we've been busy running the race, financial support
for our work has fallen into the typical summer doldrums.  Your
help would give FRC a special boost right now, so please consider
making a contribution if you possibly can. Again, thank you -- and
God bless you.

<title>Gary Bauer's November, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

November 6, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend,

<p>

I know that your first reaction to yesterday's election returns 
is to be disheartened. I found myself recalling the words of Thomas 
Jefferson, who suggested that we should tremble for our country as 
we consider that God is just.

<p>

But, my friends, as people of faith devoted to the family, there must 
be no room in our hearts for demoralization.  It is not just that 
there were many bright spots on Election Day, including the 
strengthening of pro-family forces in Congress.  No, it's the fact 
that we are obliged in conscience to carry on our fight for the family, 
no matter what one day's election returns suggest. The worst thing we 
could do now is to retreat from the public square.  Instead we must 
advance the pro-family banner boldly and without shame.  I have hope 
for the future -- because the truth is on our side, 
the lessons of history are on our side, and, I believe, the will of 
the people is on our side.

<p>

I am not naive.  In the coming year, the principles that unite us -- 
traditional values, the sanctity of human life, smaller government, 
and lower taxes -- will be under political and cultural attack as 
never before. Regarding these threats, I can speak only for me and my 
"house" at the Family Research Council: "We will redouble our efforts to 
speak for your values and to bring the truth to the American people."

<p>

With that in mind, as election day approached, my staff and I put 
together a six-point plan of action.  Today, as the final vote is 
still being tallied we begin to implement this plan, with you at our side.

<p><ul>

<li>Pro-family Americans have been too passive -- not <i>too active</i>! -- 
in their approach to public life.  Too often we've waited for our party system 
to produce for us candidates who will subscribe to some portion of our 
world view, candidates who, by design and default, always seem to fail 
us at the finish line.  The truth is, our movement should be producing 
and promoting leaders of its own.  I want you to know that achieving 
this goal is at the top of my personal priorities for the coming year. 
In my capacity as a private citizen, I will be organizing a political 
action committee, which I believe you'll be hearing a lot about in 
the near future.

<p>

<li>Each month 250,000 American homes receive our monthly publication, 
<i>Washington Watch</i>.  With your help, <b>FRC will double the 
circulation of this publication within the next 12 months</b>. Early 
next year <b>FRC will unveil a new and expanded version of <i>Watch</i></b>. 
We must make it our goal <b>to reach every American home in which 
there still burns a spark of love for this land Lincoln called 
"the last, best hope of Earth."</b>

<p>

<li>FRC will launch a youth leadership program here in Washington, 
D.C.  If the family is to survive (my friends, it <i>will</i> survive), 
if religious values are not to be completely routed from the public 
square (my friends, they <i>will</i> not), <b>we must act now to foster a 
new generation of leaders with a profoundly Christian world view.</b> The 
darker this night of cultural amorality becomes, the more youthful 
flames we must light that will kindle hope for our country.

<p>

<li>Our very self-government is at stake when the acts of duly elected 
legislatures, or of the people themselves, to restrict abortion, protect 
parental rights, and safeguard the institution of marriage are trampled 
by our runaway judges.  Judicial tyranny must end.  I pledge to you 
today <b>a sweeping campaign to check and balance our out-of-control 
courts.</b> We must become again a people who insist that <b>no one govern 
us without our consent.</b>

<p>

<li>The power to tax is the power to destroy.  How many of our 
government's destructive schemes would be possible if it did not 
seize nearly 45 cents of every dollar that hardworking families 
earn? There will be no freedom without tax freedom. <b>Today I am 
launching, in partnership with key economic conservative organizations, 
a massive push for across-the-board tax relief.</b> We will begin with 
tax credits for families with children and end the double taxation 
that occurs when government taxes the estates our families have 
shored up over a lifetime of sweat and sacrifice. <b>Our families 
built this capital; the meddling Washington establishment must be 
stopped from hauling it away.</b>

<p>

<li>Early in the new year, FRC will convene a summit of leaders of 
major pro-family groups and religious leaders who share our profound 
concern for the cultural decay now gripping the Western world. We will 
pool ideas and, where possible, resources to provide an effective 
counter to the forces of cultural disintegration.  Our response will be 
as global as the threat we face.  In the coming months and years, it is 
imperative that pro-family groups work together. <b>I pledge my total 
effort to help achieve this goal.</b>

</ul><p>

One final word. I do not view these steps as an ambitious plan. This 
is the <b>minimum</b> we must do to give this generation, and the next 
generation, of American families a fighting chance.  I cannot promise 
you we will succeed at everything we do, but I can promise you that we 
will try as never before. FRC has been positioned -- I pray by 
God's grace -- in the nation's capital to be here for the family at 
such a time as this.

<p>

In the coming days, please consider this plan and let me know if I have 
your support.  Your prayers and encouragement mean so much, and your 
financial support is FRC's very lifeblood.  I know that you are counting 
on the Family Research Council.  We will do everything we can to be worthy 
of the trust you place in us. God bless you.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<title>Gary Bauer's June, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

June 7, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

June is fittingly called &quot;the month of weddings.&quot; 
As the first real warm days of summer finally arrive, skies are
blue, flowers are blooming, and brides and grooms are seemingly
everywhere.  Marriage is never out of season, but I can think
of no better time than the month of June for our nation to reaffirm
the value and meaning of marriage.

<p>

As this letter is written, a reaffirmation of marriage is taking
place all across our land.  You can hear it in the peal of church
bells and read about it in wedding announcements and church bulletins.
You can even see it in brightly decorated cars parading by on
dazzling June days.  But this reaffirmation is taking place in
another way, too.

<p>

In Washington, DC, and in over 30 states, legislators are stepping
forward to make sure that marriage is protected in American law.
My letter is brief this month because the Family Research Council
is in the thick of this essential effort.  The reaffirmation of
traditional marriage is coming <b>just in time</b>.  Even as I
write this, an organized assault is in progress to redefine marriage
to allow men to marry men and women to marry women.

<p>

Let me recap quickly what has happened.  In 1993, the highest
court in Hawaii handed down a shocking decision.  Liberal judges
there said that Hawaii's law limiting marriage to one man and
one woman (similar to laws in every other state) was a form of
sex discrimination -- unless the state could somehow show that it
had a &quot;compelling interest&quot; in reserving marriage to
couples of the opposite sex!  Hawaii is a very liberal state politically,
but this ruling sparked immediate outrage even there.

<p>

Nearly three quarters of Hawaii's citizens told pollsters they
<I>reject</I> making Hawaii a haven for homosexual couples to
&quot;marry.&quot;  In 1994 the Hawaii legislature responded and
passed a law reaffirming that marriage is intended for &quot;man-woman
units&quot; -- not two men or two women.

<p>

Despite the findings of this poll, and subsequent efforts to
convince the courts that Hawaii does have a &quot;compelling interest&quot;
here, most experts believe that traditional marriage in Hawaii
will be struck down -- perhaps as soon as this August.  If that happens,
homosexual couples from every state in the Union are ready to
fly to Hawaii and find &quot;chapels&quot;or Justices of the Peace
to marry them.  They will then return to their home states and
demand recognition of these marriages from their state and local
governments, from their employers, from the courts, from their
churches (and from you)!

<p>

The worst news is that these demands have a good chance of succeeding.
Under what is known as the &quot;Full Faith and Credit&quot;
clause of the U.S. Constitution, each state is required to recognize
the &quot;Public Acts, Records and Judicial Proceedings&quot;
of every other state (Article IV, Section 1).   States that refuse
to recognize these Hawaiian &quot;marriage&quot; licenses as valid
are likely to find themselves being sued in court, with the outcome
uncertain.  Unbelievably, the action of a single court -- or even
a single judge -- in Hawaii could lead to a revolution that undoes
the sanctity of the marriage bond in every corner of the United
States.

<p>

<b>We must not -- and cannot -- allow this to happen!</b> When Hawaii's
Supreme Court ruled in 1993, FRC responded with alerts and issue
papers pointing out the devastating impact that would follow.
We and other groups encouraged states to respond by reaffirming
the traditional definition of marriage to insulate it from attack.
The word has spread rapidly, and a wide coalition of religious
and family groups and legislators of all political persuasions
is currently pushing for marriage protection laws.

<p>

Such laws have now been enacted in at least eleven states, and
more may be signed into law by the time you read this.  In addition,
the Congress of the United States is set to respond to this challenge.
With FRC's help and through the dedicated efforts of legal experts
on Capitol Hill, legislation has been introduced to protect marriage
in federal law.  This legislation is called the Defense of Marriage
Act, or DOMA.  It was introduced in the House of Representatives
on May 7 by Reps. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) and Bob  Barr (R-Ga.).
Senate introduction of the legislation followed on May 8 with
Don Nickles (R-Okla.) and Bob Dole (R-Kans.) as co-sponsors.
The respective bill numbers are H.R.3396 and S.1740.

<p>

Make no mistake, this bill is vitally needed.  Sen. Dan Coats
(R-Ind.) issued a powerful statement endorsing the bill and explaining
the importance of marriage.  His quote is worth sharing at length:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Marriage is the institution that civilizes our society by 
humanizing our lives. It is the social, legal and spiritual 
relationship that prepares the next generation for its duties and 
opportunities.  An 1884 decision of the Supreme Court called it 
&quot;the sure foundation of all that is stable and noble
in our civilization.&quot;

<p>

The definition of marriage is not created by politicians and judges, 
and it cannot be changed by them.  It is rooted in our history,
in our laws, our deepest moral and religious convictions, and our 
nature as human beings.  It is the union of one man and one woman. 
This fact can be respected or resented, but it can't be altered.

<p>

The institution of marriage is our most valuable cultural inheritance. 
It is our duty -- perhaps our first duty -- to pass it intact to the 
future . . . It is amazing and disturbing that the debate should even 
be necessary.  It is a sign of the times, and an indication of a deep 
moral confusion.  But events have made the definition of traditional 
marriage essential.  The preservation of marriage has become an issue 
of self-preservation for our society.</i>

</blockquote><p>

With Senator Coats' words, the case for marriage rests.
Be assured that the Family Research Council will continue to
work with him and other like-minded legislators in both parties
to secure passage of this bill as soon as possible -- before a final
decision is reached by the Supreme Court in Hawaii.  Americans
need to be heard before our courts intervene and disturb yet another
legal ideal.  Our goal is that DOMA will swiftly reach President
Clinton's desk and that he will have no choice but to sign it
into law.

<p>

<b>The need for passage of this bill could not be more urgent.
On May 20, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the state of Colorado's
Amendment 2, which would have blocked special rights for homosexuals.
One leader of the homosexual movement bragged, &quot;This is
a joyous day for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans.&quot;</b>

<p>

Please join with us in this effort.  Use the enclosed card, or
call us at 1-800-225-4008, to obtain a free copy of our information
packet on saving the institution of marriage.  Take note of the
enclosed copy of the full-page advertisement we placed in the
May 19 <i>Washington Post</i>.  Feel free to make copies or contact
us to arrange to run this ad in your local newspaper.

<p>

Be assured that your prayers and financial support of the work
of the Family Research Council are what sustain us.  Your involvment
and commitment to FRC will enable us to continue in our efforts
to defend the divine institution of marriage.  As always, thank
you for your friendship, and may God bless you.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

</center>

Since 1991, Kristi Hamrick has served the Family Research Council 
as director of communications, aggressively taking the pro-family 
message forward both in paid media (advertising) and earned media 
(news).  Mrs. Hamrick manages a broad operation that handles all 
in-coming requests from the news media -- from CNN to <I>The New 
York Times</I> -- and out-going media strategy, developing the 
framework for taking the pro-family message nationwide, via 
television, radio and print, and through such vehicles as op-ed 
articles or policy pieces.

<p>

The news operation at FRC, a pro-family policy and lobbying group, 
works to respond to breaking events and to look ahead at the trends 
that are shaping the American family.  The goal is to influence the 
cultural mindset by taking part in every pro-family debate as it 
happens.  Mrs. Hamrick is a spokesperson for FRC as well as a 
representative of the organization at events and conferences. She 
debates regularly on television, and her appearances include ABC's 
<i>Good Morning America, CBS This Morning</i>, NBC's <i>Today Show, 
The Montel Williams Show, Fox News</i>, CNN's <i>Jesse Jackson Both 
Sides</i> and numerous other CNN programs.  Her articles have appeared 
in <a href="/townhall/FRC/whois/hamdoc.html"><I>USA Today</I></a>, 
and she has been quoted nationwide, in publications including the 
<I>New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Washington 
Times, USA Today, Boston Globe</I>, Gannett News, Knight Ridder News, 
and The Associated Press. Her voice can be heard daily on radio 
programs throughout the United States.

<p>

As part of the coordinated FRC effort, Mrs. Hamrick also develops 
media strategies as part of FRC's work in government relations, 
grassroots coalition building, research and policy development, 
corporate and community outreach and publication marketing.

<p>

Before joining FRC in 1991, Mrs. Hamrick worked as press secretary 
in the Hopkins for Governor Campaign.  Mrs. Hamrick was a spokesperson 
for the campaign and directed the media operation for the U.S. 
congressman from Kentucky when he won his primary bid. Earlier in her 
career, Mrs. Hamrick also worked in the press operations of the late 
U.S. Senator John Heinz and Senator Arlen Specter, both of Pennsylvania.

<p>

Most of Mrs. Hamrick's experience is in the media.  In Washington, 
D.C., she was an on-air correspondent for CBN News Washington, D.C. 
Bureau, covering social issues.  In print, Mrs. Hamrick worked for 
<I>The Muncie Star</I>, covering courts, crime and politics, after 
completing a Pulliam Fellowship at <I>The Indianapolis Star</I>. In 
fact, Mrs. Hamrick worked her way through college as a writer and 
journalist.  She continues the crafts of a wordsmith, working on 
occassion as a freelance journalist.

<p>

Mrs. Hamrick's extensive speaking experience includes many appearances 
in schools and colleges.  She also taught news writing and advanced 
news writing at Ball State University in Indiana.

<p>

Mrs. Hamrick graduated <I>cum laude</I> and with honors in 
communications from Anderson University in Anderson, Ind. She and 
her husband, Michael Hamrick, reside in Northern Virginia.

<title>Gary Bauer's October, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

October 16, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend,

<p>

<i>Last month, just before the Congress adjourned, the Senate held its 
historic debate on partial-birth abortion.  At the end of an incredible 
day on Capitol Hill, I sat down at 1:00 o'clock in the morning to write 
you this "eyewitness account"</i>:

<p>

It's nearly 1:00 o'clock in the morning as I write this month's letter to 
you. I have just finished an unbelievable 20-hour day in which my emotions 
have run the gamut from exhilaration to deep despair.  The focus of 
today's events was the vote in the United States Senate to overturn 
President Clinton's veto of the partial-birth abortion bill. We lost that 
vote, but in the process we may have taken a giant step toward stopping the 
ongoing tragedy of abortion on demand.  Let me share with you a few excerpts 
from the roller coaster ride I was on today as we spoke the truth about the 
sanctity of human life to the powerful elites here in Washington, D.C.

<p>

My day began on the <i>CBS Morning News</i>, where I debated Kate Michelman 
of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League.  As is 
usually the case, the morning talk shows only give us four or five minutes 
to present our views on an issue -- this morning was no exception.  I knew 
I had to have my arguments down pat, for there is little time to hesitate 
or reflect when you're sitting in a TV studio under a bank of hot 
lights.  I also knew a sharp debater like Michelman would be sure to 
quickly fill any time I didn't use.

<p>

I often feel frustrated after such a debate because I don't usually get 
enough time to fully express my views or because I don't think of the 
best way to articulate some arguments until the debate is over.  But 
this morning was a "home run."  The CBS anchorwoman was fair, and she 
gave me equal time.  I was able to establish for the millions of people 
watching that partial-birth abortions <i>do</i> occur thousands of times a 
year -- most of them for purely elective reasons rather than because of 
health problems of the mother or her baby.  Kate Michelman presented few 
relevant arguments and seemed unusually low-key.  It had to be tough for 
her to defend the position that it could ever be okay to abort a baby in the 
eighth or ninth month of pregnancy by stabbing it in the back of the head.

<p>

But there was no time to relish the debate victory. I was immediately 
rushed from the CBS studio to attend an extraordinary prayer breakfast 
on Capitol Hill.  Pro-life senators led by Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania 
hosted the gathering to pray that senators' hearts would be touched 
before they voted.  The solemn gathering in that small room included 
some of the real "stars" of the pro-family/pro-life movement -- proven 
crusaders like Chuck Colson and my good friend and colleague Jim Dobson 
of Focus on the Family. We took turns asking God for His wisdom and 
strength for the tough hours of lobbying ahead.  More importantly, we 
prayed that God would have mercy on our country as it slips further 
and further into the culture of death.

<p>

A few minutes after breakfast, the ecumenical group gathered again -- 
this time in the office of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.  There 
we participated in a press conference on the upcoming vote.  Fourteen 
pro-life leaders made individual statements before a bank of TV cameras 
and a forest of microphones.  The room was jammed from one wall to the 
other, and the hot TV lights glared down on us all.  We were expecting 
the usual hostility of the liberal Washington media.  But again, 
strangely, there were no real arguments -- no hardball questions. Only 
one reporter even asked a question, and I was given the opportunity to 
answer.  He asked whether I was satisfied with the attention Bob Dole 
had paid to the issue. My response was clear: I told the reporter 
that Bob Dole was not responsible for partial-birth abortions.  I said 
we were here because Bill Clinton had vetoed a bill passed overwhelmingly 
by the Congress to stop these horrible procedures.  I then urged Senator 
Dole in the remaining days of the campaign to emphasize the issue and to 
draw the stark comparison between himself and his opponent so the 
American people could clearly understand their choice.

<p>

After the press conference, we all fanned out on Capitol Hill to buttonhole 
lawmakers.  We met Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania as he got off the 
Capitol subway, and, even though he is usually pro-abortion, we ultimately 
won his vote. A few minutes later, we encountered Senator Joe Biden of 
Delaware, and he ended up voting with us too.  Unfortunately, other senators 
were harder to convince.  Senator Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas refused to hear 
us out when we appealed to her in the Senate dining room.  She said she 
didn't even think the Senate should be discussing the issue.  My good 
friend Kay James, who is a black American, told Mrs. Kassebaum that she was 
glad that her attitude didn't prevail in our country when slavery was 
being debated over 100 years ago!

<p>

As we walked the halls of the Capitol, the abortion debate was raging on 
the floor of the Senate.  Good friends, senators like Dan Coats of Indiana, 
John Ashcroft of Missouri and Don Nickles of Oklahoma, led the floor debate 
while a hushed gallery of visitors looked on.  The pro-abortion side was 
led by Barbara Boxer of California.

<p>

We sat in the Senate gallery together to watch the proceedings -- myself, 
Dr. Dobson, Kay, Beverly LaHaye of Concerned Women for America, Anthony 
Cardinal Bevilacqua of Philadelphia, Rabbi Daniel Lapin and a dozen other 
allies.  As I looked around, I couldn't help but wonder what was going on 
in the minds of tourists from all over America who had brought their 
children there with them.  They seemed subdued, almost shocked, as they 
heard senators describe this terrible procedure.  At one emotional moment, 
one pro-life senator pointed to a picture of a baby and shouted in 
exasperation, "This is not an appendix; this is not a lump of tissue; this 
is a baby!"  Here's what happened next as reported by <i>The Washington 
Post</i>:

<p><blockquote>

<i>And then, impossibly, in an already hushed gallery, in one of 
those moments when the floor of the Senate looks like a stage set, with its 
rich wooden desks somehow too small for the matters at hand, the cry of a 
baby pierced the room, echoing across the chamber from an outside hallway.

<p>

No one mentioned the cry, but for a few seconds no one spoke at all.</i>

</blockquote><p>

No one knows whose baby it was that brought the Senate to silence that day, 
but I can't help but believe that God chose that moment for this child to 
cry and, by so doing, to remind the Senate that "choice" in this case means 
the death of <b>real</b> human beings.

<p>

Soon the voting began.  As I am sure you know by now, our efforts helped 
win a clear majority, but we still fell short of the 66 votes needed to 
overturn Clinton's veto.  It was a tragic day, but even in the midst of 
our disappointment and heartbreak, there were some encouraging developments. 
I am convinced that something is stirring among God's people.  The 
cooperation of a large number of religious leaders from different 
denominations and from all parts of the country was unprecedented.  I'm 
convinced, too, that a new level of coalition building has been achieved 
and that the groundwork has been laid for better communication and 
cooperation in the future.

<p>

As the day wore on, my message was the same in every press interview. I 
told reporter after reporter that America is better than the vote that just 
took place.  I also told them that our nation was founded as a "shining 
city on a hill", that we are a unique experiment in liberty under God 
with rights and responsibilities that come only from Him. And this vote 
to allow the outright killing of nearly-born children through the promotion 
of abortion-on-demand sticks in our throats.  It will never go down easy 
with Americans because it violates every tenet of our founding.  Our 
conscience will not rest easy as long as we continue to allow the sacrifice 
of these children.

<p>

More than ever, I believe our beloved nation is at a crossroads, with the 
question Lincoln posed at Gettysburg still before us. As he stood on 
hallowed ground, he said we were conceived in liberty and asked whether 
"this nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure?"

<p>

This is the great question facing our nation as we go into the next century. 
How we resolve the issues of life, family and marriage will determine whether 
America during the next century can still be that "shining city on a hill".

<p>

Even though the hour is late for our country, we must never cease our efforts 
to protect our spiritual heritage.  As God told Solomon, "if my people, who 
are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and 
turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive 
their sin and will heal their land." (II Chronicles 7:14 NIV) We must 
redouble our prayers seeking God's mercy as the elites of our nation look 
farther away from Him. I want you to know that my staff and I are committed 
to do everything in our power to defend the values that have made our 
country great.

<p>

The Family Research Council is here to represent and serve you.  But I have 
to be honest. In recent weeks we haven't been hearing from enough of you. 
We need your encouragement, and your prayers, and we need to know if you 
stand with us in the battle for family, faith and freedom.  We also pray 
that, if you are able, you will choose to help FRC financially, <b>after</b> 
you have met the needs of your family and your church.

<p>

In closing, it's my prayer that God will richly bless you and your family. 
I look forward to hearing from you soon.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. FRC is preparing a special analysis of the upcoming elections 
focusing on how the results will impact you and your family.  To receive

you and may God bless America.

<title>Gary Bauer's July, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

July 12, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

The Bauer family had a close call last month.  An unusually strong
summer thunderstorm ripped through the Washington area, bringing
with it 150-mile-per-hour winds.  To make matters worse, a tornado
touched down on our street, knocking down trees and sending limbs
flying through walls and onto rooftops.  Fortunately, our house
was largely spared, but a neighbor's home was badly damaged.

<p>

My daughter, Elyse, and I were driving home through the storm
when the tornado hit.  I'll never forget the sight as we turned
down our street and saw how the severe weather had rearranged
the familiar objects of our daily lives.  The storm was gone in
a little more than an hour, but it was incredible how quickly
so much raw destruction was wreaked on our community.  Human beings
are no match for the forces of God's Creation.  We were struck
with a sense of awe -- and our hearts were filled with thanks that
the destruction was not worse and that no one was injured or killed.

<p>

That twister wasn't the only storm I encountered last month.
Throughout the month of June, I found myself caught up in a whirlwind
over the Republican Party Platform and the sanctity of human life.
Debate over the GOP's pro-life plank has been going on for years,
but this new storm kicked up suddenly and unexpectedly.  It came
about when Sen. Robert Dole, the certain GOP presidential nominee,
called for the addition of  a &quot;declaration of tolerance&quot;
to the platform, and suggested that it be applied <I>only</I>
to the abortion language.  That current language in the existing
platform says that the unborn child has a fundamental right to
life that cannot be infringed, and calls for a human life amendment
to the Constitution.

<p>

Let me say right up front that Sen. Bob Dole and I have known
each other for years.  I consulted with him last fall, at his
request, before he delivered his speech in Hollywood calling on
the entertainment industry to reverse its tide of sex-and-violence
for profit.  We have collaborated over the years on many other
issues.  A few weeks ago, Jim Dobson and I prayed together with
Bob in his Capitol Hill office.  I consider him a friend, and
I believe he would say the same about me.

<p>

But, in my humble opinion, Bob Dole is wrong about the pro-life
plank. It cannot and should not be changed.  Talk about revising
the plank has been swirling, of course, for months in GOP circles.
Some prominent pro-abortion Republicans, like Govs. Christine
Todd Whitman and Pete Wilson, have insisted on removing it altogether.
To do so would repeat the discussion that took place in the Democratic
party some years ago. The 1992 Democratic Platform endorsed an
abortion on demand philosophy.  A previous statement tolerating
the presence of pro-life Democrats in the party was stripped from
the platform.  As a result, President Clinton has vetoed every
attempt to restrict abortion, including those in the 7th, 8th
and 9th months of pregnancy.

<p>

All during the early summer, I was among a number of pro-life
leaders who were kept abreast of negotiations taking place among
leading Republicans.  After weeks of discussion, an agreement
was reached to include &quot;open door&quot; language in the preamble
to the platform.  That language would only state the obvious:
that the GOP platform stands for a set of principles, and that
not every member of the party agrees with every one of those principles.
The sanctity of human life would not be singled out or in any
other way watered down.  The current pro-life plank, powerful
and unequivocal, would remain as written. No deletions.  No dilutions.

<p>

This solution was acceptable, but within 24 hours Bob Dole himself
overturned it. He used a television interview to declare his
intention to put the tolerance language right in the pro-life
plank. Talk about a twister out of the blue!  This so-called
solution was totally unacceptable, and I said so publicly.  The
sanctity-of-life plank is among a handful of essential statements
in the GOP platform.  To attach &quot;tolerance&quot; language
directly to that plank would signal to the world (and the media
immediately interpreted it this way) that the Republican Party
regards it as one of the least important issues facing the nation,
when in fact the issue goes to the heart of the fundamental purpose
of liberty.

<p>

Just consider the impact of including tolerance language on another
subject, say, taxes:  &quot;We favor tax relief for overworked
Americans, but we recognize that many people disagree with us.&quot;
You would instantly recognize that the party which said this
wasn't serious about cutting taxes.  The same holds true for the
profound question of whether unborn children and their mothers
should be protected from the exploitation of abortions.

<p>

What followed my public criticism of Sen. Dole's proposal was
uncomfortable for both of us.  The senator took me on by name,
and major newspapers were happy to splash the dispute across page
one.  I kept my comments focused on the issues at stake, but it
was an awkward moment for me anyway.  Disputes among friends will
always draw a crowd of spectators.  But this fight, gut-wrenching
as it was, has an upside.  First, I have high hopes that, by the
time you read this, the dispute over the pro-life plank will be
resolved with an agreement that makes it clear that our children
deserve the full protection of the laws of the United States.
Second, this public argument gave me a rare chance to address
the nation on why the sanctity of human life matters so much.

<p>

National Public Radio, as liberal a media outlet as there is,
interviewed me in drive-time, and my comments were carried fairly
and without censorship.  <I>The New York Times</I>, <I>Washington
Post</I> and other major papers accurately reported my defense
of our children.  The following weekend, I was invited to appear
on the prestigious CNN public policy show, <I>The Capital Gang.</I>
I was able to tell large segments of the American people what
our nation's abandonment of the sanctity of human life is doing
to the fabric of our society.  All of this came on the heels of
unprecedented media opportunities for the Family Research Council
(FRC), including appearances on <I>This Week with David Brinkley</I> 
and <I>Face the Nation</I> and a write-up in <I>Time</I> magazine
featuring our principled stands.

<p>

Since all of this happened, I have heard from many people who
say they don't necessarily agree with FRC on every issue, but
that we give them something to think about.  This is vital to
remember.  Where &quot;tolerance&quot; language goes in the Republican
platform -- whether it's there at all -- isn't just a matter of dotting
&quot;i's&quot; and crossing &quot;t's.&quot;  If an issue isn't
important enough to appear in any party's platform, then it's
not worth a national conversation.  How we address the sanctity
of human life will determine whether this nation endures, or whether
it is torn away forever from the ideals that motivated our Founders.

<p>

Let me take a moment here to thank you.  In the middle of this
hot debate, hundreds of you called, wrote and faxed me your support.
Countless friends prayed for my family and for FRC.  Believe
me, we felt that encouragement.

<p>

My relationship with Washington leaders in both parties, including
Bob Dole, matters very much to me.  But the Family Research Council
is committed to speaking the truth:  on the needs of families,
on neglected children, on coarseness in the culture, on the virtue
deficit, and on the violence corroding our common sense of neighborliness.
We will speak the truth in election years and non-election years.
We will speak up when it pleases our friends, and when it doesn't.
To do otherwise would be to convert this organization into just
one more nest of political hired guns in the nation's capital.
I won't have that.  The issues facing America are bigger and
more enduring than one presidential race.

<p>

You will be happy to know, for example, that we are working with
a courageous band of Democrats in Congress who are struggling
to add &quot;tolerance&quot; language to the 1996 Democratic Platform.
This is &quot;tolerance&quot; language we <b><i>can</i></b> support
because it moves in the opposite direction:  it would say that
there is room in the Democratic party for people who champion
the &quot;little guy&quot; in the womb.  Unfortunately, I am not
optimistic about a change in their platform even though 40 percent
of registered Democrats hold pro-life beliefs.  For nearly a decade
now, the party has turned a deaf ear to their pleas.  Instead,
they have allowed radical feminists, the ACLU and gay rights groups
to turn the party into a vehicle for radical social change.

<p>

As I've emphasized many times before, FRC does not endorse candidates,
but we do work diligently to keep the issues affecting America's
families at center stage.  Toward that end, we will work with
anyone, anywhere, who is genuinely willing to espouse family-friendly
public policy.

<p>

While I'm writing to you, let me give you an update on another
&quot;contest&quot; in which I've been involved.  This is the
competition I proposed last January between two visions:  the
big-government philosophy of Hillary Rodham Clinton's book, <I>It
Takes a Village</I>, and the family-centered ideals of my book,
<I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams.</I> This spring, Family Research Council
placed advertisements in newspapers and magazines challenging
the American people to compare the visions in these two books
and to choose the one that best represents their hopes for the
next generation of American children.

<p>

So here are the results to date.  The first lady's publisher
reports that 360,000 copies of <I>It Takes a Village</I> are in
print.  Those figures do not necessarily reflect actual sales.
A similar number of copies of <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> have
now been sold, enough to put this little paperback on the Top
Five list of Christian best-sellers for the past three months.
In short, my competition with Mrs. Clinton is neck-and-neck.

<p>

I realize that this has happened only because thousands of faithful
supporters like you have bought multiple copies of <I>Our Hopes,
Our Dreams</I> and shared them with neighbors, friends, and fellow
believers.  I can hardly ask you to do more.  But consider this:
<I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> was written as a straightforward,
easily understood summary of what has drawn pro-family Americans
into the public policy arena in record numbers.  Can you think
of anyone -- an acquaintance or business associate -- who would benefit
from the couple of hours it takes to read this statement of pro-family
principle?

<p>

If you can, it's easy to use our &quot;800&quot; number to order
<I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> directly from us.  Better still,
however, you can take a step that will aid a vital voice in your
community and help boost the ranking of <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I>
on the best-seller lists.  Visit your local Christian bookstore
and obtain or order a copy there.  Christian booksellers play
an irreplaceable role in spreading the Word, attracting new Christians
and encouraging &quot;old&quot; ones.  Many of these establishments
exist on a shoestring, and they struggle at this time of year.
Please take a moment to drop by and let them know you appreciate
their presence in your community.

<p>

Have a blessed and enjoyable summer (may it be as storm-free
as possible, too!).  From all of us at Family Research Council,
thank you for your support, and God bless you.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. Summers are a great time for families, a time for vacations
and building memories for a lifetime.  The only problem is that
cagey Washington insiders know that grassroots Americans are distracted
from their handling of critical issues. <b><i>This summer, FRC especially
needs your help</i></b>. The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) <I>must</I>
be passed before a Hawaiian court acts in August.  The
Partial-Birth Abortion bill <I>must</I> get a powerful vote in
the House this month to override Bill Clinton's veto.  And we
<i>must</i> push for desperately-needed tax relief for families with
children before Congress adjourns for the fall election campaigns.
I hope you will prayerfully consider giving us your financial
support this month.  With your help, I am convinced that we can
stay in the fight and win. Thank you and God bless you.

<title>Gary Bauer's September, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

September 13, 1996

<p><br><br>

<ul><ul>

<i>Restoring parental rights to their original firm foundation
in U.S. constitutional law is crucial to our overall efforts to
reinvigorate the democratic ideal of citizenship.</i>

</ul></ul>

<p><center>

-- from <i><b>FRC's Moms' and Dads' School Survival Guide</b></i>

</center><p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

A few weeks ago Carol and I drove our oldest daughter, Elyse,
back to college for her second year of studies.  It was wonderful
to have her home for the summer, and saying good-bye was really
hard.  The summer months flew by, reminding us once more how precious
is the time that we have together as a family.  Even though Elyse
attends college only a few hours' drive from our home outside
Washington, D.C. -- close enough for us to see her on some weekends -- 
she's still much farther away than we would prefer.

<p>

Millions of families go through this emotional ritual each September,
and it doesn't really matter that much whether your child is heading
off to college, high school, or to a nearby elementary school
classroom.  Each fall mothers and fathers face the same anxieties
and pressures:  how will my children fare in school?  Will their
teachers recognize their special qualities?  Will teachers honor
and respect their talents and beliefs or will they try to convince
them to &quot;question authority&quot; and reject the values they
have been taught?  What about their classmates?  Will they make
friends?  Will those friends help uphold their faith?  Or will
their faith be weakened?  Or worse, will our children be lead
into trouble?  Is there anyone out there besides us who really
understands the worth of our beloved children?

<p>

Today, questions like these are being asked by every parent and
they unfortunately have a special sharpness to them.  Many of
our nation's schools are no longer the &quot;common ground&quot;
of shared values and aspirations that generations of families
counted on them to be in the past. All too often, today's classrooms
are laboratories for radical ideological experimentation. The
teaching profession has been politicized as never before. Textbooks
and lesson plans routinely foster a liberal world view. Attempts
to isolate, intimidate and confuse religiously inclined students
continue. Violence and illegal drugs are found even in elementary
schools. The &quot;safe sex&quot; philosophy still dominates
sex education.

<p>

I'm sure you're familiar with the statistics on educational decline,
so I won't repeat them here.  The public education establishment
routinely goes out of its way to question the depth of the problem,
but, in the same breath, rushes to endorse the latest reform plan,
a tacit admission that our schools are falling short.  Let me
be especially clear here:  many, if not most, of our teachers
are dedicated educators who are motivated by a love of learning
and of children.  Many, if not most, are disturbed by the same
education fads that distress parents.  Like parents, these teachers
are ill-served by education leaders who are constantly reinventing
the wheel and interfering with what works in real classrooms.

<p>

In fact, the education policy debate of the last few years has
been dominated by the <I>illusion</I> of reform. With every fiber
of their being, the leadership of the nation's massive teachers'
unions, the National Education Association (2.2 million members)
and the American Federation of Teachers (900,000), have opposed
nearly every change in the way our schools are financed and operated.

<p>

Bogus education reform schemes come and go.  Many of them have
impressive-sounding names and a stellar line-up of sponsors.
Desperate for signs of improvement that will give their children
hope, parents are sold various reform packages under such brand
names as Outcome-Based Education, Goals 2000, character education,
mandatory voluntarism, New American Schools and restructuring.
These schemes have different details, but they have at least
two omissions in common:  they leave the basic method of funding
public education untouched, and they leave parents at the margin
of education decision-making.

<p>

The Family Research Council (FRC) is keenly aware of the concerns
expressed by America's families about education, and we are dedicated
to reversing these omissions.  We want parents to control their
education dollars.  We believe that the same hands that rock the
cradle, smooth the fevered brow, set the table, and clothe the
child should direct the funds that educate the child.  The centerpiece
of our campaign for education reform is massive tax relief for
families with children, coupled with genuine parental choice policies
that enable parents to select the school their children will attend.

<p>

Today, more than ever before, I am optimistic about our chances
for success.  School choice plans are gaining momentum and making
headway.  A new study by Harvard's Paul Peterson and Jay P. Greene
at the University of Houston shows that the City of Milwaukee's
parental choice plan has resulted in real academic gains for the
children enrolled in the program.  In August, state courts in
Ohio upheld the constitutionality of a school choice program that
includes religious schools.  Tax credits for families with children
will now be a centerpiece of this year's election debate.

<p>

Most importantly, I'm encouraged that, in the true spirit of
America, parents are not waiting for politicians to respond to
their needs.  They are moving in pioneering numbers to options
like homeschooling, classical education and parent-based education,
which are not so much novelties as rediscoveries of the art of
family-centered teaching and learning.  At the center of all of
this is spiritual renewal, the faith that moves mountains.

<p>

With all of the forces at work in today's education debate, FRC
has developed the <I>Moms' and Dads' School Survival Guide</I>.
This 64-page booklet is packed with resources to help you through
the coming school year.  Between its covers you'll find:

<p><ul>

<li>A glossary of education jargon -- what do the fancy terms 
<I>really</I> mean?

<p>

<li>Feature articles on major topics like Outcome-Based Education,
the religious rights of students, and parental rights in today's
schools.

<p>

<li>Addresses and phone numbers of key resources for homeschooling
and classical education.

<p>

<li>A reference section containing everything from newsletter sources
to web sites dealing with education issues.

</ul><p>

Our <I>Survival Guide</I> is designed to put a wealth of helpful
information at your fingertips.  It's yours for a donation of
any amount -- please use the enclosed reply card to order your copy

<p>

I had intended this letter to deal solely with education issues,
but drug abuse and educational failure feed off one another.
There is no way to dismiss the disturbing statistics: in the
war against teenage drug abuse, America is in full retreat. A
new federal survey shows that teen drug use has risen 105 percent
since 1992.  The sharp increases span every form of illegal drug.
Use of LSD and other hallucinogens is up 183 percent; cocaine
use, 166 percent (from 1994 to 1995 alone); marijuana, 105 percent.
One of every 10 teenagers has used an illegal drug in the past
month.

<p>

The tragedy here is that these numbers come after a decade of
progress.  By 1992, teen drug use had been driven to its lowest
point in decades.  The reason for that progress was and is easy
to understand. Our nation's policy was direct -- and repeated over
and over again in every forum where young people gather.  It said:
&quot;Drug abuse is wrong, dangerous, and stupid.&quot;  But
then, following a change in the Oval Office, we changed course.

<p>

The flow of anti-drug messages from our nation's capital dried
up.  The Clinton administration cut the office of National Drug
Control Policy some 83 percent.  MTV, and even the networks, began
to produce material that winked at the drug threat, or openly
declared the war on drugs a failure. Leaders in Congress turned
their attention to other issues. Treatment funds were reduced,
and &quot;civil libertarians&quot; ratcheted up their pressure
on highly effective social agencies like Teen Challenge that use
faith-based messages to help teenagers and young adults kick the
habit.

<p>

Let me say something here about the liberal versus conservative
debate about the treatment versus law enforcement approaches to
drug abuse.  In fact, let me say one word about it -- it is a 
<I>fallacy.</I> Both approaches are needed.  Drug abusers need treatment
if they are to re-enter society as productive citizens.  But the
truth is that even the best treatment programs are only partially
successful. Preventing the abuser from taking that first hit,
snort, or injection is crucial.

<p>

Who would propose that we eliminate hospital emergency rooms
to treat automobile accident victims?  No one, of course.  Then
again, who would argue that we eliminate speed limits, safety
belts, guard rails, and the like because, after all, we have emergency
rooms? But that's precisely what advocates of drug legalization
argue! Remember when then-Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders suggested
that problems like crime would be reduced if America legalized
drug use, saying it was time to study this option and rely on
treatment rather than law enforcement?

<p>

Elders, thankfully, is gone, but the legacy of permissiveness
she represented is reflected in what is happening now to our youth.
Last month, my senior adviser for drug issues, retired Army Lieutenant
Colonel Bob Maginnis, met with General Barry McCaffrey, President
Clinton's drug czar.  Gen. McCaffrey is a dedicated man, but he
has his work cut out for him.  FRC offered the general our heartfelt
support and suggested various ways to recapture the initiative.
New efforts to control the flow of drugs through Mexico and out
of Colombia are especially needed.

<p>

Again, we must not settle for illusion.  Attempting to treat
an ever-rising wave of drug-abusing youth will destroy our economy
and bankrupt this nation -- and, worst of all, waste the potential
of thousands of our children. Attempting to reform education
without putting parents back at the center of school decision-making
is doomed to fail as well. As always, on both of these issues,
FRC will continue to fight for the home truths that really matter:
we will work with legislators, government officials -- anyone of
goodwill, regardless of party -- who recognizes the need to strengthen
our education system and to gird our children against the sex-and-drug
culture.

<p>

We would really like to hear from you this month.  Your financial
gifts to FRC provide the lifeblood that enables us to advance
the pro-family cause.  Your prayers and involvement are essential,
too.  The cards and letters we receive provide a tremendous lift
to me and the entire FRC staff.  Because the work we do is both
draining and difficult, being able to associate names and faces
with the cause we are advancing makes our efforts all the more
meaningful.

<p>

Once again, thank you for your faithfulness.  As we continue
to work together, we can move closer to our hope and dream of
family renewal in our beloved nation.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. As our <I>Survival Guide</I> illustrates, FRC is constantly
developing new materials that make the case for family values.
Let me close by mentioning another resource that you've helped
to make a household word: <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams.</I> This
companion book to the family values debate of 1996 has now reached
a total distribution of nearly 400,000 copies.

<p>

I conceived <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> as a vision for a pro-family
future -- a book that would make the case for our cause to a cross-section
of the American public. Earlier this year, FRC took out paid
advertising posing a challenge to Hillary Rodham Clinton, who
had just released her book, <I>It Takes a Village.</I> We asked
the American people to choose between the alternative visions
represented by these books.  I'm pleased to report that, thanks
to support like yours, <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> has held its
own in this contest of visions.

<p>

Our original goal was to distribute 1,000,000 copies of <I>Our
Hopes, Our Dreams,</I> and to get them into the hands of people
who may not know just how much today's cultural clash over the
family means to them. If you can help us make one last push to
reach this goal and to spread the pro-family message, please take
this opportunity to do so. The enclosed card has all the information
you need.

</center><p>

Early in 1995, Miss Marshall joined the Family Research Council's 
public policy team to contribute her research skills and experience 
in the field of welfare. Her responsibilities as policy analyst 
include tracking, analyzing, and writing about proposed legislation 
on welfare reform. In addition, her analysis and research benefit 
FRC in educating key decision makers in the U.S. Congress and at the 
grass roots nation-wide.

<p>

Through her studies at Rice University, in various internships 
throughout her undergraduate experience, and most recently, at the 
American Enterprise Institute with Charles Murray, Marshall has 
developed a keen understanding of compassionate welfare reform and 
school choice as well as a familiarity with the U.S. Congress and 
the formulation of public policy. 

<p>

Miss Marshall began her career in Washington as an intern in the 
Office of Congressman Tom DeLay in the summer months of 1990 and 
1991. In 1992, she served an extended internship in the White 
House Office of Political Affairs during the critical months of 
the campaign. She moved on to work in the Office of the Deputy 
Convention Manager at the 1992 Republican National Convention, with 
particular responsibility for caucus teams. Since then, she has worked 
in the Houston office of George Bush and, in 1993, in the office of 
the Deputy Executive Director at the National Republican Senatorial 
Committee.

<p>

Through the years, she has volunteered time for local Republican 
party activities and campaigns, both local and Presidential. Her 
campaign experience includes a stint as opposition research 
coordinator for a Congressional candidate in Houston. 

<p>

Native of Texas, Marshall graduated <I>Summa Cum Laude</I> from Rice 
University in 1994 with majors in Policy Studies and English. She is 
a member of Phi Beta Kappa and Rice Fellow.

<A HREF="/townhall/FRC/insight/is95c2dr.html">Legalization of Drugs: 
The Myths and The Facts</a>: an article by Robert L. Maginnis

<p>

After a distinguished career in the U.S. military, Lieutenant 
Colonel Robert (Bob) L. Maginnis, USA Ret., joined the Family 
Research Council in 1994 to handle one of the most difficult 
social problems facing American society and American families 
today -- the crisis of crime.  In addition, Colonel Maginnis' 
skills as an analyst, writer, speaker and team leader will be 
applied to family issues impacted by military/foreign affairs 
policy and cultural issues. Already nationally known as an expert 
on the Pentagon and a spokesman on military issues, Colonel 
Maginnis brings to FRC a broad perspective on today's toughest 
issues.

<p>

In his many roles, Colonel Maginnis has appeared on ABC, NBC and 
CBS evening news shows, CBS "This Morning," "The MacNeil/Lehrer 
Newshour," CNBC "Cal Thomas," CNN's "Crossfire" and "Larry King 
Live" as well as other programs, such as "Donohue," and on numerous 
networks.  He has been quoted many times in newspapers across the 
country from the <I>New York Times</I> to the <I>LA Times</I>.  
His editorial pieces have been published in the <I>Washington 
Times, Orange County Register, Chicago Tribune, The Miami Herald</I> 
and elsewhere. And the colonel has been featured on most major radio 
shows nationwide.

<p>

In July 1993, Colonel Maginnis retired from an assignment in 
the Pentagon where he served as an Inspector General.  He is 
an airborne-ranger infantry officer with an assignment history 
that includes Korea, Germany, Alaska, and several posts in the 
continental United States.  He served in command and staff 
positions in four infantry divisions from platoon to division 
level.  The colonel was the chief for the U.S. Army Infantry 
School's leadership training branch.  He developed curricula, 
taught, participated in leader development research and consulted 
with leaders and soldiers throughout the Army. He is the author of 
more than fifty articles published in professional military 
journals concerning ethics, leadership, and personnel matters 
impacting the military.

<p>

In the last eight months of his military service, Colonel Maginnis 
was a member of the Army's study group examining the homosexual 
ban.  He also was advisor to the Defense Department Military 
Working Group on homosexuals in the military.  In that role, he 
debated the issue in the media as well as speaking in various forums 
-- including testifying before a House subcommittee. Because of his 
expertise, Colonel Maginnis is also, on occasion, a spokesman for 
the Defense Readiness Council, a non-profit organization that led 
the fight to keep the homosexual ban.

<p>

Colonel Maginnis' service in the armed forces was commended with 
the Legion of Merit, the highest peacetime decoration, as well as 
with five meritorious medals and four commendations. Among his over 
fifty letters of commendation is one from former President Jimmy 
Carter who honored the colonel for inventing a laser training 
device, at great savings to the armed forces.

<p>

Colonel Maginnis received his B.S. from the United States Military 
Academy, West Point, New York in 1973 and a M.S. from the Naval 
Postgraduate School, Monterey, California, in 1983.  He is also 
a graduate of many military schools, including the Command and 
General Staff College.

<p>

Long active in his community and in many organizations, the colonel 
now coordinates his church's participation in homeless shelters. 
He, his wife and two children live in Northern Virginia.

Each month, <a href="/townhall/FRC/whois/bauer.html">Gary L. 
Bauer</a>, President of the Family Research Council, writes a letter 
to the friends of FRC that highlights a current topic, analyzes a key 
family issue, or describes an ongoing or new activity of the Council. 
These personal letters both describe the FRC President's perspective 
on the most pressing family issues and chronicle the development of 
FRC projects and programs to address those issues. These letters give 
friends of FRC an inside, in-depth look at the Council's work.

<h2>The September Budget Battle: Truth and Consequence </h2><p>
<h3>Pete du Pont</h3>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
When the Congress returns from its recess after Labor Day, the battle 
of the budget will begin in earnest.   <p>
 
While the Congress has adopted a budget resolution providing for a 
balanced budget by 2002, now it must pass legislation implementing 
that budget.  Assuming the appropriations bills follow the resolution, 
and thus reduce spending, what will President Clinton do with them?  
The budget resolution Congress adopted was not subject to a 
Presidential veto, but the appropriations bills are another matter.  
President Clinton could shred the Republican budget by vetoing 
appropriations bills that include more spending cuts than he wants.   <p>
 
But the President is in a box.  The truth is his initial economic 
policy, enacted in 1993 by a single vote in each House, has failed 
badly.  One of the consequences was the election of a Republican 
Congress.  And the consequence of that is very little room for the 
President to maneuver.  <p>
 
In the 1992 campaign, President Clinton promised to balance the 
federal budget in 5 years.  His first budget proposed to reduce the 
deficit primarily through one of the largest tax increases in U.S. 
history.  Spending cuts in his budget were largely offset by spending 
increases elsewhere. <p>
 
So how has this liberal fiscal policy fared? <p>
 
In 1993, before the Clinton plan was enacted, the budget deficit was 
around $250 billion.  Under the latest budget projections, excluding 
proposed Republican changes, the deficit is projected to rise to $300 
billion per year by 2000. <p>
 
The economic rationale for the Clinton budget plan was that cutting 
the deficit would reduce borrowing pressures, and consequently reduce 
interest rates.  Lower rates would in turn stimulate investment and 
economic growth.  But by the end of April of this year, the prime rate 
charged by banks was 50% higher than in 1993 when the Clinton plan was 
adopted.  Other interest rates from new home mortgages to AAA 
corporate bonds and Treasury bills and bonds were all substantially 
higher as well. <p>
 
Meanwhile, the dollar has collapsed against foreign currencies.  From 
January, 1993 to June of this year, the dollar is down one-third 
against the Japanese yen, almost one-fourth against the Swiss franc, 
and one-eighth against the German mark.  As a result, all Americans 
are poorer because their dollar incomes now buy less of the world's 
goods and services.  This is in sharp contrast to the strong dollar 
policy of the Reagan administration, which led the dollar to soar to 
record levels, making all Americans richer. <p>
 
Real incomes and wages have continued to fall under Clinton's economic 
policies, a trend which started with the tax and regulation increases 
of the Bush Administration. <p>
 
Finally, economic growth has been sluggish.  With the Clinton tax 
increases, the recovery from the recession of 1990-1991 has been the 
weakest post-recession period on record.  Job growth has been half and 
real GDP growth  only about two-thirds the rate of prior recoveries.  
Indeed, in the last full quarter, the economy barely grew at all. <p>
 
Surely the President does not want to return to this sort of fiscal 
policy.  In any event, he cannot, for the Republican Congress will not 
raise taxes.  So the best the administration can do is veto a few 
appropriations bills and hope to keep government as large as he can 
for as long as he can. <p>
 
But remember that the Constitution dealt all the budget cards to the 
Congress.  If the Congress reduces funding for a department, the 
President cannot restore the spending simply by vetoing the 
legislation.  A veto ends all funding for all of the activities of  
the department, until the President signs a Congressionally approved 
bill. <p>
 
Remember, too, that at the end of the current fiscal year on September 
30, the government cannot operate if Congress has not authorized 
spending for the new fiscal year.  Congress can consequently turn off 
the government -- or parts of it -- if the President does not accept 
the Congressional budget.  In the fall, Congress will also have to 
approve an increase in the debt ceiling for deficit borrowing to 
continue, so it holds all the cards here as well. <p>
 
So the Congress leads from strength.  The only real risk is that the 
Republicans will compromise with themselves and hand the President a 
victory he otherwise could not have won. <p>
 
If the Republicans continue to reduce regulation and taxes, 
encouraging both job and real wage growth, and stay on the glide path 
to a balanced budget in seven years, the President will have little 
choice but to sign the appropriations bills and say it was all his 
idea in the first place.<p>

<h2>RNC TALKING POINTS:<br>
TOP TEN REASONS TO BALANCE THE BUDGET </h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br> 
As conferees from both Houses of Congress meet to reconcile 
differences between the recently passed House and Senate budget 
resolutions, it is important to remember why we must balance the budget 
and what a balanced budget will mean to all of us. We've heard the 
arguments from Bill Clinton and the Democratic leadership in Congress 
about why we can't balance the budget by 2002 and why we can't reduce 
spending. Given the doom and gloom rhetoric coming from their corner, 
many Americans may be wondering why we would want to balance 
the budget at all. Here are ten good reasons: <p>
A balanced budget will reduce the burden of debt on our children. The 
national debt is now $4.8 trillion. A child born today will pay $187,000 
in taxes over his or her lifetime -- just to pay the interest on that debt. 
That's more than $3,500 in taxes every year of their working lives to 
pay for our debt. And if we do nothing, that debt will balloon to nearly $8 
trillion in 15 years (source: Joint Economic Committee of Congress). <p>
A balanced budget will enable us to return to the American people more 
of their hard-earned tax dollars. Federal taxes as a share of median family 
income have steadily increased from 5% in 1950 to almost 25% today. In 
fact, if the average family today paid the same percentage of their income 
in taxes as their parents did, they would have roughly $10,000 more to 
spend at the end of the year. As we balance the budget, we can reduce the 
tax burden on families (sources: Heritage Foundation and Cato Institute). <p> 
A balanced budget will bring down interest rates. Deficit spending raises 
interest rates as government borrows more. A balanced federal budget 
will result in a drop in interest rates of approximately two percentage 
points or more. This will mean a savings of $37,440 on a $75,000, 30-
year home mortgage. It will mean a savings of $900 on a $15,000 car 
loan. Everything you borrow money for will cost less (source: Joint 
Economic Committee of Congress). <p> 
A balanced budget will increase economic growth. Time magazine 
reports (see attached article) that Roger Brinner, chief economist with the 
forecasting firm of DRI/McGraw-Hill, estimates balancing the budget 
would raise America's yearly output an extra 2.5% over the next 10 years. 
That would mean an average of an extra $1,000 a year for each American 
family. <p>
A balanced budget will create more jobs. Economic growth means more 
jobs, and a balanced budget is estimated to result in 6.1 million more jobs 
over the next ten years (source: Joint Economic Committee of Congress). <p>
A balanced budget will increase our standard of living. The nonpartisan 
Concord Coalition concludes that without deficit spending and debt, the 
average family income today would be $50,000 instead of $35,000.  
When asked what a balanced budget will mean for most Americans, Alan 
Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, told Congress: "I think 
their real incomes and purchasing power of their real incomes would 
significantly improve ... they would look forward to their children doing 
better than they." <p>
A balanced budget will strengthen the American dollar. Clinton's deficits 
have been driving the U.S. dollar to record lows, and the most dramatic 
drop was right after he and the Democrats in Congress defeated the 
balanced budget amendment. The devaluation of our currency ultimately 
leads to a lower standard of living. But the passage of Republican 
bills in Congress to balance the budget has caused the dollar to bounce 
back. As The Washington Post reported 5/19/95, "The U.S. dollar has 
rebounded in foreign exchange markets during the past several weeks, in 
part because of a growing belief among foreign investors that the United 
States is moving to put its economic house in order." <p> 
A balanced budget will ensure that our retirement programs are safe. 
Medicare and Social Security are programs that seniors have paid into all 
their lives, and we must be able to meet our commitments to them. 
Younger people paying into these programs now must also be assured 
that the funds will be there for them when they retire. The only way to 
preserve and protect these programs is to balance the federal budget 
once and for all, so we will always have the necessary resources 
available. As Bob Myers, long-time Chief Actuary of the Social Security 
Administration has said: "If we continue to run federal deficits year after 
year, and if interest payments continue to rise at an alarming rate, we 
will face two dangerous possibilities. Either we will raid the trust funds to 
pay for our current profligacy, or we will print money, dishonestly 
inflating our way out of indebtedness. Both cases would devastate the 
real value of the social security trust funds." <p> 
A balanced budget will allow us to spend money on programs we need, 
rather than interest on the debt. If we do nothing, entitlements and interest 
on the debt will consume all tax revenues in just 17 years. Balancing the 
budget will ensure the federal government has the money it needs to 
defend our country, fund education, build roads and perform other 
necessary and important functions of government (source: Entitlement 
Commission). <p> 
A balanced budget will restore the American Dream. Rising interest rates, 
higher taxes, and stagnant wages are robbing us of the American Dream. 
Since the early 1970s when government spending began to balloon, 
Americans' incomes have stayed flat. In 1993, the first year of 
Clintonomics, median family income declined by $709 (source: U.S. 
Census Bureau). If we balance the federal budget, interest rates 
will drop, taxes can be lowered, and wages will increase. In short, we will 
restore the American Dream for millions of hard-working American 
families.  <p>

<title>Phil Gramm Speech</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<h2>Speech by Phil Gramm</h2><p>
<h3><i>January 1st, 2001</i></h3>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Any candidate running for President ought to be able to tell you what 
they want America to look like after their programs are in effect.  It is 
particularly fitting that one of the final days of the first term of the 
next president will be January the 1st, 2001 -- the beginning of the new 
millennium.  If you choose me to be your next President, here's the 
America I will work with you to create on that day.<p>
<center><h3>BALANCED BUDGET</center></h3><p>
On January the 1st, 2001, your life will be better and your future will be 
brighter because the federal budget will be balanced.  For the first time in 
over thirty years, the government in Washington will be forced to operate 
in the black and pay its bills.  The  50 cents out of every dollar we save 
that today is siphoned off to pay for government deficit spending will be 
available to build new homes, new farms and new factories; to create new 
jobs, new growth and new opportunity.<p>
Americans will be surprised at the benefits they get when government is 
again forced to live within its means.  In the five years since 1950 when 
the federal government actually balanced the budget, prime interest rates 
averaged 3.5% and mortgage rates averaged 4%.<p>
Owning your own home will again be part of the American dream, and 
today's workers will become tomorrow's small business owners, as 
Americans will again quit their jobs and strike out on their own to start 
their own businesses.<p>
<center><h3>TAXES</center></h3><p>
On January 1, 2001, the federal government will be spending just 18 
cents out of every dollar earned in America, down from 22 cents today.  
What does that mean to you and your family?  It means $3,900 per family 
that will be spent by you rather than by Washington.  Our flat tax will be 
fully in place by January 1, 2001, and you will be able to fill out your tax 
return on a post card.  <p>
By January 1st, 2001, excessive regulations that now add as much as 33% 
to the cost of building jet engines and nearly double the price of new 
vaccines will have been lifted.<p>
By January 1st, 2001, no family farm or small business in America will 
have to be sold to pay inheritance taxes.  When you build up your 
business or farm your family will have it for keeps. <p>
<center><h3>ECONOMY</center></h3><p>
On January 1st, 2001, private investment will be at an all-time high.  
More jobs will be created and your family will earn more and keep more 
of what you earn.  With the creative genius of America once more 
unleashed, no spot on the planet will be safe from our commercial 
onslaught. <p>
By January 1st, 2001, French farmers, Japanese semi-conductor 
manufacturers, and German auto makers will be lobbying their 
governments to erect protectionist walls against American goods. And as 
President I will knock down those barriers.  <p>
<center><h3>GOVERNMENT</center></h3><p>
On January 1st, 2001, I see an America where our government will be 
doing less, but what it does it will be doing better.  Medicare will be an 
efficient health care delivery system and our seniors will know that the 
government has honored its contract with them.  Medical costs will be 
under control because we will have the right to choose the health care 
plan that best fits our needs, a plan that is competitive and efficient.  
Social Security benefits will be guaranteed and young people will be able 
to invest more in their own private retirement plans and medical savings
accounts.<p>
<center><h3>WELFARE</center></h3><p>
By January the 1st, 2001, able-bodied men and women now riding in the 
welfare wagon will have had to get out of the wagon and help the rest of 
us pull.  We will have stopped giving more and more money to 
encourage people to have more and more children on welfare.  And the 
illegitimacy rate will be falling as fast in the year 2001 as it is rising 
today.  Those who can and should help themselves will be doing it again.  
And they will be learning to love it.  And those who truly need help will 
get it in programs tailored by their own states and run in their own 
communities in partnership with their churches and charitable 
organizations.<p>
<center><h3>CRIME</center></h3><p>
It always makes me mad when I go to my mother's house and see the bars 
she has on her windows.  On January 1st, 2001, those bars will be down.  
My mother will be able to walk around her neighborhood on the darkest 
night and not be afraid, and the people she's afraid of today will have bars 
on their windows.<p>
By January 1st, 2001, your family will be safer because we will be 
grabbing violent criminals by the throat, and the 7% of criminals who 
today commit 70% of the violent crimes will be in jail where they belong.  
We won't be building federal prisons like Holiday Inns anymore.  The 
weight rooms will be gone, so will the color televisions and the air 
conditioning.  Our federal prisons will be mini-industrial parks, where 
prisoners work 10 hours a day, 6 days a week.  Prisoners will be working 
during the day to pay for the cost of their incarceration and going to 
school at night. When criminals have served their full sentences they will 
leave prison with the skills they learned working, they will be able to read 
and write and they will be drug-free.  And they won't be eager to go back 
to prison.<p>
By January 1st, 2001, the sound of children playing and people chatting, 
neighbors talking to neighbors, will replace the sound of gunfire and 
sirens in America's cities.  The law will require ten years in prison 
without parole for possessing a firearm during the commission of a 
violent crime or a drug felony, twenty years for discharging it, and when 
a brutal, predatory criminal kills one of our neighbors, he will be put to 
death.  <p>
By January of 2001, we will have begun taking down the metal detectors 
in our schools, and drug dealers will know that if they sell drugs to our 
children, they are going to go to jail for ten years without parole, no 
matter who their daddy is or how society has done them wrong.
<center><h3>EDUCATION</center></h3><p>
America will not have an education President on January 1st, 2001; we 
will have something a lot better.  You will be an education parent again.  
By January 1st, 2001, there will be no federal Department of Education.  
Half of the $32 billion it now spends every year will be back in the hands 
of families in the form of an education tax credit, so that you can invest 
your own money in your own children's education. The other half will go 
back to local school districts so local parents, local teachers, and locally 
elected school board members can again set education policy. There will 
be no federal Goals 2000 -- I will repeal Goals 2000.  Education policy 
will be set by you in your home and in your schools.  <p>
With you in charge of your child's schools, the schools of America will 
for the first time in 50 years be on their way to leading the world in math 
and science, in reading and reasoning.  They will once more teach our 
heritage and our history.  Our children will graduate ready to lead 
America and the world in the high-tech, global economy.  <p>
<center><h3>VALUES</center></h3><p>
By January, 2001, America's forty year experiment with Washington 
imposing values on our people will be a bad but fading memory.  Having 
opposed Bill Clinton's efforts to impose his values on America, I will 
never try to impose my values on you.  There's only one person 
who'sever lived who I would trust to impose values on America.  And 
when He comes back, He won't need government to impose His values.  
In the meantime, we will entrust the formation of values to the American 
family.  The values of our families, refined through each family's own 
faith, will permeate up from our homes, through our neighborhoods and 
our communities to form our nation's values. <p>
And America will be a more virtuous America. When we put families 
first in America again we will love ourselves, our neighbors and our 
country better for it.  Our children will have voluntary prayer in the 
schools again, and every American will have the guaranteed right of 
religious expression.  And putting families first means respecting the 
sanctity of human life.  By January 1st, 2001 the federal government will 
have stopped funding abortion and groups that advocate it.  Federal 
judges will be appointed who will faithfully interpret the Constitution, not 
make it up as they go along.<p>
<center><h3>QUOTAS</center></h3><p>
In taking the oath of office, I will place my hand on the Bible and swear 
allegiance to a Constitution that enshrines equal justice under law.  When 
my hand comes off that Bible, I will pick up a pen and by Executive 
Order end quotas and set-asides in the Executive branch of American 
government.  I will veto any bill that requires quotas or set-asides.  I will 
fight for equal and unlimited opportunity for all but there will be special 
privilege for none. <p>
With our best effort, by January, 2001, Martin Luther King's dream that 
men and women in America will be judged not by the color of their skin 
but by the content of their character will have come true.  And with a 
strong economy, strong families and pervasive opportunity, we will 
rediscover in America what ordinary people with more opportunity and 
more freedom than any people who have ever lived can accomplish in 
this extraordinary land of ours.<p>
<center><h3>DEFENSE</center></h3><p>
By January of 2001, we will have rebuilt our national defenses and will 
recruit and retain the finest young men and women who have ever worn 
the uniform of this country.  We will provide them with the best training 
and the finest weapons that Americans can build.  We will guarantee that
even in a world where the lion and the lamb are lying down together, 
America will always be the lion.  On January 1st, 2001 nowhere in the 
world will Americans be in combat under U.N. command.  <p>
<center><h3>ELECTION</center></h3><p>
The election for President in 1996 is not just a contest between candidates 
and political parties, it is a choice between two very different visions for 
America's future.  Bill Clinton believes that a brighter future will be won 
with more government.  I believe it will be won with more freedom.<p>
In Bill Clinton's America on January 1, 2001, our federal government 
looks pretty much the way it's looked for the last 40 years-- except it is 
bigger, more expensive, and more powerful.  But we reject that America.  
The test results are in:  big government had 40 years to do the job and it 
failed.<p>
If we are bold enough in defining our vision of an American future 
dominated by freedom and family, Bill Clinton will be remembered as 
the last President of a liberal era when big government arrogantly thought 
it knew best.  Bill Clinton is yesterday's president wedded to yesterday's 
government.  I will be tomorrow's President.  I will lead America back to 
the future to reaffirm, as our founders did, the revolutionary idea that 
ordinary people with freedom and opportunity can decide their own 
destiny and the destiny of the world.<p>
<center><h3>NORMAN ROCKWELL</center></h3><p>
As we ask our people to look up from the crisis of the present and to 
share our vision of what America can be, some will say that our vision 
looks a lot like a Norman Rockwell painting.  And I won't deny it.  But 
should we accept anything less?  After all, Norman Rockwell's paintings 
presented America as we wanted it to be and as we knew it could be.  
And I see Norman Rockwell paintings in the making everywhere in the 
history of our families and in the history of our country.<p>
I can see a Norman Rockwell painting of my wife's family.  Her 
grandfather came to America as an indentured laborer to work in the 
sugar cane fields in Hawaii.  He had no money.  He spoke not one word 
of English.  He didn't know anybody in America.  He came with a dream, 
with a devout faith, and with willing hands.  Twenty-five years later, his 
son, my wife's father, got on a freighter leaving Hawaii to come to the 
mainland with $25 he'd won in an essay contest and the dream of going 
to college.  He came home to Hawaii as an engineer and became the first 
Asian American ever to be an officer of a sugar company in the history of 
Hawaii.  And under President Reagan and President Bush, his daughter, 
my wife, served as the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission, where she oversaw the trading of all commodities and 
commodity futures, including the same cane sugar that her grandfather 
came to America to harvest.  I'm not sure that even Norman Rockwell 
could have captured that story in a painting.  But the only thing 
extraordinary about that story is that there is nothing extraordinary about 
that story.  It's a story of an ordinary family in an extraordinary country. <p>
Neither of my parents graduated from high school, but my mother had a 
dream before I was born that I was going to college.  I resisted.  I failed 
the third, seventh, and ninth grades, but it didn't make any difference to 
my mother. My mother prodded me every step of the way through 
collegeto a Ph.D. in economics because in the America we grew up in, 
mother's dreams did not die easily.  Too many mothers' dreams are dying 
too easily in America today.  And I want our America back.<p>
We have a right to dream great dreams because we're Americans.  If 
American history proves anything, it proves that with leadership and 
courage what we can dream we can do.  <p>
Our founders dreamed they could start the world over again and they did 
it in America.  With God's help we can make our dream, The American 
Dream, a reality.  Now and forever.<p>

<b>Comments:</b><P>

<ul>
"Conservatives often get too caught up in the many proble
ith the was affirmative action is currently implemented, and forget the reason it's there at all.
It is not enough to just get rid of race-based preferences, we must create opportunities for minorities and all of society through pro-growth tax policies.
<br>A negative message of "anti-affirmative" action will get the Republican party
nowhere unless it is backed up with a positive message of hope and opportunities
created."<br><b>Charles, Washington DC</b><P>

"Racial tensions are very real and
the rights of minorities do need to be protected.  Perhaps the affirmative action programs of the past three decades have been helpful in at least weakening
 barriers that existed, especially in the better-paying professions.  We now
e a generation of senior managers, many of whom really believe that they have an
 obligation to ensure that women and minorities are given opportunities for advancement.  <br>Though these programs may have been necessary to help overcome the
barriers of tradition and expectation, they have had incidious effects as we have seen  minorities of mediocre talent promoted to levels of high responsibility.  These unmerited promotions are damaging to the esteem of our institutions
and are as debilitating to those of little merit who are promoted as they are those of great merit who are passed over.  We need to move as quickly as possile
to a color- and sex-blind system of merit.
<br><b>Judy, Vienna, VA</b>

<P>
I believe neither the Republicans nor the Democrats
are serious about ensuring fairness in hiring practices (note the Democrat-controlled Congress's long-standing
policy of exempting themselves from all the affirmative
action laws they have passed over the last 25 years as
well as the Republicans missing the opportunities they
have had over the years to demonstrate any understanding
of racial inequity).<br>
I will hold both parties responsible for the lack of pro-
gress this year and with any increase in racial tensions
or inequity in treatment of all people of any race. <br><b>John, South Charleston</b><P>
 
"I coach the Debate Team at Transylvania University, a member
 of the National Educational Debate Association, and our resolution this semester deals with Affirmative Action. From the massive amount of research my team
has done it is very clear
that Affirmative Action is a joke.  It promotes a very small group of minorities,
 while failing to address the real needs of the very people it is suppossed
help.<br>
It is typical of governmental attempts at solving problems.  It simply does not
work."<br><b>James, Lexington, KY</b><P>


"I hope the March accomplishes its stated goal of helping men
return to their families as better individuals and citizens. <br>I hope that all men who heard about the march take this as a wake up call to them. Too many people in this country are waiting for someone else to fix their problems. I wish that politicians from both parties would realize that they are simply tearing this country further apart by their constant pettiness. Instead of trying to shift the blame from one party to another, they should understand that they are a group.
That is why congress was composed. <BR>
Whether they are Republican or Democrat or Independent, they should be responsible. In a crime, there is an idea of accomplice. In politics, there is no such idea, only men trying to appear to be perfect.
Sorryy to be so winded, I am really getting sick of hearing both sides blame each
er. It makes it difficult to believe anybody.<br><b>Mark, Scottsdale, AZ</b><P> 


Affirmative Action has never affirmed anyone's worth in
 society.  The proof is that achievement of any sort by any of the eligible classes holds no validity, even in their own eyes.  The presence of the possibility that decisions are made based on such superficial standards promotes envy, malice and distrust.<Br>
The MMM, and their threat of lawsuit about the count released by the park service only illustrates the difference between races.  A difference that all the social programs in the world cannot hide.  Although blacks and hispanics now openly
exercise their right to speak about segregation (and territorial control),
only a limited license is granted to whites, and those who try to practice segregation have the fate of Randy Weaver to consider.<br><b>Patty, Chantilly, VA</b><p>

Affirmative action programs were good when they started.
<BR>
Martin Luther King woke americans up to prejudice and the
need for real equality in america. The congress then passed
laws and they were almost immediately grafted and corrupted
The Bumper sticker which says " Crime wouldn't pay if the
Government ran it" is true. We need government to set 
guidelines and make laws, but it is people who must learn
to do right and be just.<BR>
 For Black people to support Farakan
is to turn their backs on the principles that Martin Luther
King fought for. We white Americans need to do the right
thing because it is right not because some muslim demands it.
Islam is in direct opposition to what this country stands for.
Liberals scream separation of church and state and then
rush to support a cult that will divide us and tear down the
advancements we have made. I say we should look to the
real Black leaders, such as Dexter Scott King, and seek to
encourage them and stand firm with Martin Luther Kings'
principle of a truely integrated america.<br><b>Michael, West Palm Beach, FL</b><P>

<title>Budget Reform</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
Washington Watch<br>
Volume 6, Number 10<br>
September 23, 1995<br>

<h2><center>KEEPING BUDGET REFORM ON TRACK</h2></center><br>

	White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta and Senior Counselor George Stephanopoulos know the drill well. They are using today the same tactics they employed in 1990 when they successfully maneuvered President George Bush into breaking his "no new taxes" pledge. Today, they decry "a train wreck" they say will occur if Congress makes spending cuts stick. <p>
	First, some background. The U.S. Government will begin the 1996 Fiscal Year October 1.  Congress has spent the last nine months paring down Clinton budget requests, eliminating billions in future wasteful spending, and pushing for a balanced budget by 2002.<p>
	House Republicans earlier this year passed a FY 1996 budget resolution that calls for a balanced budget by FY 2002.  They tried to cut federal taxes by $354 billion over the same seven-year period, but Senate liberals limited tax relief to  $245 billion. Clinton and his  congressional supporters vigorously denounced both the proposed tax cuts and the 2002 balanced budget target. <p>
	
<h3><center>Media's False Picture</h3></center><br>
	Journalists describe the major difference between Congress and the president as a dispute over whether to balance the budget in a seven-year or ten-year period.  However, the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) analysis of Clinton's  proposed budget found a $209 billion shortfall in the year 2005 -- the very year that he claims to achieve a balanced budget.  His ten-year proposal also produces $2 trillion in new federal debt.  <p>
	Liberal critics of the GOP budget plan attack the tax cuts, claiming that they favor the rich or that they will gouge Medicare.  They claim the tax cuts will "explode the deficit,."  But more than half (55 percent) of the House-passed tax relief  is dedicated to the $500-per-child tax credit.  And approximately three-quarters of this tax credit is slated to go to families with incomes less than $75,000;  nearly five million families at the lowest levels will be freed from federal income taxes. Senate GOP leaders have strongly suggested that the final composition of the tax package will be very "family friendly."<p>
	Conservatives see savings in the cuts in discretionary spending programs and welfare reform.  They also note that Medicare spending is projected to increase at twice the rate of inflation even as reforms are instituted to restrain the rate of growth.  The argument that tax cuts "explode the deficit" is answered by pointing out that tax revenues actually increased by more than the rate of inflation during the 1980s.  If spending increases had been held to the rate of inflation, we'd have a budget surplus today. <p>
	Not a penny can be spent unless both houses of Congress approve. This gives the GOP tremendous leverage to set conditions on the use of taxpayers' money. Funding battles are also battles over abortion, federal subsidies for pornographic art, the gay agenda and liberal legal activism. Congress has an obligation to use its "power of the purse" to protect the legitimate interests of the American family.<p>
	
<h3><center>A Contest of Wills <br></h3></center>
	Who will blink first, Bill Clinton or Congress?  Both sides may try to get through October by passing "continuing resolutions. But, by early November, the Treasury's authority to borrow will expire.  Congress can then apply conditions to legislation to raise the debt ceiling.  If the budget dispute is not resolved by then, a real clash is possible. But essential services like mail delivery, air traffic control and Social Security will continue during this dispute. Doubtless there will be a great hue and cry from the liberal interest groups who see their funds disappearing.<p>       
	A government shutdown poses great risks for liberal interest groups.  What happens if a few weeks or months go by and the public doesn't miss the "services?"  That would provide a very powerful argument for reducing spending even further. Our national debt and much of our cultural decline have been the products of several decades of reckless government spending. If it takes a  liberal "train wreck" to get our country back on track, that may be a small price to pay. <p>

<h2>Phil Gramm Speech to the Senate</h2><p>			
<h3>104th Congress 1st Session</h3>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this week and next week, we are going to come
down to the moment of truth on two issues. One issue has to do with putting
the Federal Government on a budget like everybody else. The other issue has
to do with fulfilling the Contract With America to let working people keep
more of what they earn. I would like to briefly address both of these subjects.<p>
In the 1994 election, in one of the most remarkable political occurrences
in the postwar period, House Republicans did something that is very unusual
in the political process and that is they set out in plain English what they
promised America they would do if the American people gave them a majority
in the House of Representatives for the first time in 40 years.<p>
I would add that while many people have forgotten it, Republican
candidates for the Senate put out a joint statement where virtually every
Republican challenger for the U.S. Senate in the country came to Washington
and released a ''Seven More In '94'' document, where we outlined seven
things we would do if the American people gave us a majority.<p>
   Two of those promised items had to do with balancing the budget and with
letting working people keep more of what they earned. The House of
Representatives has done something even more remarkable than making all these
promises-they have actually done it. The House of Representatives has adopted
the Contract With America. They have adopted 90 percent of the things they
promised to simply vote on. And at the best universities in the land, you
would grade that as an ''A.''<p>
   We are now down to the moment of truth in the U.S. Senate and that moment
of truth basically has to do with whether or not we are going to pass the
Contract With America and whether we can make the tough decisions necessary
in order to do that. To balance the Federal budget over a 7-year period and
at the same time to accommodate the tax cut contained in the Contract With
America will require us, over a 7-year period, to limit the growth in
Federal spending to approximately 3 percent a year.<p>
   Over the last 40 years, Federal spending has grown at 2-1/2 times the
growth of family budgets in America. Over the last 40 years, the Federal
Government has increased its spending 2-1/2 times as fast as the average
family in America has been able to increase its spending. Now what would
America look like if those trends had been reversed? Well, if the average
family in America had seen its budget grow as fast as the Government has
grown for the last 40 years, and the Government's budget had grown only as
fast as the family budget has grown over the last 40 years, the average
family in America today would be earning $ 128,000 a year and the Government
would be approximately one-third its current size.<p>
   I ask my colleagues, if you could choose between the America where the
governments budget grew faster or an America where the family's budget grew
faster-put me down as one who would favor having the average family in
America make $ 128,000 a year and have the Federal Government one-third its
size.<p>
   Here is our dilemma. We have some of our colleagues who say, ''I did not
sign any Contract With America. That was the House of Representatives.'' As
I am fond of saying in our private meetings, that is a subtlety that is lost
on the American people. They do not see this contract as having been a
contract between just the House and the American people. They see it as a
Republican contract. And, quite frankly, it is a Republican contract. It
embodies everything that our party claims to stand for.<p>
   But what I think is important for the Senate is not just that Republican
candidates signed the contract, not just that every House Republican
incumbent who signed the contract was reelected but I think what is
significant to us is that the American people signed that contract when they
gave us a majority in both Houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years.<p>
   The question that we are going to have to answer in the next 3 weeks is,
are we willing to limit the growth of Government spending to 2-1/2 percent a
year so that we can, over a 7-year period, balance the Federal budget and so
that we can let working families keep more of what they earn? I believe that
we can and I believe that we should. I think there are many Republicans in
the Senate who sort of have a problem, in that they have one foot firmly
implanted in the dramatic changes in Government policy that we promised the
American people in 1994, and they have the other foot firmly implanted in the
status quo. And, as those two things have moved further apart, we have had
the predictable result.<p>
   I think it is time for us to choose. I believe in the next 3 weeks we are
going to basically decide whether or not we meant it in November of 1994
when we told the American people that we were going to dramatically change
the way Government does its business. I think the American people are
convinced that we can limit the growth of Government spending to 2-1/2
percent a year so that we can let families and businesses spend more of what
they earn.<p>
   I know if the President were here, he would say this is a debate about
how much money we are spending on our children; or how much money we are
spending on education; or how much money we are spending on housing or
nutrition.<p>
   But that is not what the debate is about. Everybody in America wants to
spend money on children, housing, education, and nutrition. The debate we
are about to have is not how much money is going to be spent on those
things, but who is going to do the spending. Bill Clinton and the Democrats
want Government to go on doing the spending. They want Government spending
to continue to grow 2-1/2 times as fast as the family budget grows.<p>
   I want to put the Federal Government on a diet. I want to slow down the
rate of growth in Government spending so that we can let working families
keep more of their own money to invest in their own children, in their own
businesses, and in their own future.<p>
   This is not a debate about how much money we spend on the things that all
Americans believe we should spend money on. It is a debate about who ought
to do the spending. Bill Clinton and the Democrats want the Government to do
the spending. We want the family to do the spending. We know the Government,
and we know the family. And we know the difference.<p>
   Since we are investing in the future of America, I want to invest the
future of America in our families and not in our Government.<p>
   I know that there is a lot of anguish in the Senate, even on our side of
the aisle. But I think it is time to choose. I wanted my colleagues to know
that I am for a budget that does two things: No. 1, over a 7-year period,
limit the growth of Federal spending to about 3 percent a year so we can
balance the budget in 7 years and let our colleagues do something that no
current Member of the Senate, save two, has ever done before; that is, vote
for a real honest-to-God balanced budget. We literally have the power, by
having a 7-year binding budget, to let Members of the Senate vote to stop
talking about balancing the budget and to start doing it.<p>
   Second, in addition to the controls on spending necessary to balance the
budget, I want to limit the growth of spending not to 3 percent a year, but
to 2-1/2 percent a year so that we can let families keep more of what they
earn, so that we can cut the capital gains tax rate, so that we can
eliminate the marriage penalty, so that we can let families have a $ 500 tax
credit per child, so that, rather than having our Government spend our money
for us, we can let working people spend their own money on their own
children and on their own future.<p>
   As we look at this in perspective, let me give you three numbers. In
1950, the average family in America with two little children sent $ 1 out of
every $ 50 it earned to Washington, DC, and thought it was too much. And it
probably was. Today, that family is sending $ 1 out of every $ 4 it earns to
Washington, DC, and if the Congress did not meet again for the next 20 years
some people would applaud that prospect, but only because they do not
understand our problems. If Congress did not meet again for the next 20 years
and we did not start a single new program nor repeal any existing program, to
pay for the Government that we have already committed to is going to require
that in 20 years $ 1 out of every $ 3 earned by the average family in America
with two children come to Washington, DC, to pay for the Government.<p>
   We are going to have to institute dramatic changes in spending simply to
keep things the way they are. If we are to let working families keep more of
what they earn, we are going to have to institute a dramatic change in
Government policy. Mr. President, I am in favor of a dramatic change in
Government policy. If our Budget Committee does not offer and adopt a budget
that balances the budget and that provides for tax cuts for families and for
job creation, I intend to offer a substitute for that budget. I think we
have to stop cutting deals with America's future. I think we have to stand
up and tell the American people we meant it in November 1994 when we said
you give us a Republican majority in both Houses of Congress and we will
change the policy of American Government.<p>
I think we are now down to a moment of truth. Are we going to fulfill the
commitment we made in that election, or are we basically going to defend the
status quo? The status quo means less opportunity, future jobs, and an
America that is not the America that I want my children and my grandchildren
to have. I am ready to change the status quo. I am ready to cut the growth
in Government spending, not just to balance the budget, but to cut taxes.
And what I want my colleagues to know today is I want to work with the
Budget Committee, I want to work with our leadership. I am hopeful that we
can put together as a party position a budget that balances the budget over
a 7-year period and that mandates tax cuts contained in the contract. But,
if our leadership is not ready to bring that budget forward, if they cannot
muster the courage to control Government spending to make it possible, I
will muster that courage, and will offer a substitute and give my colleagues
the opportunity to join me, and to join America in that process.<p>
   Finally, let me say, Mr. President, I simply want to remind my colleagues
that the Contract With America was in fact signed by House Members, but
there are two additional points. First, it was not distinctly different from
the ''Seven More in '94'' contract that our candidates agreed to here on the
north front of the Capitol. Second, the important part of that contract is
not the fact that the House signed it. The important part of that contract
is that America signed it. The important part of that contract is it was the
document that defined what the 1994 election was all about.<p>
   The question now, the question that will be before us for the next 3
weeks is, Did we simply want to be for dramatic changes in Government at
election time, or are we willing to put our votes where our mouth is? Are we
really more wedded to funding for programs such as public television, or are
we more wedded to letting working people keep more of what they earn? Do we
really believe that Government knows best and that we need not only a $ 1.6
trillion Federal budget but that we need it to grow by 7.5 percent a year
while the family budget is growing at less than half that rate?<p>
   I think that is the decision. I think the answer of every Republican in
the Senate ought to be clear. And that answer ought to be we can change the
status quo, we can limit the growth of Government spending, we can terminate
programs, and we can and will not only balance the budget but let working
families keep more of what they earn to invest in their own children, in
their own businesses and their own future, and that we ought to cut taxes on
American business to provide incentives for people to work, save, and
invest. That is what I am for. I believe that is what America is for.<p>
   I thank the Chair.<p>
I yield the floor.<p>

<H2>President Reagan's First Inaugural Address</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Tuesday, January 20th, 1981. <HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Senator Hatfield, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. President, Vice President
Bush, Vice President Mondale, Senator Baker, Speaker O'Neill,
Reverend Moomaw, and my fellow citizens: To a few of us here today,
this is a solemn and most momentous occasion; and yet, in the
history of our Nation, it is a commonplace occurrence. The orderly
transfer of authority as called for in the Constitution routinely
takes place as it has for almost two centuries and few of us stop
to think how unique we really are. In the eyes of many in the
world, this every-4-year ceremony we accept as normal is nothing
less than a miracle.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Mr. President, I want our fellow citizens to know how much you
did to carry on this tradition. By your gracious cooperation in
the transition process, you have shown a watching world that we
are a united people pledged to maintaining a political system
which guarantees individual liberty to a greater degree than any
other, and I thank you and your people for all your help in maintaining
the continuity which is the bulwark of our Republic.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The business of our nation goes forward. These United States are
confronted with an economic affliction of great proportions. We
suffer from the longest and one of the worst sustained inflations
in our national history. It distorts our economic decisions, penalizes
thrift, and crushes the struggling young and the fixed-income
elderly alike. It threatens to shatter the lives of millions of
our people.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Idle industries have cast workers into unemployment, causing human
misery and personal indignity. Those who do work are denied a
fair return for their labor by a tax system which penalizes successful
achievement and keeps us from maintaining full productivity.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
But great as our tax burden is, it has not kept pace with public
spending. For decades, we have piled deficit upon deficit, mortgaging
our future and our children's future for the temporary convenience
of the present. To continue this long trend is to guarantee tremendous
social, cultural, political, and economic upheavals.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You and I, as individuals, can, by borrowing, live beyond our
means, but for only a limited period of time. Why, then, should
we think that collectively, as a nation, we are not bound by that
same limitation?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We must act today in order to preserve tomorrow. And let there
be no misunderstanding--we are going to begin to act, beginning
today.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The economic ills we suffer have come upon us over several decades.
They will not go away in days, weeks, or months, but they will
go away. They will go away because we, as Americans, have the
capacity now, as we have had in the past, to do whatever needs
to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our
problem.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
From time to time, we have been tempted to believe that society
has become too complex to be managed by self-rule, that government
by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the
people. But if no one among us is capable of governing himself,
then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else? All
of us together, in and out of government, must bear the burden.
The solutions we seek must be equitable, with no one group singled
out to pay a higher price.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We hear much of special interest groups. Our concern must be for
a special interest group that has been too long neglected. It
knows no sectional boundaries or ethnic and racial divisions,
and it crosses political party lines. It is made up of men and
women who raise our food, patrol our streets, man our mines and
our factories, teach our children, keep our homes, and heal us
when we are sick--professionals, industrialists, shopkeepers,
clerks, cabbies, and truckdrivers. They are, in short, &quot;We
the people,&quot; this breed called Americans.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, this administration's objective will be a healthy, vigorous,
growing economy that provides equal opportunity for all Americans,
with no barriers born of bigotry or discrimination. Putting America
back to work means putting all Americans back to work. Ending
inflation means freeing all Americans from the terror of runaway
living costs. All must share in the productive work of this &quot;new
beginning&quot; and all must share in the bounty of a revived
economy. With the idealism and fair play which are the core of
our system and our strength, we can have a strong and prosperous
America at peace with itself and the world.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, as we begin, let us take inventory. We are a nation that has
a government--not the other way around. And this makes us special
among the nations of the Earth. Our Government has no power except
that granted it by the people. It is time to check and reverse
the growth of government which shows signs of having grown beyond
the consent of the governed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is my intention to curb the size and influence of the Federal
establishment and to demand recognition of the distinction between
the powers granted to the Federal Government and those reserved
to the States or to the people. All of us need to be reminded
that the Federal Government did not create the States; the States
created the Federal Government.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now, so there will be no misunderstanding, it is not my intention
to do away with government. It is, rather, to make it work--work
with us, not over us; to stand by our side, not ride on our back.
Government can and must provide opportunity, not smother it; foster
productivity, not stifle it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If we look to the answer as to why, for so many years, we achieved
so much, prospered as no other people on Earth, it was because
here, in this land, we unleashed the energy and individual genius
of man to a greater extent than has ever been done before. Freedom
and the dignity of the individual have been more available and
assured here than in any other place on Earth. The price for this
freedom at times has been high, but we have never been unwilling
to pay that price.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is no coincidence that our present troubles parallel and are
proportionate to the intervention and intrusion in our lives that
result from unnecessary and excessive growth of government. It
is time for us to realize that we are too great a nation to limit
ourselves to small dreams. We are not, as some would have us believe,
doomed to an inevitable decline. I do not believe in a fate that
will fall on us no matter what we do. I do believe in a fate that
will fall on us if we do nothing. So, with all the creative energy
at our command, let us begin an era of national renewal. Let us
renew our determination, our courage, and our strength. And let
us renew our faith and our hope.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We have every right to dream heroic dreams. Those who say that
we are in a time when there are no heroes just don't know where
to look. You can see heroes every day going in and out of factory
gates. Others, a handful in number, produce enough food to feed
all of us and then the world beyond. You meet heroes across a
counter--and they are on both sides of that counter. There are
entrepreneurs with faith in themselves and faith in an idea who
create new jobs, new wealth and opportunity. They are individuals
and families whose taxes support the Government and whose voluntary
gifts support church, charity, culture, art, and education. Their
patriotism is quiet but deep. Their values sustain our national
life.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have used the words &quot;they&quot; and &quot;their&quot; in
speaking of these heroes. I could say &quot;you&quot; and &quot;your&quot;
because I am addressing the heroes of whom I speak--you, the citizens
of this blessed land. Your dreams, your hopes, your goals are
going to be the dreams, the hopes, and the goals of this administration,
so help me God.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We shall reflect the compassion that is so much a part of your
makeup. How can we love our country and not love our countrymen,
and loving them, reach out a hand when they fall, heal them when
they are sick, and provide opportunities to make them self-sufficient
so they will be equal in fact and not just in theory?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Can we solve the problems confronting us? Well, the answer is
an unequivocal and emphatic &quot;yes.&quot; To paraphrase Winston
Churchill, I did not take the oath I have just taken with the
intention of presiding over the dissolution of the world's strongest
economy.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the days ahead I will propose removing the roadblocks that
have slowed our economy and reduced productivity. Steps will be
taken aimed at restoring the balance between the various levels
of government. Progress may be slow--measured in inches and feet,
not miles--but we will progress. Is it time to reawaken this industrial
giant, to get government back within its means, and to lighten
our punitive tax burden. And these will be our first priorities,
and on these principles, there will be no compromise.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
On the eve of our struggle for independence a man who might have
been one of the greatest among the Founding Fathers, Dr. Joseph
Warren, President of the Massachusetts Congress, said to his fellow
Americans, &quot;Our country is in danger, but not to be despaired
of.... On you depend the fortunes of America. You are to decide
the important questions upon which rests the happiness and the
liberty of millions yet unborn. Act worthy of yourselves.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, I believe we, the Americans of today, are ready to act worthy
of ourselves, ready to do what must be done to ensure happiness
and liberty for ourselves, our children and our children's children.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And as we renew ourselves here in our own land, we will be seen
as having greater strength throughout the world. We will again
be the exemplar of freedom and a beacon of hope for those who
do not now have freedom.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To those neighbors and allies who share our freedom, we will strengthen
our historic ties and assure them of our support and firm commitment.
We will match loyalty with loyalty. We will strive for mutually
beneficial relations. We will not use our friendship to impose
on their sovereignty, for our own sovereignty is not for sale.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
As for the enemies of freedom, those who are potential adversaries,
they will be reminded that peace is the highest aspiration of
the American people. We will negotiate for it, sacrifice for it;
we will not surrender for it--now or ever.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Our forbearance should never be misunderstood. Our reluctance
for conflict should not be misjudged as a failure of will. When
action is required to preserve our national security, we will
act. We will maintain sufficient strength to prevail if need be,
knowing that if we do so we have the best chance of never having
to use that strength.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Above all, we must realize that no arsenal, or no weapon in the
arsenals of the world, is so formidable as the will and moral
courage of free men and women. It is a weapon our adversaries
in today's world do not have. It is a weapon that we as Americans
do have. Let that be understood by those who practice terrorism
and prey upon their neighbors.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I am told that tens of thousands of prayer meetings are being
held on this day, and for that I am deeply grateful. We are a
nation under God, and I believe God intended for us to be free.
It would be fitting and good, I think, if on each Inauguration
Day in future years it should be declared a day of prayer.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is the first time in history that this ceremony has been
held, as you have been told, on this West Front of the Capitol.
Standing here, one faces a magnificent vista, opening up on this
city's special beauty and history. At the end of this open mall
are those shrines to the giants on whose shoulders we stand.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Directly in front of me, the monument to a monumental man: George
Washington, Father of our country. A man of humility who came
to greatness reluctantly. He led America out of revolutionary
victory into infant nationhood. Off to one side, the stately memorial
to Thomas Jefferson. The Declaration of Independence flames with
his eloquence.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And then beyond the Reflecting Pool the dignified columns of the
Lincoln Memorial. Whoever would understand in his heart the meaning
of America will find it in the life of Abraham Lincoln.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Beyond those monuments to heroism is the Potomac River, and on
the far shore the sloping hills of Arlington National Cemetery
with its row on row of simple white markers bearing crosses or
Stars of David. They add up to only a tiny fraction of the price
that has been paid for our freedom.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Each one of those markers is a monument to the kinds of hero I
spoke of earlier. Their lives ended in places called Belleau Wood,
The Argonne, Omaha Beach, Salerno and halfway around the world
on Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Pork Chop Hill, the Chosin Reservoir,
and in a hundred rice paddies and jungles of a place called Vietnam.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Under one such marker lies a young man--Martin Treptow--who left
his job in a small town barber shop in 1917 to go to France with
the famed Rainbow Division. There, on the western front, he was
killed trying to carry a message between battalions under heavy
artillery fire.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We are told that on his body was found a diary. On the flyleaf
under the heading, &quot;My Pledge,&quot; he had written these
words: &quot;America must win this war. Therefore, I will work,
I will save, I will sacrifice, I will endure, I will fight cheerfully
and do my utmost, as if the issue of the whole struggle depended
on me alone.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The crisis we are facing today does not require of us the kind
of sacrifice that Martin Treptow and so many thousands of others
were called upon to make. It does require, however, our best effort,
and our willingness to believe in ourselves and to believe in
our capacity to perform great deeds; to believe that together,
with God's help, we can and will resolve the problems which now
confront us.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And, after all, why shouldn't we believe that? We are Americans.
God bless you, and thank you.

<H2>President Reagan's Second Inaugural Address</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Monday, January 21st, 1985 <HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Senator Mathias, Chief Justice Burger, Vice President Bush, Speaker
O'Neill, Senator Dole, Reverend Clergy, members of my family and
friends, and my fellow citizens:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This day has been made brighter with the presence here of one
who, for a time, has been absent--Senator John Stennis.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
God bless you and welcome back.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is, however, one who is not with us today: Representative
Gillis Long of Louisiana left us last night. I wonder if we could
all join in a moment of silent prayer. (Moment of silent prayer.)
Amen.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are no words adequate to express my thanks for the great
honor that you have bestowed on me. I will do my utmost to be
deserving of your trust.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is, as Senator Mathias told us, the 50th time that we the
people have celebrated this historic occasion. When the first
President, George Washington, placed his hand upon the Bible,
he stood less than a single day's journey by horseback from raw,
untamed wilderness. There were 4 million Americans in a union
of 13 States. Today we are 60 times as many in a union of 50 States.
We have lighted the world with our inventions, gone to the aid
of mankind wherever in the world there was a cry for help, journeyed
to the Moon and safely returned. So much has changed. And yet
we stand together as we did two centuries ago.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
When I took this oath four years ago, I did so in a time of economic
stress. Voices were raised saying we had to look to our past for
the greatness and glory. But we, the present-day Americans, are
not given to looking backward. In this blessed land, there is
always a better tomorrow.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Four years ago, I spoke to you of a new beginning and we have
accomplished that. But in another sense, our new beginning is
a continuation of that beginning created two centuries ago when,
for the first time in history, government, the people said, was
not our master, it is our servant; its only power that which we
the people allow it to have.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
That system has never failed us, but, for a time, we failed the
system. We asked things of government that government was not
equipped to give. We yielded authority to the National Government
that properly belonged to States or to local governments or to
the people themselves. We allowed taxes and inflation to rob us
of our earnings and savings and watched the great industrial machine
that had made us the most productive people on Earth slow down
and the number of unemployed increase.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
By 1980, we knew it was time to renew our faith, to strive with
all our strength toward the ultimate in individual freedom consistent
with an orderly society.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We believed then and now there are no limits to growth and human
progress when men and women are free to follow their dreams.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And we were right to believe that. Tax rates have been reduced,
inflation cut dramatically, and more people are employed than
ever before in our history.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We are creating a nation once again vibrant, robust, and alive.
But there are many mountains yet to climb. We will not rest until
every American enjoys the fullness of freedom, dignity, and opportunity
as our birthright. It is our birthright as citizens of this great
Republic, and we'll meet this challenge.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
These will be years when Americans have restored their confidence
and tradition of progress; when our values of faith, family, work,
and neighborhood were restated for a modern age; when our economy
was finally freed from government's grip; when we made sincere
efforts at meaningful arms reduction, rebuilding our defenses,
our economy, and developing new technologies, and helped preserve
peace in a troubled world; when Americans courageously supported
the struggle for liberty, self-government, and free enterprise
throughout the world, and turned the tide of history away from
totalitarian darkness and into the warm sunlight of human freedom.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
My fellow citizens, our Nation is poised for greatness. We must
do what we know is right and do it with all our might. Let history
say of us, &quot;These were golden years--when the American Revolution
was reborn, when freedom gained new life, when America reached
for her best.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Our two-party system has served us well over the years, but never
better than in those times of great challenge when we came together
not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans united in a
common cause.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Two of our Founding Fathers, a Boston lawyer named Adams and a
Virginia planter named Jefferson, members of that remarkable group
who met in Independence Hall and dared to think they could start
the world over again, left us an important lesson. They had become
political rivals in the Presidential election of 1800. Then years
later, when both were retired, and age had softened their anger,
they began to speak to each other again through letters. A bond
was reestablished between those two who had helped create this
government of ours.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In 1826, the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence,
they both died. They died on the same day, within a few hours
of each other, and that day was the Fourth of July.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In one of those letters exchanged in the sunset of their lives,
Jefferson wrote: &quot;It carries me back to the times when, beset
with difficulties and dangers, we were fellow laborers in the
same cause, struggling for what is most valuable to man, his right
to self-government. Laboring always at the same oar, with some
wave ever ahead threatening to overwhelm us, and yet passing harmless
... we rode through the storm with heart and hand.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, with heart and hand, let us stand as one today: One people
under God determined that our future shall be worthy of our past.
As we do, we must not repeat the well-intentioned errors of our
past. We must never again abuse the trust of working men and women,
by sending their earnings on a futile chase after the spiraling
demands of a bloated Federal Establishment. You elected us in
1980 to end this prescription for disaster, and I don't believe
you reelected us in 1984 to reverse course.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
At the heart of our efforts is one idea vindicated by 25 straight
months of economic growth: Freedom and incentives unleash the
drive and entrepreneurial genius that are the core of human progress.
We have begun to increase the rewards for work, savings, and investment;
reduce the increase in the cost and size of government and its
interference in people's lives.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We must simplify our tax system, make it more fair, and bring
the rates down for all who work and earn. We must think anew and
move with a new boldness, so every American who seeks work can
find work; so the least among us shall have an equal chance to
achieve the greatest things--to be heroes who heal our sick, feed
the hungry, protect peace among nations, and leave this world
a better place.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The time has come for a new American emancipation--a great national
drive to tear down economic barriers and liberate the spirit of
enterprise in the most distressed areas of our country. My friends,
together we can do this, and do it we must, so help me God.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
From new freedom will spring new opportunities for growth, a more
productive, fulfilled and united people, and a stronger America--an
America that will lead the technological revolution, and also
open its mind and heart and soul to the treasures of literature,
music, and poetry, and the values of faith, courage, and love.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A dynamic economy, with more citizens working and paying taxes,
will be our strongest tool to bring down budget deficits. But
an almost unbroken 50 years of deficit spending has finally brought
us to a time of reckoning. We have come to a turning point, a
moment for hard decisions. I have asked the Cabinet and my staff
a question, and now I put the same question to all of you: If
not us, who? And if not now, when? It must be done by all of us
going forward with a program aimed at reaching a balanced budget.
We can then begin reducing the national debt.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I will shortly submit a budget to the Congress aimed at freezing
government program spending for the next year. Beyond that, we
must take further steps to permanently control Government's power
to tax and spend. We must act now to protect future generations
from Government's desire to spend its citizens' money and tax
them into servitude when the bills come due. Let us make it unconstitutional
for the Federal Government to spend more than the Federal Government
takes in.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We have already started returning to the people and to State and
local governments responsibilities better handled by them. Now,
there is a place for the Federal Government in matters of social
compassion. But our fundamental goals must be to reduce dependency
and upgrade the dignity of those who are infirm or disadvantaged.
And here a growing economy and support from family and community
offer our best chance for a society where compassion is a way
of life, where the old and infirm are cared for, the young and,
yes, the unborn protected, and the unfortunate looked after and
made self-sufficient.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And there is another area where the Federal Government can play
a part. As an older American, I remember a time when people of
different race, creed, or ethnic origin in our land found hatred
and prejudice installed in social custom and, yes, in law. There
is no story more heartening in our history than the progress that
we have made toward the &quot;brotherhood of man&quot; that God
intended for us. Let us resolve there will be no turning back
or hesitation on the road to an America rich in dignity and abundant
with opportunity for all our citizens.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Let us resolve that we the people will build an American opportunity
society in which all of us--white and black, rich and poor, young
and old--will go forward together arm in arm. Again, let us remember
that though our heritage is one of blood lines from every corner
of the Earth, we are all Americans pledged to carry on this last,
best hope of man on Earth.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have spoken of our domestic goals and the limitations which
we should put on our National Government. Now let me turn to a
task which is the primary responsibility of National Government--the
safety and security of our people.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Today, we utter no prayer more fervently than the ancient prayer
for peace on Earth. Yet history has shown that peace will not
come, nor will our freedom be preserved, by good will alone. There
are those in the world who scorn our vision of human dignity and
freedom. One nation, the Soviet Union, has conducted the greatest
military buildup in the history of man, building arsenals of awesome
offensive weapons.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We have made progress in restoring our defense capability. But
much remains to be done. There must be no wavering by us, nor
any doubts by others, that America will meet her responsibilities
to remain free, secure, and at peace.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is only one way safely and legitimately to reduce the cost
of national security, and that is to reduce the need for it. And
this we are trying to do in negotiations with the Soviet Union.
We are not just discussing limits on a further increase of nuclear
weapons. We seek, instead, to reduce their number. We seek the
total elimination one day of nuclear weapons from the face of
the Earth.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now, for decades, we and the Soviets have lived under the threat
of mutual assured destruction; if either resorted to the use of
nuclear weapons, the other could retaliate and destroy the one
who had started it. Is there either logic or morality in believing
that if one side threatens to kill tens of millions of our people,
our only recourse is to threaten killing tens of millions of theirs?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have approved a research program to find, if we can, a security
shield that would destroy nuclear missiles before they reach their
target. It wouldn't kill people, it would destroy weapons. It
wouldn't militarize space, it would help demilitarize the arsenals
of Earth. It would render nuclear weapons obsolete. We will meet
with the Soviets, hoping that we can agree on a way to rid the
world of the threat of nuclear destruction.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We strive for peace and security, heartened by the changes all
around us. Since the turn of the century, the number of democracies
in the world has grown fourfold. Human freedom is on the march,
and nowhere more so than our own hemisphere. Freedom is one of
the deepest and noblest aspirations of the human spirit. People,
worldwide, hunger for the right of self-determination, for those
inalienable rights that make for human dignity and progress.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
America must remain freedom's staunchest friend, for freedom is
our best ally.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And it is the world's only hope, to conquer poverty and preserve
peace. Every blow we inflict against poverty will be a blow against
its dark allies of oppression and war. Every victory for human
freedom will be a victory for world peace.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
So we go forward today, a nation still mighty in its youth and
powerful in its purpose. With our alliances strengthened, with
our economy leading the world to a new age of economic expansion,
we look forward to a world rich in possibilities. And all this
because we have worked and acted together, not as members of political
parties, but as Americans.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
My friends, we live in a world that is lit by lightning. So much
is changing and will change, but so much endures, and transcends
time.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
History is a ribbon, always unfurling; history is a journey. And
as we continue our journey, we think of those who traveled before
us. We stand together again at the steps of this symbol of our
democracy--or we would have been standing at the steps if it hadn't
gotten so cold. Now we are standing inside this symbol of our
democracy. Now we hear again the echoes of our past: a general
falls to his knees in the hard snow of Valley Forge; a lonely
President paces the darkened halls, and ponders his struggle to
preserve the Union; the men of the Alamo call out encouragement
to each other; a settler pushes west and sings a song, and the
song echoes out forever and fills the unknowing air.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is the American sound. It is hopeful, big-hearted, idealistic,
daring, decent, and fair. That's our heritage; that is our song.
We sing it still. For all our problems, our differences, we are
together as of old, as we raise our voices to the God who is the
Author of this most tender music. And may He continue to hold
us close as we fill the world with our sound--sound in unity,
affection, and love--one people under God, dedicated to the dream
of freedom that He has placed in the human heart, called upon
now to pass that dream on to a waiting and hopeful world.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
God bless you and may God bless America.

<TITLE>The Reagan Home Page:President Reagan's Speech at Omaha Beach
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/townhall/background.jpg">

<H2>Address at the U.S.-French Ceremony at Omaha Beach on the
40th Anniversary of D-Day.</H2>
<HR>

<P>
President Ronald Reagan, June 6, 1984. Normandy, France. <HR>

<P>
We stand today at a place of battle, one that 40 years ago saw
and felt the worst of war. Men bled and died here for a few feet
of - or inches of sand, as bullets and shellfire cut through their
ranks. About them, General Omar Bradley later said, &quot;Every
man who set foot on Omaha Beach that day was a hero.&quot;
<P>
Some who survived the battle of June 6, 1944, are here today.
Others who hoped to return never did.
<P>
&quot;Someday, Lis, I'll go back,&quot; said Private First Class
Peter Robert Zannata, of the 37th Engineer Combat Battalion, and
first assault wave to hit Omaha Beach. &quot;I'll go back, and
I'll see it all again. I'll see the beach, the barricades, and
the graves.&quot;
<P>
Those words of Private Zanatta come to us from his daughter, Lisa
Zanatta Henn, in a heart-rending story about the event her father
spoke of so often. &quot;In his words, the Normandy invasion would
change his life forever,&quot; she said. She tells some of his
stories of World War II but says of her father, &quot;the story
to end all stories was D-Day.&quot;
<P>
&quot;He made me feel the fear of being on the boat waiting to
land. I can smell the ocean and feel the sea sickness. I can see
the looks on his fellow soldiers' faces-the fear, the anguish,
the uncertainty of what lay ahead. And when they landed, I can
feel the strength and courage of the men who took those first
steps through the tide to what must have surely looked like instant
death.&quot;
<P>
Private Zannata's daughter wrote to me, &quot;I don't know how
or why I can feel this emptiness, this fear, or this determination,
but I do. Maybe it's the bond I had with my father. All I know
is that it brings tears to my eyes to think about my father as
a 20-year old boy having to face that beach.&quot;
<P>
The anniversary of D-Day was always special to her family. And
like all the families of those who went to war, she describes
how she came to realize her own father's survival was a miracle:
&quot;So many men died. I know that my father watched many of
his friends be killed. I know that he must have died inside a
little each time. But his explanation to me was, `You did what
you had to do, and you kept on going.&quot;
<P>
When men like Private Zannata and all our Allied forces stormed
the beaches of Normandy 40 years ago they came not as conquerors,
but as liberators. When these troops swept across the French countryside
and into the forests of Belgium and Luxembourg they came not to
take, but to return what had been wrongfully seized. When our
forces marched into Germany they came not to prey on a brave and
defeated people, but to nurture the seeds of democracy among those
who yearned to bee free again.
<P>
We salute them today. But, Mr. President [Francois Mitterand of
France], we also salute those who, like yourself, were already
engaging the enemy inside your beloved country-the French Resistance.
Your valiant struggle for France did so much to cripple the enemy
and spur the advance of the armies of liberation. The French Forces
of the Interior will forever personify courage and national spirit.
They will be a timeless inspiration to all who are free and to
all who would be free.
<P>
Today, in their memory, and for all who fought here, we celebrate
the triumph of democracy. We reaffirm the unity of democratic
people who fought a war and then joined with the vanquished in
a firm resolve to keep the peace.
<P>
From a terrible war we learned that unity made us invincible;
now, in peace, that same unity makes us secure. We sought to bring
all freedom-loving nations together in a community dedicated to
the defense and preservation of our sacred values. Our alliance,
forged in the crucible of war, tempered and shaped by the realities
of the post-war world, has succeeded. In Europe, the threat has
been contained, the peace has been kept.
<P>
Today, the living here assembled-officials, veterans, citizens-are
a tribute to what was achieved here 40 years ago. This land is
secure. We are free. These things are worth fighting and dying
for.
<P>
Lisa Zannata Henn began her story by quoting her father, who promised
that he would return to Normandy. She ended with a promise to
her father, who died 8 years ago of cancer: &quot;I'm going there,
Dad, and I'll see the beaches and the barricades and the monuments.
I'll see the graves, and I'll put flowers there just like you
wanted to do. I'll never forget what you went through, Dad, nor
will I let any one else forget. And, Dad, I'll always be proud.&quot;
<P>
Through the words of his loving daughter, who is here with us
today, a D-Day veteran has shown us the meaning of this day far
better than any President can. It is enough to say about Private
Zannata and all the men of honor and courage who fought beside
him four decades ago: We will always remember. We will always
be proud. We will always be prepared, so we may always be free.
<P>
Thank you.

<HR>

<P>
President Reagan's Speech to the House of Commons, June 8, 1982.
<HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We're approaching the end of a bloody century plagued by a terrible
political invention -- totalitarianism. Optimism comes less easily
today, not because democracy is less vigorous, but because democracy's
enemies have refined their instruments of repression. Yet optimism
is in order because day by day democracy is proving itself to
be a not at all fragile flower. From Stettin on the Baltic to
Varna on the Black Sea, the regimes planted by totalitarianism
have had more than thirty years to establish their legitimacy.
But none -- not one regime -- has yet been able to risk free elections.
Regimes planted by bayonets do not take root.

The strength of the Solidarity movement in Poland demonstrates
the truth told in an underground joke in the Soviet Union. It
is that the Soviet Union would remain a one-party nation even
if an opposition party were permitted because everyone would join
the opposition party....

Historians looking back at our time will note the consistent restraint
and peaceful intentions of the West. They will note that it was
the democracies who refused to use the threat of their nuclear
monopoly in the forties and early fifties for territorial or imperial
gain. Had that nuclear monopoly been in the hands of the Communist
world, the map of Europe--indeed, the world--would look very different
today. And certainly they will note it was not the democracies
that invaded Afghanistan or suppressed Polish Solidarity or used
chemical and toxin warfare in Afghanistan and Southeast Asia.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If history teaches anything, it teaches self-delusion in the face
of unpleasant facts is folly. We see around us today the marks
of our terrible dilemma--predictions of doomsday, antinuclear
demonstrations, an arms race in which the West must, for its own
protection, be an unwilling participant. At the same time we see
totalitarian forces in the world who seek subversion and conflict
around the globe to further their barbarous assault on the human
spirit. What, then, is our course? Must civilization perish in
a hail of fiery atoms? Must freedom wither in a quiet, deadening
accommodation with totalitarian evil?

Sir Winston Churchill refused to accept the inevitability of war
or even that it was imminent. He said, &quot;I do not believe
that Soviet Russia desires war. What they desire is the fruits
of war and the indefinite expansion of their power and doctrines.
But what we have to consider here today while time remains is
the permanent prevention of war and the establishment of conditions
of freedom and democracy as rapidly as possible in all countries.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, this is precisely our mission today: to preserve freedom
as well as peace. It may not be easy to see; but I believe we
live now at a turning point.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In an ironic sense Karl Marx was right. We are witnessing today
a great revolutionary crisis, a crisis where the demands of the
economic order are conflicting directly with those of the political
order. But the crisis is happening not in the free, non-Marxist
West but in the home of Marxism- Leninism, the Soviet Union. It
is the Soviet Union that runs against the tide of history by denying
human freedom and human dignity to its citizens. It also is in
deep economic difficulty. The rate of growth in the national product
has been steadily declining since the fifties and is less than
half of what it was then.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The dimensions of this failure are astounding: a country which
employs one-fifth of its population in agriculture is unable to
feed its own people. Were it not for the private sector, the tiny
private sector tolerated in Soviet agriculture, the country might
be on the brink of famine. These private plots occupy a bare 3
percent of the arable land but account for nearly one-quarter
of Soviet farm output and nearly one-third of meat products and
vegetables. Overcentralized, with little or no incentives, year
after year the Soviet system pours its best resources into the
making of instruments of destruction. The constant shrinkage of
economic growth combined with the growth of military production
is putting a heavy strain on the Soviet people. What we see here
is a political structure that no longer corresponds to its economic
base, a society where productive forced are hampered by political
ones.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The decay of the Soviet experiment should come as no surprise
to us. Wherever the comparisons have been made between free and
closed societies -- West Germany and East Germany, Austria and
Czechoslovakia, Malaysia and Vietnam -- it is the democratic countries
that are prosperous and responsive to the needs of their people.
And one of the simple but overwhelming facts of our time is this:
of all the millions of refugees we've seen in the modern world,
their flight is always away from, not toward the Communist world.
Today on the NATO line, our military forces face east to prevent
a possible invasion. On the other side of the line, the Soviet
forces also face east to prevent their people from leaving.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The hard evidence of totalitarian rule has caused in mankind an
uprising of the intellect and will. Whether it is the growth of
the new schools of economics in America or England or the appearance
of the so-called new philosophers in France, there is one unifying
thread running through the intellectual work of these groups --
rejection of the arbitrary power of the state, the refusal to
subordinate the rights of the individual to the superstate, the
realization that collectivism stifles all the best human impulses....
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Chairman Brezhnev repeatedly has stressed that the competition
of ideas and systems must continue and that this is entirely consistent
with relaxation of tensions and peace.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, we ask only that these systems begin by living up to their
own constitutions, abiding by their own laws, and complying with
the international obligations they have undertaken. We ask only
for a process, a direction, a basic code of decency, not for an
instant transformation.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We cannot ignore the fact that even without our encouragement
there has been and will continue to be repeated explosion against
repression and dictatorships. The Soviet Union itself is not immune
to this reality. Any system is inherently unstable that has no
peaceful means to legitimize its leaders. In such cases, the very
repressiveness of the state ultimately drives people to resist
it, if necessary, by force.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
While we must be cautious about forcing the pace of change, we
must not hesitate to declare our ultimate objectives and to take
concrete actions to move toward them. We must be staunch in our
conviction that freedom is not the sole prerogative of a lucky
few but the inalienable and universal right of all human beings.
So states the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
which, among other things, guarantees free elections.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The objective I propose is quite simple to state: to foster the
infrastructure of democracy, the system of a free press, unions,
political parties, universities, which allows a people to choose
their own way to develop their own culture, to reconcile their
own differences through peaceful means.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is not cultural imperialism; it is providing the means for
genuine self-determination and protection for diversity. Democracy
already flourishes in countries with very different cultures and
historical experiences. It would be cultural condescension, or
worse, to say that any people prefer dictatorship to democracy.
Who would voluntarily choose not to have the right to vote, decide
to purchase government propaganda handouts instead of independent
newspapers, prefer government to worker-controlled unions, opt
for land to be owned by the state instead of those who till it,
want government repression of religious liberty, a single political
party instead of a free choice, a rigid cultural orthodoxy instead
of democratic tolerance and diversity.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Since 1917 the Soviet Union has given covert political training
and assistance to Marxist-Leninists in many countries. Of course,
it also has promoted the use of violence and subversion by these
same forces. Over the past several decades, West European and
other social democrats, Christian democrats, and leaders have
offered open assistance to fraternal, political, and social institutions
to bring about peaceful and democratic progress. Appropriately,
for a vigorous new democracy, the Federal Republic of Germany's
political foundations have become a major force in this effort.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We in America now intend to take additional steps, as many of
our allies have already done, toward realizing this same goal.
The chairmen and other leaders of the national Republican and
Democratic party organizations are initiating a study with the
bipartisan American Political Foundation to determine how the
United States can best contribute as a nation to the global campaign
for democracy now gathering force. They will have the cooperation
of congressional leaders of both parties, along with representatives
of business, labor, and other major institutions in our society.
I look forward to receiving their recommendations and to working
with these institutions and the Congress in the common task of
strengthening democracy throughout the world.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is time that we committed ourselves as a nation -- in both
the public and private sectors -- to assisting democratic development....
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
What I am describing now is a plan and a hope for the long term
-- the march of freedom and democracy which will leave Marxism-Leninism
on the ash heap of history as it has left other tyrannies which
stifle the freedom and muzzle the self-expression of the people.
And that's why we must continue our efforts to strengthen NATO
even as we move forward with our zero-option initiative in the
negotiations on intermediate-range forces and our proposal for
a one-third reduction in strategic ballistic missile warheads.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Our military strength is a prerequisite to peace, but let it be
clear we maintain this strength in the hope it will never be used,
for the ultimate determinant in the struggle that's now going
on in the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills
and ideas, a trial of spiritual resolve, the values we hold, the
beliefs we cherish, the ideals to which we are dedicated.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The British people know that, given strong leadership, time, and
a little bit of hope, the forces of good ultimately rally and
triumph over evil. Here among you is the cradle of self-government,
the Mother of Parliaments. Here is the enduring greatness of the
British contribution to mankind, the great civilized ideas: individual
liberty, representative government, and the rule of law under
God.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I've often wondered about the shyness of some of us in the West
about standing for these ideals that have done so much to ease
the plight of man and the hardships of our imperfect world. This
reluctance to use those vast resources at our command reminds
me of the elderly lady whose home was bombed in the blitz. As
the rescuers moved about, they found a bottle of brandy she'd
stored behind the staircase, which was all that was left standing.
And since she was barely conscious, one of the workers pulled
the cork to give her a taste of it. She came around immediately
and said, &quot;Here now -- there now, put it back. That's for
emergencies.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, the emergency is upon us. Let us be shy no longer. Let us
go to our strength. Let us offer hope. Let us tell the world that
a new age is not only possible but probable.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
During the dark days of the Second World War, when this island
was incandescent with courage, Winston Churchill exclaimed about
Britain's adversaries, &quot;What kind of people do they think
we are?&quot; Well, Britain's adversaries found out what extraordinary
people the British are. But all the democracies paid a terrible
price for allowing the dictators to underestimate us. We dare
not make that mistake again. So, let us ask ourselves, &quot;What
kind of people do we think we are?&quot; And let us answer, &quot;Free
people, worthy of freedom and determined not only to remain so
but to help others gain their freedom as well.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Sir Winston led his people to great victory in war and then lost
an election just as the fruits of victory were about to be enjoyed.
But he left office honorably and, as it turned out, temporarily,
knowing that the liberty of his people was more important than
the fate of any single leader. History recalls his greatness in
ways no dictator will ever know. And he left us a message of hope
for the future, as timely now as when he first uttered it, as
opposition leader in the Commons nearly twenty-seven years ago,
when he said, &quot;When we look back on all the perils through
which we have passed and at the mighty foes that we have laid
low and all the dark and deadly designs that we have frustrated,
why should we fear for our future? We have,&quot; he said, &quot;come
safely through the worst.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, the task I've set forth will long outlive our own generation.
But together, we too have come through the worst. Let us now begin
a major effort to secure the best -- a crusade for freedom that
will engage the faith and fortitude of the next generation. For
the sake of peace and justice, let us move toward a world in which
all people are at last free to determine their own destiny.

<H2>A Time for Choosing, aka The Speech</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I am going to talk of controversial things. I make no apology
for this.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It's time we asked ourselves if we still know the freedoms intended
for us by the Founding Fathers. James Madison said, &quot;We base
all our experiments on the capacity of mankind for self government.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This idea? that government was beholden to the people, that it
had no other source of power is still the newest, most unique
idea in all the long history of man's relation to man. This is
the issue of this election: Whether we believe in our capacity
for self-government or whether we abandon the American Revolution
and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far-distant
capital can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them
ourselves.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You and I are told we must choose between a left or right, but
I suggest there is no such thing as a left or right. There is
only an up or down. Up to man's age-old dream-the maximum of individual
freedom consistent with order or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism.
Regardless of their sincerity, their humanitarian motives, those
who would sacrifice freedom for security have embarked on this
downward path. Plutarch warned, &quot;The real destroyer of the
liberties of the people is he who spreads among them bounties,
donations and benefits.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Founding Fathers knew a government can't control the economy
without controlling people. And they knew when a government sets
out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its
purpose. So we have come to a time for choosing.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Public servants say, always with the best of intentions, &quot;What
greater service we could render if only we had a little more money
and a little more power.&quot; But the truth is that outside of
its legitimate function, government does nothing as well or as
economically as the private sector.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Yet any time you and I question the schemes of the do-gooders,
we're denounced as being opposed to their humanitarian goals.
It seems impossible to legitimately debate their solutions with
the assumption that all of us share the desire to help the less
fortunate. They tell us we're always &quot;against,&quot; never
&quot;for&quot; anything.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We are for a provision that destitution should not follow unemployment
by reason of old age, and to that end we have accepted Social
Security as a step toward meeting the problem. However, we are
against those entrusted with this program when they practice deception
regarding its fiscal shortcomings, when they charge that any criticism
of the program means that we want to end payments....
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We are for aiding our allies by sharing our material blessings
with nations which share our fundamental beliefs, but we are against
doling out money government to government, creating bureaucracy,
if not socialism, all over the world.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We need true tax reform that will at least make a start toward
I restoring for our children the American Dream that wealth is
denied to no one, that each individual has the right to fly as
high as his strength and ability will take him.... But we can
not have such reform while our tax policy is engineered by people
who view the tax as a means of achieving changes in our social
structure....
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Have we the courage and the will to face up to the immorality
and discrimination of the progressive tax, and demand a return
to traditional proportionate taxation? . . . Today in our country
the tax collector's share is 37 cents of -very dollar earned.
Freedom has never been so fragile, so close to slipping from our
grasp.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Are you willing to spend time studying the issues, making yourself
aware, and then conveying that information to family and friends?
Will you resist the temptation to get a government handout for
your community? Realize that the doctor's fight against socialized
medicine is your fight. We can't socialize the doctors without
socializing the patients. Recognize that government invasion of
public power is eventually an assault upon your own business.
If some among you fear taking a stand because you are afraid of
reprisals from customers, clients, or even government, recognize
that you are just feeding the crocodile hoping he'll eat you last.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If all of this seems like a great deal of trouble, think what's
at stake. We are faced with the most evil enemy mankind has known
in his long climb from the swamp to the stars. There can be no
security anywhere in the free world if there is no fiscal and
economic stability within the United States. Those who ask us
to trade our freedom for the soup kitchen of the welfare state
are architects of a policy of accommodation.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
They say the world has become too complex for simple answers.
They are wrong. There are no easy answers, but there are simple
answers. We must have the courage to do what we know is morally
right. Winston Churchill said that &quot;the destiny of man is
not measured by material computation. When great forces are on
the move in the world, we learn we are spirits-not animals.&quot;
And he said, &quot;There is something going on in time and space,
and beyond time and space, which, whether we like it or not, spells
duty.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You and I have a rendezvous with destiny. We will preserve for
our children this, the last best hope of man on earth, or we will
sentence them to take the first step into a thousand years of
darkness. If we fail, at least let our children and our children's
children say of us we justified our brief moment here. We did
all that could be done.

<TITLE>The Reagan Home Page:SDI 10th Anniversary Speech</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/townhall/background.jpg">
<H2>Statement on the Occasion of the Tenth Anniversary of the
Announcement of the Strategic Defense Initiative</H2>
<HR>

<P>
President Ronald Reagan, March 23rd, 1993. Washington, D.C. <HR>

<P>
Good morning. It's a pleasure to be able to speak to you today
on this tenth anniversary of my announcement of the Strategic
Defense Initiative. Above all I want to thank all of you for the
hard work and perseverance you have shown through the years in
supporting and shaping this very important program. It is as true
today as it was ten years ago that this effort holds the promise
of changing the course of human history, by freeing the world
from the ominous threat of ballistic missile attack. Given the
choice, shouldn't we seek to save lives rather than avenge them?
I think we should. And indeed, now we can.
<P>
Ten years ago when I asked the scientific community to give us
the means of defending against the threat of ballistic missiles,
I said there would be risks, and that results would take time.
Well, I'm proud to say that these scientists and engineers boldly
embraced this challenge, and in only a few short years broke new
technological ground in developing innovative systems capable
of providing effective and affordable defenses against missile
attacks anywhere in the world. It is a tremendous achievement,
worthy of the great scientific accomplishments of this century.
<P>
As you know, however, critics of SDI from the very beginning have
been all too eager to denounce the program (and if it weren't
for George Lucas, maybe we would have been off to a better start).
But over the years, these critics have been disproved time and
time again. Today we know that we can defend ourselves, that the
threats have not disappeared -- many new threats, in fact, are
rapidly emerging -- and that Russia and our European allies have
expressed their desire to cooperate with us in developing a global
system of missile defenses.
<P>
This should be good news. Unfortunately, there is a stubborn contingent
of policy-makers who insist on abiding by the obsolete ABM Treaty
and support only extremely limited missile defenses, or even none
at all. Yet I believe their efforts will not stop the progress
we have made and the progress we have yet to make. The wisdom
of the program we launched a decade ago will prevail, and America
will not remain forever defenseless against ballistic missile
attack.
<P>
Now more than ever it is vital that the United States not back
down from its efforts to develop and deploy strategic defenses.
It is technologically feasible, strategically necessary and morally
imperative. For if our nation and our precious freedoms are worth
defending with the threat of annihilation, we are surely worth
defending by defensive means that ensure our survival.
<P>
Thank you again. God bless you, and may God bless America.

<H2>Reagan's Speech at the 1994 Gala</H2>

<H3>On the Occasion of His 83rd Birthday</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I can't tell you how thrilled Nancy and I are to be here with
you tonight to celebrate the &quot;forty-fourth anniversary of
my thirty-ninth birthday.&quot; Haley told me he was going to
gather a few friends for dinner tonight, but I had no idea!
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Before I get started here, I want to thank my dear friend, Margaret
Thatcher, for being part of yet another important milestone in
my life and for those very kind words.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
As most of you know, Margaret and I go back quite a ways. We met
at a time before she became Prime Minister and I became President.
From the moment we met, we discovered that we shared quite similar
views of government and freedom. Margaret ended our first meeting
by telling me, &quot;we must stand together,&quot; and that's
exactly wat we've done in the years since--as friends and as political
allies. Margaret Thatcher is one of the giants of our century.
Her many achievements will be appreciated more and more as time
goes on and history is written. For me, she has been a staunch
ally, my political soulmate, a great visionary and a dear, dear
friend. Thank you, Margaret, for being with us here tonight. I
would also like to convey my personal appreciation to Haley Barbour.
Haley, you and the entire Republican National Committee are doing
and excellent job keeping the heat on the Democrats at both ends
of Pennsylvania Avenue. Haley, back when I hired you to work on
my White House staff, I suspected you might amount to something
someday!
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I must say that returning to Washington today really brought back
memories. As our plane headed toward the airport, I looked down
on the White House, and it was just like the good old days...the
South Lawn, the Rose Garden...David Gergen. I looked over a couple
of blocks, and there was the Internal Revenue Service--bigger
than I ever remembered it. When I looked down at the enormous
United States Post Office building I could just see the excitement
on the faces of the bureaucrats--knowing they would soon be managing
our national health care system! Up on Capital Hill, I saw that
big, white dome, bulging with new tax revenues. I instinctively
reached for my veto pen and thought to myself, &quot;Go ahead,
make my day.&quot; You may have seen President Clinton draw his
own veto pen on television just last week. The difference is that
his pen doesn't have any ink in it! Unless, of course, you're
talking about red ink. And we all know the Democrats have plenty
of that!
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
All of you have made our day, just by being here. It's a pleasure
to see so many familiar faces and those who work so hard for the
Grand Old Party. Birthdays often serve as the rare moments when
we can pause from the bustle of our daily lives to reflect on
the years that have passed, the accomplishments and people that
have made them special. As I look around this gathering, I am
filled with countless warm and fond memories. Many of you go back
with us as far as my two terms as California Governor. Others
of you are more recent additions to the family.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Regardless of when you came, you have been a big part of our lives.
For that, we are so grateful and feel so blessed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now, as most of you know, I'm not one for looking back, I figure
there will be plenty of time for that when I get old. But rather
what I take from the past, is inspiration for the future. And
what we accomplished during our years in the White House must
never be lost amid the rhetoric of political revisionists.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
When we came to Washington on that bright sunny day in January
of 1981, we shared a dream for America. Back then, the reach of
government had become intolerable. It was a time of rampant inflation
and crushing interest rates--when hope was scarce. It was a time
when coldy, ugly walls divided nations and human rights were trampled
in the name of evil and corrupt ideologies. It was a time when
the nuclear arms race was spiraling out of control and a blinding
mistrust stood between East and West. We believed that for the
future of America and the free world, this could not stand. And
together, we insisted that this great nation must once again behave
as such.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

In our America, most people still believed in the power of a better
tomorrow. So together we got the government off the backs of the
American people. We created millions of new jobs for Americans
at all income levels. We cut taxes and freed the people from the
shackles of too much government. And, the economy burst loose
in the longest peacetime expansion ever. We brought America back--bigger
and better than ever.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It was a time when America was a bright beacon of hope and freedom
to oppressed people everywhere. The world looked to us--not just
because of our military might--but because of our ideas of liberty
and freedom. And, they knew we were willing to defend and promote
those ideas in every corner of the earth. We rebuilt a demoralized,
underfunded and unappreciated military. And we made it the most
modern and respected force in the world. And who can forget those
so-called &quot;experts&quot; who said our military build-up threatened
a dangerous escalation of tensions? What kind of fool, they asked,
would call the Soviet Union an &quot;evil empire&quot;. But as
events have shown, there was nothing foolish in my prediction
that communism wa destined for the ash-heap of history. After
decades of struggle, and with the help of the bold leadership
of Margaret Thatcher, democracy won the Cold War and the Berlin
Wall came tumbling down.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The world watched with amazement as we put our house in order
and took our rightful place as the most dynamic country in the
world. And I firmly believe that history will record our era as
on of peace and global prosperity.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
However, our task is far from over. Our friends in the other party
will never forgive us for our success and are doing everything
i their power to rewrite history. Listening to the liberals, you'd
think that the 1980s were the worst period since the Great Depression--filled
with greed and despair. Well you and I know better than that.
Although the political landscape has changed, the bold ideas of
the 1980s are alive and well. Republican candidates swept every
major election across the country last year. From New York to
Texas--from New Jersey to my home state of California. And as
a result, it seems that our opponents have finally realized how
unpopular liberalism really is. So now, they're trying to dress
their liberal agenda in a conservative overcoat. After watching
the State of the Union address the other night, I'm reminded of
the old adage that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
Only in this case, it's not flattery, but grand larceny--the intellectual
theft of ideas that you and I recognize as our own. Speech delivery
counts for little on the world stage unless you have convictions
and, yes, the vision to see beyond the front row seats. The Democrats
may remember their lines, but how quickly they forget the lessons
of the past. I have witnessed five major wars in my lifetime,
and I know how swiftly storm clouds can gather on a peaceful horizon.
The next time a Saddam Hussein takes over a Kuwait, or North Korea
brandishes a nuclear weapon, will we be ready to respond?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the end, it all comes down to leadership. That is what this
country is looking for now. It was leadership here at home that
gave us strong American influence abroad and the collapse of imperial
communism. Great nations have responsibilities to lead and we
should always be cautious of those who would lower our profile
because they might just wind up lowering our flag.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
My friends, on a serious note, I would like to end by telling
you something Nancy and I have wanted to say to you for a long
time. During our years together here, as you know, things were
always on the move. As soon as we accomplished one objective,
we were quickly on to the next. There was rarely time to celebrate
victory or recall all the people who made it possible.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, one of the benefits of retirement is you get a chance to
reflect back over the years. Since Nancy and I have returned to
California, we've spent many oaccasions looking back at what we
did here and remembering the extraordinary people who worked so
hard to make those great days possible. Ad we've wondered if we
would ever get the chance to thank them. You are those people--those
great individuals who gave so much of yourselves--who sacrificed
and supported us and helped us achieve everything we did. So,
I will conclude tonight by saying that the greatest gift I could
receive on my birthday is to be able to stand before each and
every one of you and convey in the only words I can how grateful
Nancy and I are: thank you for being there--and for being here.
And thank you for making this evening a memory I will cherish
forever. Until we meet again, God bless you, my friends.

<H2>President Reagan's Speech at Pointe de Hoc</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Ronald Reagan -- Pointe de Hoc, Normandy, June 6, 1984 (The 40th
anniversary of D-Day) <HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We're here to mark that day in history when the Allied peoples
joined in battle to reclaim this continent to liberty. For four
long years, much of Europe had been under a terrible shadow. Free
nations had fallen, Jews cried out in the camps, millions cried
out for liberation. Europe was enslaved, and the world prayed
for its rescue. Here in Normandy the rescue began. Here the Allies
stood and fought against tyranny in a giant undertaking unparalleled
in human history.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We stand on a lonely, windswept point on the northern shore of
France. The air is soft, but forty years ago at this moment, the
air was dense with smoke and the cries of men, and the air was
filled with the crack of rifle fire and the roar of cannon. At
dawn, on the morning of the 6th of June 1944, 225 Rangers jumped
off the British landing craft and ran to the bottom of these cliffs.
Their mission was one of the most difficult and daring of the
invasion: to climb these sheer and desolate cliffs and take out
the enemy guns. The Allies had been told that some of the mightiest
of these guns were here and they would be trained on the beaches
to stop the Allied advance.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Rangers looked up and saw the enemy soldiers -- at the edge
of the cliffs shooting down at them with machine-guns and throwing
grenades. And the American Rangers began to climb. They shot rope
ladders over the face of these cliffs and began to pull themselves
up. When one Ranger fell, another would take his place. When one
rope was cut, a Ranger would grab another and begin his climb
again. They climbed, shot back, and held their footing. Soon,
one by one, the Rangers pulled themselves over the top, and in
seizing the firm land at the top of these cliffs, they began to
seize back the continent of Europe. Two hundred and twenty-five
came here. After two days of fighting only ninety could still
bear arms.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Behind me is a memorial that symbolizes the Ranger daggers that
were thrust into the top of these cliffs. And before me are the
men who put them there.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
These are the boys of Pointe du Hoc. These are the men who took
the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent.
These are the heroes who helped end a war.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Gentlemen, I look at you and I think of the words of Stephen Spender's
poem. You are men who in your 'lives fought for life...and left
the vivid air signed with your honor'...
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Forty summers have passed since the battle that you fought here.
You were young the day you took these cliffs; some of you were
hardly more than boys, with the deepest joys of life before you.
Yet you risked everything here. Why? Why did you do it? What impelled
you to put aside the instinct for self-preservation and risk your
lives to take these cliffs? What inspired all the men of the armies
that met here? We look at you, and somehow we know the answer.
It was faith, and belief; it was loyalty and love.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The men of Normandy had faith that what they were doing was right,
faith that they fought for all humanity, faith that a just God
would grant them mercy on this beachhead or on the next. It was
the deep knowledge -- and pray God we have not lost it -- that
there is a profound moral difference between the use of force
for liberation and the use of force for conquest. You were here
to liberate, not to conquer, and so you and those others did not
doubt your cause. And you were right not to doubt.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You all knew that some things are worth dying for. One's country
is worth dying for, and democracy is worth dying for, because
it's the most deeply honorable form of government ever devised
by man. All of you loved liberty. All of you were willing to fight
tyranny, and you knew the people of your countries were behind
you.

<H2>President Reagan's Speech on The Challenger Disaster</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Ronald Reagan -- Oval Office of the White House, January 28, 1986
<HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Nineteen years ago, almost to the day, we lost three astronauts
in a terrible accident on the ground. But, we've never lost an
astronaut in flight; we've never had a tragedy like this. And
perhaps we've forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the
shuttle; but they, the Challenger Seven, were aware of the dangers,
but overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly. We mourn seven
heroes: Michael Smith, Dick Scobee, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair,
Ellison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe. We mourn
their loss as a nation together.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
For the families of the seven, we cannot bear, as you do, the
full impact of this tragedy. But we feel the loss, and we're thinking
about you so very much. Your loved ones were daring and brave,
and they had that special grace, that special spirit that says,
'Give me a challenge and I'll meet it with joy.' They had a hunger
to explore the universe and discover its truths. They wished to
serve, and they did. They served all of us.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We've grown used to wonders in this century. It's hard to dazzle
us. But for twenty-five years the United States space program
has been doing just that. We've grown used to the idea of space,
and perhaps we forget that we've only just begun. We're still
pioneers. They, the members of the Challenger crew, were pioneers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who
were watching the live coverage of the shuttle's takeoff. I know
it is hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this
happen. It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery.
It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons.
The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the
brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and
we'll continue to follow them...
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
There's a coincidence today. On this day 390 years ago, the great
explorer Sir Francis Drake died aboard ship off the coast of Panama.
In his lifetime the great frontiers were the oceans, and a historian
later said, 'He lived by the sea, died on it, and was buried in
it.' Well, today we can say of the Challenger crew: Their dedication
was, like Drake's, complete.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The crew of the space shuttle Challenger honoured us by the manner
in which they lived their lives. We will never forget them, nor
the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for
the journey and waved goodbye and 'slipped the surly bonds of
earth' to 'touch the face of God.'

Die Kostenexplosion im Gesundheitswesen ist ein Reizthema, das nicht 
reibungslos an einem vorbeigehen kann. Deshalb hat debis als f&uuml;hrender 
Serviceanbieter f&uuml;r Informationstechnologie die richtigen "Therapien" 
entwickelt. 

Wir haben den Informationsaustausch im Gesundheitswesen durchleuchtet und ihm mehr Transparenz verschrieben: durch die Vernetzung von insgesamt <br>

<TD WIDTH=20>

<TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=275>

150.000 Teilnehmern. 

Der Info-Highway verk&uuml;rzt die Kommunikationswege zwischen &Auml;rzten und Krankenh&auml;usern, Krankenkassen und Arbeitgebern, Pharmaindustrie und 
Apotheken. Aus j&auml;hrlich 1 Milliarde Einzelrechnungen werden Bits und Bytes, die &uuml;ber die Datenautobahn gejagt werden. Und das spart Kosten. 

Ganzheitliches Denken, vernetztes Know-how - davon soll die ganze Gesellschaft profitieren.

In Partnerschaft mit f&uuml;hrenden Unternehmen - so mit Cap Gemini, dem gr&ouml;&szlig;ten herstellerunabh&auml;ngigen Anbieter von informationstechnischen Dienstleistungen in Europa mit Aktivit&auml;ten in den USA - erschlie&szlig;t debis neue M&auml;rkte, gewinnt internationale Kunden und garantiert optimale Kundenbetreuung weltweit. Dr. Klaus Mangold, Vorstandsvorsitzender der debis AG: "Wir nutzen durch den kundenorientierten Ausbau des Leistungsangebots und die Erschlie&szlig;ung neuer Gesch&auml;ftsfelder - so in den Bereichen Multimedia und modernes Verkehrsmanagement - die starken Wachstumspotentiale des Dienstleistungssektors, um als Dienstleister der Moderne in den M&auml;rkten der Zukunft aktiv zu sein."<p>Die Daimler-Benz InterServices (debis) AG mit den Gesch&auml;ftsbereichen Systemhaus, Finanzdienstleistungen, Assekuranz Makler,  Telekommunikations- und Mediendienste, Handel, sowie Immobilienmanagement ist das Dienstleistungsunternehmen im Daimler-Benz-Konzern. Gegr&uuml;ndet am 1. Juli 1990 erreichte das Unternehmen in den ersten f&uuml;nf Jahren seines Bestehens ein erhebliches Wachstum und steigerte seinen Umsatz von rd. 4 Mrd. DM auf rd. 11,8 Mrd. DM (1995). Damit hat sich der Umsatz von debis seit Beginn der Gesch&auml;ftst&auml;tigkeit nahezu verdreifacht. Damit hat sich der Umsatz von debis seit Beginn der Gesch&auml;ftst&auml;tigkeit nahezu verdreifacht. Im ersten Halbjahr 1996 hat debis den Umsatz gegen&uuml;ber dem vergleichbaren Vorjahreswert (5,4 Mrd. DM) um &uuml;ber 21 % auf bereits &uuml;ber 6,5 Mrd. DM gesteigert. Die Zahl der Mitarbeiter stieg seit der Gr&uuml;ndung bis Ende Mai 1996 von 3.600 auf 11.000. Fast 2.000 Mitarbeiter sind davon in den ausl&auml;ndischen Niederlassungen der debis t&auml;tig. Dr. Norbert Bensel, Vorstandsmitglied der debis AG, verantwortlich f&uuml;r Personal und Immobilienmanagement: "Die Wettbewerbsf&auml;higkeit der debis wird entscheidend durch die Qualifikation und das Engagement der Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter gepr&auml;gt. Daher bilden Investitionen in deren Qualifikation gerade bei einem kundenorientierten Dienstleistungsunternehmen den Schl&uuml;ssel zum Erfolg."<p>Mit dem Hauptsitz Berlin setzt die debis AG ein wichtiges Zeichen f&uuml;r den Dienstleistungsstandort Deutschland. Wichtigste Aufgabe der debis-Gruppe ist es, den Kunden durch die &Uuml;bernahme von Dienstleistungen die M&ouml;glichkeit zu geben, sich voll und ganz auf ihre Kernaktivit&auml;ten zu konzentrieren. Die modular aufgebauten Leistungsangebote bieten dabei sowohl ma&szlig;geschneiderte Einzel- als auch integrierte Gesamtl&ouml;sungen - ausgerichtet am jeweiligen Kundenbed&uuml;rfnis. So erkl&auml;rt sich auch das debis Firmenzeichen als dynamische Verdichtung einzelner Leistungen zu einem System.</TABLE><P><br><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="debis2_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>English</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../group_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>&Uuml;berblick</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="debis_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Zur&uuml;ck</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Suche</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Hilfe</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 19.11.1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML></BODY></HTML>

Oktober 1996</I><BR>Die Bedeutung der Dienstleistungen und ihre Zukunftsperspektiven insbesondere in und f&uuml;r Deutschland, zeigt die Daimler-Benz InterServices (debis) AG beim ersten Dienstleistungskongre&szlig; am Donnerstag, 24. Oktober 1996 in Berlin auf. Mit internationalen Referenten aus Politik, Wirtschaft, Wissenschaft und Medien m&ouml;chte die debis AG die neuesten Erkenntnisse und Trends auf dem Dienstleistungssektor darstellen und zukunftsweisende Impulse f&uuml;r eine moderne, innovative Dienstleistungsgesellschaft geben. Bundespr&auml;sident Prof. Dr. Roman Herzog wird an diesem ersten debis-Forum teilnehmen und in seiner Rede die gesellschaftspolitische Aufgabe der Dienstleistung deutlich machen.<p>Dr. Klaus Mangold, Vorsitzender des Vorstandes der debis AG, weist in seiner programmatischen Einf&uuml;hrungsrede auf die Impulse hin, die der Dienstleistungsbereich zur &Uuml;berwindung der Arbeitslosigkeit zu leisten in der Lage ist. Der Dienstleistungssektor kann bei Schaffung der notwendigen Rahmenbedingungen durch den Staat und bei Bereitstellung entsprechender Forschungsmittel durchaus zum Besch&auml;ftigungsmotor und zum Hoffnungstr&auml;ger werden und den Industriestandort Deutschland beleben und st&auml;rken. Dienstleistungen werden schon in naher Zukunft sowohl die Wirtschaft als auch den Arbeitsmarkt entscheidend pr&auml;gen und eine wichtige Klammer f&uuml;r den Industriestandort bilden.<p>Nach den Gru&szlig;worten des Pr&auml;sidenten des Abgeordnetenhauses Berlin, Professor Dr. Herwig E. Haase, und - in Vertretung des Regierenden B&uuml;rgermeisters - von Frau Dr. Christine Bergmann, Senatorin f&uuml;r Arbeit, Berufliche Bildung und Frauen, gibt Friedrich Schorlemmer, Studienleiter der Evangelischen Akademie Sachsen-Anhalt,  Impulse zum Kongre&szlig; und spricht &uuml;ber "Die Tugend des Dienens". Professor Dr. Gerhard Fels, Direktor des Instituts der deutschen Wirtschaft, stellt in seinem Vortrag die "Chancen f&uuml;r den Wirtschaftsstandort Deutschland durch Dienstleistungen" dar.<p>Ist ein Blick in die USA, in das "Mutterland der Dienstleistungen" wie ein Blick in unsere nahe Zukunft? Dort sind in den letzten f&uuml;nf Jahren acht Millionen neue Arbeitspl&auml;tze entstanden. Eine Entwicklung, die weniger mit dem technischen Fortschritt als vielmehr mit dem z&uuml;gigen Wandel zur Dienstleistungsgesellschaft zusammenh&auml;ngt.<p>Zu den handfesten Erfolgen, wie sie in den USA erzielt wurden, sprechen Robert Reich, US Secretary of Labor - er kann wegen der bevorstehenden US-Wahlen nur per Video zu den Kongre&szlig;teilnehmern sprechen - und Herman Cain, Chairman und CEO der "Godfather's Pizza", der in seinem Referat die USA  als  das Mutterland der Dienstleistungen darstellen wird. Dr. Paul  Achleitner, Gesch&auml;ftsf&uuml;hrer der Goldman, Sachs & Co. oHG, geht der Frage nach,  ob die USA ein ohne weiteres auf Deutschland &uuml;bertragbares Modell sein k&ouml;nnen. Abgerundet und ganz speziell auf deutsche Verh&auml;ltnisse &uuml;bertragen werden diese Erfahrungen und Modelle im Beitrag des Gesch&auml;ftsf&uuml;hrers der Piepenbrock-Dienstleistungsgruppe, Professor Hartwig Piepenbrock. Er spricht zum Thema "Service in Deutschland".<p>Im dritten Themenblock des Symposions "Fakten und Visionen", stellt Professor  Dr. Rupert Scholz, MdB, Vorsitzender des Sachverst&auml;ndigenrates "Schlanker Staat" die staatlichen Initiativen f&uuml;r die Dienstleistungen der Zukunft dar. Bernhard Jagoda, Pr&auml;sident der Bundesanstalt f&uuml;r Arbeit, spricht &uuml;ber seine Erwartungen zur Schaffung neuer Arbeitspl&auml;tze durch Dienstleistungen. EU-Kommissar Dr. Martin Bangemann hat seinen Vortrag thematisch als Forderung formuliert: "Dienstleistung braucht einen europ&auml;ischen Rahmen".<p>Diese drei Referenten bestreiten auch die Podiumsdiskussion "Chancen und Risiken der Dienstleistungsgesellschaft", zusammen mit John Diebold, Chairman der John Diebold Incorporated, Professor  Dr. Peter Eichhorst, M&uuml;nchen/San Diego, Dr. Thomas Middelhoff, Vorstandsmitglied der Bertelsmann AG, und mit Professor Dr. Eckard P.W. Minx, Leiter Forschung Gesellschaft und Technik der Daimler-Benz AG. Die Moderation der Podiumsdiskussion hat J&uuml;rgen Jeske &uuml;bernommen, Herausgeber der Frankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung.<p>Zu diesem ersten Dienstleistungsforum in Berlin erwartet debis 500 Teilnehmer aus dem In- und Ausland sowie ein gro&szlig;es Interesse von Presse, Funk und Fernsehen.</TD></TR></TABLE></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../lines/db_250.gif" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="16"NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="../../group/debis/debis_g.htm"><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>zur&uuml;ckzur debis</FONT></I></B></A></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><BR><IMG SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif" WIDTH="592" HEIGHT="16" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><TABLE><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER" WIDTH="550"><H5><A HREF="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home&nbsp;]</I></A><A HREF="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Suche&nbsp;]</I></A><AHREF="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog&nbsp;] </I></A><I><A HREF="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;Hilfe&nbsp;]</A></I></H5></TD></TR></TABLE></P><ADDRESS ALIGN=CENTER>&copy; debis </ADDRESS></BODY></HTML>

Daimler-Benz, das gr&ouml;&szlig;te europ&auml;ische Industrieunternehmen, vereinigt in seinen Gesch&auml;ftsfeldern vielf&auml;ltiges K&ouml;nnen und Erfahrungen in den Bereichen Verkehr und Transport, bei Komponenten und Systemen und verschiedenen, mit den Kerngesch&auml;ften verkn&uuml;pften Dienstleistungen. Mehr als 310.000 Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter (Stand 31.12.95) sind weltweit f&uuml;r den Konzern t&auml;tig, sie erwirtschafteten 1995 einen Umsatz von &uuml;ber 100 Mrd. DM.

Die Jahre 1996 und 1997 sind f&uuml;r Daimler-Benz Jahre des &Uuml;bergangs, in denen die Straffung des Gesch&auml;fts-Portfolios und die Verbesserung der Ertragsstruktur im Vordergrund stehen: So wird zur Jahresmitte 1996 die AEG Aktiengesellschaft auf die Daimler-Benz AG verschmolzen werden. Die Gesch&auml;ftsfelder Bahnsysteme, Mikroelektronik und Postautomatisierung werden dann von Daimler-Benz direkt, der Bereich Dieselantriebe von Mercedes-Benz industriell gef&uuml;hrt werden. Die Luftfahrtaktivit&auml;ten der Daimler-Benz Aerospace konzentrieren sich<br>

Auch die zuk&uuml;nftige Struktur des Konzerns wird darauf ausgerichtet sein, technisches K&ouml;nnen und unternehmerisches Engagement wirkungsvoll miteinander zu verbinden: Mercedes-Benz als Hersteller von Personenwagen und Nutzfahrzeugen; Daimler-Benz Aerospace in der Luft- und Raumfahrt, in der Verteidigungstechnik und bei Zivilen Systemen; und die Daimler-Benz InterServices (debis) als Anbieter von anspruchsvollen Dienstleistungen.

Um die Marktposition in Deutschland zu st&auml;rken und den Zugang zu internationalen M&auml;rkten zu erhalten, schlo&szlig; das debis Systemhaus 1992 eine strategische Allianz mit Cap Gemini. <p>Das branchenspezifisch ausgerichtete Leistungsangebot des in Deutschland f&uuml;hrenden, herstellerneutralen IT-Dienstleisters deckt das gesamte Spektrum der Informationsverarbeitung ab. Durch die Kernf&auml;higkeiten Beraten, Entwickeln und Betreiben ist das debis Systemhaus in der Lage, seinen Kunden informationstechnische L&ouml;sungen zur Erneuerung und Revitalisierung ihres Gesch&auml;ftes aus einer Hand anzubieten. Zum Beispiel &uuml;bernimmt das debis Systemhaus die Verantwortung f&uuml;r Wartung und Pflege von Anwendungssystemen. Bei den Business Transformation Services wird neben Konzeption, Realisierung und Betreuung gegebenenfalls auch die operative Verantwortung f&uuml;r IT-bezogene Unternehmensfunktionen des Kunden - wie beispielsweise Rechenzentrums- und Netzdienste - angeboten. "Der entscheidende Vorteil f&uuml;r den Kunden ist", so Karl-Heinz Achinger, Vorstandsmitglied der debis AG, verantwortlich f&uuml;r Systemhaus, "da&szlig; er einerseits hochwertige Leistungen erh&auml;lt, die flexibel und dennoch zeitplan- und budgetkonform erbracht werden. Andererseits kann er auf die Solidit&auml;t und das Know-how eines der gr&ouml;&szlig;ten herstellerneutralen Komplettanbieters im europ&auml;ischen Markt f&uuml;r IT-Services bauen."In diesem Markt, der in Deutschland in diesem Jahr ein Volumen von ca. 22 Mrd. DM erreicht, erzielte das debis Systemhaus 1995 mit seinen rund 6.700 Mitarbeitern einen Umsatz von insgesamt 2 Mrd. DM.</TABLE><P><br><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="syste2_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>English</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../group_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>&Uuml;berblick</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="system_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Zur&uuml;ck</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Suche</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Hilfe</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 19.11.1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Over 200 branches in 23 countries of the world are a clear sign of the international orientation of debis's seven divisions. In strategic alliances with other leading companies - such as <A HREF="http://www.cgs.fr">Cap Gemini Sogeti</A>, the biggest supplier of IT services in Europe which is independent of the manufacturers, and which also operates in the USA - debis is opening up new markets, winning international customers and guaranteeing the highest possible level of service to its customers all over the world. In the words of Dr. Klaus Mangold, Chairman of the Board of Management of debis AG: "Through our customer-focused expansion of our range of services and by opening up new areas of business - for example in the fields of multimedia and modern traffic management - we are exploiting the vast potential for growth that exists in the service sector, in order to be involved in the markets of the future as a provider of modern services."<p>Daimler-Benz InterServices (debis) AG, with its seven business divisions - Systemhaus, Financial Services, Insurance Brokerage, Trading, Marketing Services, Telecommunications and Media Services and Real Estate Management - is the service undertaking of the Daimler-Benz Group. Established on July 1st 1990, the company has achieved substantial growth during the first five years of its existence, increasing its turnover from around DM 4 billion to some DM 11,6 billion (1995). This means that debis's turnover has been multiplied almost threefold since the company was established. The number of employees has risen over the same period from 3,600 to 10,196. Almost 2,000 of these work in debis's foreign branches. J&uuml;rgen Gembus, the member of the Board of Management of debis AG responsible for personnel and mobile communications services, says: "Crucial to debis's competitiveness are the level of qualification of its staff and their high degree of commitment. This shows that in a customer-focused service undertaking above all, investment in staff training is the key to success."<p>By having its headquarters in Berlin, debis AG demonstrates its total confidence in Germany's future as a service industry location. The debis Group's most important mission is to take over the responsibility for services on behalf of its customers, thereby allowing them to concentrate fully and completely on their core activities.<p>The various ranges of services offered are designed to be modular in structure, so that the company can offer both tailor-made individual packages and overall integrated solutions - according to the requirements of each particular customer. This is also the meaning of the debis logo, which represents the dynamic concentration of individual services into a single organised system.</TABLE><P><br><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="debis2_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../group_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>At a Glance</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="debis_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Up</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 04/11/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Gerade in wettbewerbsintensiven M&auml;rkten leisten produktspezifische, kundenorientierte Leasing- und Finanzierungsprogramme einen wichtigen Beitrag zur Absatzunterst&uuml;tzung. F&uuml;r den Gesch&auml;ftsbereich Finanzdienstleistungen ist daher - im partnerschaftlichen Miteinander mit den Unternehmensbereichen des Daimler-Benz-Konzerns - die Vertriebsabst&uuml;tzung von Konzernprodukten Schwerpunkt seiner T&auml;tigkeit.<p>Bedingt durch das starke Wachstum und die regionale Ausweitung hat sich der Gesch&auml;ftsbereich durch die Gr&uuml;ndung der Finanzdienstleistungs GmbH im Juli 1995 eine neue Struktur gegeben. Zielsetzung dieser Management-GmbH ist die operative und strategische F&uuml;hrung und Steuerung der Mercedes-Benz Leasing- und Finanzierungsgesellschaften und der debis Leasing- und Finanzierungsgesellschaften. Diese bieten von der Teilzahlungsfinanzierung bis zum Full-Service-Leasing Finanzierungsl&ouml;sungen f&uuml;r Mercedes-Benz-Fahrzeuge sowie f&uuml;r Konzernprodukte aus dem nicht-automobilen Bereich an.<p>"Die neue Struktur ist die organisatorische Konsequenz des volumenm&auml;&szlig;igen und strukturellen Wachstums des Gesch&auml;ftsbereichs in den zur&uuml;ckliegenden Jahren und bietet gleichzeitig die Basis f&uuml;r die weitere Ausweitung unseres Gesch&auml;fts", erkl&auml;rt Hans Adams, Mitglied des Vorstands der Daimler-Benz InterServices (debis) AG, verantwortlich f&uuml;r die Gesch&auml;ftsbereiche Finanzdienstleistungen und Versicherungen und zugleich Vorsitzender der Gesch&auml;ftsf&uuml;hrung der debis Finanzdienstleistungs GmbH.<p>Die <A HREF="../../debis/dal/dal.htm">debis Aviation Leasing GmbH</A>, die ebenso zum Gesch&auml;ftsbereich Finanzdienstleistungen geh&ouml;rt, bietet prim&auml;r f&uuml;r Flugzeuge des Daimler-Benz-Konzerns produktbegleitende Leasingfinanzierungen mit dem Schwerpunkt auf Leasingfonds an. Bisher konnten 13 Jets mit einem Investitionsvolumen von rund einer Milliarde DM und einem Eigenkapitalanteil von &uuml;ber 640 Mio DM finanziert werden. Die <A HREF="../../debis/dal/dal.htm">debis Fondsmanagement GmbH</A>, das dritte Unternehmen des Gesch&auml;ftsbereichs, befa&szlig;t sich ebenfalls mit komplexen Leasingtransaktionen. Ihr Schwerpunkt liegt auf Gro&szlig;mobilien, wie beispielsweise Schienenfahrzeuge, sowie auf Immobilienprojekten. debis Fondsmanagement hat bereits zwei Fonds plaziert, f&uuml;r das neue Landesfunkhaus des Norddeutschen Rundfunks (NDR) in Schwerin und 42 AEG-Niederflurstra&szlig;enbahnen der Bremer Stra&szlig;enbahn AG.<p>Der Gesch&auml;ftsbereich Finanzdienstleistungen mit seinen 49 operativen Gesellschaften in 20 L&auml;ndern setzte mit einem verantworteten Vertragsvolumen von rund 26,5 Mrd. DM und einem Neugesch&auml;ft von 14 Mrd. DM (1995) die positive gesch&auml;ftliche Entwicklung der letzten Jahre weiter fort. Mit einem Anteil an der debis Gesamtleistung von rund 70 % sind die Finanzdienstleistungen weiterhin der leistungsst&auml;rkste Bereich der debis.</TABLE><P><br><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="finan2_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>English</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../group_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>&Uuml;berblick</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="financ_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Zur&uuml;ck</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Suche</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Hilfe</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 20.12.1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Basis der Beratung ist ein umfassendes Risk-Management, bestehend aus den Bereichen Risk Engineering und Risk Financing. Dieser Ansatz umfa&szlig;t zun&auml;chst die Risikoanalyse und -dokumentation. Danach werden durch Spezialisten technische und organisatorische Ma&szlig;nahmenkataloge erarbeitet, um die identifizierten Risiken zu minimieren oder sogar auszuschalten. F&uuml;r die verbleibenden Risiken erstellt debis Assekuranz Makler ma&szlig;geschneiderte Versicherungsdeckungskonzepte.<p>Wesentliche Voraussetzung f&uuml;r eine kostenoptimierte Umsetzung komplexer Risk-Financing-Konzepte im Dienste des Kunden ist der direkte Einflu&szlig; auf die internationalen Erst- und R&uuml;ckversicherungsm&auml;rkte. Durch Gr&uuml;ndung des R&uuml;ckversicherungsmaklers debis Re Brokers, Bremen, sowie der R&uuml;ckversicherungsgesellschaft debis Re Insurance, Luxemburg, hat sich der Gesch&auml;ftsbereich 1994 auch den Zugang zu den internationalen R&uuml;ckversicherungsm&auml;rkten erschlossen und sich damit ein Instrumentarium von strategischer Bedeutung geschaffen. <p>Den Schwerpunkt bildet das Industriekundengesch&auml;ft. Hierbei entf&auml;llt der bei weitem &uuml;berwiegende Anteil auf Kunden au&szlig;erhalb des Daimler-Benz-Konzerns. Ihre qualitative und quantitative Entwicklung stellt die debis Assekuranz Makler durch Wachstum aus eigener Kraft sowie in Einzelf&auml;llen durch Zuk&auml;ufe von Marktanteilen sicher. In diesem Rahmen ist auch die mehrheitliche Beteiligung am Industrieversicherungsmakler IHA Industrie- und Handels-Assekuranz Makler GmbH zu verstehen, die zu Beginn dieses Jahres realisiert wurde. Die debis Assekuranz Makler Vermittlungs GmbH hat auch 1995 ihr Betriebsergebnis weiter gesteigert. Mit insgesamt 465 Mitarbeitern im In- und Ausland betreut sie heute ein Pr&auml;mienvolumen von rund 900 Mio DM. Zur Zeit ist debis Assekuranz Makler in sieben L&auml;ndern mit Niederlassungen vertreten. &Uuml;ber weltweit t&auml;tige Kooperationspartner stellt sie auch f&uuml;r ihre anderen internationalen Kunden eine ma&szlig;geschneiderte "vor-Ort-Betreuung" sicher. Dieses Betreuungsangebot soll in den n&auml;chsten Jahren konsequent weiter ausgebaut werden.</TABLE><P><br><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="insur2_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>English</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../group_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>&Uuml;berblick</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="insura_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Zur&uuml;ck</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Suche</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Hilfe</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 19.11.1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Protecting a company against all eventualities can be an expensive proposition. Our Risk EngIneering can provide just the kind of reassurance you need. The first thing we do is to identify all imaginable risk factors. Then we evaluate and quantify them.<br>
<TD WIDTH=20>



<TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=275>
The next step is to prepare a catalogue of measures for minimising precisely these risks, and where possible even eliminating them altogether. We then put together a package tailored to provide the assurance cover you need for the remaining risk.

Dr. Klaus Mangold, Vorsitzender des Vorstandes der debis AG, auch verantwortlich f&uuml;r den Gesch&auml;ftsbereich Handel: "Dar&uuml;ber hinaus unterst&uuml;tzen wir auch unsere Partner in devisenarmen L&auml;ndern bei der Beschaffung von Technologieprodukten und identifizieren gleichzeitig Waren vor Ort, um sie mit Hilfe von debis Handel in westlichen M&auml;rkten abzusetzen. Dadurch erm&ouml;glichen wir den Aufbau nachhaltiger Gesch&auml;ftsbeziehungen in schwierigen M&auml;rkten und machen sie f&uuml;r den Kunden erreichbarer und transparenter."<p>Innerhalb von debis Handel bietet die debis International Trading GmbH Countertrade-Dienstleistungen schwerpunktm&auml;&szlig;ig f&uuml;r die M&auml;rkte Osteuropas, Lateinamerikas und Asiens an, w&auml;hrend die debis Industriehandel GmbH auf den M&auml;rkten S&uuml;dosteuropas, Afrikas und des Fernen und Nahen Ostens t&auml;tig ist und das Key-Accounting von Konzernprojekten &uuml;bernimmt. Die internationale Stellung von debis Handel - debis Handel ist weltweit in 15 L&auml;ndern vertreten - wird &uuml;ber die Zusammenarbeit mit starken Partnern in den Zielm&auml;rkten gefestigt. So unterst&uuml;tzt debis Handel z.B. &uuml;ber das gemeinsam mit dem russischen Energiekonzern Gasprom gef&uuml;hrte Joint Venture DITGAS Handelshaus seinen Kooperationspartner u.a. bei der Beschaffung von technischen Produktionsanlagen und bei der Organisation der entsprechenden Gegenlieferungen.<p>Im Commodity-Handel ist debis Handel &uuml;ber ein Gemeinschaftsunternehmen mit der Metallgesellschaft Handel & Beteiligungen AG, der MG NE Produkthandel GmbH, t&auml;tig. Das Dienstleistungsspektrum der MG NE umfa&szlig;t auf dem Sektor Nichteisen (NE)-Metalle (Prim&auml;raluminium und Halbzeuge) die Versorgung mit Roh- und Vormaterial bis zur Vermarktung der Halbzeuge einschlie&szlig;lich des Managements von Programmen zur Absicherung gegen Metallpreisschwankungen. <p>Der Warenhandel bietet &uuml;ber die debis concepts+products Werbemittel GmbH ein aktuelles Dienstleistungs- und Produktspektrum im Accessoires- und Werbemittelmarkt an.

Auf rd. 7 ha Fl&auml;che werden mitten in Berlin 19 Geb&auml;ude mit einer oberirdischen Bruttogescho&szlig;fl&auml;che von rd. 340.000 m2 gebaut werden. Dies entspricht einem Bauvolumen von &uuml;ber 3.000 Einfamilienh&auml;usern. Das neue Stadtviertel wird bis Ende 1998 fertiggestellt. Es bietet B&uuml;ror&auml;ume, Wohnungen, Einzelhandelsgesch&auml;fte, Restaurants, Caf&eacute;s, Kneipen, Kinos, ein Musicaltheater, ein Vari&eacute;t&eacute;, ein 3D-Kino, eine Spielbank und ein Grand Hotel und gew&auml;hrleistet so "Leben rund um die Uhr". Die B&uuml;ronutzung wurde im Interesse der Vitalit&auml;t des Stadtquartiers auf knapp 50 % begrenzt. 20 % sind Wohnungen vorbehalten, die restlichen 30 % typischen urbanen Einrichtungen. Ein Teil der B&uuml;rofl&auml;che wird von der debis-Konzernzentrale sowie Bereichen der Daimler-Benz AG genutzt werden. Die Gesamtinvestitionskosten von rd. 4 Mrd. DM sind fremdfinanziert. Neben der Baubetreuung am Potsdamer Platz ist die optimierte Nutzungsverwertung, Entwicklung und Betreuung von fremden und konzerneigenen Grundst&uuml;cken Aufgabe und Zielsetzung der dIM und ihrer 54 Mitarbeiter.<P><BR><A HREF="estate_g.htm">Zur&uuml;ck zu debis Immobilienmanagement</A></TABLE><P><br><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="estat2_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>English</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../group_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>&Uuml;berblick</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="estate_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Zur&uuml;ck</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Suche</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Hilfe</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 30.05.1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Januar 1997</I><BR>Die Daimler-Benz AG wird ihre bisherigen 100prozentigen Tochtergesellschaften AEG Electrocom GmbH, Konstanz, und die AEG ElectroCom International Inc. (ECA), Irving, Texas, an den Siemens-Bereich Automatisierungstechnik, N&uuml;rnberg, abgeben. Mit diesem Verkauf ist f&uuml;r Daimler-Benz die Fokussierung des Gesch&auml;ftsportfolios auf die Bereiche Transport, Verkehr und Dienstleistungen weitgehend abgeschlossen. Daimler-Benz umfa&szlig;t damit noch 23 Gesch&auml;ftsbereiche nach 35 zur Mitte des Jahres 1995.<p>Die vollst&auml;ndige &Uuml;bernahme durch Siemens wird r&uuml;ckwirkend zum 1. Januar 1997 wirksam werden, wie beide Unternehmen am 13. Januar 1997 mitteilten. Entsprechende Vertr&auml;ge wurden bereits unterschrieben. Die &Uuml;bernahme steht unter Vorbehalt der Zustimmung der Kartellbeh&ouml;rden. Ein Kaufpreis wurde von den beteiligten Unternehmen nicht genannt.<p>Das Gesch&auml;ftsfeld Erkennungs- und Sortiersysteme, das die weltweiten Aktivit&auml;ten der AEG Electrocom umfa&szlig;t, befindet sich in hervorragender Marktposition und wirtschaftet erfolgreich, z&auml;hlt aber seit der Aufl&ouml;sung der AEG im Jahr 1996 als Teilbereich der AEG-Automatisierungstechnik nicht mehr zu den T&auml;tigkeitsfeldern, auf die der Daimler-Benz-Konzern sich inzwischen konzentriert hat. Bereits bei der &Uuml;bernahme der US-Gesellschaft ECA im Jahr 1994 hatte Daimler-Benz betont, da&szlig; eine Beteiligung eines Invetors angestrebt werde. F&uuml;r Siemens bedeutet der Zukauf der AEG Electrocom eine ideale Erg&auml;nzung des Bereichs Automatisierungstechnik.<p>Die AEG Electrocom ist ein f&uuml;hrender Anbieter auf dem Gebiet der Sortier - und Erkennungssysteme f&uuml;r die Postautomatisierung. Das Unternehmen erzielte 1995 einen weltweiten Umsatz von rund 650 Mill. DM, f&uuml;r 1996 wird etwa 1 Mrd. DM erwartet. Rund 70% des Gesamtumsatzes der letzten Jahre entfielen auf den amerikanischen Markt. Electrocom besch&auml;ftigt weltweit knapp 3.000 Mitarbeiter, davon etwa 40% in den USA und knapp 60% in Deutschland. Rund 10.000 Electrocom-Briefsortieranlagen arbeiten derzeit in 29 L&auml;ndern. </TD></TR></TABLE></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><BR><IMG SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif" WIDTH="592" HEIGHT="16" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER" WIDTH="550"><H5><A HREF="70113_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>English&nbsp;]</I> </A><A HREF="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home&nbsp;]</I> </A><A HREF="../news_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Nachrichten&nbsp;]</I></A><A HREF="61213_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Weiter&nbsp;]</I> </A><A HREF="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Suche&nbsp;]</I></A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog&nbsp;]</I> </A><A HREF="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Hilfe&nbsp;]</I> </A></H5></TD></TR></TABLE></P><ADDRESS ALIGN=CENTER>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 13.01.1997</ADDRESS></BODY></HTML>

November 1996</I><BR>Durch den Einsatz neuer und international orientierter Finanzierungsinstrumente hat Daimler-Benz seine Kapitalbeschaffung in den vergangenen Jahren auf eine breite und global nutzbare Basis gestellt. Bereits im Sommer 1996 hatte Daimler-Benz erstmals mit einer auf D-Mark lautenden Optionsanleihe, die auch eine Inzahlunggabe der Teilschuldverschreibung zum Bezug von Aktien vorsieht, eine absolute Novit&auml;t auf den deutschen Kapitalmarkt gebracht und damit auch in Deutschland  neue Investorenkreise angesprochen.<p>Jetzt stellte Finanzchef Manfred Gentz in Frankfurt in einem Vortrag vor dem Institut f&uuml;r Kapitalmarktforschung der Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universit&auml;t zwei weitere Innovationen vor, die Daimler-Benz in B&auml;lde in den sogenannten Emerging Markets nutzen k&ouml;nnte: Mittels sogenannter Captive Equity Vehicles sollen k&uuml;nftig Daimler-Benz-Projekte in M&auml;rkten mit wenig entwickelten Finanzm&auml;rkten und unter Einschlu&szlig; des L&auml;nderrisikos finanziert werden. Diese Finanzierungsmodelle, von einer internationalen Bank gemanagt, werden von lokalen Investoren mit Eigenkapital ausgestattet, das wiederum in renditeversprechende Projekte von Daimler-Benz investiert wird, ein Modell, so Gentz, das Daimler-Benz beispielsweise in Asien einzusetzen gedenke.  <p>Den Einsatz von Kapitalmarktinstrumenten habe Daimler-Benz bisher in den Emerging Markets ausgeschlossen, da man nur mit Daimler-Benz-Papieren der gleichen Risikoqualit&auml;t vertreten sein wollte. Allerdings sind nach den Worten von Manfred Gentz auch Konstruktionen f&uuml;r h&ouml;her verzinsliche Emerging Market-Anleihen denkbar, bei denen dem Investor die &Uuml;bernahme des Konvertierungs- und Transferrisikos durch die Gew&auml;hrung einer h&ouml;heren Rendite schmackhaft gemacht werden k&ouml;nnte. Gentz nannte Brasilien, wo Daimler-Benz zahlreiche Aktivit&auml;ten betreibt, als ersten m&ouml;glichen Fall einer solchen Emission.<p>Daimler-Benz-Finanzchef Gentz f&uuml;hrte in seinem Vortrag Finanzstrategien auf internationalen M&auml;rkten weiter aus, da&szlig; der Stuttgarter Konzern sein j&auml;hrliches Finanzierungsvolumen in den kommenden Jahren verh&auml;ltnism&auml;&szlig;ig unver&auml;ndert beibehalten werde. W&auml;hrend der Finanzierungsbedarf des industriellen Gesch&auml;fts &uuml;berwiegend aus dem Cash Flow gedeckt werde, wird der f&uuml;r 1997 erwartete Refinanzierungsbedarf f&uuml;r den Konzern von rund 15 Mrd. DM, der  &uuml;berwiegend den Leasing- und Absatzfinanzierungsgesellschaften zuzurechnen ist, &uuml;blicherweise durch Kapitalmarktaufnahmen gedeckt. Davon entfalle 13 Mrd. DM auf Prolongationen, 2 Mrd. DM davon sei Neubedarf.  Im Jahr 1998 werde Daimler-Benz angesichts seiner kr&auml;ftigen Wachstumsraten in den 24 Gesch&auml;ftsfeldern die internationalen Fremdkapitalm&auml;rkte mit rund 18 Mrd. DM beanspruchen, wobei hier 14 Mrd. DM auf Prolongationen entfielen.    <p><br><B>"Asset backed securities" k&uuml;nftig auch in Japan</B><p>&Uuml;ber die etablierten Finanzierungsinstrumente hinaus - im kurzfristigen Bereich Commercial Paper-Programme, bei l&auml;ngerfristigem Finanzbedarf Multi Currency Treasury Note-Programme (MCTN), Euro- sowie US-Medium Term Note-Programme - betonte Gentz auch Spezialfinanzierungen wie zum Beispiel die Projektfinanzierung f&uuml;r die Smart-Fabrik im lothringischen Hambach durch eine spezielle Leasingkonstruktion. Die in den USA sowie in Gro&szlig;britannien aufgelegten Asset-Backed Securitization-Programme, also die Begebung von Anleihen, die durch Forderungen unterlegt sind, werde Daimler-Benz, so Gentz, demn&auml;chst erstmals auch f&uuml;r Japan vorsehen.<p>Daimler-Benz verfolgt laut Gentz f&uuml;nf Prinzipien, um sich m&ouml;glichst flexibel und unabh&auml;ngig auf den Kapitalm&auml;rkten bewegen zu k&ouml;nnen und optimale Konditionen zu erzielen:<br>-	Finanzierung in lokaler W&auml;hrung<br>-	Kostenoptimale Beschaffung der Finanzmittel<br>-	Flexibilit&auml;t der Mittelaufnahme  (z.B. Euro Medium Term Note-Programm, Medium Term Note-Programm in USA, US-Notierung von Daimler-Benz)<br>-	Mittelaufnahme unter Daimler-Benz zur Nutzung der Bonit&auml;t<br>-	Transparente Kreditw&uuml;rdigkeit durch Ratings von Standard & Poor`s und Moody`s.<p>Neben den Hauptaktion&auml;ren Deutsche Bank (24,4%) und Kuwait (rund 12,9%), ist das Kapital von Daimler-Benz bei rund 450.000 Aktion&auml;ren in Streubesitz, darunter rund 200.000 Belegschaftsaktion&auml;ren. Rund 55  Prozent des Kapitals werden in Deutschland gehalten, 20 im restlichen Europa, 8 Prozent in den USA und 17 Prozent in Asien. </TD></TR></TABLE></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><BR><IMG SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif" WIDTH="592" HEIGHT="16" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER" WIDTH="550"><H5><A HREF="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home&nbsp;]</I> </A><A HREF="../news_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Nachrichten&nbsp;]</I></A><A HREF="61115_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Weiter&nbsp;]</I> </A><A HREF="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Suche&nbsp;]</I></A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog&nbsp;]</I> </A><A HREF="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Hilfe&nbsp;]</I> </A></H5></TD></TR></TABLE></P><ADDRESS ALIGN=CENTER>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 27.11.1996</ADDRESS></BODY></HTML>

November 1996</I><BR>Die Kunst der Unternehmensf&uuml;hrung besteht darin, die Anspr&uuml;che der Aktion&auml;re, der Mitarbeiter und der Kunden zu befriedigen. Und dies geht nur im Konsens, nicht im Konflikt. Mit diesen Worten hat der Vorstandsvorsitzende der Daimler-Benz AG, J&uuml;rgen E. Schrempp, vor dem Gespr&auml;chskreis der Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung in der Diskussion um Shareholder Value Position bezogen.<p>Schrempp sieht die Gesellschaft in Deutschland an einer gef&auml;hrlichen Schwelle von der Konsens- zur Konfliktgesellschaft. Gemeinsam m&uuml;&szlig;te nach L&ouml;sungen gesucht, der Begriff der Solidarit&auml;t neu mit Leben gef&uuml;llt werden. In der ideologisch &uuml;berfrachteten Gespensterdiskussion um Shareholder Value gehe es doch nicht darum, ob eine Anspruchsgruppe &uuml;ber die jeweils andere triumphiere, sondern um die banale wirtschaftliche Erkenntnis, den Wert eines Unternehmens zu steigern und die Rendite einer Investition &uuml;ber ihre Lebensdauer h&ouml;her zu halten als den Zins f&uuml;r ihre langfristige Finanzierung. <p>Europa sieht sich nach den Worten Schrempps mit der Tatsache einer umfassenden Globalisierung konfrontiert. Die Globalisierung habe die Kapital- und Finanzm&auml;rkte vollst&auml;ndig erfa&szlig;t, die M&auml;rkte f&uuml;r G&uuml;ter und Dienstleistungen und die Arbeitsm&auml;rkte folgten, ebenso die Bereiche Forschung und Entwicklung. So suchten sich heute die Fondsmanager rund um den Globus die attraktivsten Unternehmen. Er wisse nicht, wann ein Gewinn obsz&ouml;n hoch sei, wie SPD-Fraktionschef Scharping es formuliert habe. Er wisse nur, wann ein Gewinn zu niedrig sei, n&auml;mlich wenn die Anleger einem Unternehmen die R&uuml;cken kehrten, erkl&auml;rte Schrempp.<p>Bei der Globalisierung der G&uuml;ter und Dienstleistungen m&uuml;ssen die Unternehmen, um ihre Position auf den Wachstumsm&auml;rkten der Welt zu verbessern, dorthin gehen, wo ein starker Nachfragesog bestehe. Ich bezweifle, da&szlig; es den westlichen Anspruchsgesellschaften gelingen wird, den asiatischen Verzichtsgesellschaften Art und Weise ihres Weges vorzuschreiben oder sie gar zu einer freiwilligen Begrenzung ihrer wirtschaftlichen Expansion zu bewegen, erkl&auml;rte Schrempp im Blick auf die &Uuml;berlegungen der SPD &uuml;ber weltweiten sozialen und steuerlichen  Mindeststandard zur Verteidigung des deutschen Sozial- und Wohlfahrtsstaates. So wenig wie der internationale Investor bereit sei, einen Abschlag f&uuml;r deutsche Unternehmen hinzunehmen, sowenig sei der internationale Konsument noch bereit, f&uuml;r ein deutsches Produkt einen h&ouml;heren Preis zu bezahlen. <p>Der Vorstandvorsitzende der Daimler-Benz AG kommt zu dem Ergebnis, die Globalisierung zwinge dazu, die Unternehmen v&ouml;llig neu auszurichten, um ihre Wettbewerbsf&auml;higkeit sicherzustellen. Dabei h&auml;lt Schrempp nichts davon, sich auf amerikanisch zu schminken, um so angels&auml;chsischen Investoren besser zu Gefallen zu sein. Deutsche St&auml;rken wie die langfristig angelegte Unternehmensstrategie oder das Konsensmodell der Mitbestimmung seien Besonderheiten, die bewahrt werden m&uuml;&szlig;ten. <p>Schrempp r&auml;umte ein, da&szlig; in den vergangenen Wochen vielleicht der Symbolcharakter mancher gewerkschaftlicher Errungenschaften nicht richtig eingesch&auml;tzt worden sei. Allerdings h&auml;tten bei Daimler-Benz der Vorstandsvorsitzende und der Gesamtbetriebsratsvorsitzende die eskalierende Auseinandersetzung zugunsten einer Verhandlungsl&ouml;sung beigelegt. Klar sei, da&szlig; die Unternehmen der Metallindustrie eine Kostenentlastung brauchten, um das Niveau der Besch&auml;ftigung wenigstens zu halten und um Zusammenbr&uuml;che schw&auml;cherer Unternehmen zu verhindern. Es sei nun wirklich nicht die Zeit f&uuml;r Verteilungsk&auml;mpfe. Kein Vorstand wolle einem kranken Arbeitnehmer am Krankenbett den Lohn k&uuml;rzen. Aber wenn es uns gelingt, die Krankenquote am Montag oder Freitag um einen Prozentpunkt zu k&uuml;rzen, dann ist das ein solidarischer Beitrag, der die Arbeitspl&auml;tze sichert und dem Unternehmen hilft, im globalen Wettbewerb zu bestehen, betonte der Daimler-Chef.<p>Im Blick auf den R&uuml;ckzug des Staates und der Sozialversicherung aus bisherigen Leistungsversprechen konstatierte Schrempp die Notwendigkeit neuer Ans&auml;tze. Die Daimler-Benz AG sei dabei, ein neues Modell einer erfolgsorientierten Mitarbeiterbeteiligung zu entwickeln. Das System der Belegschaftsaktien sei erfolgreich - in diesem Jahr haben 87.000 Mitarbeiter Aktien von Daimler-Benz gekauft - , aber noch nicht ausreichend. Hier sei auch der Gesetzgeber gefordert, die notwendigen Vorarbeiten zu leisten. Bei der Absicherung der gro&szlig;en Lebensrisiken der Mitarbeiter werde man gezielt das Wissen im Konzern, z. B. bei der debis Assekuranz, einsetzen, damit die Mitarbeiter kosteng&uuml;nstig L&uuml;cken schlie&szlig;en k&ouml;nnten, die die Sparprogramme bei der Renten- und Krankenversicherung rei&szlig;en. Auch das Wissen der hochkar&auml;tigen  Anlagespezialisten der Treasury k&ouml;nnte genutzt werden f&uuml;r die Sparanlagen der Mitarbeiter. <p>Globalisierung sei nur dann eine Bedrohung, wenn die notwendigen Reformen unterblieben. Die deutschen Unternehmen seien l&auml;ngst von der B&ouml;rsenglocke wachgeklingelt, auch dies ein Effekt des Shareholder Value. In anderen Bereichen vermisse er noch die Reformf&auml;higkeit, betonte Schrempp. <p>Unsere Verantwortung als Unternehmer endet nicht am Fabriktor. Wir m&uuml;ssen aber auch sagen, wo die Reichweite unserer wirtschaftlichen M&ouml;glichkeiten endet. Unternehmen d&uuml;rfen nicht &uuml;berlastet werden, sonst k&ouml;nnen sie den Kern ihrer Aufgaben nicht mehr erf&uuml;llen. Wir engagieren uns f&uuml;r den Standort Deutschland. Schlie&szlig;lich lebt in Deutschland die Mehrzahl unserer Mitarbeiter. Wir wissen, da&szlig; das derzeitige Niveau von Wohlstand und Lebensqualit&auml;t in Deutschland nur zu erhalten ist, wenn wir uns international wettbewerbsf&auml;hig und profitabel positionieren. Wir wollen uns den Standort Deutschland weiter leisten k&ouml;nnen. Aber daf&uuml;r m&uuml;ssen wir mehr leisten als andere, forderte Schrempp abschlie&szlig;end. </TD></TR></TABLE></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><BR><IMG SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif" WIDTH="592" HEIGHT="16" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER" WIDTH="550"><H5><A HREF="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home&nbsp;]</I> </A><A HREF="../news_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Nachrichten&nbsp;]</I></A><A HREF="61107_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Weiter&nbsp;]</I> </A><A HREF="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Suche&nbsp;]</I></A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog&nbsp;]</I> </A><A HREF="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Hilfe&nbsp;]</I> </A></H5></TD></TR></TABLE></P><ADDRESS ALIGN=CENTER>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 15.11.1996</ADDRESS></BODY></HTML>

November 1996</I><BR>Daimler-Benz hat seinen Umsatz in allen Unternehmensbereichen sowie in den direkt gef&uuml;hrten Gesch&auml;ftsfeldern deutlich gesteigert und weist f&uuml;r die Monate Januar bis September 1996  ein Umsatzwachstum von 11 % auf 75,9 Mrd. DM aus. Aus heutiger Sicht wird das Konzernergebnis im zweiten Halbjahr - wie bereits Ende August berichtet - &uuml;ber dem des ersten Halbjahres liegen (Januar bis Juni 1996: Operating Profit von 827 Mill. DM).<p>Diese Entwicklung best&auml;tigt den Kurs der Fokussierung auf wachstumstr&auml;chtige und ergebnisstarke Bereiche, sagte J&uuml;rgen E. Schrempp, Vorstandsvorsitzender von Daimler-Benz.<p>Wie Daimler-Benz in seinem heute ver&ouml;ffentlichten Aktion&auml;rsbrief &uuml;ber die Neun-Monats-Periode 1996 weiter mitteilt, wurde bei Mercedes-Benz der Umsatz um 8 % auf knapp 57 Mrd. DM verbessert. Die Daimler-Benz Aerospace (Dasa) steigerte ihren Umsatz - auf vergleichbarer Basis gerechnet - um 18 % auf knapp 8,3 Mrd. DM. Die Daimler-Benz InterServices (debis) setzte ihr dynamisches Wachstum mit einem Plus von 14 % auf 9,8 Mrd. DM fort. <p>Im Umsatz zugelegt haben in der Berichtsperiode auch die von der Daimler-Benz AG direkt gef&uuml;hrten Gesch&auml;ftsfelder (Bahnsysteme/Adtranz, Mikroelektronik/ Temic, Dieselantriebe/MTU Friedrichshafen, Erkennungs- und Sortiersysteme/ Electrocom), die insgesamt einen Umsatz von 5,5 Mrd. DM erzielten.  <p>Diese Gesch&auml;ftsbelebung wird sich voraussichtlich auch im vierten Quartal fortsetzen, so da&szlig; Daimler-Benz f&uuml;r das Gesamtjahr einen Umsatz von &uuml;ber 105 Mrd. DM erwartet. Besonders positiv stimmt, da&szlig; Daimler-Benz diese kr&auml;ftigen Zuw&auml;chse trotz verhaltener Entwicklungstrends in zahlreichen Produktm&auml;rkten und Regionen durchsetzen konnte. Der Konzern steigerte seine Ums&auml;tze in nahezu allen Weltregionen.<p>Zum 30. September 1996 waren im Daimler-Benz-Konzern weltweit 290.031 Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter besch&auml;ftigt (vergleichbare Vorjahreszahl: 291.226), davon 223.106 (30. September 1995: 226.701) in Deutschland und 66.925 (30. September 1995: 64.525) im Ausland.<p>Der positive Gesch&auml;ftsverlauf bei Mercedes-Benz ist vor allem zur&uuml;ckzuf&uuml;hren auf neue, erfolgreiche Produkte und auf deutliche Produktivit&auml;tsfortschritte. Der Umsatz konnte auf 56,9 Mrd. DM gesteigert werden. In Deutschland nahm er &uuml;berdurchschnittlich um 11 % auf 22,6 Mrd. DM zu, aber auch im west-europ&auml;ischen Ausland (+18 %), in den USA (+11 %) und in Japan (+21 %) waren kr&auml;ftige Zuwachsraten zu verzeichnen. <p>W&auml;hrend bei Personenwagen die Ums&auml;tze um 16% stiegen, nahmen sie bei Nutzfahrzeugen leicht ab. Der Hintergrund daf&uuml;r ist die ung&uuml;nstige Marktsituation f&uuml;r Lkw in Deutschland und in wichtigen &Uuml;berseem&auml;rkten sowie der Modellwechsel im Segment der Schweren Klasse. Der weltweite Absatz von Nutzfahrzeugen nahm jedoch, im wesentlichen getragen vom Transporter-gesch&auml;ft, um 5% auf 248.600 Einheiten zu. <p>Die weltweite Mercedes-Benz-H&auml;ndlerorganisation hat in der Berichtsperiode 491.000 Personenwagen an Kunden verkauft. Der konsolidierte Absatz, der die Reduzierung des Bestandes im Vertriebsnetz nicht ber&uuml;cksichtigt, lag mit 481.300 Personenwagen um 13% h&ouml;her als in den ersten neun Monaten 1995.<p>Die gr&ouml;&szlig;ten Umsatzsteigerungen erzielte die Daimler-Benz Aerospace  (Dasa) in den Gesch&auml;ftsfeldern Antriebe (+48 %) und Raumfahrt (+51 %). In der Luftfahrt (+5 %) und im Gesch&auml;ftsfeld Verteidigung und Zivile Systeme (+3 %) nahmen die Verk&auml;ufe hingegen nur leicht zu. Der Auftragseingang liegt in den ersten neun Monaten 1996 mit 13,6 Mrd. DM um 89 % &uuml;ber dem Vorjahreswert. Die Zahl der bei Airbus bestellten Flugzeuge liegt mit 269 nach drei Quartalen so hoch wie in den letzten drei Jahren zusammen.<p>Die Dasa hat die Ma&szlig;nahmen zur Verbesserung der Ertragskraft konsequent fortgesetzt und damit auch die Abh&auml;ngigkeit ihres Ergebnisses von der Entwicklung des Dollarkurses weiter verringert.<p>Die dynamische Gesch&auml;ftsausweitung der Daimler-Benz InterServices (debis) wurde vor allem im Systemhaus (+14 %), bei Finanzdienstleistungen (+12 %) und Mobilfunkdiensten (+70 %) erzielt. Das Gesch&auml;ftsfeld Marketing Services wurde verselbst&auml;ndigt.<p>Bei Bahnsystemen betrug der auf Daimler-Benz entfallende Umsatzanteil des Gemeinschaftsunternehmens Adtranz 1,9 Mrd. DM. Der Auftragseingang von Januar bis September erreichte 2,1 Mrd. DM. Weitere Gro&szlig;auftr&auml;ge aus China, Singapur, der T&uuml;rkei und Thailand sind im Oktober eingegangen.<p>Die Mikroelektronik setzte von Januar bis September 1,8 Mrd. DM um (+11 %). Der Auftragseingang ging vor allem aufgrund der Schw&auml;che des Halbleitermarktes um 4 % auf 1,7 Mrd. DM zur&uuml;ck.<p>Das Gesch&auml;ftsfeld Dieselantriebe erh&ouml;hte die Erl&ouml;se um 13 % auf 1,1 Mrd. DM und den Auftragseingang um 14 % auf 1,2 Mrd. DM, vor allem in den zukunftstr&auml;chtigen Segmenten Dezentrale Energiesysteme und Kommerzielle Schiffe. <p>Die Erkennungs- und Sortiersysteme verdoppelten ihren Umsatz vor allem durch die Abrechnung von Gro&szlig;auftr&auml;gen mit der US-amerikanischen und der Deutschen Post auf 700 Mill. DM, der Auftragseingang lag erneut &uuml;ber dem Umsatz. </TD></TR></TABLE></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><BR><IMG SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif" WIDTH="592" HEIGHT="16" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER" WIDTH="550"><H5><A HREF="61107_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>English&nbsp;]</I> </A><A HREF="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home&nbsp;]</I> </A><A HREF="../news_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Nachrichten&nbsp;]</I></A><A HREF="61007_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Weiter&nbsp;]</I> </A><A HREF="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Suche&nbsp;]</I></A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog&nbsp;]</I> </A><A HREF="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Hilfe&nbsp;]</I> </A></H5></TD></TR></TABLE></P><ADDRESS ALIGN=CENTER>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 07.11.1996</ADDRESS></BODY></HTML>

<tr><td valign=top width=380>Daimler-Benz erwirtschaftete in den ersten neun Monaten 
1996 einen Umsatz von 75,9 Mrd. DM. Vergleichbar 
gerechnet, d. h. bereinigt um Ver&auml;nderungen im 
Konsolidierungskreis, wurde der Vorjahreswert um 11% 
&uuml;bertroffen. Zu der Gesch&auml;ftsausweitung, die in nahezu allen 
M&auml;rkten erzielt wurde, trugen s&auml;mtliche 
Unternehmensbereiche und die direkt gef&uuml;hrten 
Gesch&auml;ftsfelder bei. Hauptumsatztr&auml;ger blieb Mercedes-Benz 
mit knapp drei Viertel des Konzernumsatzes; 12% der Erl&ouml;se 
entfielen auf debis und 10% auf die Dasa. Die restlichen 7% 
verteilen sich auf die direkt gef&uuml;hrten Gesch&auml;ftsfelder 
Bahnsysteme, Mikroelektronik, Dieselantriebe sowie 
Erkennungs- und Sortiersysteme. Neben dem 
Umsatzwachstum hat sich auch die positive 
Ergebnisentwicklung des ersten Halbjahres weiter fortgesetzt.<p>Zum 30. September waren im Daimler-Benz-Konzern 
weltweit 290.031 Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter 
besch&auml;ftigt, davon knapp 11.000 (50%) bei dem zum 
Jahresbeginn 1996 zwischen Daimler-Benz und ABB 
gegr&uuml;ndeten Joint-venture Adtranz. Bei Mercedes-Benz, Dasa 
und in den Gesch&auml;ftsfeldern Mikroelektronik und 
Dieselantriebe verringerte sich der Belegschaftsstand 
gegen&uuml;ber Ende September 1995, w&auml;hrend er insbesondere 
bei debis deutlich anstieg.</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign=top width=380>Trotz der eher verhaltenen Entwicklung wichtiger 
Automobilm&auml;rkte hat sich der positive Gesch&auml;ftsverlauf bei 
Mercedes-Benz auch im dritten Quartal 1996 fortgesetzt. 
Neue erfolgreiche Produkte, aber auch deutliche Fortschritte 
in der Produktivit&auml;t und damit eine verbesserte 
Preis/Wert-Relation haben dazu beigetragen.<p>Insgesamt hat Mercedes-Benz seinen Umsatz um 8% auf 56,9 
Mrd. DM gesteigert. Mit einem Plus von 11% entwickelte sich 
das Gesch&auml;ftsvolumen in Deutschland &uuml;berdurchschnittlich und 
nahm auf 22,6 Mrd. DM zu. Aber auch im westeurop&auml;ischen 
Ausland, in den USA und in Japan stiegen die Erl&ouml;se kr&auml;ftig. 
Tr&auml;ger des Wachstums waren die Personenwagen, deren 
Erl&ouml;se um 16% zulegten. Bei den Nutzfahrzeugen hingegen lag 
der Umsatz leicht unter dem hohen Vorjahresniveau; dies ist 
vor allem auf die ung&uuml;nstige Marktsituation f&uuml;r Lkw in 
Deutschland und wichtigen &Uuml;berseem&auml;rkten sowie den 
Modellwechsel in der Schweren Klasse zur&uuml;ckzuf&uuml;hren. </p>
<p>Bei Personenwagen waren die ersten neun Monate des Jahres 
1996 von der Mercedes-Benz Produktoffensive gepr&auml;gt. Die 
T-Modelle der C- und E-Klasse, der Roadster SLK sowie 
die Gro&szlig;raumlimousine der V-Klasse stie&szlig;en bei unseren 
Kunden durchweg auf eine sehr positive Resonanz. Mit 
481.300 Personenwagen (einschlie&szlig;lich Gel&auml;ndewagen) setzte 
der Pkw-Bereich weltweit 13% mehr Fahrzeuge ab als im 
Vergleichszeitraum des Vorjahres. Besonders erfreulich war 
die Entwicklung in Deutschland; hier konnte Mercedes-Benz 
die Neuzulassungen um 17% steigern und seinen Marktanteil 
ausbauen. Im Ausland wurde mit fast 280.000 abgesetzten 
Personenwagen die bisherige H&ouml;chstmarke von 1995 
nochmals um 10% &uuml;bertroffen. Allein in Japan legte der 
Absatz um 45% zu; aber auch im stagnierenden 
US-amerikanischen Markt konnten die Verk&auml;ufe um 20% 
gesteigert werden. Starke Zuw&auml;chse wurden auch in wichtigen 
europ&auml;ischen M&auml;rkten verbucht. Damit haben Mercedes-Benz 
Personenwagen ihre Wettbewerbsposition insbesondere in 
den Triadem&auml;rkten weiter ausgebaut. </p>
<p>W&auml;hrend die Verk&auml;ufe der S-Klasse vor allem wegen 
ver&auml;nderter steuerlicher Regelungen f&uuml;r Dienstwagen in 
Deutschland unter dem Vorjahreswert blieben, war die 
Absatzentwicklung der E-Klasse &auml;u&szlig;erst positiv; die C-Klasse 
behauptete ihre gute Marktposition. Aufgrund der guten 
Absatzsituation wurde die Produktion um 10% auf fast 
485.000 Personenwagen angehoben. </p>
<p>Mit weltweit 248.600 Einheiten konnte Mercedes-Benz den 
Absatz von Nutzfahrzeugen gegen&uuml;ber den ersten neun 
Monaten des Vorjahres um 5% steigern. Dazu hat die 
Mercedes-Benz Produktoffensive ma&szlig;geblich beigetragen. So 
konnte mit den erfolgreichen Transportern Sprinter und Vito 
die Marktposition in Westeuropa deutlich ausgebaut werden. 
Vor allem im westeurop&auml;ischen Ausland (+46%), aber auch 
im deutschen Transportermarkt (+8%), der insgesamt 
r&uuml;ckl&auml;ufig war, sind die Neuzulassungen von Mercedes-Benz 
erfreulich gestiegen. Weltweit lag der Absatz bei 105.000 
Transportern und damit um 29% h&ouml;her als im 
Vorjahreszeitraum. Der neue Schwer-Lkw Actros fand bei 
unseren Kunden in Westeuropa ein sehr positives Echo, was 
auch durch die Entwicklung der Auftragseing&auml;nge best&auml;tigt 
wird. Aufgrund der schwierigen Verh&auml;ltnisse in wichtigen 
M&auml;rkten und des erst im Oktober vollzogenen 
Modellwechsels bei der Schweren Klasse hat der 
Lkw-Absatz jedoch insbesondere in Westeuropa das 
Vorjahresniveau nicht erreicht. Zwar erh&ouml;hten sich die 
Neuzulassungen von Mercedes-Benz Lkw &uuml;ber 6&#160;t im 
westeurop&auml;ischen Ausland um 5% auf 21.700 Einheiten, die 
schwache Marktverfassung f&uuml;hrte jedoch in Deutschland zu 
einem R&uuml;ckgang um 11% auf 23.100 Fahrzeuge. Die EvoBus 
GmbH konnte mit den Marken Mercedes-Benz und Setra 
trotz des preis- und wettbewerbsintensiven Umfelds weltweit 
4.700 Komplettbusse und Fahrgestelle (+12%) absetzen. Das 
Unimoggesch&auml;ft hat durch einen Gro&szlig;auftrag &uuml;ber 540 
Einheiten neue Impulse erhalten. </p>
<p>Die Gesellschaften in &Uuml;bersee setzten insgesamt 98.000 (i.&#160;V. 
102.400) Nutzfahrzeuge ab. W&auml;hrend der Absatz bei 
Mercedes-Benz do Brasil aufgrund der Schw&auml;che des 
Gesamtmarkts um 24% auf 28.800 Einheiten nachgab, stieg er 
bei Mercedes-Benz Argentina um 69% auf 5.400 Einheiten. 
Aufgrund der hohen Auftragsbest&auml;nde konnte Freightliner 
&#150;&#160;trotz der zyklischen Abschw&auml;chung des nordamerikanischen 
Marktes f&uuml;r schwere Lkw &#150;&#160;seinen Absatz nochmals um 4% 
auf 59.000 Einheiten steigern. Bei Mercedes-Benz Mexico 
erh&ouml;hte sich der Absatz gegen&uuml;ber dem sehr schwachen 
Vorjahr um 43% auf 1.600 Fahrzeuge. </p>
<p>In den ersten neun Monaten 1996 lag die 
Nutzfahrzeugproduktion von Mercedes-Benz mit 246.100 
Einheiten insgesamt leicht unter dem Vorjahresniveau. 
154.900 Fahrzeuge wurden in Europa und 91.200 Einheiten in 
den Werken in &Uuml;bersee gefertigt. </p>

<tr><td valign=top width=380>Die Dasa setzte im Verlauf des Jahres 1996 ihre Ma&szlig;nahmen 
zur Verbesserung der Ertragskraft konsequent fort. Bei der 
Daimler-Benz Aerospace Airbus GmbH konnte Ende August, 
wie schon zuvor in den anderen Gesch&auml;ftsfeldern, zwischen 
der Unternehmensleitung und den Arbeitnehmervertretern eine 
Einigung &uuml;ber nachhaltige Kostenreduzierungen erzielt werden. 
Damit ist die Dasa dabei, auch die Abh&auml;ngigkeit vom 
US-Dollar weiter zu verringern.<p>Der Umsatz des Unternehmensbereichs stieg im Zeitraum 
Januar bis September 1996 gegen&uuml;ber dem Vorjahreswert 
vergleichbar gerechnet um 18% auf 8,3 Mrd. DM. Dieser 
Zuwachs wurde entscheidend vom Gesch&auml;ftsfeld Antriebe 
(+48%) getragen, das neben der allgemeinen 
Gesch&auml;ftsbelebung auch gr&ouml;&szlig;ere Abrechnungen von 
Triebwerken verzeichnen konnte, sowie von der Raumfahrt 
(+51%), wo die Projekte XMM (X-Ray Multi Mirror 
Mission) und Envisat zu einem deutlich h&ouml;heren Umsatz 
f&uuml;hrten. Demgegen&uuml;ber nahm das Gesch&auml;ftsvolumen in der 
Luftfahrt (+5%) sowie im Gesch&auml;ftsfeld Verteidigung und 
Zivile Systeme (+3%) nur leicht zu. Aufgrund der deutlich 
gestiegenen Lieferungen von Triebwerkskomponenten erh&ouml;hte 
sich der in den USA erzielte Umsatz kr&auml;ftig um 37%. In 
Deutschland (+11%), den Partnerl&auml;ndern der EU (+18%) und 
den &uuml;brigen M&auml;rkten (+13%) war ebenfalls ein erfreulicher 
Anstieg zu verzeichnen.</p>
<p>Die gro&szlig;e Nachfrage nach Airbus-Flugzeugen und Antrieben 
sowie mehrere Gro&szlig;auftr&auml;ge f&uuml;r das Gesch&auml;ftsfeld Raumfahrt 
lie&szlig;en den Auftragseingang bei der Dasa um 89% auf 13,6 
Mrd. DM ansteigen. Allein bei Airbus lagen die Bestellungen 
in den ersten neun Monaten mit 269 Flugzeugen so hoch wie 
in den letzten drei Jahren zusammen. Im Gesch&auml;ftsfeld 
Verteidigung und Zivile Systeme erh&ouml;hte sich der 
Auftragseingang insbesondere in den Arbeitsgebieten 
F&uuml;hrungs- und Informationssysteme, Ausr&uuml;stung f&uuml;r 
Krisenreaktionskr&auml;fte sowie Nortel Dasa Network Systems.</p>

<tr><td valign=top width=380>Die Daimler-Benz InterServices (debis) setzte ihr dynamisches 
Wachstum mit einem zweistelligen Umsatzanstieg fort. Im 
Rahmen der Konzentration auf die Kernaktivit&auml;ten wurde das 
Gesch&auml;ftsfeld Marketing Services verselbst&auml;ndigt.<p>Zu der Gesch&auml;ftsausweitung um 14% auf 9,8 Mrd. DM trugen 
insbesondere die Gesch&auml;ftsfelder Systemhaus, 
Finanzdienstleistungen sowie Telekommunikations- und 
Mediendienste bei. Das Systemhaus erzielte ein Plus von 14% 
auf 1,7 Mrd. DM; wesentlichen Anteil daran hatten die 
Gesch&auml;ftseinheit Computer-Communication-Services wie auch 
die Software-Bereiche. Die Finanzdienstleistungen erbrachten 
mit 6,3 Mrd. DM den Hauptbeitrag zum Umsatz der debis; 
der Vorjahreswert wurde damit um 12% &uuml;bertroffen. Im 
Gesch&auml;ftsfeld Telekommunikations- und Mediendienste war 
bei den Mobilfunkdiensten erneut ein besonders starkes 
Wachstum zu verzeichnen (+70%). Die Gesch&auml;ftsfelder 
Versicherungen und Immobilienmanagement entwickeln sich 
kontinuierlich und bauen ihre Marktposition sukzessive aus. </p>

<tr><td valign=top width=380>Im Gesch&auml;ftsfeld Bahnsysteme betrug der anteilige Umsatz des 
Gemeinschaftsunternehmens ABB Daimler-Benz 
Transportation (Adtranz) 1,9 Mrd. DM. Die Auftragseing&auml;nge 
erreichten 2,1 Mrd. DM; weitere Gro&szlig;auftr&auml;ge aus China, 
Singapur, der T&uuml;rkei und Thailand sind im Oktober 
eingegangen.<p>In der Mikroelektronik lag der Umsatz in den ersten neun 
Monaten 1996 mit 1,8 Mrd. DM um 11% &uuml;ber dem 
vergleichbaren Vorjahreswert. Dabei stiegen die Erl&ouml;se 
insbesondere in den Bereichen Kfz-Elektronik (+26%) und 
Gasgeneratoren (+21%); die Bereiche Halbleiter und 
Mikrosysteme erzielten noch einen leichten Zuwachs von 
jeweils 3%. Der Auftragseingang konnte den Vorjahreswert 
nicht erreichen (-4%); hier machte sich vor allem die 
Schw&auml;che des Halbleitermarkts bemerkbar.</p>
<p>Im Gesch&auml;ftsfeld Dieselantriebe stiegen Umsatzerl&ouml;se und 
Auftragseingang um 13 bzw. 14%. Dies war im wesentlichen 
auf den verst&auml;rkten Ausbau der zukunftstr&auml;chtigen 
Gesch&auml;ftssegmente Dezentrale Energiesysteme und 
Kommerzielle Schiffe zur&uuml;ckzuf&uuml;hren. Aber auch bei 
Antrieben f&uuml;r Marineschiffe und Milit&auml;rische Fahrzeuge lag das 
Gesch&auml;ftsvolumen &uuml;ber dem Vorjahresniveau.</p>
<p>Bei Erkennungs- und Sortiersystemen f&uuml;hrte die Abrechnung 
von Gro&szlig;auftr&auml;gen, vor allem mit der US-amerikanischen und 
der Deutschen Post, zu einer Umsatzverdoppelung. Der 
Auftragseingang lag erneut &uuml;ber dem Umsatz; dar&uuml;ber hinaus 
werden im vierten Quartal 1996 noch umfangreiche Auftr&auml;ge 
erwartet.</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign=top width=380>Die in den ersten neun Monaten des Jahres 1996 erzielte 
Gesch&auml;ftsbelebung wird sich voraussichtlich auch im letzten 
Quartal fortsetzen. F&uuml;r das Gesamtjahr rechnen wir deshalb 
mit einem Gesch&auml;ftsvolumen von &uuml;ber 105 Mrd. DM &#150;&#160;ein 
deutlicher Anstieg gegen&uuml;ber dem um Ver&auml;nderungen im 
Konsolidierungskreis bereinigten Wert von 96,9 Mrd. DM im 
Vorjahr. Der Zuwachs wird von allen Unternehmensbereichen 
und den direkt gef&uuml;hrten Gesch&auml;ftsfeldern getragen. <p>Im Pkw-Bereich von Mercedes-Benz soll erstmals ein Absatz 
von deutlich &uuml;ber 600.000 Fahrzeugen erreicht werden. 
Aufgrund des Erfolgs der neuen Transporter in Westeuropa 
wird auch der Nutzfahrzeugabsatz den im Vorjahr erreichten 
H&ouml;chststand von 320.000 Einheiten erneut &uuml;bertreffen. Dem 
schwierigen Lkw-Gesch&auml;ft in Westeuropa d&uuml;rfte der neu 
eingef&uuml;hrte Actros im vierten Quartal neue Impulse geben.</p>
<p>Bereinigt um strukturelle Ver&auml;nderungen erwartet die Dasa f&uuml;r 
das laufende Jahr eine Belebung des Gesch&auml;fts vor allem im 
zivilen Sektor.</p>
<p>Durch die gute Auftragslage sowohl bei der debis als auch bei 
den direkt gef&uuml;hrten Gesch&auml;ftsfeldern rechnen wir hier 
insgesamt mit zweistelligen Erl&ouml;ssteigerungen f&uuml;r 1996.</p>
<p>Aufgrund der deutlichen Produktivit&auml;tsfortschritte, die wir in 
verschiedenen Bereichen des Daimler-Benz-Konzerns 
realisiert haben, und der wieder g&uuml;nstigeren 
Wechselkursrelationen wird das h&ouml;here Gesch&auml;ftsvolumen in 
fast allen Gesch&auml;ftsfeldern von einer positiven 
Ergebnisentwicklung begleitet. In den Gesch&auml;ftsfeldern Lkw 
Westeuropa und Mikroelektronik haben wir 
ergebnisverbessernde Ma&szlig;nahmen eingeleitet, die ab dem 
Gesch&auml;ftsjahr 1997 zur Geltung kommen werden. Wir gehen 
unver&auml;ndert davon aus, da&szlig; sich das Konzernergebnis im 
zweiten Halbjahr 1996 weiter verbessern wird.</p>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren!</FONT>
<p>

1995 war in der &uuml;ber 100j&auml;hrigen Geschichte von Daimler-Benz ein &uuml;ber alle Ma&szlig;en dramatisches Jahr. Der Vorstand, der in dieser Konstellation seit Mai 1995 das Unternehmen f&uuml;hrt, entschlo&szlig; sich zu einer Z&auml;sur. Wir haben Entscheidungen getroffen, die Daimler-Benz wieder zu jener Ertragsst&auml;rke f&uuml;hren werden, die den hervorragenden Ruf unseres Unternehmens begr&uuml;ndet hat.
<p>

Unser vorrangiges Ziel war es, Verlustquellen zu schlie&szlig;en. Der Vorstand hat daher das Portfolio des Konzerns unter strengen Renditekriterien analysiert und konsequent dort gestrafft, wo dringender Handlungsbedarf bestand. Gleicherma&szlig;en haben wir uns auch von Gesch&auml;ftsfeldern getrennt, in denen weitere Investitionen f&uuml;r uns nicht l&auml;nger wirtschaftlich sinnvoll waren.
<p>

Ihr Unternehmen, Daimler-Benz, pr&auml;sentiert sich nach diesen Entscheidungen mit einem konzentrierteren Konzernprofil, das auf 28 nach vormals 35 Gesch&auml;ftsfelder ausgerichtet ist. Dieser Proze&szlig; ist noch nicht abgeschlossen. Mit diesem Handeln haben wir auch gesch&auml;ftspolitische Entscheidungen, die in Vorperioden getroffen wurden, in Frage gestellt und teilweise zur&uuml;ckgenommen. Gravierende Ver&auml;nderungen der exogenen Faktoren haben uns dazu gezwungen. Die Entscheidungen waren notwendig, um den Daimler-Benz-<wbr>Konzern binnen kurzem auf ein -international- akzeptables Renditeniveau zur&uuml;ckzuf&uuml;hren.
<p>

Der Vorstand orientiert sich in erster Linie daran, Ihnen, den Anteilseignern der Daimler-Benz AG, attraktive Renditeaussichten zu bieten. Wir haben uns daran gehalten, Ihnen stets mit Offenheit selbst bei sensiblen Entscheidungen und mit schnellstm&ouml;glicher Information Transparenz zur Einsch&auml;tzung unseres Kurses zu bieten.
<p>

Dazu z&auml;hlt auch, da&szlig; wir Ende Juni 1995 &ouml;ffentlich unsere Gewinn- in eine Verlusterwartung &auml;ndern mu&szlig;ten, nachdem deutlich geworden war, da&szlig; die Abwertung des Dollar, die uns besonders im Flugzeuggesch&auml;ft trifft, -entgegen bis dahin &uuml;berwiegender Erwartungen- nicht nur vor&uuml;bergehender Natur ist. Auch die gewaltigen Verschiebungen innerhalb der europ&auml;ischen W&auml;hrungen beeintr&auml;chtigten 1995 unsere Ertragssituation. F&uuml;r uns als international agierendes Unternehmen zeigt sich hier &uuml;berdeutlich die Notwendigkeit einer europ&auml;ischen W&auml;hrungsunion, selbst dann, wenn anfangs nur einige Staaten die Vorausetzungen erf&uuml;llen.
<p>

Mitte September 1995 haben wir anl&auml;&szlig;lich der Vorlage des Halbjahresergebnisses in New York angek&uuml;ndigt, da&szlig; der Vorstand f&uuml;r zwei gro&szlig;e Verlustquellen, die AEG Daimler-Benz Industrie und den Luftfahrtbereich, insbesondere den holl&auml;ndischen Flugzeughersteller Fokker, schnellstm&ouml;glich grundlegende L&ouml;sungen einleiten wird. Bereits im Oktober informierten wir Sie &uuml;ber Verhandlungen zur Bereinigung der Probleme der AEG Daimler-Benz Industrie. Mitte November gaben wir die endg&uuml;ltige Entscheidung der Dasa-Wettbewerbsinitiative bekannt, nach deren Umsetzung alle Dasa-Bereiche auch bei einem langfristig niedrigen Dollarkurs von 1,35 D-Mark profitabel sein werden.
<p>

Am 17. Januar 1996 wurde die Neuordnung der AEG-Gesch&auml;fte entschieden, die noch im Jahr 1996 zu einer Verschmelzung der AEG Aktiengesellschaft auf die Daimler-Benz AG f&uuml;hren soll. Schlie&szlig;lich beendeten wir am 22. Januar die finanzielle Unterst&uuml;tzung f&uuml;r Fokker, nachdem der weitere Gro&szlig;aktion&auml;r, die niederl&auml;ndische Regierung, auch nach siebenmonatigen Verhandlungen nicht bereit war, einen angemessenen Beitrag zur Sanierung zu leisten. Angesichts unserer 40-Prozent-Beteiligung f&uuml;r Fokker war es im Interesse unserer Aktion&auml;re nicht l&auml;nger zu akzeptieren, weiterhin allein das gesamte Risiko zu tragen. Am 15. M&auml;rz dieses Jahres meldete Fokker Konkurs an.
<p>

Ebenfalls entschieden haben wir die unternehmerische Neustrukturierung unseres Engagements bei dem franz&ouml;sischen Softwarehaus Cap Gemini Sogeti. Mit gr&ouml;&szlig;erem Einflu&szlig; werden wir gemeinsam mit dem debis Systemhaus die Internationalisierung des Gesch&auml;fts mit der Informationstechnologie umsetzen.
<p>

Wir haben damit alle Themen entschieden, die wir im September als vordringlich pr&auml;sentiert hatten. Im Abschlu&szlig; des Jahres 1995 schlagen sich diese Bereinigungen als au&szlig;erordentliche Belastungen und Sondereinfl&uuml;sse in H&ouml;he von 5,1 Milliarden D-Mark nieder, die teilweise in Form von Strukturaufwand auch das Ergebnis der betrieblichen T&auml;tigkeit beeintr&auml;chtigen. Dabei sind die dar&uuml;ber hinaus im Flugzeuggesch&auml;ft gebildeten Drohverlustr&uuml;ckstellungen hier nicht eingerechnet. Der Vorstand ist &uuml;berzeugt, damit die Voraussetzungen geschaffen zu haben, um den Konzern schnellstm&ouml;glich wieder auf Erfolgskurs zu bringen.
<p>

Aufgrund der genannten Faktoren gibt der Jahresfehlbetrag von 5,7 Milliarden D-Mark im Konzernabschlu&szlig; nicht jene Fortschritte wieder, welche die Unternehmensbereiche des Konzerns im vergangenen Jahr durch zahlreiche neue und erfolgreiche Produkte und Dienstleistungen, durch weitere Rationalisierungen und vor allem durch zunehmende Internationalisierung, mit der die Wertsch&ouml;pfung auf zukunftstr&auml;chtige M&auml;rkte ausgeweitet werden soll, verzeichnen k&ouml;nnen. Mercedes-Benz hat hier Ma&szlig;st&auml;be gesetzt.
<p>

Trotz der operativen Verbesserung -bereits im zweiten Halbjahr verzeichneten wir im Ergebnis der betrieblichen T&auml;tigkeit wieder schwarze Zahlen- sowie einer unver&auml;ndert hohen Substanz des Unternehmens haben Aufsichtsrat und Vorstand der Hauptversammlung empfohlen, f&uuml;r das Gesch&auml;ftsjahr 1995 keine Dividende auszusch&uuml;tten.
<p>

Entscheidender Gradmesser f&uuml;r unsere Managementleistung ist jedoch der Aktienkurs. Nicht die kurzfristige Gewinnmaximierung ist das Ziel, sondern die mittel- und langfristige Sicherung einer hohen Ertragskraft.
<p>

So werden Sie in diesem Gesch&auml;ftsbericht lesen k&ouml;nnen, da&szlig; trotz des Kraftaktes unsere Investitionen 1995 deutlich &uuml;ber denen der Vorjahre liegen. Wir haben dort, wo wir positive Ergebnisse erwarten, die Standorte im In- wie im Ausland weiter ausgebaut oder neue er&ouml;ffnet. Wir haben die Forschungsausgaben auf hohem Niveau beibehalten, um auch in Zukunft Vorreiter mit wegweisenden Innovationen und Weiterentwicklungen in unseren M&auml;rkten zu sein.
<p>

Basis unseres Erfolgs sind aber unsere Mitarbeiter, ihre Motivation, sich f&uuml;r unsere ehrgeizigen Ziele einzusetzen, nicht zuletzt auch ihre Entfaltungsm&ouml;glichkeiten. Gew&auml;hrleistet wird dies auch mit neuen und effizienteren Strukturen in der Konzernzentrale, die wir seit Juni 1995 eingef&uuml;hrt haben. Verantwortung wird noch deutlicher als bisher auf jene Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter &uuml;bertragen, welche die N&auml;he zum operativen Gesch&auml;ft besitzen. Nur so, in flachen Hierarchien, dezentral und in flexiblen Einheiten organisiert, wird jener unternehmerische Tatendrang freigesetzt, in der sich die Kultur des Unternehmens entwickeln kann. Dazu z&auml;hlt auch die Einf&uuml;hrung von leistungsbezogener Bezahlung sowie neue Steuerungsgr&ouml;&szlig;en, die das Unternehmensergebnis direkt an den nach US-Standards erstellten Kenngr&ouml;&szlig;en messen. In allen Teilen des Konzerns werden diese Reformen vorangetrieben.
<p>

F&uuml;r viele Mitarbeiter ist dies eine Herausforderung, f&uuml;r manche aber ein schmerzhafter Proze&szlig;, vor allem dann, wenn Effizienzsteigerung und Rationalisierung den Wegfall ihres Arbeitsplatzes bedeutet. Doch nicht nur wir bei Daimler-Benz mu&szlig;ten lernen, da&szlig; ein Festhalten an &uuml;berkommenen Traditionen langfristig in die Sackgasse f&uuml;hrt. Unsere Sozialstrukturen, unsere Arbeits- und Produktionsmethoden, unsere Kostenbasis m&uuml;ssen sich in Zukunft noch viel konsequenter an denen von wettbewerbsf&auml;higen internationalen Konkurrenten messen.
<p>

Wir m&uuml;ssen deshalb vorbehaltlos und mit gro&szlig;er Kreativit&auml;t neue Strukturen und Formen der Zusammenarbeit schaffen. Wir m&uuml;ssen den Standort Deutschland mit allen uns zur Verf&uuml;gung stehenden Mitteln und Argumenten attraktiv und international wettbewerbsf&auml;hig gestalten. Besonders an der Bereitschaft zu einer solchen Dynamik m&uuml;ssen sich die Verantwortlichen in Deutschland, mu&szlig; sich die gesellschaftspolitische Verantwortung der Unternehmer messen.
<p>

Wenn wir vor diesem Hintergrund aus W&auml;hrungs- oder Marktgr&uuml;nden Produktionsentscheidungen f&uuml;r das Ausland treffen, dann ist dies keine Absage an den Standort. Wir erhalten dadurch vielmehr Arbeitspl&auml;tze f&uuml;r die Zulieferung hochwertiger Komponenten an diese ausl&auml;ndische Produktion.
<p>

Wir, der Vorstand von Daimler-Benz, werden uns dieser Verantwortung stellen. Dies zeigen Verhandlungsergebnisse zwischen Management und Arbeitnehmern 1995 und auch in den vergangenen Wochen, in denen Vereinbarungen auf betrieblicher Ebene, einige von vielen notwendigen B&uuml;ndnissen f&uuml;r Arbeit, den Standort Deutschland sichern. Den daf&uuml;r notwendigen Pioniergeist und die Entschlossenheit zu neuen Wegen werden wir auch in 1996 beweisen.
<p>

Die Weichen, die wir gestellt haben, werden das Unternehmen in diesem Jahr in die Gewinnzone zur&uuml;ckf&uuml;hren. Unser Ziel ist jedoch, Ihre berechtigten Erwartungen, unsere ehrgeizigen Ziele zu befriedigen. Deshalb werden wir Ihnen auch in den kommenden Monaten &uuml;ber weitere einschneidende Ma&szlig;nahmen berichten. Gleicherma&szlig;en wollen wir ebenso selbstbewu&szlig;t Gesch&auml;fte aufbauen, die unseren Ergebnis- und Renditeanspruch erf&uuml;llen. Wir sind &uuml;berzeugt, da&szlig; wir uns mit dieser Neuausrichtung auf dem richtigen 
Kurs befinden.

<TD VALIGN=TOP align=right width=275>Daimler-Benz erzielte im Jahr 1995 einen Konzern-Umsatz von 103,5 Mrd. DM. Der Anstieg gegen&uuml;ber dem vergleichbaren Vorjahreswert um 1% war im wesentlichen auf die insgesamt g&uuml;nstige Gesch&auml;ftsentwicklung bei Mercedes-Benz zur&uuml;ckzuf&uuml;hren. Mit dem Ziel, die Ertragskraft des Unternehmens nachhaltig zu verbessern, haben wir in der zweiten Jahresh&auml;lfte alle Gesch&auml;ftsaktivit&auml;ten &uuml;berpr&uuml;ft und neu geordnet. Insbesondere bei der AEG Daimler-Benz Industrie und der Dasa wurden<br> 
<TD width=20>
<TD VALIGN=TOP align=left width=275>einschneidende Strukturma&szlig;nahmen eingeleitet, um die Verlustquellen zu beseitigen, die in den letzten Jahren die Ergebnisentwicklung des Unternehmens empfindlich beeintr&auml;chtigt haben. Das negative Konzernergebnis in H&ouml;he von 5,7 Mrd. DM ist durch Einmalaufwendungen im Zusammenhang mit der Straffung des Konzernportfolios gepr&auml;gt. Diese mu&szlig;ten aufgrund der jetzt getroffenen Entscheidungen bilanziell im Abschlu&szlig; des Jahres 1995 ber&uuml;cksichtigt werden.<br>

Dezember 1996</i><br>Der Name ist bereits Programm. Computer Aided Design (CAD, auf deutsch: computerunterst&uuml;tzter Entwurf) ist quasi das Rei&szlig;brett der Neuzeit. Modellzeichnungen entstehen durch Mausklick am Computerbildschirm und nicht mehr mit Lineal und Bleistift auf Papier.<p>Daimler-Benz-Forscher haben ein Computerprogramm entwickelt, das produktrelevante Computer Aided Design (CAD)-Daten innerhalb von Sekunden in eine dreidimensionale, ver&auml;nderbare Ansicht umsetzt. Diese Grundlage f&uuml;r Einbauuntersuchungen sowie f&uuml;r Abstands- und Ma&szlig;informationen erleichtert die Entwicklung neuer Produkte.<p>F&uuml;r die Arbeit mit der Software flie&szlig;en alle CAD-Originaldaten eines Bauteils in den Rechner ein, unabh&auml;ngig welcher Herkunft sie sind. Das Programm kann Daten von verschiedenen CAD-Systemen mischen und gleichzeitig in ein Bild umsetzen. Die Ansicht des CAD-Modells l&auml;&szlig;t sich in Echtzeit - das hei&szlig;t ohne Zeitverz&ouml;gerung durch die daf&uuml;r notwendigen Rechenschritte - drehen oder anderweitig ver&auml;ndern. So kann man Schnittebenen durch das Bauteil legen, einzelne Teile herausziehen, Explosionszeichnungen erzeugen oder sogar durch das Modell "hindurchfliegen".<p>F&uuml;r die Datendarstellung innerhalb des Computerprogramms w&auml;hlten die Forscher zwei Modelle, um die Ver&auml;nderungen des Objekts in Echtzeit zu erm&ouml;glichen. Das sogenannte Advanced Brep Modell greift auf alle eingelesenen Daten zur&uuml;ck, w&auml;hrend das Facettenmodell f&uuml;r die Bildschirmansicht einen wesentlich kleineren Datensatz ben&ouml;tigt. Zu jedem Zeitpunkt besteht zwischen der einzelnen Facette und dem genauen Brepmodell eine Verbindung, so da&szlig; die zum Drehen oder Ver&auml;ndern des Modells notwendigen Berechnungen stets auf dem genauen Brep-Modell beruhen.<p>Computer Aided Design (CAD) macht den Bau von verkleinerten Modellen bei der Entwicklung neuer Produkte &uuml;berfl&uuml;ssig. Denn mit Hilfe von CAD-Daten lassen sich die Objekte dreidimensional auf dem Bildschirm darstellen. Mit der Entwicklung der CAD-Software tun die Daimler-Benz-Forscher ein &uuml;briges, um diesen Proze&szlig; weiter zu beschleunigen.<p><br></table><img width=592 height=16 src="../../lines/db_592.gif"><p><table><td align=center width=550><h5><a href="61230_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>English</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Home</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../news_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Forschung &amp; Technik</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="61223_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Weiter</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Suche</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Dialog</i>&nbsp;]</a>   <a href="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Hilfe</i>&nbsp;]</a></h5></table><address>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 30.12.1996</address><p></center></body></html>

Dezember 1996</i><br>F&uuml;r herausragende Erfolge im Ressort Forschung und Technik verleiht der Daimler-Benz-Konzern im Jahr 1996 zum dritten Mal seinen Forschungspreis. Die Jury zeichnete in diesem Jahr gleich zwei Verfahren mit einem ersten Preis aus. Forschungsvorstand Prof. Dr. Hartmut Weule hat den Preistr&auml;gern die Auszeichnung am Mittwoch, dem 18. Dezember 1996, in einer Feierstunde &uuml;berreicht. Der mit insgesamt 60.000 DM dotierte Preis wird j&auml;hrlich verliehen, um Spitzenleistungen im Ressort Forschung und Technik zu honorieren. <p>Das erste Preistr&auml;ger-Team bilden Henning Neef, Robert Schneider, Dr. Josef Wenger und Dr. Gerd Wanielik vom Daimler-Benz-Forschungszentrum Ulm. Sie entwickelten ein neues Radarsystem f&uuml;r den Stra&szlig;enverkehr. Das System liefert dreidimensionale Bildinformationen &uuml;ber den umgebenden Fahrzeugverkehr und erm&ouml;glicht es sogar, durch vorausfahrende Fahrzeuge "hindurchzusehen". Ein Computer wertet die erhaltenen Daten aus; Ziel ist die automatische Interpretation von Verkehrssituationen.<p>Das Einsatzgebiet dieser Technik beschr&auml;nkt sich nicht auf den Stra&szlig;enverkehr. Sie k&ouml;nnte auf Flugh&auml;fen Fahrten auf den Rollbahnen sicherer machen oder als Man&ouml;vrierhilfe bei Schiffen dienen. In der Bahntechnik k&ouml;nnte sie zur Strecken&uuml;berwachung und f&uuml;r Koppelvorg&auml;nge eingesetzt werden. Auch bei fahrerlosen Transportsystemen oder beim Container-Umschlag auf Bahnh&ouml;fen sind Anwendungen denkbar.<p>Ebenfalls einen ersten Preis erhalten Michele Melchiorre und Ralf Jakob vom Forschungszentrum Ulm f&uuml;r Konzeption und Aufbau einer neuartigen Elektronikschrott-Recyclinganlage. Auf rein mechanischem Weg gewinnen die Forscher aus alten Elektronik-Bauteilen und Platinen sortenrein und hochwirtschaftlich wertvolle Metallanteile zur&uuml;ck - mit wesentlich besseren Ergebnissen als bei s&auml;mtlichen bisherigen Verfahren. Die Wissenschaftler legten neben einer deutlichen Verringerung der Emissionen beim Recyclingproze&szlig; vor allem Wert auf eine h&ouml;here Reinheit der zur&uuml;ckgewonnenen Metalle, um Schadstoffemissionen bei der Verh&uuml;ttung der Metalle zu minimieren. <p>Ein wesentlicher Vorteil dieses Verfahrens ist die M&ouml;glichkeit, unter bestimmten Voraussetzungen auch feinste Reststoff-St&auml;ube zu trennen. W&auml;hrend die bisherigen Verfahren bei einer Korngr&ouml;&szlig;e unter einem Millimeter passen m&uuml;ssen, trennt die von der Daimler-Benz-Forschung entwickelte Anlage noch Partikel mit Korngr&ouml;&szlig;en unter einem Zehntel Millimeter. St&auml;ube, die bei anderen Verfahren als Sonderm&uuml;ll anfallen, k&ouml;nnen also mit dieser Anlage noch wertvolle Edelmetalle liefern. <p><br></table><img width=592 height=16 src="../../lines/db_592.gif"><p><table><td align=center width=550><h5><a href="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Home</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../news_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Forschung &amp; Technik</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="61217_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Weiter</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Suche</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Dialog</i>&nbsp;]</a>   <a href="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Hilfe</i>&nbsp;]</a></h5></table><address>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 18.12.1996</address><p></center></body></html>

        <td valign="top" width="380">Seit f&uuml;nf Jahren besteht
        das &quot;Belm-Projekt&quot; im Amazonasdelta, ein
        Forschungsvorhaben mit sozialer, &ouml;kologischer und
        &ouml;konomischer Komponente. <p><b>Geschichte</b></p>
        <p>Im Jahr 1991 sind die Universit&auml;t des brasilianischen
        Bundesstaates Par in Belm und deren
        &quot;Botschafter&quot; Willi Hoss, fr&uuml;herer
        Daimler-Benz-Betriebsrat und Bundestagsabgeordneter der
        Gr&uuml;nen, an Daimler-Benz und dessen brasilianische
        Tochtergesellschaft Mercedes-Benz do Brasil in Sao Paulo
        mit der Bitte um Unterst&uuml;tzung herangetreten.</p>
        <p>Die Universit&auml;t plante, ein Forschungsprojekt mit dem
        Namen &quot;POEMA - Programa Pobreza e Meio Ambiente na
        Amaznia/Armut und Umwelt in Amazonien&quot; -
        aufzusetzen. Ein Renaturierungsprogramm mit dem Ziel, die
        Menschen se&szlig;haft zu machen und ihnen durch den Regenwald
        eine Lebensgrundlage zu verschaffen. Dieses Projekt
        k&ouml;nnte, so die damalige Argumentation, den mittlerweile
        f&uuml;r das globale Klima als bedeutend erkannten
        brasilianischen Regenwald vor weiterem Raubbau retten. </p>
        <p>Die Bitte an Daimler-Benz war vorrangig mit der Frage
        verbunden, ob mit Hilfe des technologischen Know-hows von
        Daimler-Benz/Mercedes-Benz do Brasil Methoden gefunden
        werden k&ouml;nnten, um die Naturstoffe des Regenwaldes mit
        &quot;angepa&szlig;ten Technologien&quot; zu verarbeiten und
        ob gegebenenfalls Interesse an der Nutzung dieser
        Rohstoffe best&uuml;nde.</p>
        <p>Daimler-Benz und Mercedes-Benz do Brasil sind in
        dieses Projekt eingestiegen und haben es gemeinsam mit
        der UNICEF ab Mitte 1992 f&uuml;r drei Jahre finanziell und
        technologisch unterst&uuml;tzt. Die finanzielle Beteiligung
        des Daimler-Benz-Konzerns belief sich in dieser Zeit auf
        eine Million US Dollar. Darin nicht enthalten waren
        eigene Forschungsleistungen sowie andere technisch
        bedingte Aufwendungen, insbesondere das von Mercedes-Benz
        do Brasil gestartete Projekt &quot;Tecnologia
        Ecolgica&quot; und die Arbeiten der
        Daimler-Benz-Forschung.</p>
        <p>Seit dem Auslaufen der ersten Projektphase Mitte 1995
        wird das Projekt von der Universit&auml;t Belm und
        Daimler-Benz gemeinsam weiterverfolgt und auch weiterhin
        von Daimler-Benz finanziell und technisch unterst&uuml;tzt.
        Ziel der Phase von 1995 bis 1997 sind Untersuchungen
        bez&uuml;glich der Nutzungsm&ouml;glichkeiten von Naturstoffen
        wie Naturfasern als Verst&auml;rkungsmaterial oder die
        Herstellung von Basiskomponenten f&uuml;r Kunststoffe aus
        pflanzlichen &ouml;len und Harzen. </p>
        <p>Zur Frage eines m&ouml;glichen Technologietransfers in
        andere tropische Regionen der Welt veranstaltet das
        Sonderprogramm POEMA der Bundesuniversit&auml;t von Par mit
        finanzieller Unterst&uuml;tzung von Daimler-Benz vom 27. bis
        29. November 1996 in Belm einen wissenschaftlichen
        Kongre&szlig; mit weltweiter Beteiligung. </p>
        <p><b>Die Herausforderungen des
        &quot;Belm-Projektes&quot;</b></p>
        <p>Drei wesentliche Fragestellungen waren im Zusammenhang
        mit dem Projekt zu l&ouml;sen, um &uuml;berhaupt einen Erfolg zu
        erm&ouml;glichen:</p>
        <p>1. Zum einen mu&szlig;te eine gerodete Fl&auml;che aufgeforstet
        werden, die einen dauerhaften Ertrag durch Fr&uuml;chte,
        Fasern und Holz verspricht und mehrere - m&ouml;glichst
        unterschiedliche - Ernten pro Jahr zul&auml;&szlig;t.</p>
        <p>2. F&uuml;r die Bewohner mu&szlig;te mit einer nachhaltigen
        Wasserversor- gung ein zweiter Anreiz vorhanden sein, den
        Wohnort nicht wieder zu verlassen (Normalisierung).</p>
        <p>3. Die Frage des Ertrages hing eng mit Perspektiven
        einer indu- striellen Nutzung der Rohstoffe aus dem Wald
        zusammen. </p>
        <p>F&uuml;r alle drei Aspekte hat das Projekt sinnvolle
        L&ouml;sungen gefunden, die es als vorbildlich erscheinen
        lassen.</p>
        <p><b>1. Das &quot;agroforstwirtschaftliche System&quot;
        in Belm</b></p>
        <p>Das von der Universit&auml;t und insbesondere von dem
        POEMA-Projektleiter Prof. Dr. Thomas Mitschein gestartete
        Projekt sah eine Wiederaufforstung von degradierten
        Regionen nach wissenschaftlichen Prinzipien vor. Hierzu
        wurden kleine Gemeinden gesucht, deren Bewohner an neuen
        Aufforstungsformen Interesse hatten. Zur Verf&uuml;gung
        gestelltes Land wurde in jeweils 20 x 20 Meter gro&szlig;e
        Parzellen aufgeteilt. </p>
        <p>Das &quot;agroforstwirtschaftliche Prinzip&quot;
        l&auml;&szlig;t sich vereinfacht so beschreiben: Im Zentrum jeder
        Parzelle steht (oder wurde gepflanzt) ein besonders
        hochwachsender Baum, zum Beispiel ein Mangabaum oder ein
        Paranu&szlig;baum. Nach agroforstlichen Regeln wurden um
        diesen herum B&auml;ume und Str&auml;ucher angepflanzt, die je
        nach Art mehr oder weniger durch die hochwachsenden
        B&auml;ume vor der Sonnenstrahlung gesch&uuml;tzt wurden. Es
        entsteht ein tropischer Mischwald mit mehreren
        &quot;Etagen&quot;, wie er auch f&uuml;r den Regenwald
        typisch ist. </p>
        <p>In dieser Art von Mischwald, der kein nat&uuml;rlicher
        Regenwald und in der Anlage vergleichbar mit unseren
        Nutzw&auml;ldern ist, werden neben Kokospalmen Kakaob&auml;ume,
        Kaffeestr&auml;ucher und Uruc-Str&auml;ucher gepflanzt. Die
        Mischung ist einerseits auf die Tragf&auml;higkeit der B&ouml;den
        abgestimmt, andererseits erm&ouml;glicht sie Ernten
        verschiedener Produkte und eine Abkehr von der
        Brandrodung. Die verschiedenen Pflanzen schaffen dar&uuml;ber
        hinaus im Lauf der Zeit eine neue Humus-Schicht und
        bieten somit der Bodenerosion Einhalt. </p>
        <p><b>2. Keimfreies Wasser: Ein &quot;Essential&quot;
        f&uuml;r das Projekt</b></p>
        <p>F&uuml;r die Herstellung von Trinkwasser wurde in der
        Gemeinde Praia Grande in Ponta de Pedras auf der Insel
        Maraj eine Wasserstation entwickelt, die aus einem
        Hochtank, einer Wasserpumpe (per Windrad) und einer
        Solaranlage besteht, an welche eine Elektrolysezelle
        angeschlossen ist. Durch diese Zelle wird eine L&ouml;sung
        aus Wasser und Kochsalz geleitet. Dadurch wird
        keimt&ouml;tendes Hypochlorid freigesetzt und dem Hochtank
        zugef&uuml;hrt.</p>
        <p>Hervorzuheben ist, da&szlig; die Regierung des Bundestaates
        Par sich verpflichtet hat, 1047 solcher Stationen in
        nicht mit keimfreien Trinkwasser versorgten l&auml;ndlichen
        Gemeinden einzurichten.</p>
        <p><b>3. Industrielle Aspekte von POEMA am Beispiel
        &quot;Fasern&quot;</b></p>
        <p>Die industrielle Verwertung nachwachsender Rohstoffe
        aus dem &quot;Regenwald&quot; traf auf das origin&auml;re
        Interesse des Daimler-Benz-Konzerns: In Versuchen in Sao
        Paulo, Ulm und Stuttgart wurde insbesondere die
        Tauglichkeit der Naturfasern, und hier vor allem die
        Kokosfaser, f&uuml;r die Automobilproduktion untersucht. </p>
        <p>Nachdem sich diese generell als brauchbar
        herausgestellt hatten, war die Frage zu kl&auml;ren, ob - und
        gegebenenfalls mit welchem Aufwand - sich die Rohstoffe
        im Amazonasdelta gewinnen und zumindest gegen Verrottung
        sch&uuml;tzen lassen. Weiter war die Frage zu beantworten,
        inwieweit sich eine industrielle Produktion im
        Amazonas-Delta durchf&uuml;hren lie&szlig;e, um die Wertsch&ouml;pfung
        vor Ort zu erh&ouml;hen.</p>
        <p>Diese Aspekte standen unter zwei weiteren Bedingungen:
        Das Endprodukt mu&szlig;te kostenm&auml;&szlig;ig mit herk&ouml;mmlichen
        Produkten vergleichbar sein. Und die zur Konservierung
        und Bearbeitung eingesetzten Ger&auml;te und Apparate mu&szlig;ten
        den Grunds&auml;tzen der &quot;angepa&szlig;ten Technologien&quot;
        entsprechen, mu&szlig;ten also vor Ort und vom dort lebenden
        Personal gewartet und repariert werden k&ouml;nnen. </p>
        <p>Bei der L&ouml;sung dieser Fragen waren ausgepr&auml;gte
        Literaturstudien erforderlich, um sich mit dem
        &quot;Stand der Technik&quot; &uuml;berall auf der Welt
        vertraut zu machen, und um darauf aufbauend die
        notwendigen Forschungsaufgaben zu formulieren.</p>
        <p>Sehr schnell entwickelte sich bei Daimler-Benz
        aufgrund der gewonnenen Erkenntnisse &uuml;ber die
        untersch&auml;tzten Werkstoffeigenschaften der Fasern ein
        ausgedehntes Forschungsprogramm &quot;Nachwachsende
        Rohstoffe&quot;, das in nur wenigen Jahren schon zum
        verst&auml;rkten Einsatz solcher Naturfasern in Automobilen
        f&uuml;hrte (Rohstoffe aus dem Regenwald in brasilianischen
        Fabriken, Rohstoffe aus heimischem Anbau in deutschen
        Fabriken, zum Beispiel Flachs und Hanf)</p>
        <p><b>Kopfst&uuml;tzen aus Kokosfasern</b></p>
        <p>Bereits kurze Zeit nach Beginn des Projektes begannen
        die Bewohner der Siedlung Praja Grande auf der
        Amazonasinsel Maraj mit der Lieferung von Kopfst&uuml;tzen
        aus Kokosfasern an Mercedes-Benz do Brasil in Sao Paulo.
        Die Fasern werden mit einfachen technischen Hilfsmitteln
        aus dem Schwimmantel der Kokosnu&szlig; gewonnen, zu Seilen
        gedreht und an die kleine Fabrik f&uuml;r Nackenst&uuml;tzen
        geliefert. Dort werden sie zusammen mit Naturgummi
        (Latex) zu Kopfst&uuml;tzen geformt. </p>
        <p>Die Gewinnung der Fasern, das Verseilen und die
        anschlie&szlig;ende Herstellung der Kopfst&uuml;tzen wird von den
        Bewohnern als Kooperative betrieben. Jede Woche hat eine
        andere Familie &quot;Dienst&quot;. Die einzelnen
        Herstellungsschritte sind mittlerweile von den Bewohnern
        optimiert worden. </p>
        <p>So wurde zum Beispiel das L&ouml;sen der Fasern aus der
        Frucht durch Eigeninitiative erheblich erleichtert und
        praktisch industrialisiert. Weitere
        Verfahrensverbesserungen, etwa beim Drehen der Seile,
        erh&ouml;hten die Effizienz um das etwa Neunfache von drei
        Kilogramm verseilter Fasern auf 26 Kilogramm pro Tag.
        Auch in der Kopfst&uuml;tzen-Produktion haben verschiedene,
        in Eigeninitiative entstandene Verfahrensentwicklungen
        die Prozesse verbessert und erleichtert.</p>
        <p>Heute beliefert die Kooperative in Praja Grande
        Mercedes-Benz mit zirka 2500 Kopfst&uuml;tzen im Monat (30
        000 pro Jahr). Die Kosten - einschlie&szlig;lich des
        Transports aus dem Amazonasgebiet nach Sao Paulo - liegen
        knapp unter den Angeboten von Herstellern von
        Kunststoffteilen. Unter Einbezug der &ouml;kologischen
        Aspekte (Recycling), wie dies heute allgemein bei
        Daimler-Benz &uuml;blich ist, befindet sich die Produktion
        auf Maraj in einer wettbewerblich starken Position. </p>
        <p><b>Akzeptanz und Beteiligung</b></p>
        <p>Die gute Akzeptanz wird durch die Ausweitung des
        Projektes eindr&uuml;cklich belegt: 1992 beteiligte sich eine
        Gemeinde mit 50 Familien an POEMA, mit den Einwohnern von
        Praja de Grande, einer kleinen Siedlung auf der
        1.400.000-Einwohner-Stadt Belm nahegelegenen Insel
        Maraj im Amazonasdelta. </p>
        <p>1996 beteiligen sich zirka 35 Gemeinden mit zirka 2000
        Familien an den Projekten. Immer mehr Bewohner
        benachbarter Siedlungen informieren sich unmittelbar bei
        den Projektpartnern, um auch f&uuml;r sich m&ouml;glichst viele
        &ouml;konomische Vorteile nutzbar zu machen. Der erwartete
        Schneeballefekt hat sich realisiert.</p>
        <p>POEMA hat auf diese Weise in Kooperation mit der
        Daimler-Benz AG und Mercedes-Benz do Brasil Zeichen f&uuml;r
        innovative Kooperationsformen zwischen unterschiedlichen
        Partnern gesetzt, die den Menschen in der Region nutzen
        und geeignet sind, den &#132;Druck&quot; auf die
        Regenw&auml;lder zu reduzieren. Der in Belm stattfindende
        Kongre&szlig; ist als Forum konzipiert, das Partnern aus
        Wissenschaft, Wirtschaft und Politik Wege f&uuml;r
        vergleichbare Vorgehensweisen aufzeigt und diesen Ansatz
        - m&ouml;glichst global - verbreitet.</p>
        <p><b>Bewertung</b></p>
        <p>Dieses Projekt hat einen Weg gezeigt, Menschen in in
        einer der &auml;rmsten Regionen der Welt eine
        Lebensperspektive zu geben. Oft geh&ouml;rte Vorurteile, zum
        Beispiel da&szlig; Menschen in solch armen Regionen nicht in
        der Lage sind, ihre Situation zu verbessern, wurde
        eindeutig widerlegt. </p>
        <p>Die Menschen in Praja Grande sind heute - relativ
        gesehen - reich, da sie nicht nur Kokosn&uuml;sse auf dem
        Markt verkaufen. Die Abnahme der Kopfst&uuml;tzen durch
        Mercedes-Benz ist eine wesentliche Einnahmequelle
        geworden. Dazu kommen Erl&ouml;se durch zus&auml;tzliche, auf das
        ganze Jahr verteilt, anfallende Ernten weiterer Produkte
        des angebauten Waldes. </p>
        <p>Die Erfolge und der neue soziale Status schlagen sich
        in einem gestiegenen Selbstbewu&szlig;tsein nieder. Die
        Bewohner modifizieren mittlerweile die Anbaumethoden des
        Waldes nach eigenen Vorstellungen, genauso wie sie die
        Produktionsverfahren aus eigenem Antrieb erfolgreich
        verbessert haben. </p>
        <p>Die Ziele der Bewohner richten sich jetzt auf eine
        weitere Verbesserung der Lebensqualit&auml;t: Mit einer
        selbst angeschafften Windm&uuml;hle soll erstmals
        elektrischer Strom erzeugt werden. Damit lassen sich die
        Verfahrenskosten durch eine umweltfreundliche Technologie
        senken. Nat&uuml;rlich erlaubt elektrischer Strom weitere
        zivilisatorische Annehmlichkeiten, zum Beispiel den
        K&uuml;hlschrank. </p>
        <p><b>Nachwachsende Rohstoffe bei Mercedes-Benz</b></p>
        <p>Das Wissen um die industrielle Einsetzbarkeit der
        nachwachsenden Rohstoffe hat dar&uuml;ber hinaus bei
        Mercedes-Benz eine sehr schnelle Umsetzung in die
        Produkte gefunden. In den Fahrzeugen finden sich mit
        zunehmender Tendenz nachwachsende Rohstoffe. </p>
        <p>Bereits heute sind in der C-Klasse folgende Teile aus
        nachwachsenden Rohstoffen (aus Deutschland) anzutreffen:</p>

Die Bedeutung        dieses Programms liegt insbesondere auf der Erarbeitung        und Anwendung neuer Technologien, systematischer Analysen        und Probleml&ouml;sungen sowie der internationalen        Zusammenarbeit zwischen Industrie- und Schwellenl&auml;ndern.</p>        <p><b>R&uuml;ckblick</b></p>        <p>In den Jahren 1952 bis 1956 lud die brasilianische        Regierung die internationalen Automobilunternehmen ein,        in Brasilien zu investieren und eine rationale        Automobilindustrie zu schaffen. Das Potential des Landes,        mit einem Territorium gr&ouml;&szlig;er als das der USA (ohne        Alaska), einer Bev&ouml;lkerung von damals 54 Millionen        Einwohnern (heute 162 Millionen) und einem hohen        Transportbedarf einer auf landwirtschaftliche Produkte        ausgerichteten Wirtschaft, hatte eine schnelle Reaktion        zur Folge, die innerhalb weniger Jahre zum Aufbau einer        von amerikanischen und europ&auml;ischen Unternehmen        getragenen Automobilbau- und Zulieferindustrie in        Brasilien f&uuml;hrte. Dieser Schnitt war und ist das        R&uuml;ckgrat des dann folgenden Aufschwungs des gesamten        industriellen Sektors, des Bauwesens, des Handels und des        Bankwesens. Wir in Sao Paulo sagen immer mit Stolz, da&szlig;        wir heute die gr&ouml;&szlig;te deutsche Industriestadt in der        Welt sind, gemessen an der Anzahl der ans&auml;ssigen        deutschen Unternehmen und der Zahl der dort        Besch&auml;ftigten.</p>        <p>Diese Phase der industriellen Entwicklung Brasiliens        ist damit ein Beispiel internationaler Zusammenarbeit,        das dazu gef&uuml;hrt hat, da&szlig; heute die brasilianische        Nutzfahrzeugindustrie weltweit eine starke Position        einnimmt und mit einem j&auml;hrlichen Exportvolumen von        &uuml;ber 18.000 Einheiten erheblich zur positiven        Exportbilanz Brasiliens beitr&auml;gt.</p>        <p>Daimler-Benz hat an dieser Erfolgsstory teilgenommen        und sie wesentlich mitgepr&auml;gt. Seit 1955 als erster        europ&auml;ischer Fahrzeughersteller in Sao Paulo pr&auml;sent,        brachte Daimler-Benz als Technologiebeitrag den        Dieselmotor ins Land, dessen hohe Wirtschaftlichkeit sich        im Nutzfahrzeugbereich gegen die Benzinmotoren der        Amerikaner Ford und GM durchsetzte und ab 1969 bis heute        die Marktf&uuml;hrerschaft mit mehr als 50&nbsp;Prozent der        produzierten Nutzfahrzeuge in Brasilien behaupten konnte.</p>        <p><b>Zusammenarbeit zum beiderseitigen Nutzen </b></p>        <p>Die Bereitschaft zur Zusammenarbeit mit einem an der        Schwelle einer modernen industriellen Entwicklung        stehenden Land und das Setzen und der Transfer moderner,        zukunftssicherer Technologien hat sich f&uuml;r Daimler-Benz        durch den Erfolg im Lande, aber dar&uuml;ber hinaus auch        durch Know-how&#150;R&uuml;ckflu&szlig; bezahlt gemacht.</p>        <p>Die &quot;Heavy-duty&quot;-Anforderungen in einem Land        wie Brasilien, gekennzeichnet durch hohe        Nutzenanforderungen wie zum Beispiel geringe Kosten, hohe        Wirtschaftlichkeit, geringe Stillstandszeiten, geringer        Wartungsbedarf, leichte Reparierbarkeit bei harten        Einsatzbedingungen, die aus den schlechten        Stra&szlig;enverh&auml;ltnissen resultieren und damit        erforderlicher off-road-Tauglichkeit,        &uuml;berladef&auml;higkeit, H&ouml;hentauglichkeit sowie        Langstreckeneins&auml;tze haben zu Produkt- und        Komponentenentwicklungen gef&uuml;hrt, die sich von den        europ&auml;ischen unterscheiden.</p>        <p>Dieser auf diesem Wege gelungene Aufbau einer        &quot;Heavy-duty&quot;-Produktion in Brasilien konnte vom        Konzern genutzt werden, um insbesondere in den L&auml;ndern        der s&uuml;dlichen Hemisph&auml;re, die mit europ&auml;ischen        Produkten (Kosten, Technologien) nicht mehr bedienbar        waren, eine Markteroberung mit brasilianischen Produkten        zu vollziehen. Damit konnte auch in diesem Teil der Welt        die Marktf&uuml;hrerschaft bei Nutzfahrzeugen oberhalb von        sechs Tonnen bewahrt werden.</p>        <p><b>&quot;Tecnologia Ecol&Ucirc;gica&quot;</b></p>        <p>Von dieser Makrobetrachtung der internationalen        Zusammenarbeit zwischen Industrie- und Schwellenl&auml;ndern,        ihrer historischen Entwicklung und ihrer befruchtenden        Wirkung f&uuml;r beide Partner nun zur Behandlung des        speziellen Themas der &quot;Tecnologia Ecol&Ucirc;gica&quot;.        In einem Schwellenland wird von einem renommierten        industriellen Partner vorbildhaftes und fortschrittliches        Verhalten im sozialen, technologischen und        unternehmerischen Bereich erwartet. Das gilt vor allem        auch auf dem Gebiet der Umweltvertr&auml;glichkeit.</p>        <p>Von Anfang an hat Daimler-Benz bei der Gestaltung        seiner Fabriken in Brasilien diesem Aspekt ganz besondere        Bedeutung zukommen lassen. Mercedes-Benz do Brasil hat in        Brasilien das erste Emissionslabor eingerichtet, hat sich        aktiv an Regierungsprogrammen zur Entwicklung und        Erprobung von Alkohol-, Erdgas- und Natur&ouml;lmotoren f&uuml;r        Nutzfahrzeuge beteiligt und arbeitet aktiv und progressiv        in Umweltgesetzgebungsfragen mit der Regierung zusammen.</p>        <p>All dies m&uuml;ndet ein in die Vision von        &quot;Technologien mit System&quot;, einer ganzheitlichen        Betrachtung von Fahrzeug, Verkehr und Umwelt, in der die        Einzelprozesse der Produktgestaltung, Produktnutzung und        der Produktwirkungen in dauerhafte (sustainable) Prozesse        &uuml;berf&uuml;hrt werden, die letztendlich zu stabilen        Situationen in der Wechselwirkung von Industriewelt und        Umwelt f&uuml;hren.</p>        <p>Konkret bedeutet das zum Beispiel f&uuml;r die Gestaltung        der Produkte in Brasilien:</p>        <p>1. Einsatz emissionsarmer Dieselmotoren (gleiche        Technologien wie in Europa und USA)</p>        <p>2. Entwicklung von Gasmotoren</p>        <p>3. Vermeidung gef&auml;hrlicher Materialien (zum Beispiel        Asbest)</p>        <p>4. FCKW-freie Systeme und Herstellverfahren</p>        <p>5. Ger&auml;uschreduzierungen (Fahrzeug und Produktion)</p>        <p>6. Verbrauchsreduzierung (Leichtbau, Aerodynamik,        Motor- elektronik und andere)</p>        <p>7. Rezyklierbarkeit, Korrosionsbest&auml;ndigkeit</p>        <p>8. Kreisprozesse (Betriebsmittel, Abfall) und        Ressourcenschonung (Energie, Wasser, Material) im        Produktionsproze&szlig;</p>        <p>9. Einsatz nachwachsender Rohstoffe</p>        <p>10. Emissions&uuml;berwachung im Service und im Feld</p>        <p>In enger Zusammenarbeit mit Daimler-Benz und        Mercedes-Benz konnte bei vielen dieser Punkte in        Deutschland erarbeitetes Know-how &uuml;bernommen werden. In        einigen Bereichen erfolgten wiederum Anst&ouml;&szlig;e aus        Brasilien, wie zum Beispiel bei den Gasmotoren und den        nachwachsenden Rohstoffen, die seit einigen Jahren mit        steigendem Interesse auch von den Mutterh&auml;usern genutzt        und weiterverfolgt werden. </p>        <p><b>Einsatz nachwachsender Rohstoffe</b></p>        <p>Am umfassendsten kommt innerhalb des Programms das        Konzept des Einsatzes nachwachsender Rohstoffe der        Idealvorstellung eines dauerhaften Gleichgewichtes        zwischen Umwelt und Technik nahe. In diesem Fall ist der        technische Stoffkreislauf bei der Herstellung eines        Bauteils in einen nat&uuml;rlichen Stoffkreislauf        eingebettet, der &uuml;ber das Wachsen der Pflanze, die        Herstellung des Rohstoffes, die Verarbeitung und        Darstellung des Bauteils sowie die sp&auml;tere Entsorgung        bez&uuml;glich der Material- und CO<sub>2</sub>-Bilanz sich        in eben diesem dauerhaften Gleichgewicht befindet.</p>        <p>Seit 1992 besteht ein Forschungsprogramm zwischen        Daimler-Benz und der Universit&auml;t Par&sdot; im Amazonasgebiet        Brasiliens, in dem in vier Arbeitsschwerpunkten        Naturfasern, Natur&ouml;le, Naturfarben und        Naturgummi/-adhesive die Gewinnung, Verarbeitung und        Nutzung der Naturmaterialien untersucht wird. Dabei        er&ouml;ffnet der Reichtum der amazonensischen Pflanzenwelt        neue und interessante Ansatzpunkte. Insbesondere bei        faserverst&auml;rkten Kunststoffen zeigt sich, da&szlig;        naturfaserverst&auml;rkte Materialien im Hinblick auf Biege-        und Zugelastizit&auml;t, Splitterbildung oder        Leichtbaueigenschaften teilweise erheblich bessere        Eigenschaften aufweisen als glasfaserverst&auml;rkte        Materialien und ebenfalls Kostenvorteile bieten.</p>        <p>Diese positiven Merkmale haben dazu gef&uuml;hrt, da&szlig; der        &uuml;bergang vom Forschungsstadium zum Einsatz in        Serienprodukten schnell vollzogen werden konnte. Jute-        und Sisalfasern werden in Verkleidungsteilen im        Kabineninnenraum verwendet (zum Beispiel Dach, R&uuml;ckwand,        T&uuml;re) sowie zusammen mit Baumwolle bei thermoakustischen        Isolierungen. </p>        <p>Kokosfaser dient als Werkstoff f&uuml;r Sitze. Ebenso        erfolgreich verl&auml;uft die Entwicklung auf dem Gebiet der        Natur&ouml;le. Rizinus&ouml;l hat sich als gute Basis f&uuml;r        Klebestoffe, Lacke, Polyamide und Polyurethan erwiesen.        &uuml;ber 300 Tonnen setzt Mercedes-Benz do Brasil j&auml;hrlich        bei Polyamid-Bremsleitungen der MBBras-Nutzfahrzeuge ein.        </p>        <p>Bei den Naturfarbpigmenten gelang es in Zusammenarbeit        mit Glasurit, das Indigoblau der Feranil-Pflanze zu einem        licht- und temperaturstabilen Pigment zu entwickeln. Der        Einsatz wird zur Zeit vorbereitet. </p>        <p>Naturgummi (Latex) ist zwar bereits im Einsatz (4.000        Tonnen im Jahr in MBBras-Produkten), das besondere        Augenwerk im Forschungsprogramm gilt aber der Herstellung        von biologisch abbaubarem Naturgummi, zum Beispiel auf        Basis von Zuckerrohr oder Staudenbananen.</p>        <p>Einen Schwerpunkt der Forschungsarbeit bildet ferner        die m&ouml;glichst umfassende Verwertung von Nutzpflanzen:        Stamm oder Stengel zur Fasergewinnung, der Samen zur &ouml;l-        und Kunststofferzeugung und gegebenenfalls beides in        Kombination als naturfaserverst&auml;rktes &ouml;ko-Composite.</p>        <p><b>Umwelttechnologie - die dritte Technologiewelle im        Automobilbau </b></p>        <p>Die Anwendung nachwachsender Rohstoffe bildet f&uuml;r        Forschung, Verfahrensentwicklung und den Fahrzeugbau ein        v&ouml;llig neues Technologiefeld. Ende des vorigen        Jahrhunderts gelang durch Anwendung der Technologien des        klassischen Maschinenbaus (Mechanik, Thermodynamik,        Elektrik) der Schritt vom Fuhrwerk zum Automobil. Die        gegenw&auml;rtige Phase l&auml;&szlig;t sich kennzeichnen durch die        Nutzbarmachung von Elektronik und Informations-,        Kommunikations- und Computertechnologien, mit denen der        Schritt vom Automobil zum System Verkehr vollzogen wird        (unter anderem erarbeitet im Projekt PROMETHEUS). </p>        <p>Nach dieser zweiten Technologiewelle wird die dritte        die der Umwelttechnologien sein. Mit ihr wird der Schritt        vom offenen Proze&szlig; zum geschlossenen, dauerhaft aufrecht        erhaltenen Kreisproze&szlig; vollzogen werden. Darin werden        nicht nur technische, sondern auch ganz wesentlich        soziale Aspekte mit eingebunden werden m&uuml;ssen, im Sinne        einer sozial gerechteren Verteilung der positiven und        negativen Folgen industrieller T&auml;tigkeit.</p>        <p>Der Dialog zwischen Industrie- und        Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern, zwischen armen und reichen Regionen        sowie der Bereitschaft zur Zusammenarbeit wird dabei von        fundamentaler Bedeutung sein. Ohne darauf hier n&auml;her        eingehen zu wollen, nur als Stichwort: Das globale        Umweltziel, Tropenwaldregionen zu erhalten, wird sicher        nicht l&ouml;sbar sein, wenn das gleichzeitig bedeutet, die        Armut in diesen Regionen zu erhalten, um auf diesem Wege        Reichtum und Luxus verbunden mit hohem Energieverbrauch        wie CO<sub>2</sub>-Aussto&szlig; in den Wohlstandsl&auml;ndern        abzusichern.</p>        <p><b>Das Projekt &quot;POEMA - Armut und Umwelt in        Amazonien&quot;</b></p>        <p>Es werden viele kleine Schritte auf dem Weg der        Einbettung der Technik in dauerhafte Prozesse        erforderlich sein. Die Nutzung nachwachsender Rohstoffe        ist einer dieser Schritte. Er ist verkn&uuml;pft mit        sozialpolitischen Arbeiten, die innerhalb des von        Daimler-Benz unterst&uuml;tzten Projektes &quot;Armut und        Umwelt in Amazonien&quot; durchgef&uuml;hrt werden. </p>        <p>In Brasilien ist das wirtschaftliche Gef&auml;lle zwischen        den Industriezentren im S&uuml;den und den        landwirtschaftlichen Regionen des Nordens und Nordostens        besonders gro&szlig;. Dieses Gef&auml;lle f&uuml;hrt unter anderem zur        Landflucht, die von den St&auml;dten nicht verkraftet wird,        es wachsen die Favelas &#150; die Slums in den        Metropolen. Dieser Proze&szlig; l&auml;&szlig;t sich nur stoppen, wenn        es gelingt, die Lebensbasis in den armen Regionen zu        verbessern.</p>        <p>Das von der Universit&auml;t Par&sdot; mit Beteiligung der        UNICEF und von Daimler-Benz durchgef&uuml;hrte Projekt        &quot;Armut und Umwelt in Amazonien&quot; hat genau        dieses Ziel.</p>        <p>In Pilotprojekten in vier ausgew&auml;hlten Gemeinden des        Amazonasgebietes wurden Wege zur Verbesserung der        Lebensbasis erarbeitet. Das Projekt umfa&szlig;t den Aufbau        einer </p>        <p>- sozialen Basis - durch Entwicklung kommunaler        Strukturen (Verwaltung, Erziehung, Genossenschaften) und        des Ge- sundheitswesens (Wasserversorgung,        Sanit&auml;rkonzepte, medizini- sche Betreuung),</p>        <p>- der agroforstwirtschaftlichen Basis - den Aufbau        eines dauerhaften land- und forstwirtschaftlichen Systems        zum Anbau, Pflege und Ernte von Nutzpflanzen und</p>        <p>- der industriellen Basis - die die Verwendung und        Vorverarbeitung der Pflanzen zu industriell nutzbaren        Produkten (Rohmaterial, Halbzeug, Fertigprodukte)        vorsieht.</p>        <p>Das agroforstwirtschaftliche Konzept basiert auf der        altindianischen Kultur des Terrassenanbaus von Pflanzen.        Es ist strukturell dem Aufbau des Tropenwaldes        nachempfunden. Es wird eine Pflanzengemeinschaft        gebildet, die dicht gesetzt ist, sich gegenseitig vor zu        starker Sonneneinstrahlung sch&uuml;tzt, das Austrocknen des        Bodens verhindert, Feuchtigkeit in der Luft h&auml;lt und so        die Fehler der Monokulturen, die zu extensiver        Bodenauszehrung und zu immer neuen Landgewinnungen durch        Waldrodung f&uuml;hrten, zu vermeiden sucht.</p>        <p>Wichtig ist, da&szlig; das Konzept der wirtschaftlichen        Nutzung der angebauten Pflanzen darauf beruht, da&szlig;        wesentliche Wertsch&ouml;pfungsanteile in der Region        verbleiben und das hei&szlig;t, da&szlig; die Verarbeitung der        Produkte in den l&auml;ndlichen Gemeinden geschieht. Es        werden bei der Verarbeitung angepa&szlig;te Technologien        verwendet, die im wesentlichen auf Heim- und Handarbeit        zur&uuml;ckgehen und in Energie- und Investitionsbedarf im        Rahmen der M&ouml;glichkeiten der Familien und        Genossenschaften bleiben. Als erstes wurde mit dem Aufbau        von Kokosfaser- und Kopfst&uuml;tzenprodukten begonnen.</p>        <p>Die Gewinnung der Faser bis zur Herstellung des        Halbzeugs (Kokosfaserzopf) erfolgt im Familienbetrieb        durch die Bauern selbst. Die Aufbereitung der Halbzeuge,        Aufbringung von Latex, Trocknung und Ausformung der        Kopfst&uuml;tzen erfolgt durch die Genossenschaft im        Zentralort Ponta de Pedra.</p>        <p>Die erste Projektstufe sah bis Ende 1994 die        Produktion von 900 Kopfst&uuml;tzen pro Monat vor und in 1995        (in einer zweiten Stufe) eine Steigerung auf zirka 2.000        Einheiten je Monat. Das Projekt entwickelte sich gut. Die        Belieferung der Mercedes-Benz do Brasil erfolgt        p&uuml;nktlich, die Qualit&auml;t ist in Ordnung und die Kosten        sind trotz des langen Transportweges konkurrenzf&auml;hig.</p>        <p>Nach Abschlu&szlig; der ersten beiden Phasen werden        Auswertungsm&ouml;glichkeiten sowohl in der Quantit&auml;t        (Belieferung anderer Mercedes-Benz-Werke oder anderer        Automobilfirmen) als auch in der Produktvielfalt (zum        Beispiel Sonnenblenden, Bodenmatten und andere)        angestrebt. Ferner wird in den Labors der Universit&auml;t        Par&sdot;, der Daimler-Benz AG in Ulm und bei Projektpartnern        der Zulieferer in Brasilien an weiteren        Nutzungsm&ouml;glichkeiten der angepflanzten Materialien        gearbeitet, um eine m&ouml;glichst breite Basis f&uuml;r die        wirtschaftliche Nutzung land- und forstwirtschaftlicher        Produkte dieser Region zu gew&auml;hren.</p>        <p>Diese Arbeiten in Par&sdot; haben Modellcharakter, sie        k&ouml;nnen und sollen &uuml;bertragen werden auf andere Regionen        Brasiliens. Sie sind in ihrer generellen Zielsetzung -        Nutzung landwirtschaftlicher Produkte f&uuml;r        Industrieprodukte und Entwicklung von        Produktionskonzepten mit angepa&szlig;ten Technologien in        l&auml;ndlichen Gebieten - sicher auch auf andere L&auml;nder        &uuml;bertragbar. (In diesem Sinne werden im Ulmer        Forschungsinstitut neben den brasilianischen auch in        Europa vorkommende Pflanzensorten - vor allem Flachs und        Hanf - mit ebenfalls bisher guten Resultaten untersucht.)</p>        <p>Die Zielsetzung im Rahmen der Entwicklung einer        &quot;Tecnologia Ecol&Ucirc;gica&quot;, in allen Bereichen der        Produktgestaltung, Produktnutzung und Produktwirkungen        den Gedanken der geschlossenen Prozesse in den        Vordergrund zu stellen, hat zu neuen Ans&auml;tze bei der        Entwicklung und der Verbindung von technischen        Stoffkreisl&auml;ufen, nat&uuml;rlichen Stoffkreisl&auml;ufen und        soziopolitischen Arbeitskreisl&auml;ufen gef&uuml;hrt. Sie        erfordert in vielen Bereichen ein neues Denken, bei dem        gerade die Zusammenarbeit von Industrie- und        Entwicklungs- oder Schwellenl&auml;ndern sehr fruchtbar sein        kann, da hier unter anderem die Schwellenl&auml;nder aus den        geschehenen Fehlentwicklungen in den Industriel&auml;ndern        lernen k&ouml;nnen, ohne deren Fehler wiederholen zu m&uuml;ssen.        Es k&ouml;nnen dann dort viel leichter als in den        Industriel&auml;ndern, deren weiterentwickelte Strukturen        h&auml;ufig die Flexibilit&auml;t einschr&auml;nken, neue Wege        aufgezeigt werden, die bei Bew&auml;hrung dann auch        transferiert werden k&ouml;nnen.</p>        <p><b>Erfolgreiches Beispiel: Gasbusse in Deutschland</b></p>        <p>Dies belegt das nachfolgende Beispiel. Einer der        untersuchten Kreisprozesse bezog sich auch auf die        Nutzung von Erdgas als Kraftstoff f&uuml;r unsere        Stadtomnibusse. </p>        <p>Erdgas (Methan) steht als Naturgas, als Deponiegas        oder als Biogas zur Verf&uuml;gung, unter anderem wird in        Brasilien Biogas aus Zuckerrohrabf&auml;llen gewonnen. Damit        betreibt man Nutzfahrzeuge bei der Zuckerrohrernte. Es        wurden Erdgasmotoren entwickelt, die praktisch        partikelfrei sind und in den gasf&ouml;rmigen Emissionen        unterhalb von 50 Prozent der Euro-II-Dieselmotoren        liegen. Mercedes-Benz do Brasil hat zur Zeit zirka 500        Stadtbusse in Brasilien im Einsatz und bemerkt steigendes        weltweites Interesse, besonders aus Europa.</p>        <p>In Deutschland konnte die erste Testflotte schon 1994        in Hannover anl&auml;&szlig;lich der IAA in Betrieb genommen und        vorgestellt werden.</p>        <p>&quot;Tecnologia Ecol&Ucirc;gia&quot; ist der Versuch,        konsequent &ouml;kologische Konzepte mit &ouml;konomischer        Tragf&auml;higkeit zu entwickeln. Es ist gleichzeitig der        Versuch, &quot;Technologien mit System&quot;        konzeptionell und in realen Schritten vorzubereiten und        durchzuf&uuml;hren. Die internationale Zusammenarbeit        insbesondere innerhalb des Daimler-Benz-Konzerns zwischen        den Partnern in den Industrie- und Schwellenl&auml;nder hat        sich dabei als sehr fruchtbar erwiesen und wird die Basis        bleiben sowohl f&uuml;r die industrielle T&auml;tigkeit in        Brasilien als auch f&uuml;r die Entwicklung gemeinsamer        Zukunftskonzepte wie zum Beispiel das der        &quot;Tecnologia Ecol&Ucirc;gica&quot;.</p>        </td>    </tr></table></center></div><p align="center"><img src="../../lines/db_592.gif" width="592"height="16"></p><div align="center"><center><table border="0">    <tr>        <td align="center" width="550"><h5><a href="61218b_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>English</i>&nbsp;]</a>        <a href="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Home</i>&nbsp;]</a>        <a href="../news_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Forschung &amp; Technik</i>&nbsp;]</a>        <a href="61218a_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Weiter</i>&nbsp;]</a> <a        href="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Suche</i>&nbsp;]</a>        <a href="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Dialog</i>&nbsp;]</a>        <a href="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Hilfe</i>&nbsp;]</a>        </h5>        </td>    </tr></table></center></div><div align="center"><center><address>    &#169; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 18.12.1996 </address></center></div></body></html>

<i>Stuttgart, 17. Dezember 1996</i><br>
Ob Ozon in der Luft oder Nitrat im Boden, ob Schadstoffe im Abgas oder Fremdstoffe in Lebensmitteln; nichts ist unpers&ouml;nlicher und verwirrender als die Angabe von Grenzwerten durch nackte Zahlen. Denn wer kann schon aus Zahlen allein die tats&auml;chliche Belastung von Natur und Umwelt ersehen?
<p>

Der zur Daimler-Benz AG geh&ouml;rende Unternehmensbereich Mercedes-Benz setzt in seinem Werk Sindelfingen verschiedene Pflanzen ein, um die Wirkung von Luftschadstoffen anschaulich zu untersuchen. Genauer gesagt beurteilen die verantwortlichen Wissenschaftler alle vierzehn Tage die Wirkung der L&ouml;semittelemissionen aus den Lackieranlagen auf Tomate, Spinat und Kapuzinerkresse.
<p>

Die Suche nach geeigneten Indikatorpflanzen kennzeichnete die erste Phase des Projekts, die Verfahrensentwicklung. Darauf folgte das eigentliche Biomonitoring, also die &Uuml;berwachung und Beurteilung der Lackierereiabluft durch diese Indikatorpflanzen.
<p>

An sechs verschiedenen Standorten - direkt im Werk und in der n&auml;heren Umgebung - wacht seit 1992 quasi eine Kleing&auml;rtneridylle in offenen Gew&auml;chsh&auml;usern &uuml;ber die Luftqualit&auml;t. Das positive Ergebnis der Langzeitbeobachtung: Keine der ausgesetzten Pflanzen zeigt Sch&auml;den, die auf die Lackierung bei Mercedes-Benz zur&uuml;ckzuf&uuml;hren sind. Selbst an Standorten h&ouml;chster Belastung ist die Schadstoffkonzentration um einen Faktor f&uuml;nfzig bis hundert zu niedrig, um eine Sch&auml;digung der Pflanzen zu bewirken.

Dezember 1996</i><br>... f&uuml;nf, vier, drei, zwei, eins - Sektkorken knallen und Raketen tauchen den Himmel in ein glitzerndes Feuerwerk; ein neues Jahr bricht an. Und bald, mit dem Jahreswechsel 1999 auf 2000, &auml;ndert sich dann nicht nur die letzte Ziffer, sondern die komplette Zahlenreihe. F&uuml;r viele computergest&uuml;tzte Anwendungen kann diese Umstellung allerdings ein Problem sein.<p>Mit Gr&uuml;ndung des "Kompetenzzentrums Kalenderjahr 2000" bietet die Daimler-Benz-Tochter debis Systemhaus umfassende Hilfe bei der Datumsanpassung von Computerprogrammen auf das neue Jahrtausend an. Das Zentrum vereint Expertenwissen und praktische Erfahrung, um die Umstellung m&ouml;glichst ohne Unterbrechung der Betriebsabl&auml;ufe in den Unternehmen durchzuf&uuml;hren. Hilfe leisten dabei die TransMillenniumTM Services, die sich international bereits vielfach bew&auml;hrt haben.<p>"Historisch bedingt, n&auml;mlich um teuren Speicherplatz zu sparen, arbeiten die meisten Computeranwendungen mit der verk&uuml;rzten Schreibweise der Jahreszahlen und betrachten nur die beiden letzten Stellen", erl&auml;utert Dr. Josef Kisting von debis Systemhaus. "Im Jahre 2000 - sprich "00" - starten sie also nicht in ein neues Jahrtausend, sondern fangen wieder bei Null an." Die Folge sind simple, aber schwerwiegende, logische Fehler beim Vergleich oder Sortieren von Jahreszahlen (denn "97" ist nicht kleiner als "00"), sowie bei ihrer Berechnung (denn "00" minus "97" ist nicht "03", sondern "-97"). Ein weiteres Problem ist, da&szlig; Zahlenkombinationen wie 99 oder 00 h&auml;ufig ein K&uuml;rzel f&uuml;r einen speziellen Befehl und keine Jahresangabe sind.<p>Laut Kisting sollten die Unternehmen fr&uuml;hzeitig die Datumsanpassung durchf&uuml;hren lassen. Denn das Problem wird nicht pl&ouml;tzlich am Morgen des 01. Januar 2000 auftreten, sondern schon l&auml;ngst davor. Kisting weiter: "Denken Sie zum Beispiel an Versicherungspolicen oder Lizenzen, die &uuml;ber mehrere Jahre laufen. Wer seine Programme nicht rechtzeitig umstellt, kann keine Vertr&auml;ge &uuml;ber das magische Datum hinaus ausstellen."<p>Mit Hilfe der TransMillenniumTM Services ist das "Kompetenzzentrum Kalenderjahr 2000" in der Lage, Millionen von Programmzeilen schnell und kosteng&uuml;nstig auf Datumsangaben zu pr&uuml;fen und diese anzupassen. Damit k&ouml;nnen sich Unternehmen, die jetzt richtig starten, viel Hektik kurz vor dem 31. Dezember 1999 ersparen.</table><p><br><img width=592 height=16 src="../../lines/db_592.gif"><p><table><td align=center width=550><h5><a href="61210_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>English</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Home</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../news_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Forschung &amp; Technik</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="61203_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Weiter</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Suche</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Dialog</i>&nbsp;]</a>   <a href="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Hilfe</i>&nbsp;]</a></h5></table><address>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 10.12.1996</address><p></center></body></html>

Dezember 1996</i><br>Wo geht es jetzt lang? Bei der Schilderflut am Stra&szlig;enverkehr &uuml;bersieht man leicht das ein oder andere Verkehrszeichen. War eine Geschwindigkeitsbegrenzung dabei, erinnert gerne auch ein Blitz nochmal daran. Das kostet dann in der Regel ein paar Mark und ist eventuell gepaart mit Punkten in Flensburg.<p>Ein System, das Verkehrszeichen am Stra&szlig;enrand erkennen und die Information an den Fahrer weitergeben k&ouml;nnte, w&auml;re eine hilfreiche Erg&auml;nzung im Fahrzeugcockpit. Daimler-Benz-Forscher haben ein solches Bildverarbeitungssystem bereits entwickelt. Eine Kamera am R&uuml;ckspiegel erfa&szlig;t die Umgebung und wertet die Bilder nach zwei Merkmalen aus, die f&uuml;r Verkehrsschilder charakteristisch sind: Farbe und Form.<p>Auf deutschen Stra&szlig;en gibt es etwa 400 Verkehrszeichen, die den Verkehr regeln. Die dabei vorherrschenden Farben sind rot, blau, gelb, schwarz und wei&szlig;. Im ersten Schritt filtert das Bildverarbeitungssystem aus dem Kameragesamtbild die Elemente mit den charakteristischen Farben heraus. Im zweiten Schritt sucht es solche Elemente, die aufgrund ihrer Farbkombinationen und Formmerkmale &uuml;berhaupt ein Verkehrszeichen sein k&ouml;nnen.<p>In den so eingegrenzten Ausschnitten sucht das System dann nach den typischen runden, drei- und viereckigen Verkehrsschildformen. Diese miteinander verkn&uuml;pften Informationen vergleicht es schlie&szlig;lich mit den bekannten Verkehrszeichen, die es eingespeichert hat. Nach der Zuordnung erscheint das ermittelte Schild auf einem kleinen Bildschirm im Fahrzeugcockpit.Dies alles leistet ein Hochleistungsrechner im Kofferraum des Fahrzeugs. Er verarbeitet die Bildinformationen genauso schnell, wie das menschliche Auge und Gehirn, allerdings ohne Erm&uuml;dungserscheinungen und ohne nachlassende Konzentration. Das Bildverarbeitungssystem der Daimer-Benz-Forscher ist damit eine echte Hilfe im Schilderdschungel des Stra&szlig;enverkehrs.</table><p><br><img width=592 height=16 src="../../lines/db_592.gif"><p><table><td align=center width=550><h5><a href="61203_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>English</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Home</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../news_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Forschung &amp; Technik</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="61126_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Weiter</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Suche</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Dialog</i>&nbsp;]</a>   <a href="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Hilfe</i>&nbsp;]</a></h5></table><address>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 03.12.1996</address><p></center></body></html>

November 1996</i><br>Auch wenn man noch so genau hinschaut, man sieht keine rote Nikolausm&uuml;tze zwischen den verschneiten Tannen hervorblitzen. Das ist auch nur schwer m&ouml;glich. Denn was wie ein weihnachtlich verschneiter Tannenwald aussieht, ist in Wirklichkeit ein Rohquarz. In dieser Form war er bereits vor etlichen Jahren Ausgangspunkt f&uuml;r die Schwingquarzforschung bei der Daimler-Benz AG.<p>Schwingquarze sind kleine St&uuml;cke aus reinem Quarzkristall. Ein von au&szlig;en angelegtes, hochfrequentes elektrisches Wechselfeld regt den Kristall zu intensiven, mechanischen Schwingungen an; man spricht vom umgekehrten piezoelektrischen Effekt. Aufgrund dieser Eigenschaft finden Schwingquarze schon seit vielen Jahren in den verschiedensten Bereichen Anwendung.<p>Schwingquarze geben den Takt in Quarzuhren und der Digitalelektronik an. Sie wirken als Sender oder Empf&auml;nger und finden Einsatz als Drucksensoren oder elektronische Filter. Doch gerade jetzt zur Weihnachtszeit fasziniert weniger das Bauelement als vielmehr das Rohmaterial, das in all den Jahren des Fortschritts nichts von seiner Sch&ouml;nheit eingeb&uuml;&szlig;t hat und den Eindruck eines tiefverschneiten Winterwaldes vermittelt.</table><p><br><img width=592 height=16 src="../../lines/db_592.gif"><p><table><td align=center width=550><h5><a href="61126_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>English</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Home</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../news_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Forschung &amp; Technik</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="61119_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Weiter</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Suche</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Dialog</i>&nbsp;]</a>   <a href="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Hilfe</i>&nbsp;]</a></h5></table><address>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 26.11.1996</address><p></center></body></html>

November 1996</i><br>Mit einem sirrenden Ger&auml;usch gr&auml;bt sich die Schleifscheibe in den geh&auml;rteten Stahl. Zur K&uuml;hlung spritzt ein &Ouml;l-Wasser-Gemisch zwischen Werkzeug und Stahl. Doch der Stahl ist so hei&szlig;, da&szlig; ein Teil des K&uuml;hlschmierstoffes verdampft, in die Werkshalle aufsteigt und dadurch das Arbeitsklima beeintr&auml;chtigt.<p>K&uuml;hlschmierstoffe sind &ouml;kologisch nicht unbedenklich. Sie lassen sich schlecht von den anfallenden Sp&auml;nen trennen und verhindern so ein einfaches Recycling der Metallabf&auml;lle.  Au&szlig;erdem treten bei ihrem Einsatz sch&auml;dliche D&auml;mpfe und Schl&auml;mme auf. Abhilfe schaffen wollen Daimler-Benz-Forscher, die unter dem Motto "Drehen statt Schleifen" an einem neuen Verfahren arbeiten, das bei der spanenden Bearbeitung geh&auml;rteter Bauteile ganz auf den Einsatz von K&uuml;hlschmierstoffen verzichtet.  <p>Die bisher &uuml;bliche Schleifbearbeitung von geh&auml;rteten Bauteilen erzeugt vor allem durch die hohe Geschwindigkeit zwischen Schleifscheibe und Werkst&uuml;ck sehr viel W&auml;rme, die den Einsatz eines K&uuml;hlschmierstoffes verlangt. Bei dem neuen Verfahren, der Hartzerspanung mit geometrisch bestimmter Schneide oder kurz dem Hartdrehen, treten wesentlich geringere Geschwindigkeiten zwischen Werkzeug und Werkst&uuml;ck auf. Au&szlig;erdem f&uuml;hren die beim Proze&szlig; anfallenden Sp&auml;ne etwa achtzig Prozent der entstehenden W&auml;rme ab. Der Einsatz eines K&uuml;hlschmierstoffes ist nicht mehr n&ouml;tig.<p>Die Entwicklung neuartiger, hochharter Schneidstoffe erm&ouml;glicht die trockene Zerspanung von geh&auml;rteten Bauteilen mittels geometrisch bestimmter Schneide. Statt einer Schleifscheibe spant jetzt eine Schneide aus kubischem Bornitrid oder Schneidkeramik das Metall ab. Das spart einerseits die Kosten f&uuml;r Anschaffung und Entsorgung des K&uuml;hlschmierstoffes. Andererseits sind die anfallenden Sp&auml;ne frei von Verunreinigungen, was eine direkte Wiederverwertung erm&ouml;glicht.<p>Neben allen &ouml;kologischen &Uuml;berlegungen darf man aber nicht die Wirtschaftlichkeit des Verfahrens vergessen. Vordringliches Ziel der Daimler-Benz-Forscher ist es nun, ausreichende Werkzeugstandzeiten bei Einhaltung der geforderten Oberfl&auml;cheng&uuml;te des Bauteils zu erzielen und den Proze&szlig; unter wirtschaftlichen Gesichtspunkten weiter zu verbessern.</table><p><br><img width=592 height=16 src="../../lines/db_592.gif"><p><table><td align=center width=550><h5><a href="61119_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>English</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Home</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../news_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Forschung &amp; Technik</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="61112_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Weiter</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Suche</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Dialog</i>&nbsp;]</a>   <a href="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Hilfe</i>&nbsp;]</a></h5></table><address>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 19.11.1996</address><p></center></body></html>

November 1996</i><br>Lautlos rollen die Autos &uuml;ber die Stra&szlig;e. Weder Benzin- noch Abgasgestank verpesten die Luft, keine Ru&szlig;wolken suchen sich aus Auspuffen den Weg ins Freie. Und die Kr&ouml;nung des Ganzen: Abgase belasten die Umwelt &uuml;berhaupt nicht oder zumindest nur in sehr geringen Mengen. Noch sind das alles Wunschvorstellungen, aber so soll der Verkehr der Zukunft aussehen.<p>Der erste Schritt zum alternativen Antrieb waren batteriegetriebene Fahrzeuge, sogenannte Elektroautos. Doch wie das j&uuml;ngst von Daimler-Benz in Berlin vorgestellte Forschungsfahrzeug Necar II und die Weltwasserstoffkonferenz in Stuttgart gezeigt haben, scheint die Brennstoffzellentechnologie mit Wasserstoff als Energietr&auml;ger immer mehr zum Antrieb der Zukunft zu werden.<p>Die Energieversorgung mit Wasserstoff in einer kalten Verbrennung ist eigentlich ein alter Hut. Bereits seit den sechziger Jahren nutzt die Raumfahrt sogenannte alkalische Brennstoffzellen als Energiequelle. Den Namen hat diese Technologie von dem dabei verwendeten Elektrolyten, der &auml;u&szlig;erst aggresiven Kalilauge. Und genau an diesem Punkt scheidet diese Form der Energieversorgung auch f&uuml;r den Gebrauch im Alltag aus.<p>Nur wenige Materialien widerstehen der &auml;tzenden Kalilauge, deren Handhabung prinzipiell nicht unbedenklich ist. Au&szlig;erdem arbeitet der Elektrolyt nur dann in ausreichend langen Betriebszeiten, wenn die zugef&uuml;hrte Luft frei von Kohlendioxid ist, was einen h&ouml;heren baulichen Aufwand bedeutet. Dies alles macht ein alkalisches Brennstoffzellensystem teuer und damit unbrauchbar f&uuml;r den allt&auml;glichen Einsatz.<p>Aber dennoch hat die Wasserstofftechnologie Einzug auf unsere Stra&szlig;en gehalten. Mit der Entwicklung neuartiger Hochleistungsmembranen Mitte der achtziger Jahre setzte eine neue Generation von Brennstoffzellen zum Siegeszug an. Kunststoffolien, die den internen Ladungstransport &uuml;bernehmen, ersetzten jetzt die aggresive Kalilauge. Auch hier leitet sich der Name des Brennstoffzellensystems vom Elektrolyten, n&auml;mlich von Proton Exchange Membrane - kurz PEM - ab.<p>Die PEM-Technologie treibt auch das Daimler-Benz-Forschungsfahrzeug Necar II an. Sie erlaubt im Vergleich zur alkalischen Brennstoffzelle bei bereits h&ouml;heren Leistungsdichten eine wesentlich einfachere Handhabung der elektrochemischen Zellen. Auch die hierbei eingesetzten Materialien sind billiger, so da&szlig; die Kosten auf ein Niveau sinken k&ouml;nnen, welches das System in Zukunft auch f&uuml;r den Normalverbraucher erschwinglich macht.</table><p><br><img width=592 height=16 src="../../lines/db_592.gif"><p><table><td align=center width=550><h5><a href="61112_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>English</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Home</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../news_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Forschung &amp; Technik</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="61105_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Weiter</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Suche</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Dialog</i>&nbsp;]</a>   <a href="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Hilfe</i>&nbsp;]</a></h5></table><address>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 12.11.1996</address><p></center></body></html>

November 1996</i><br>Eigentlich ist sie ganz h&uuml;bsch anzusehen, die Hanfpflanze, auch canabis sativa genannt. Doch der Mi&szlig;brauch von Canabis als Rauschmittel hatte in j&uuml;ngster Vergangenheit ein Anbauverbot in Deutschland zur Folge. Die Pflanze f&uuml;hrte, wenn &uuml;berhaupt, ein verbotenes Dasein. Seit 1996 jedoch ist der Anbau von Faserhanf - der nur in sehr geringen Mengen rauschmittelhaltiges Harz produziert - zur industriellen Nutzung in Deutschland wieder erlaubt.<p>Hanf war schon vor Jahren in das Interesse von Wissenschaftlern im Daimler-Benz-Forschungszentrum Ulm ger&uuml;ckt. Aber erst die Lockerung des Anbauverbotes in Deutschland f&uuml;hrte zu intensiven Forschungen. Zur Zeit untersuchen die Forscher die Einsatzm&ouml;glichkeiten von Hanf- statt Glasfasern zur Verst&auml;rkung von Kunststoffen.<p>Glasfaserverst&auml;rkte Kunststoffe finden im Automobilbau sowohl in der Innen- wie auch der Au&szlig;enausstattung Verwendung. Doch die eingebetteten Glasfasern erschweren eine umweltgerechte Entsorgung nicht mehr gebrauchter Bauteile. Deshalb ersetzen &ouml;kologisch sinnvollere Fasern wie Flachs schon heute in einigen Teilen die Glasfasern. Und seit neuestem stehen in diesem Zusammenhang auch Hanffasern in der Diskussion. <p>Wie die Forscher herausgefunden haben, liegen die Vorteile von Hanf gegen&uuml;ber Flachs in der sehr guten Verarbeitbarkeit, der noch h&ouml;heren Faserfestigkeit sowie dem Verzicht auf Pflanzenschutzmittel beim Anbau. Doch das allein gen&uuml;gt nicht. Denn trotz des &ouml;kologischen Vorteils m&uuml;ssen Hanffasern die Anforderungen an Sicherheit, Zuverl&auml;ssigkeit, Leistung und Komfort mindestens genausogut erf&uuml;llen wie Flachs. Ungekl&auml;rt sind zur Zeit noch Fragen nach einer geeigneten Erntetechnologie und Standardisierung der Faserqualit&auml;t.<p>Erste Untersuchungen der Daimler-Benz-Forscher zeigen, da&szlig; Hanf in den meisten F&auml;llen das Leistungspotential von Flachs besitzt und es teilweise sogar &uuml;bertrifft. Genaue Aussagen &uuml;ber die Kosten sind im Moment noch nicht m&ouml;glich, doch bietet Hanf auch die Aussicht auf noch geringere Faserkosten.</table><p><br><img width=592 height=16 src="../../lines/db_592.gif"><p><table><td align=center width=550><h5><a href="61105_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>English</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Home</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../news_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Forschung &amp; Technik</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="61029_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Weiter</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Suche</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Dialog</i>&nbsp;]</a>   <a href="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Hilfe</i>&nbsp;]</a></h5></table><address>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 05.11.1996</address><p></center></body></html>

Oktober 1996</i><br>Ordentlich hintereinander aufgereiht erinnern die abgebildeten Transistoren eher an dorische S&auml;ulen als an ein Halbleiterbauelement. Doch nicht ihre &Auml;sthetik sondern ihre physikalischen Eigenschaften zeichnen diese von Daimler-Benz-Forschern entwickelten, sogenannten Heterostrukturbipolar-Transistoren aus.<p>Vor allem im Bereich der Telekommunikation erwarten die Wissenschaftler in den kommenden Jahren einen steigenden Bedarf an Transistoren mit sehr hohen Grenzfrequenzen. Die bei Daimler-Benz entwickelten Heterostrukturbipolar-Transistoren aus den zwei Materialien Silizium und Germanium (kurz Si/SiGe-HBT) erreichen dabei mit 160 Gigahertz, das sind 160 Milliarden Schwingungen pro Sekunde, einen Weltrekord. Au&szlig;erdem erf&uuml;llen sie weitere Anforderungen wie Kosteng&uuml;nstigkeit, geringen Platzbedarf durch Hochintegration und geringe Leistungsaufnahme durch hohen Wirkungsgrad.<p>Der Marktvorteil von Si/SiGe-Heterostrukturbipolar-Transistoren gegen&uuml;ber sogenannten III-V Halbleitern wie Galliumarsenid oder Indiumphosphid liegt in der leichten und billigen Verf&uuml;gbarkeit des Materials sowie in der ausgereiften Proze&szlig;technik f&uuml;r Silizium. Weitere Vorteile sind die nat&uuml;rliche Oxidschicht, welche die Reaktionsf&auml;higkeit des Metalls herabsetzt (Passivierung), und die hohe thermische Leitf&auml;higkeit, die eine effiziente Abfuhr von Verlustw&auml;rme erlaubt.<p>Die Vorteile der Si/SiGe-Heterostrukturbipolar-Transistoren sprechen nach Angaben der Wissenschaftler f&uuml;r einen Einsatz in Bereichen wie dem Mobilfunk, die gro&szlig;e St&uuml;ckzahlen fordern. Hier erm&ouml;gliche vor allem die Nutzung von Standard-Silizium-Produktionslinien billige Herstellungskosten.</table><p><br><img width=592 height=16 src="../../lines/db_592.gif"><p><table><td align=center width=550><h5><a href="61029_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>English</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Home</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../news_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Forschung &amp; Technik</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="61022_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Weiter</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Suche</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Dialog</i>&nbsp;]</a>   <a href="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Hilfe</i>&nbsp;]</a></h5></table><address>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 29.10.1996</address><p></center></body></html>

Oktober 1996</i><br>Ich kann mich ganz genau erinnern!", aus dem Munde des Menschen eine durchaus gew&ouml;hnliche Aussage. Doch es gibt auch Metalle, die das behaupten k&ouml;nnten, wenn sie neben ihrem Erinnerungsverm&ouml;gen ein Sprachrohr bes&auml;&szlig;en.<p>Die faszinierende Eigenschaft sogenannter Formged&auml;chtnislegierungen - auch Memorymetalle genannt - ist ihre F&auml;higkeit, wiederholt verschiedene Formen anzunehmen. Daimler-Benz Forscher nutzen diesen Effekt in der Luft- und Raumfahrttechnologie. Aber Memorymetalle finden auch zunehmend Anwendung in der Fahrzeugtechnik, der Medizin, der Datenverarbeitung und der Energietechnik.<p>Ziel der Daimler-Benz-Forschung ist es, zum Beispiel die Betriebsdauer von Satelliten zu erh&ouml;hen. Dazu ersetzen die Wissenschaftler Kunststoffgurte, welche die Tieftemperaturtanks an die &auml;u&szlig;ere Struktur binden, abschnittsweise durch Formged&auml;chtnislegierungen. Wegen der geringen Kr&auml;fte im All ist die Vorspannung der Gurte nur vor und w&auml;hrend des Starts notwendig, nicht w&auml;hrend des Betriebes. Die Formged&auml;chtnislegierungen erm&ouml;glichen nun ein temperaturabh&auml;ngiges Entspannen der Gurte im All und verhindern somit einen W&auml;rmeflu&szlig; &uuml;ber die Gurte in Richtung der Tanks. Dadurch verringert sich der Kraftstoffverlust drastisch und die Lebensdauer des Satelliten verl&auml;ngert sich. <p>Die zur Zeit wichtigsten Vertreter von Formged&auml;chtnislegierungen sind Metalle auf Nickel-Titan-Basis. Ein verformtes Memorymetall-Bauteil nimmt nach Erw&auml;rmung bei einer bestimmten, vorher "einprogrammierten" Temperatur seine urspr&uuml;ngliche Form wieder ein. Erkl&auml;ren l&auml;&szlig;t sich der temperaturabh&auml;ngige Effekt durch ein schlagartiges Umklappen des Atomgitters in eine andere Kristallstruktur. Nach au&szlig;en zeigt sich dieser &Uuml;bergang in einer &Auml;nderung von L&auml;nge, Volumen oder elektrischem Widerstand. Der Vorgang l&auml;&szlig;t sich durch Abk&uuml;hlung auch wieder umkehren - das Metall "erinnert" sich also an seine jeweilige Ausgangsform.</table><p><br><img width=592 height=16 src="../../lines/db_592.gif"><p><table><td align=center width=550><h5><a href="61022_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>English</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Home</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../news_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Forschung &amp; Technik</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="61015_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Weiter</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Suche</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Dialog</i>&nbsp;]</a>   <a href="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Hilfe</i>&nbsp;]</a></h5></table><address>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 22.10.1996</address><p></center></body></html>

In diesem Backproze&szlig; entstehen aus sogenanntem Kernsand Negativformen f&uuml;r die zu gie&szlig;enden Metallbauteile. Doch weniger der Backproze&szlig; als vielmehr die dabei entstehende Abluft ist in das Interesse von Ingenieuren der Daimler-Benz-Tochter Mercedes-Benz ger&uuml;ckt.<p>Die Gie&szlig;ereiabluft enth&auml;lt in hohen Konzentrationen den gasf&ouml;rmigen Katalysator Dimethylisopropylamin, der im Backproze&szlig; die Aush&auml;rtung von Kernsand, Binder und Harz beschleunigt. Bisher &uuml;berf&uuml;hrt ein S&auml;urew&auml;scher im Abluftstrom das Amin in eine Salzl&ouml;sung, die entsorgt werden mu&szlig;. Mit einem neuen Verfahren wollen die Umwelt-Ingenieure jetzt den Katalysator aus der Abluft zur&uuml;ckgewinnen und wieder im Backproze&szlig; einsetzen.<p>Die Versuchsanlage besteht aus mehreren Einheiten. Zuerst entfernen Vorfilter Schmutz- und Staubreste sowie &uuml;bersch&uuml;ssigen Binder und H&auml;rter aus der Gie&szlig;ereiabluft. Diese str&ouml;mt anschlie&szlig;end durch eine rotierende Adsorptionseinheit, die mit Polyurethanschaum auf Aktivkohle angef&uuml;llt ist. Das Amin lagert sich auf der riesigen Oberfl&auml;che des Aktivkohleschaums an, die gereinigte Abluft entweicht.<p>Durch Zufuhr von hei&szlig;er Luft (etwa 150 Grad Celsius) in einem bestimmten Bereich des Rotoradsorbers l&auml;&szlig;t sich das gasf&ouml;rmige Amin wieder vom Aktivkohleschaum abl&ouml;sen. Doch bevor das Amin erneut als Katalysator in den Backproze&szlig; einflie&szlig;en kann, mu&szlig; es v&ouml;llig wasserfrei sein. Dies erreichen die Ingenieure mit einem nachgeschalteten Entfeuchtungsrad, das auf dem gleichen Prinzip wie die Adsorptionseinheit beruht.<p>Im letzten Schritt erfolgt die R&uuml;ckgewinnung des Katalysators. Eine K&auml;ltemaschine k&uuml;hlt den aminhaltigen Gasstrom auf unter minus vierzig Grad Celsius ab, wobei sich das Amin verfl&uuml;ssigt. Auf diese Art und Weise k&ouml;nnen die Ingenieure pro Tag zirka achtzig Prozent des eingesetzten Amins zur&uuml;ckgewinnen.<p>Nach erfolgreichen Vorversuchen im Labor- und Technikumsma&szlig;stab mu&szlig; sich die Anlage jetzt unter Alltagsbedingungen in der Eisengie&szlig;erei der Mercedes-Benz AG im Werk Untert&uuml;rkheim, Werksteil Mettingen bew&auml;hren. Erkl&auml;rtes Ziel der Ingenieure ist mindestens eine betriebswirtschaftliche Null&ouml;sung. Das hei&szlig;t der Kostenaufwand f&uuml;r R&uuml;ckgewinnung und Wiedereinsatz des Amins soll den Neubeschaffungspreis des Katalysators plus den Entsorgungsaufwand f&uuml;r den Abfall nicht &uuml;bersteigen.</table><p><br><img width=592 height=16 src="../../lines/db_592.gif"><p><table><td align=center width=550><h5><a href="61015_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>English</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Home</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../news_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Forschung &amp; Technik</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="61008_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Weiter</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Suche</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Dialog</i>&nbsp;]</a>   <a href="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Hilfe</i>&nbsp;]</a></h5></table><address>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 15.10.1996</address><p></center></body></html>

<td valign=top align=left width=380>

<i>Stuttgart, 9. Oktober 1996</i><br>
Daimler-Benz hat jetzt in Ulm ein Zentrum f&uuml;r Virtual Reality-Technnologie er&ouml;ffnet. Es ist das technisch modernste und aufwendigste seiner Art in der deutschen Industrie. Mit Hilfe von Virtual Reality will der Konzern u.a. die Entwicklungszeiten seiner Produkte drastisch verk&uuml;rzen. 
<p>

F&uuml;r Prof. Dr. Hartmut Weule, im Daimler-Benz-Vorstand verantwortlich f&uuml;r Forschung und Technik, hat dieses neuartige Zentrum hohen Stellenwert: "Als weltweit agierender Hersteller technisch anspruchsvoller G&uuml;ter kann Daimler-Benz im Wettlauf um k&uuml;rzere Entwicklungszeiten, um Fehlerreduktion in der Planungsphase, um geringere Produktionskosten und verbesserte Produktqualit&auml;t auf diese Schl&uuml;sseltechnologie nicht verzichten." 
<p>

"Noch behindern aber in vielen Bereichen fehlende internationale Standards und hohe Kosten eine konzernweite Nutzung von VR-Werkzeugen. An dieser Stelle setzt der Forschungs- und Dienstleistungsauftrag des 'Virtual Reality Competence Centers (VRCC)' in Ulm ein", beschreibt Dr. Franz May, Leiter des VRCC, die derzeitige Lage. Sein Bereich wird deshalb zentrale Anlaufstelle f&uuml;r Fragen der VR-Technologie f&uuml;r den gesamten Konzern. Dar&uuml;ber hinaus soll es innovative L&ouml;sungen gemeinsam mit Entwicklung und Produktion erarbeiten, die jeweils aktuellen Virtual-Reality-Komponenten und Systeme beschaffen und integrieren. 
<p>

Die in die Hardware investierten Kosten von rund 2,5 Mio. DM werden sich schon nach kurzer Zeit amortisieren, wenn durch VR beispielsweise einige der bisher &uuml;blichen, in wochenlanger Feinarbeit angefertigten Holz- oder Wachsmodelle von neuen Fahrzeugvarianten eingespart werden. Daimler-Benz-Forscher haben deshalb eine Technik entwickelt, mit der sich schon jetzt ein Fahrzeug aus allen Blickwinkeln am Bildschirm darstellen l&auml;&szlig;t, einschlie&szlig;lich etwaiger Reflexe, z.B. von Neonlampen, mit denen Design-M&auml;ngel sofort erkannt werden k&ouml;nnen. &Auml;nderungsw&uuml;nsche k&ouml;nnen mit dieser Technik in Minutenschnelle verwirklicht und in ihrer Wirkung &uuml;berpr&uuml;ft werden.  
<p>

Nachdem der Konzern schon seit den Anf&auml;ngen der VR-Technologie diese aktiv verfolgt und in verschiedenen Anwendungen Know-how gesammelt hat, erschien es jetzt an der Zeit, mit dem VRCC eine zentrale Anlaufstelle zu schaffen. Die Zahl der Anwendungen von VR wird bei den erwarteten starken Preissenkungen f&uuml;r Hard- und Software in den n&auml;chsten Jahren erheblich steigen. Daimler-Benz ist darauf vorbereitet.

<i>Stuttgart, 9. Oktober 1996</i><br>
Mit einem gezielten "Innovations-Management" will Daimler-Benz in Zukunft noch schneller Ideen in Produkte umsetzen. Auf einem zweit&auml;gigen Pressesymposium am 8. und 9. Oktober 1996 in Stuttgart stellten Prof. Dr. Hartmut Weule, f&uuml;r Forschung und Technik verantwortlicher Daimler-Benz-Vorstand, und Helmut Petri, Pkw-Entwicklungs-Chef bei Mercedes-Benz, das in den letzten Jahren entwickelte Innovations- und Technologie-management erstmals einer breiteren &Ouml;ffentlichkeit vor. Sie nannten als augenf&auml;llige Belege aus diesem Jahr f&uuml;r ein erfolgreiches Innovations-Management das erste alltagstaugliche Brennstoffzellen-Fahrzeug der Welt (NECAR II) und den neuen Roadster SLK mit Variodach.
<p>

Laut Prof. Weule hat der Konzern in den vergangenen Jahren bedeutende Schritte unternommen, um sein technologisches Wissen verst&auml;rkt in neue Produkte zu transferieren: Alle internen Strukturen und Abl&auml;ufe seien in den vergangenen Jahren neu formiert und eine neue Qualit&auml;t der Zusammenarbeit geschaffen worden. Laut Weule nimmt Daimler-Benz deshalb heute im Weltma&szlig;stab gesehen eine Spitzenposition bei den Innovationsprozessen ein. Dies zeige sich u.a. an der weltweiten Pr&auml;senz der Forschung, einem effizienten internationalen Wissenschaftsnetzwerk des Konzerns, internen Planungsprozessen und der ungew&ouml;hnlich hohen internen Vernetzung. 
<p>

Dieses Technologie-Management sei in die konzernweite Strategieentwicklung integriert. Weule weiter: "Die &Uuml;berpr&uuml;fung aller Gesch&auml;ftsfelder des Konzerns, die st&auml;rkere Betonung des 'Shareholder Value'-Gedankens, die Produktoffensive von Mercedes-Benz, das Joint-Venture mit ABB auf dem Gebiet der Bahnsysteme (Adtranz), die Produktivit&auml;tsoffensive der DASA - all dies sind wichtige Prozesse, um die Stellung unseres Konzerns im globalen Wettbewerb zu st&auml;rken und auszubauen."
<p>

Helmut Petri steht fest, da&szlig; nur dann ein Innovations-Management erfolgreich sein kann, wenn "das Top-Management in marktpr&auml;gende Technologie-Entscheidungen eingebunden ist". Nach einem internationalen Benchmarking habe man die eigenen St&auml;rken und Schw&auml;chen schonungslos analysiert. Als Kernkompetenz kristallisierte sich letztlich das "Management erlebbarer Produkt-Innovationen" heraus. 
<p>

Das seither entwickelte Innovations-Management besteht aus drei Komponenten, dem "Ideenhaus", dem "Innovations-Kalender" und der "Integrierten Konzeptfindung". Das "Ideenhaus" greift aktiv neue Produktideen aus Mitarbeiterkreisen auf und betreut sie. Der "Innovations-Kalender" stellt sicher, da&szlig; vorbereitete Innovationen "Just In Time" in die Vorentwicklung oder Entwicklung weitergeleitet werden. Die "Integrierte Konzeptfindung" bringt Vertreter aller am Produkt beteiligten Bereiche, von der Forschung bis zum Vertrieb, an einen Tisch, um schon langfristig die Weichen f&uuml;r den Transferproze&szlig; zu stellen.
<p>

Als Beleg f&uuml;r den Erfolg dieses "Technologie-Managements" f&uuml;hrte der Konzern eine Reihe von "Prozessen" vor, die den Transfer von der Idee zum Produkt deutlich machen: 
<p>

-	"Reverse Engineering" verk&uuml;rzt die Entwicklungszeiten. Die Verfahren werden teilweise noch in der Forschung erarbeitet und fast zeitgleich in Entwicklung und Produktion eingesetzt. <br>
-	Der Zugriff auf Technologie-Pools erlaubt es Adtranz, Produkte erheblich kosteng&uuml;nstiger herzustellen.<br>
-	Eine deutsch-amerikanische Kooperation der DASA f&uuml;hrte zum Experimentalflugzeug X-31, das weitgehend "absturzsicher" ist und eine Grundlage f&uuml;r neue zivile Luftfahrtprojekte darstellt. <br>
-	Auch die neue Reihe von MTU-Dieselmotoren konnte dank Technologie-Management erheblich schneller und preiswerter entwickelt werden. <br>
-	Mit dem neuen Virtual-Reality Competence Center in Ulm soll diese neue Technologie noch schneller eingesetzt werden.<br>
-	Von Daimler-Benz mit dem "Innovationspreis" ausgezeichnet wurde die Entwicklung der sogenannten "Planartechnologie" bei der TEMIC. Sie hat zur Technologief&uuml;hrerschaft im Bereich von ABS- (Anti-Blockier-Sytemen) und Motormanagement-Steuerungen gef&uuml;hrt. 
<p>

Neben derartigen Proze&szlig;beschreibungen stellte der Konzern einzelne Highlights aus Forschung und Entwicklung vor: <br>
-	Neue Technologien f&uuml;r ein "Virtuelles Kaufhaus",<br> 
-	Verbesserung des Autobahnverkehr mit einer elektronischen Deichsel, <br>
-	Sprachbedienung von Komponenten im Fahrzeug und<br>
-	elektronische Abstandserkennung.<br>
Weitere technische L&ouml;sungen wurden an einem Bus mit aktiven Fahrwerk, an der neuen LKW-Serie "Actros", am SLK und am Brennstoffzellen-Fahrzeug NECAR II pr&auml;sentiert. 
<p>

Nach Meinung von Forschungsvorstand Prof. Dr. Hartmut Weule "ist Technologiemanagement f&uuml;r die Leitung von Daimler-Benz eine sehr wichtige Aufgabe". Weule sieht das Unternehmen hier insgesamt "auf einem guten Weg". Und er versicherte: Was das Unternehmen zur Erhaltung des Industriestandorts Deutschland tun kann, werde es tun.

<i>Stuttgart, 8. Oktober 1996</i><br>
Das vierte Daimler-Benz Forschungsinstitut im Ausland  nimmt am 15. Oktober 1996 in der s&uuml;dindischen Stadt Bangalore seine Arbeit auf. Das "Daimler-Benz Research Centre India" soll vorhandenes Know-how in den Bereichen Multimedia, Mustererkennung, Software-Entwicklung und Produktions-Informatik f&uuml;r den Konzern nutzbar machen. Das indische Institut startet zun&auml;chst mit 10 Mitarbeitern, doch wie f&uuml;r die anderen in den vergangenen Jahren er&ouml;ffneten Forschungseinrichtungen im Ausland ist ein starkes Wachstum von Aufgabenstellungen und Personalst&auml;rke wahrscheinlich. "Eine Erweiterung auf 30 bis 50 Mitarbeiter ist in den n&auml;chsten Jahren vorstellbar", so Prof. Dr. Hartmut Weule, Daimler-Benz-Vorstand f&uuml;r Forschung und Technik, auf einem Presse-Symposium in Stuttgart. Gesch&auml;ftsf&uuml;hrer ist der vorher lange Zeit in der Daimler-Benz-Forschung in Ulm t&auml;tige Inder Dr. Seshu Bhagavathula. Das Institut ist mit einer Hochleistungs-Datenverbindung - einem "Radio Link" - mit der Konzernforschung in Deutschland verbunden.
<p>

F&uuml;r den Standort Indien gab es laut Prof. Weule eine Reihe von Gr&uuml;nden. Indien verf&uuml;gt nach den USA &uuml;ber die gr&ouml;&szlig;te Zahl an Software-Entwicklern - mehr als doppelt so viele wie in Deutschland.  Auch das hervorragende Verh&auml;ltnis von Kosten zu Leistung und Qualit&auml;t war bei der Standortauswahl mitentscheidend. Dar&uuml;ber hinaus er&ouml;ffnet der Standort Indien den Zugang zu neuen M&auml;rkten und erm&ouml;glicht den langfristigen Aufbau von Gesch&auml;ftsbeziehungen zu den Daimler-Benz-Konzernt&ouml;chtern in S&uuml;dasien. 
<p>

Mit Bangalore wurde eine Stadt als Sitz des Forschungszentrums gew&auml;hlt, die mit ihren angesehenen Forschungseinrichtungen, insbesondere dem India Institute of Science, als die Wissenschaftsstadt Indiens gilt. Dieses Potential will der Konzern nutzen. Eine enge Zusammenarbeit mit indischen Universit&auml;ten, Forschungszentren und Wissenschaftsorganisationen wird angestrebt.
<p>

Das Daimler-Benz Research Centre India ist die vierte &uuml;berseeische Forschungseinrichtung, die der Konzern innerhalb von nur drei Jahren er&ouml;ffnet hat: In Shanghai wird gemeinsam mit der chinesischen Akademie der Wissenschaften an neuen Verfahren der die Mikroelektronik gearbeitet. Das "Research and Technology Center" in Palo Alto (Kalifornien), dem Zentrum des "Silicon Valley" der USA, bearbeitet neue gesellschaftliche und technologische Trends sowie Fragen der Verkehrsforschung. In Portland (Oregon/USA) unterst&uuml;tzt ein Forschungsinstitut die Fahrzeugsystemforschung, insbesondere f&uuml;r die Konzerntochter Freightliner.
<p>

Mittlerweile hat die Zahl von Ausl&auml;ndern in der Forschung bzw. deutscher Forscher im Ausland bei Daimler-Benz 225 &uuml;berschritten. Laut Prof. Weule sollten im Jahr 2000 bereits 300 der Daimler-Benz-Forscher aus dem Ausland stammen. Mit der Einrichtung der &uuml;berseeischen Forschungszentren pa&szlig;t sich die Forschung an die verst&auml;rkte internationale Produktion an. Andererseits sollen die Zentren den Technologietransfer nach Deutschland erleichtern und fr&uuml;hzeitig neue technologische Trends erkennen und nutzbar machen.

<i>Stuttgart, 8. Oktober 1996</i><br>
Daimler-Benz hat zum ersten Mal hervorragende Innovationen seiner Mitarbeiter mit dem "Daimler-Benz-Innovationspreis" pr&auml;miert. Der Preis, der mit 30.000 DM dotiert ist, wird j&auml;hrlich an Mitarbeiter verliehen, die Produktinnovationen schnell von einer Idee zur Marrktreife gef&uuml;hrt haben. 
<p>

"Damit wollen wir besonders jene Mitarbeiter belohnen, die sich um schnelle Umsetzung von Ideen bem&uuml;hen", betonte J&uuml;rgen E. Schrempp, der Daimler-Benz-Vorstandsvorsitzende, bei der Verleihung des 1. Innovationspreises im Mercedes-Benz-Museum in Stuttgart-Untert&uuml;rkheim. Pr&auml;miert wurde die Leistung von zwei Entwicklern der Daimler-Benz-Tochtergesellschaft TEMIC, die die sogenannte "Planartechnologie" entwickelt und umgesetzt haben, eine Technologie, die im Fahrzeugbau bei ABS-Steuerelektroniken und im Motorenmanagement von Automobilen eingesetzt wird.  
<p>

Die beiden Entwickler, Klaus Schirmer und Alfred Schuster, hatten diese Basisinnovation in rasantem Tempo und mit gro&szlig;em wirtschaftlichen Erfolg umgesetzt und daf&uuml;r mehrere Patente angemeldet. Prof. Hartmut Weule, Daimler-Benz-Vorstand f&uuml;r Forschung und Technik, unterstrich: "Wir konnten in einer beispielhaften Zusammenarbeit innerhalb sehr kurzer Zeit zwischen TEMIC, den Zulieferern und Kunden die 'Planartechnologie' zur Marktreife entwickeln. Sie bringt beim Einsatz in der Kraftfahrzeug-Fertigung technische Vorteile und senkt zus&auml;tzlich die Kosten."
<p>

Mit der "Planartechnologie" wird das Volumen herk&ouml;mmlicher Kfz-Steuerelektroniken um die H&auml;lfte reduziert, w&auml;hrend die Kosten gleichzeitig um ein Drittel gesenkt werden. Die Elektronik f&uuml;r Antiblockiersysteme und andere Steuereinheiten beim Kraftfahrzeug sind extremen Umweltbedingungen wie beispielsweise gro&szlig;en Temperaturschwankungen ausgesetzt. Zudem kommt es beim Aktivieren des ABS durch den Stromflu&szlig; von mehreren Ampere zu einer starken Erhitzung der Bauteile. Diese Probleme l&ouml;st die TEMIC-Planartechnologie auf ganz einfache Weise. Durch das Auflaminieren der gedruckten Schaltung wirkt eine Aluminiumplatte als K&uuml;hlk&ouml;rper - und gleichzeitig als mechanische St&uuml;tze. Ein weiterer Vorteil: Die Module sind vollautomatisch produzierbar und lassen sich durch einfache Werkstofftrennung wiederverwerten.
<p>

Bis heute wurden bereits mehr als vier Millionen Autos mit ABS auf Basis der TEMIC-Planartechnologie ausgeliefert. In diesem Jahr erfolgte der Serienstart f&uuml;r das von TEMIC und Mercedes-Benz gemeinsam entwickelte Motormanagementsystem PLD, das ebenfalls auf der "Planartechnologie" basiert.
<p>

TEMIC ist ein Unternehmen im Daimler-Benz-Konzern und Spezialist f&uuml;r Mikroelektronik-Produkte und Kfz-Ausr&uuml;stungen. Weltweit besch&auml;ftigt TEMIC 15.000 Mitarbeiter und setzte 1995 drei Milliarden DM um.

<i>Stuttgart, 8. Oktober 1996</i><br>
Kein X f&uuml;r ein U lassen sich Experten im Bereich Mikroelektronik vormachen. Der abgebildete Feldeffekttransistor geh&ouml;rt zu einer neuartigen, von Daimler-Benz entwickelten Familie von Halbleiterkomponenten: den sogenannten
III-V Bauelementen.
<p>

Gegen&uuml;ber den bisher weltweit am h&auml;ufigsten eingesetzten Silizium (Si)-Halbleitern haben III-V Bauelemente zwei entscheidende Vorteile. Sie erreichen wesentlich h&ouml;here Geschwindigkeiten, weshalb sie vor allem in der Kommunikations- und Sensortechnik Anwendung finden. Weiterhin ist der Entwurf von Halbleitern mit "ma&szlig;geschneiderten" optischen und elektrischen Eigenschaften m&ouml;glich.
<p>

Ihre chemische Zusammensetzung - Elemente der dritten und f&uuml;nften Hauptgruppe des Periodensystems - gab diesen Halbleitern den Namen. Typische Vertreter sind zum Beispiel Gallium-Arsenid (GaAs) oder Indium-Phosphid (InP).
<p>

F&uuml;r Anbieter, Hersteller und Anwender von Sensor- und Kommunikationssystemen ergeben sich mit den III-V Halbleiterbauelementen viele neue Aussichten. Entwickelt werden beispielsweise allwettertaugliche Sensorsysteme im Bereich der Kraftfahrzeugsicherheit.

Oktober 1996</I> <BR>Auf die Frage &quot;Wieviele Motoren braucht ein Auto?&quot; lautet diespontane Antwort: &quot;einen.&quot; Fast richtig. Denn neben dem eigentlichenMotor, der das Fahrzeug antreibt, leisten schon in einem Mittelklasse-Fahrzeugim Schnitt bis zu 25 Elektromotoren einen Beitrag zum Fahrbetrieb beziehungsweisezum Fahrkomfort.</P><P>Elektrische Fensterheber zum Beispiel brauchen Motoren, die die Fensterscheibenauf und ab bewegen. Hilfsmotoren treiben aber auch den K&uuml;hlventilatorund die Kraftstoffpumpe an.</P><P>Eine &auml;u&szlig;erst elegante Hilfsmotor-Variante setzen Daimler-Benz-Forscherim K&uuml;hlkreislauf des Brennstoffzellenfahrzeuges Necar II ein: den seit1859 bekannten Reluktanzmotor, der die mechanisch einfachste Bauform einesElektromotors darstellt. Der Name leitet sich von der englischen Bezeichnungdes magnetischen Widerstands (&quot;reluctance&quot;) ab, auf dem die Funktionsweisedes Reluktanzmotors beruht.</P><P>Erst der Einsatz moderner Leistungselektronik und die immer g&uuml;nstigerwerdende Mikroelektronik verhelfen dem &auml;ltesten elektrischen Antriebskonzeptzu neuem Glanz. Denn damit l&auml;&szlig;t sich das Betriebsverhalten feinf&uuml;hligund kraftvoll einstellen. Dies macht den Reluktanzmotor zu einer echtenAlternative zu den herk&ouml;mmlichen Gleichstrommotoren.</P><P>Die in Necar II eingesetzten Reluktanzmotoren haben mehrere Vorteile.Die zugeh&ouml;rige Leistungselektronik ist unmittelbar in den Motor selbsteingebracht; ein eigener Schaltkasten f&uuml;r Steuerung, Sensorik, Schutz-und Diagnoseeinrichtungen er&uuml;brigt sich. Dies vermindert einerseitsdie Fertigungskosten. Andererseits verliert der Motor deutlich an Gr&ouml;&szlig;eund Gewicht.<BR></TD></TR></TABLE></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><BR><IMG SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif" WIDTH="592" HEIGHT="16" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="0"><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER" WIDTH="550"><H5><A HREF="60923_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>English</I>&nbsp;]</A> <A HREF="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../news_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Forschung &amp; Technik</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="60923_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Weiter</I>&nbsp;]</A> <A HREF="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Suche</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A> <A HREF="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Hilfe</I>&nbsp;]</A> </H5></TD></TR></TABLE></P><ADDRESS ALIGN=CENTER>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 01.10.1996</ADDRESS></BODY></HTML>

<i>Stuttgart, 23. September 1996</i><br>
Die &auml;u&szlig;ere Form erinnert vielleicht an einen plattgefahrenen Hirschk&auml;fer, das Muster an ein Zebra: So sehen Ladeluftgeh&auml;use von Nutzfahrzeugen aus, wenn Daimler-Benz-Forscher sie in Schwingungen versetzen.
<P>

Von den etwa sechzig mal achtzig Zentimeter gro&szlig;en Ladeluftgeh&auml;usen geht w&auml;hrend des Motorbetriebes eine starke Ger&auml;uschentwicklung aus. Aber erst wenn die Quellen der Ger&auml;uschentwicklung bekannt sind, kann man gezielt Ma&szlig;nahmen zur L&auml;rmunterdr&uuml;ckung ergreifen.
<P>

Deshalb ermitteln die Wissenschaftler durch eine Analyse des Ger&auml;uschspektrums genau die Schwingungszahlen pro Sekunde, bei denen starker L&auml;rm entsteht. F&uuml;r jede dieser sogenannten kritischen Resonanzfrequenzen erzeugen die Forscher dann mit Hilfe der holographischen Interferometrie - einer physikalischen Me&szlig;technik - ein Schwingungsbild; eben den "plattgefahrenen, gestreiften Hirschk&auml;fer".
<P>

Die Schwingungsbilder stellen die zweidimensionale Verteilung des jeweiligen Schwingungsausschlages auf dem Ladeluftgeh&auml;use dar. Mit ihrer Hilfe kann der zust&auml;ndige Konstrukteur das Geh&auml;use anschlie&szlig;end gezielt ver&auml;ndern, indem er die l&auml;rmerzeugenden Schwingformen am Bauteil behindert.

<i>Stuttgart, 17. September 1996</i><br>
Mu&szlig; Liebe sch&ouml;n sein. Doch hier ist nicht der Ku&szlig; zweier au&szlig;erirdischer Wesen festgehalten. Die Abbildung zeigt vielmehr eine neuartige Mischerdiode aus dem Daimler-Benz Forschungszentrum in Ulm.
<p>

Anwendungen in Klein- und Kleinstradarsystemen verlangen mikroelektronischen Bauteilen immer h&ouml;here Leistungen ab. Gleichzeitig mu&szlig; aber auch die Herstellung einfach und kosteng&uuml;nstig sein. Unter diesen Gesichtspunkten entwickelten Daimler-Benz-Forscher die neuartigen Mischerdioden f&uuml;r ber&uuml;hrungslose Sensorsysteme im Fahrzeugbereich sowie f&uuml;r Anwendungen zur Strahlungsmessung in F&uuml;hrungs- und Lenksystemen.
<p>

Mit der Mischerdiode auf Gallium-Arsenid-Basis verwirklichten die Forscher diese Anforderungen. Neue Heterostrukturen mit sehr d&uuml;nnen, indiumhaltigen Nanometer-Schichten in Oberfl&auml;chenn&auml;he (ein Nanometer entspricht einem Millionstel Millimeter) unterscheidet die Diode von vergleichbaren, herk&ouml;mmlichen Bauelementen. Sie erm&ouml;glicht es, die mikroelektronischen Eigenschaften der Diode bei gleichzeitig niedrigen Herstellungskosten weiter zu verbessern.
<p>

Die neue Struktur f&uuml;hrte bereits in kurzer Zeit aus der Grundlagenfoschung heraus zu sehr guten Ergebnissen im Produktbereich. Zur Zeit arbeiten die Forscher an der Serienreife. Dies er&ouml;ffnet vielversprechende M&ouml;glichkeiten im Bereich der Hochfrequenzsensorik und der Kommunikationstechnik.

September 1996</i><br>Angestrengt kneift die junge Autofahrerin die Augen zusammen und blickt auf die Stra&szlig;e vor ihr. Die Scheibenwischer leisten unabl&auml;ssig Schwerstarbeit. Aber die aufgewirbelte N&auml;sse vorausfahrender Fahrzeuge verhindert dennoch die freie Sicht nach vorn.<p>Die Verminderung der sogenannten Spr&uuml;hfahnenbildung ist Ziel der Zusammenarbeit von Forschern, Aerodynamikern und Konstrukteuren im Daimler-Benz-Konzern. Dazu entwickelten die Wissenschaftler ein Verfahren, das auf der Verfeinerung und Kombination g&auml;ngiger Methoden zur Spr&uuml;hfahnenerfassung beruht . Es erlaubt sowohl &ouml;rtlich begrenzte Messungen wie auch dreidimensionale, hochaufgel&ouml;ste Nachbildungen der gesamten Spr&uuml;hnebelfahne eines Fahrzeuges. Die Ergebnisse dieser Messungen werten Aerodynamiker aus, und Konstrukteure setzen sie im Fahrzeugbau um.<p>Die Me&szlig;gr&ouml;&szlig;e des Verfahrens ist die Intensit&auml;t des Streulichtes, das bei Beleuchtung der Wassertr&ouml;pfchen des Spr&uuml;hnebels entsteht. Technisch verwirklichen die Wissenschaftler die Streulichtmessungen durch Kombination der sogenannten Lichtschnitt-Technik (zweidimensionale Aufweitung eines Lichtstrahles) und der Videotechnik. Letztere erlaubt die bildhafte Darstellung der Me&szlig;werte. Erste Aufschl&uuml;sse geben Untersuchungen im Windkanal, die durch Aufnahme von Einzelbildern vor allem &ouml;rtlich begrenzte Messungen der Spr&uuml;hfahnen liefern.<p>Ziel der Streulichtmessungen auf der Teststrecke ist die Erfassung der gesamten vom Fahrzeug verursachten Spr&uuml;hfahne. Nur die &ouml;rtliche wie auch die zeitliche &Auml;nderung des Spr&uuml;hnebels - ausgedr&uuml;ckt in Streulichtintensit&auml;ten - liefern ein objektives Ma&szlig; f&uuml;r die Sichtbehinderung. Deshalb nehmen die Wissenschaftler eine ganze Reihe von Einzelbildern auf, wobei jedes Einzelbild die &ouml;rtliche Verteilung der Spr&uuml;hnebelintensit&auml;t zu einem bestimmten Zeitpunkt, das hei&szlig;t in einem bestimmten Abstand zum Fahrzeug enth&auml;lt.<p>Die Umrechnung des Spr&uuml;hnebelintensit&auml;ten in Sichtweiten erlaubt abschlie&szlig;end die objektive Beurteilung von Ma&szlig;nahmen zur Verminderung der Spr&uuml;hfahnenbildung. Und weniger Spr&uuml;hnebelfahnen bedeuten geringeres Unfallrisiko und erh&ouml;hte Verkehrssicherheit bei Regen.</table><p><br><img width=592 height=16 src="../../lines/db_592.gif"><p><table><td align=center width=550><h5><a href="60910_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>English</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Home</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../news_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Forschung &amp; Technik</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="60903_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Weiter</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Suche</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Dialog</i>&nbsp;]</a>   <a href="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Hilfe</i>&nbsp;]</a></h5></table><address>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 10.09.1996</address><p></center></body></html>

August 1996</i><br>Drau&szlig;en herrschen hochsommerliche Temperaturen. Und auch im Labor von Diplom-Ingenieur Eberhard Holder klettert das Thermometer auf &uuml;ber zwanzig Grad Celsius. Mitten im Raum jedoch scheint der Winter ausgebrochen zu sein: Kleine Eiskristalle &uuml;berziehen den dort aufgebauten Forschungsmotor mit einer wei&szlig;en Schicht.<p>An dem "tiefgek&uuml;hlten" Motor untersuchen Daimler-Benz-Forscher die Kraftstoffverbrennung bei Temperaturen bis minus zwanzig Grad Celsius. Anstatt aber das Labor in eine Tiefk&uuml;hltruhe zu verwandeln, verbannen die Wissenschaftler Kraftstoff, Luft und K&uuml;hlmittel in einen K&uuml;hlraum au&szlig;erhalb des Labors und leiten sie entsprechend temperiert in den Motor ein.<p>Die Vorteile dieser Vorgehensweise liegen auf der Hand. Der Effekt l&auml;&szlig;t sich mit geringen baulichen Ma&szlig;nahmen verwirklichen. Kraftstoff, Luft und K&uuml;hlmittel haben schnell die gew&uuml;nschte Temperatur, so da&szlig; nach Aussagen der Wissenschaftler bis zu 15 Messungen pro Tag m&ouml;glich sind. Und nicht zu vergessen sind die wesentlich angenehmeren Arbeitsbedingungen.<p>Hintergrund f&uuml;r die Kaltstartuntersuchungen sind die zuk&uuml;nftig zu erwartenden, niedrigen Abgasgrenzwerte. Allein &uuml;ber die Katalysatorwirkung seien diese Werte nicht mehr zu erreichen, erl&auml;utert Holder. Denn bei niedrigen Temperaturen, wie sie direkt nach dem Start herrschen, arbeiten Katalysatoren noch nicht optimal.<p>Der Forschungsmotor ist ein Einzylinderaggregat, dessen Verhalten an einen Vollmotor angepa&szlig;t ist. Dadurch k&ouml;nnen die Wissenschaftler im fr&uuml;hen Stadium der Motorentwicklung das Kaltstart- und Warmlaufverhalten von Vollmotoren untersuchen und bewerten. Den Kraftstofftransport im Motorinneren beobachten sie mit optischen Methoden.<p>Die am Forschungsmotor gewonnenen Erkenntnisse f&uuml;hren dann sofort zu Verbesserungsma&szlig;nahmen an den Fahrzeugmotoren. So kann die Anordnung und das Tropfenspektrum der Einspritzventile sowie die Luftstr&ouml;mung im Einla&szlig;kanal deutlich die Abgaswerte beim Kaltstart beeinflussen.</table><p><br><img width=592 height=16 src="../../lines/db_592.gif"><p><table><td align=center width=550><h5><a href="60820_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>English</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Home</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../news_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Forschung &amp; Technik</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="60813_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Weiter</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Suche</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Dialog</i>&nbsp;]</a>   <a href="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Hilfe</i>&nbsp;]</a></h5></table><address>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 20.08.1996</address><p></center></body></html>

August 1996</i><br>Nomen est omen - bei einem Auffahrunfall sind in der Regel die Sto&szlig;f&auml;nger die Leidtragenden. Fr&uuml;her waren die zerbeulten Metallbauteile ein Fall f&uuml;r den Schrottplatz. Heute jedoch sind Sto&szlig;f&auml;nger aus lackiertem Kunststoff und landen demzufolge nicht mehr beim "alten Eisen".<p>Den Recyclingbestrebungen f&uuml;r lackierte Kunststoffbauteile haben Wissenschaftler aus dem Daimler-Benz Forschungszentrum Ulm ein neues Verfahren beigef&uuml;gt. Die Vorteile dieses neuen Verfahrens: Die Kunststoffbauteile werden sehr schonend behandelt und der abgetrennte Lack flie&szlig;t wieder in den Produktionskreislauf ein.<p>F&uuml;r eine schonende Entlackung sorgen umweltfreundliche Quellmittel. Sie quellen den Lack auf den zerkleinerten Kunstoffteilen auf und verwandeln ihn in eine pastenartige Substanz, die sich durch schwache Reibkr&auml;fte abl&ouml;sen l&auml;&szlig;t. Mit Hilfe der sogenannten Gleitschleiftechnik erreichen die Wissenschaftler einen allseitigen und schonenden Abrieb des Lackes auf der gesamten Kunststoffoberfl&auml;che.<p>In den n&auml;chsten Schritten erfolgt die Trennung von Kunststoffteilen, abgel&ouml;sten Lackteilchen und Quellmittel. F&uuml;r die weitere Verwertung des Lackes w&auml;hlen die Wissenschaftler Bedingungen, unter denen sich dieser mit restlichem Quellmittel vollst&auml;ndig zu einem sogenannten Polyol umsetzt. Dieses wiederum ist ein Ausgangsstoff bei der Lackherstellung. Die gereinigten Kunststoffteile gehen als Rezyklat in den Kreislauf f&uuml;r neue Bauteile ein. Das Quellmittel wird wieder dem Entlackungsproze&szlig; zugef&uuml;hrt. Es bleiben keinerlei "Rest"-Abf&auml;lle zur&uuml;ck - der Kreislauf f&uuml;r lackierte Kunststoffteile ist vollst&auml;ndig geschlossen.Nach Absch&auml;tzung der anfallenden Mengen durch Reparatur und Altfahrzeugr&uuml;cknahme sind etwa vier Sto&szlig;f&auml;nger pro Automobil f&uuml;r die Wiederverwertung zu erwarten. Das Entlackungsverfahren mit Quellmitteln erm&ouml;glicht dabei ein hochwertiges Recycling dieser Kunststoffbauteile.</table><p><br><img width=592 height=16 src="../../lines/db_592.gif"><p><table><td align=center width=550><h5><a href="60813_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>English</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Home</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../news_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Forschung &amp; Technik</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="60806_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Weiter</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Suche</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Dialog</i>&nbsp;]</a>   <a href="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Hilfe</i>&nbsp;]</a></h5></table><address>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 13.08.1996</address><p></center></body></html>

Doch so manchem Postangestellten kann es passieren, da&szlig; er nach dem &Ouml;ffnen des Briefes nicht die erwarteten Liebesgr&uuml;&szlig;e in H&auml;nden h&auml;lt, sondern da&szlig; er ein flexibles St&uuml;ck Mikroelektronik aus dem Umschlag fischt.<p>Mit Hilfe dieses elektronischen Me&szlig;briefes k&ouml;nnen Postdienste den Weg der Postsendungen vom Absender zum Adressaten minuti&ouml;s verfolgen und eventuelle Schwachstellen lokalisieren. Der elektronische Me&szlig;brief ist das Herzst&uuml;ck des sogenannten Qualit&auml;ts-Testsystems (QTS), einem Produkt der Daimler-Benz-Tochter AEG Electrocom. Der Qualit&auml;ts-Testbrief pa&szlig;t in jeden DIN C6-Briefumschlag und unterscheidet sich &auml;u&szlig;erlich nicht von anderen Briefen.<p>Die Bef&ouml;rderung der Post unterliegt einem genauen Zeitplan, nach dessen Vorgabe die Postsendungen st&auml;ndig in Bewegung sein sollten. Darauf beruht das Me&szlig;prinzip des QTS. W&auml;hrend der ganzen Reise zeichnet der Me&szlig;brief dauerhaft seine Bewegungen auf. Aufgetragen in einem Intensit&auml;ts-Zeit-Schaubild ergeben die Me&szlig;werte dann f&uuml;r jede Transportart - zu Fu&szlig;, mit dem Auto, der Bahn oder per Flugzeug - eine charakteristische Kurve. Im Vergleich mit den Vorgaben des Zeitplanes erlaubt das System dann die Lokalisierung von Schwachstellen w&auml;hrend des Transportes.<p>Eine Schwachstelle w&auml;hrend der Bef&ouml;rderung k&ouml;nnte eine zu lange Unterbrechung sein. Dies dr&uuml;ckt sich im Intesit&auml;ts-Zeit-Schaubild als Null-Linie aus, die l&auml;nger ist, als sie der Zeitplan zul&auml;&szlig;t. Mit einer Aufl&ouml;sung bis zu einer halben Minute k&ouml;nnen die Postdienste diesen Abschnitt dann ganz genau der Leerung, der Sortierung im Absender-Postamt, dem Transport, der erneuten Sortierung im Ziel-Postamt oder schlie&szlig;lich der Zustellung zuordnen.<p>QTS ist im Gegensatz zu herk&ouml;mmlichen Testverfahren eine schnelle, genaue und vor allem den vollst&auml;ndigen Proze&szlig; - vom Absender zum Adressaten - erfassende Methode, um Verz&ouml;gerungen beim Transport von Postsendungen aufzusp&uuml;ren und die M&auml;ngel zu beheben. Mehrere Postdienste setzen das Qualit&auml;ts-Testsystem bereits ein.

Das Tal aber liegt unter einer dicken, undurchdringlichen Dunstglocke aus Rauch und Schmutz.<p>Vor allem Industriest&auml;dte und St&auml;dte mit viel Verkehr sind vom sogenannten Smog betroffen. Wenn er die St&auml;dte zu ersticken droht, tut Abhilfe Not. Doch bisher konnte der einzelne nur unter Einschr&auml;nkung seiner pers&ouml;nlichen Beweglichkeit eine Beitrag dazu leisten; n&auml;mlich indem er sein Fahrzeug stehen lie&szlig;.<p>Doch das mu&szlig; nicht so bleiben.  Mit der Entwicklung der Brennstoffzelle, einem alternativen Antriebssystem, vereinigten Daimler-Benz-Forscher Umweltschutz mit Mobilit&auml;t. Die Brennstoffzelle erzeugt auf elektrochemischem Wege Strom aus Wasserstoff und Sauerstoff. Als Abgas entsteht bei dieser Reaktion Wasser, sonst nichts. Dieses entweicht als Dampf durch den Auspuff. Im Fahrbetrieb belasten weder Kohlendioxid noch Stickoxide die Umwelt, keine Ru&szlig;partikel verschmutzen die Luft. Mensch und Natur k&ouml;nnen aufatmen.<p>Der erste Schritt in die Zukunft ist bereits getan. Schon heute f&auml;hrt das Forschungsfahrzeug "Necar II" v&ouml;llig schadstofffrei und ger&auml;uscharm mit Brennstoffzellenantrieb durch die Stra&szlig;en. Es bietet Platz f&uuml;r sechs Personen und hat eine Reichweite von &uuml;ber 250 Kilometern. Bei Spitzengeschwindigkeiten von 110 Kilometern pro Stunde sind auch Autobahnfahrten kein Problem. <p>Und die Entwicklungen gehen weiter: Zun&auml;chst will Daimler-Benz den emissionsfreien Antrieb in st&auml;dtischen Omnibussen verwirklichen. Bis zum Jahre 2010 soll der Brennstoffzellenantrieb dann f&uuml;r den Einbau in die A-Klasse serienreif sein.</table><p><br><img width=592 height=16 src="../../lines/db_592.gif"><p><table><td align=center width=550><h5><a href="60723_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>English</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Home</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../news_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Forschung &amp; Technik</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="60716_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Weiter</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Suche</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Dialog</i>&nbsp;]</a>   <a href="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Hilfe</i>&nbsp;]</a></h5></table><address>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 23.07.1996</address><p></center></body></html>

Beim genaueren Hinsehen jedoch entpuppen sich die "Teddygesichter" als Radar-Sensoren, die Wissenschaftler im Daimler-Benz Forschungszentrum Ulm entwickelt haben.<P>Das aktive Halbleiterbauelement der Mini-Radar-Chips ist eine sogenannte Lawinenlaufzeitdiode. Deren spezielle Eigenschaften erlauben neben der Strahlungsaussendung auch den Empfang von reflektierten Strahlen. Die Abbildung zeigt zwei um neunzig Grad gegeneinander verdrehte Mini-Radar-Sensor-K&ouml;pfe. Diese Anordung erm&ouml;glicht mit einem Zwei-Frequenz-Radar-Verfahren die gleichzeitige Messung von Geschwindigkeit und Abstand. Weitere Einsatzgebiete f&uuml;r Mini-Radar-Chips mit Sende- und Empfangseigenschaften sind Bewegungsmelder, Geschwindigkeitssensoren und Radarsensoren im Nahbereich.<P>Der Mini-Radar-Sensor-Kopf besteht aus einem nur wenige Millimeter gro&szlig;en Siliziumpl&auml;ttchen. Dieser Silizium-Chip ist auf ein rundes Transistorgeh&auml;use montiert, und zwei feine Golddr&auml;hte verbinden ihn mit den Anschlu&szlig;beinchen des Geh&auml;uses. Auf dem Chip ist mit Hilfe der bei Daimler-Benz entwickelten SIMMWIC-Technologie (Silizium Millimeterwellen Integrated Circuit) die Hochfrequenzschaltung mit der Lawinenlaufzeitdiode untergebracht. </table><p><br><img width=592 height=16 src="../../lines/db_592.gif"><p><table><td align=center width=550><h5><a href="60716_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>English</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Home</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../news_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Forschung &amp; Technik</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="60709_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Weiter</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Suche</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Dialog</i>&nbsp;]</a>   <a href="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Hilfe</i>&nbsp;]</a></h5></table><address>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 16.07.1996</address><p></center></body></html>

Juli1996</i><br>Im Operationssaal herrscht absolute Stille. Der Chirurg verlangt nach einem Skalpell, um den K&ouml;rper des Patienten f&uuml;r die Operation zu &ouml;ffnen. Doch wider Erwarten setzt er nicht zu einem gro&szlig;en Schnitt an, sondern schneidet lediglich eine kleinen &Ouml;ffnung in die Haut. Durch diese &Ouml;ffnung schiebt er ein langes Endoskop und beginnt mit dem operativen Eingriff.<P>Szenarien dieser Art sind keine Wunschvorstellung mehr. Immer mehr Entwicklungen im Bereich der Minimal-Invasiven Chirurgie (MIC) erm&ouml;glichen solch schonende Operationen mit verl&auml;ngerten, starren Instrumenten unter endoskopischer Kontrolle. Mit der sogenannten taktilen Fa&szlig;zange leisten auch Wissenschaftler der Daimler-Benz AG - in Kooperation mit der Dornier Medizintechnik und der Sektion f&uuml;r Minimal-Invasive Chirurgie, Professor Gerhard Bue&szlig;, Universit&auml;t T&uuml;bingen - einen Beitrag zu diesem Forschungsgebiet und zur Entlastung der Patienten.<P>Endoskopische Operationen haben gegen&uuml;ber herk&ouml;mmlichen, offenenen Eingriffen einen Schwachpunkt: Sie heben die funktionelle Einheit von Chirurgenhand und Instrument auf. Der Chirurg kann also umgebendes Gewebe oder Gef&auml;&szlig;e im K&ouml;rperinneren nicht ertasten. Und genau an diesem Punkt setzt die Technik der taktilen Fa&szlig;zange an. Sie &uuml;bermittelt Kr&auml;fte, die im K&ouml;rperinneren am Instrument auftreten, nach au&szlig;en an den Zangengriff weiter und erzeugt so ein Tastempfinden.<P>An den Maulteilen der Fa&szlig;zange befinden sich ein Mikrosensorarray und ein Kraftsensor. Ber&uuml;hrt ein Objekt die Maulteile, messen die Sensoren die daher stammenden (taktilen) Impulse, verarbeiten sie und leiten sie weiter an den Zangengriff. Dort nimmt ein Aktuatorarray die Information auf und regt durch eine entsprechende Gegenkraft die Fingerkuppen an. So erzeugen Sensor und Aktuator ein Tastempfinden beim Chirurgen und erm&ouml;glichen die sichere Durchf&uuml;hrung von endoskopischen Operationen.<P>Die taktile Fa&szlig;zange zeigt auf eindrucksvolle Weise, wie der Einsatz von Mikrosystemtechnik die taktilen Informationen f&uuml;r die MIC zur&uuml;ckgewinnt. Die Zange erlaubt au&szlig;erdem minimal-invasive Tastuntersuchungen zum Auffinden und Eingrenzen von krankhaft ver&auml;ndertem Gewebe. Gro&szlig;e, kompakte Organe (zum Beispiel Leber oder Bauchspeicheldr&uuml;se) lassen sich dabei genauso untersuchen wie bewegliche Organe (zum Beispiel Darm).<P>Der Einsatz der taktilen Fa&szlig;zange senkt die Belastung der Patienten durch operative Eingriffe. Gleichzeitig erh&ouml;ht sich die Qualit&auml;t der Versorgung bei Verringerung der Komplikationen. Prototypen der taktilen Fa&szlig;zange befinden sich derzeit im klinischen Test. </table><p><br><img width=592 height=16 src="../../lines/db_592.gif"><p><table><td align=center width=550><h5><a href="60709_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>English</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Home</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../news_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Forschung &amp; Technik</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="60702_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Weiter</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Suche</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Dialog</i>&nbsp;]</a>   <a href="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Hilfe</i>&nbsp;]</a></h5></table><address>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 09.07.1996</address><p></center></body></html>

Juli1996</i><br>Riesige Glaskolben, verbunden durch ein System von Glasr&ouml;hren und Klammern, muten wie der Arbeitsplatz in einer Hexenk&uuml;che an. Doch weit gefehlt - hier kocht nicht der Hexenmeister pers&ouml;nlich sein S&uuml;ppchen, sondern Daimler-Benz-Forscher f&uuml;hren verunreinigte Schaumstoffabf&auml;lle aus Polyurethan (PU) der Wiederverwertung zu.<p>Die Chemie des Polyurethanrecyclings - die sogenannte Glykolyse - ist kein Geheimnis und l&auml;&szlig;t sich problemlos auf sortenreine PU-Abf&auml;lle anwenden. Mit einem mechanischen Kniff ist es den Wissenschaftlern aus dem Daimler-Benz Forschungsinstitut Ulm gelungen, jetzt auch verunreinigte Schaumstoffabf&auml;lle wiederzuverwerten. Damit lassen sich PU-Reste aus Verbundbauteilen, Au&szlig;enverkleidungen, Sitzschaumstoffen oder Lackreststoffen wieder zu neuen Bauteilen verarbeiteten.<p>Und das geht folgenderma&szlig;en: Vor dem eigentlichen Umwandlungsproze&szlig; f&uuml;hren die Wissenschaftler eine Vorglykolyse durch. In einem Scherreaktor kneten zwei F&ouml;rderschnecken den auf &uuml;ber 180 Grad Celsius erhitzten, z&auml;hfl&uuml;ssigen PU-Abfall mit Glykol durch. Es entsteht ein "Vorglykolysat", das den Ausgangsstoff f&uuml;r das weitere Recycling darstellt. Ohne diese Vorbehandlung w&uuml;rden die Fremdstoffe das R&uuml;hrwerk des Reaktors w&auml;hrend des Prozesses in kurzer Zeit verkleben. Die hohe Scherbeanspruchung w&auml;hrend des Knetens zerkleinert die Verunreinigungen auf etwa drei&szlig;ig Tausendstel Millimeter. In dieser Gr&ouml;&szlig;e stellen die Fremdstoffe keine Gefahr mehr f&uuml;r das R&uuml;hrwerk dar. Ganz im Gegenteil: Fein verteilt wirken sie hinterher als F&uuml;llstoff im Kunststoff.<p>Im Vergleich mit Polyurethanbauteilen aus "frischen" Ausgangsstoffen kann sich das wiederverwertete Polyurethan aus verunreinigten Abf&auml;llen durchaus sehen lassen. Mechanische Kennwerte wie zum Beispiel Biegefestigkeit oder Schlagz&auml;higkeit sind vergleichbar mit den Werten von Neuware. Eine erste Kostenabsch&auml;tzung bei Daimler-Benz zeigte, da&szlig; die Wiederverwertung von verunreinigtem Polyurethan durchaus konkurrenzf&auml;hig ist.</table><p><br><img width=592 height=16 src="../../lines/db_592.gif"><p><table><td align=center width=550><h5><a href="60702_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>English</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Home</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../news_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Forschung &amp; Technik</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="60625_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Weiter</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Suche</i>&nbsp;]</a><a href="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Dialog</i>&nbsp;]</a>   <a href="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Hilfe</i>&nbsp;]</a></h5></table><address>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 02.07.1996</address><p></center></body></html>

Daimler-Benz is the largest industrial group in the whole of Europe. Combining a powerful blend of expertise and experience, Daimler-Benz's business interests extend from the field of traffic and transport to the production of components and systems, and include the provision of services associated with its key business sectors. With more than 310,000 employees worldwide (December, 1995), the company had a turnover of more than 100 billion DM in 1995.

1996 and 1997 are to be years of transition at Daimler-Benz. With the AEG corporation to be amalgamated into the Daimler-Benz AG by mid-1996, the aim is to tighten-up the business portfolio and improve the overall profit structure. Railway systems, microelectronics and postal automation are to be controlled directly by Daimler-Benz with diesel drive systems coming under the industrial control of Mercedes-Benz. Now that financial support for Fokker has been terminated, Daimler-Benz Aerospace's activities will concentrate essentially upon the Airbus project.<br>

<TD WIDTH=20>

<TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=275>
In the future, too, the company will continue to trim its structure so as to create an effective synergy of technical know-how and corporate engagement: Mercedes-Benz will concentrate on its role as a manufacturer of passenger cars and commercial vehicles; Daimler-Benz Aerospace on activities in the areas of aircraft and space systems, defence technology, alongside the production of civil systems; Daimler-Benz Interservices (debis) on its role as the supplier of sophisticated services.

<TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=275>Daimler-Benz and Asea Brown Boveri AG (ABB) have merged operations in the rail sector and joined forces to form Adtranz. The result of a joint 50%-50% holding, Adtranz can profit from ABB's leading role in the field of microelectronics and from the exceptional position enjoyed by Daimler-Benz in the areas of mechanical engineering and transport systems. Adtranz is therefore perfectly poised to generate the innovative and world-beating solutions needed to solve the transport problems of today.<BR>

<TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=275>

The product range on offer at Adtranz incorporates just about everything that can run on rails: electric and diesel locomotives, high-speed trains, intercity and local trains, underground and city transit systems, streetcars as well as fully-automated passenger transport systems, freight cars, train security systems, transport management systems, rail supply systems, and, finally, maintenance and repair services.<br>



<TD WIDTH=20>



<TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=275>



Adtranz has an extremely high profile worldwide and is active in Australia, Asia, India, Europe, North and South America, and Africa. Made up a large number of smaller, customer-oriented branches, the group has a decentralized organizational structure. With the help of the support and cooperation they enjoy from technology centers based throughout the world, these locally operating companies are then able to offer an optimal package of attractively-priced know-how and expertise designed to match the their customers' needs.<P>

(ECA), Irving, Texas, to the Siemens Automation division, based in Nuremberg, Germany. With this sale, Daimler-Benz largely completes its effort to focus the group's business on traffic, transport and services. Following the sale, the Daimler-Benz group will be comprised of 23 business units compared to 35 in mid-1995.<p>The companies will be taken over in full by Siemens. The acquisition will enter into effect retrospectively from January 1, 1997, according to statements made by the two companies on January 13. The contracts have already been signed. The take-over is subject to the approval of the cartel authorities. The companies have not made any statement concerning purchase price.<p>The business unit Recognition and Sorting Systems in which the worldwide activities of AEG Electrocom are housed has an excellent position on the market and is performing successfully. However, since the dissolution of AEG in 1996, this sector has no longer ranked among the fields of activity which now constitute the focus of the Daimler-Benz group. When Daimler-Benz took over the US company ECA in 1994, it already emphasised that it was hoping to find a suitable investor. With AEG Electrocom, Siemens will acquire the perfect complement to the existing activities in its Automation division.<p>AEG Electrocom is a leading supplier in the field of sorting and recognition systems for postal automation. In 1995 the company recorded worldwide sales of approximately DM 650 mill. Sales for 1996 are expected to total approximately DM 1 billion. In recent years the American market has accounted for around 70 % of total sales. Electrocom employs a workforce of just under 3,000 worldwide, around 40 % of these in the USA and around 60 % in Germany. Approximately 10,000 Electrocom letter sorting systems are currently in use in 29 countries around the world.</TD></TR></TABLE></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><BR><IMG SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif" WIDTH="592" HEIGHT="16" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></P><P ALIGN=CENTER><TABLE><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER" WIDTH="550"><H5><A HREF="70113_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch&nbsp;]</I> </A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home&nbsp;]</I></A><A HREF="../news_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>News&nbsp;]</I> </A><A HREF="61107_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next&nbsp;]</I></A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search&nbsp;]</I> </A><AHREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog&nbsp;]</I> </A><A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help&nbsp;]</I></A></H5></TD></TR></TABLE></P><ADDRESS ALIGN=CENTER>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 01/13/1996</ADDRESS></BODY></HTML>

Sales revenues for January to September 1996 were up 11 % to DM 75.9 billion. As already reported at the end of August, the company expects consolidated earnings for the second half of the year to surpass those of the first half of the year (operating profit January to June 1996: DM 827 mill.).<p>This trend vindicates our course of focusing on high-growth, high-earnings fields of activity, commented Daimler-Benz Chairman J&uuml;rgen E. Schrempp.<p>Summing up the first nine months of 1996, the Daimler-Benz letter to shareholders published today also states that Mercedes-Benz sales revenues increased by 8 % to just under DM 57 billion during this period. Comparably calculated sales revenues of Daimler-Benz Aerospace (Dasa) increased by 18 % to just under DM 8.3 billion. Daimler-Benz InterServices (debis) maintained its dynamic growth, with a 14 % rise in sales to DM 9.8 billion.<p>Revenues also increased during the period under view in the businesses which report directly to Daimler-Benz AG (Rail Systems/Adtranz, Microelectronics/Temic, Diesel Engines/MTU Friedrichshafen, Recognition and Sorting Systems/Electrocom). These businesses posted total sales revenues of DM 5.5 billion.<p>This positive trend in business seems set to continue in the fourth quarter of the year, so that Daimler-Benz expects full-year revenues of over DM 105 billion. It is particularly encouraging to note that the sharp increases mentioned above were achieved despite relatively modest trends in numerous product markets and regions. The Daimler-Benz group registered increased business in virtually all parts of the world.<p>On September 30, 1996, the Daimler-Benz group had 290,031 employees worldwide (comparable figure for 1995: 291,226), of whom 223,106 (September 30, 1995: 226,701) worked in Germany and 66,925 (September 30, 1995: 64,525) elsewhere.<p>The positive trend in performance at Mercedes-Benz is due above all to new, successful products and significant productivity advances. Sales revenues increased during the period to DM 56.9 billion. An above-average increase of 11 % to DM 22.6 billion was recorded in Germany, and strong growth was also recorded in Western Europe outside Germany (+ 18%), the USA (+ 11%) and Japan (+ 21%).<p>Car sales revenues increased by 16 %, while sales of commercial vehicles showed a slight decline. This is attributable to the unfavourable conditions for trucks in Germany and important overseas markets and the model change in the heavy-duty segment. The companys world sales of commercial vehicles increased in unit terms however by 5 % to 248,600 vehicles, largely spurred by van business. <p>The Mercedes-Benz dealer network sold 491,000 cars to customers during the period under review. Consolidated unit sales, which do not take account of reduced stocks in the dealer network,  totalled 481,300 units, 13 % more than in the first nine months of 1995.<p>The largest increases in revenues were achieved by the Propulsion Systems (+ 48 %) and Space Systems (+ 51 %) business units of Daimler-Benz Aerospace (Dasa). Aircraft sales (+ 5%) and sales of the Defence and Civil Systems business unit ( + 3%) on the other hand increased only slightly. Orders received in the first nine months of 1996 were 89 % up on the first nine months of 1995, at DM 13.6 billion. 269 aircraft were ordered from Airbus in the first three quarters of the year, as many as in the previous three years together.<p>Dasa continued to move forward with its competitiveness-improvement measures, thus further reducing the dependence of its results on the value of the dollar.<p>The dynamic expansion in business of Daimler-Benz InterServices (debis) was achieved above all by the Systemhaus (+ 14%), Financial Services (+ 12%) and Mobile Communication Services (+70%) units. The Marketing Services unit was made independent.<p>In Rail Systems, the Daimler-Benz share in the revenues of the joint venture Adtranz was DM 1.9 billion. Orders worth DM 2.1 billion were received for the period from January to September. In October, further large orders were received from China, Singapore, Turkey and Thailand.<p>Sales of Microelectronics from January to September totalled DM 1.8 billion (+ 11%). Orders received fell by 4% to DM 1.7 billion, primarily due to the weakness of the semiconductor market.<p>The Diesel Engines business unit increased its revenues by 13% to DM 1.1 billion. Orders received rose by 14% to DM 1.2 billion, above all in the high-growth segments Distributed Power Supply Systems and Commercial Ships.<p>Recognition and Sorting Systems doubled its sales revenues to DM 700 million, chiefly due to the invoicing of large orders from the US and German Post Offices.

<tr><td valign=top width=380>In the first nine months of 1996, Daimler-Benz generated 
revenues totaling DM 75.9 billion. After making adjustments 
for changes within the consolidated group, this represents an 
11% increase over the first nine months of the previous year. 
All of the corporate units and directly managed business units 
contributed to the expansion, which was experienced in almost 
every market. Mercedes-Benz remained the principal source 
of consolidated revenues, contributing just under three 
quarters of the total; debis contributed 12% and Dasa 10%. 
The remaining 7% were distributed among the directly 
managed business units Rail Systems, Microelectronics, Diesel 
Engines, and Recognition and Sorting Systems. In addition to 
the growth in revenues, the positive development of profits in 
the first half year continued.<p>On September 30, Daimler-Benz had 290,031 employees 
worldwide, of which just under 11,000 represent the pro rata 
share (50%) of the Adtranz joint venture founded by 
Daimler-Benz and ABB at the beginning of 1996. At 
Mercedes-Benz and Dasa, and in the Microelectronics and 
Diesel Engines divisions, the number of employees declined as 
compared to September 1995, while the number rose 
markedly at debis in particular.</p>

<table>
<tr><td valign=top width=380>Despite the rather restrained development of important 
automotive markets, the positive business trend at 
Mercedes-Benz continued in the third quarter of 1996. The 
expansion was largely the result of successful new products as 
well as a definite boost in productivity and the related 
improvement in the price/value ratio.<p>In total, Mercedes-Benz revenues rose 8% to DM 56.9 
billion. Business volume in Germany was up 11% to DM 22.6 
billion; this represents an above-average increase. But 
Mercedes-Benz also reported vigorous growth in revenues in 
the rest of Western Europe, in the USA, and in Japan. The 
expansion was experienced primarily in the passenger car 
sector, where revenues were up 16%. In commercial vehicles, 
on the other hand, revenues were slightly below the high 
previous year&#146;s level, a drop that is related above all to the 
unfavorable market situation for trucks in Germany and 
important overseas markets and to the model change in the 
heavy-duty trucks class.</p>
<p>In passenger cars, the first nine months of 1996 were 
characterized by the Mercedes-Benz product offensive. The 
T-Models of the C- and E-Class, the SLK roadster, and the 
V-Class minivans were exceptionally well-received by our 
customers. With 481,300 units sold worldwide (including 
off-road vehicles) sales in the passenger car sector were up 
13% compared with the first three quarters of 1995. The 
development was especially encouraging in Germany, where 
sales rose 17% and Mercedes-Benz expanded its market 
share. In foreign markets, a total of nearly 280,000 passenger 
cars were sold, surpassing the all-time record set in 1995 by 
another 10%. In Japan alone, sales advanced by 45%, but 
even in the stagnant US market a 20% increase was reported. 
Mercedes-Benz thus continued to expand its competitive 
position in the markets of the Triad above all.</p>
<p>While sales of the S-Class remained below the level achieved 
a year earlier as a result of the new tax treatment of business 
cars in Germany in particular, the trend in the E-Class was 
exceptionally positive and the C-Class maintained its strong 
market position. Because of the favorable sales situation, 
passenger car production was increased by 10% to almost 
485,000 units.</p>
<p>At 248,600 units, sales of Mercedes-Benz commercial 
vehicles were 5% higher than in the first nine months of the 
previous year, again for the most part thanks to the 
Mercedes-Benz product strategy. For instance, the market 
position in Western Europe was clearly expanded with the 
successful Sprinter and Vito vans. Van sales rose in Western 
Europe outside of Germany above all (up 46%), but also in 
Germany, where an 8% increase was reported in an otherwise 
recessive market. With 105,000 vans sold worldwide, sales in <br>
that sector surpassed the same period in 1995 by 29%. The 
new heavy-duty truck Actros was received favorably by our 
Western European customers, which is also confirmed by the 
development of incoming orders. Because of the difficult 
situation in important markets, however, and because the 
model change in the heavy-duty class was not completed 
before October, truck sales did not reach the level of the 
previous year, most notably in Western Europe. New 
registrations of Mercedes-Benz trucks over 6 tons were up 
5% to 21,700 units in Western Europe outside Germany, 
whereas in Germany the weak market condition was 
responsible for an 11% drop to 23,100 vehicles. EvoBus 
GmbH was able to sell 4,700 complete buses and bus chassis 
of the Mercedes-Benz and Setra makes (up 12%) despite an 
aggressive market in terms of pricing and competition. The 
Unimog business received a significant boost from a large 
order for 540 units.</p>
<p>The overseas companies sold a total of 98,000 commercial 
vehicles (1995: 102,400). While sales were down 24% to 
28,800 units at Mercedes-Benz do Brasil because of the 
weakness of the market on the whole, they rose 69% at 
Mercedes-Benz Argentina, reaching 5,400 units. Thanks to a 
high order backlog, Freightliner was able to increase its sales 
by another 4% to 59,000 units, in spite of the cyclical 
downturn of the North American market for heavy-duty 
trucks. At Mercedes-Benz Mexico sales were up 43% to 
1,600 units as compared with the very weak situation one year 
earlier.</p>
<p>In the first nine months of 1996, commercial vehicle 
production at Mercedes-Benz totaled 246,100 units, which 
was slightly under the previous year&#146;s level. A total of 154,900 
vehicles were produced in Europe and 91,200 at our overseas 
plants.</p>

<tr><td valign=top width=380>In 1996, Dasa resolutely continued to pursue the measures it 
had introduced to improve profitability. In late August an 
agreement for permanent cost reductions was reached 
between management and employee representatives at 
Daimler-Benz Aerospace Airbus GmbH, as had been 
achieved earlier for other divisions. Thus Dasa is also further 
reducing its dependence on the US dollar.<p>The corporate unit&#146;s revenues for January to September 1996 
were up 18% as compared with the corresponding value for 
1995, reaching a total of DM 8.3 billion. The growth was 
predominantly contributed by Propulsion Systems (up 48%), 
which in addition to a revival of business in general also 
recorded higher invoicing for jet engines, and by Space 
Systems (up 51%), where the projects XMM (X-Ray 
Multi-Mirror Mission) and Envisat generated significantly 
higher revenues. Business volume grew only slightly in the 
Aircraft division (up 5%) and in Defense and Civil Systems 
(up 3%). Because of the noticeable increase in deliveries of jet 
engine components, the revenues generated in the USA rose 
by 37%. A significant increase was also reported in Germany 
(up 11%), the other EU countries (up 18%), and in the other 
markets (up 13%).</p>
<p>The high demand for Airbus aircraft and propulsion systems, 
coupled with several large orders in the Space Systems 
division, meant that incoming orders at Dasa were up 89% to 
DM 13.6 billion. At Airbus alone, orders in the first nine 
months, at 269 aircraft, were as high as in the last three years 
together. In Defense and Civil Systems, incoming orders grew 
in the sectors of pilot and information systems, equipment for 
crisis response forces, and Nortel Dasa Network Systems in 
particular.</p>

<tr><td valign=top width=380>In the Rail Systems division, the pro rata share in revenues of 
the joint venture ABB Daimler-Benz Transportation (Adtranz) 
was DM 1.9 billion. Incoming orders totaled DM 2.1 billion; 
additional large orders from China, Singapore, Turkey, and 
Thailand were received in October.<p>In Microelectronics, revenues in the first nine months of 1996 
reached DM 1.8 billion, an 11% increase over the previous 
year. The growth in revenues was especially pronounced in the 
motor vehicle electronics and gas generator sectors (up 26% 
and 21% respectively); both the semiconductor and the 
microsystems sectors reported a moderate 3% expansion. 
Incoming orders were not as high as in the first nine months of 
1995 (down 4%). This was above all caused by the weak 
semi-conductor market.</p>
<p>In the Diesel Engines division, revenues and incoming orders 
rose by 13% and 14% respectively. For the most part, this 
was due to the intensified expansion of the emerging business 
segments decentralized energy systems and commercial ships. 
But business in the navy vessel and military vehicle sectors also 
surpassed the previous year&#146;s volume.</p>
<p>In Recognition and Sorting Systems, revenues have doubled 
due to the invoicing of large orders, most notably those placed 
by the US and German postal services. Once again, incoming 
orders were higher than revenues, and additional large orders 
are expected for the fourth quarter of 1996.</p>

<tr><td valign=top width=380>The revival of business achieved in the first nine months of 
1996 will most likely continue in the final quarter of the year. 
For the year as a whole, we therefore anticipate our business 
volume to top DM 105 billion, a definite increase over the 
previous year&#146;s total, which after making adjustments for 
changes in the consolidated group was DM 96.9 billion. All of 
the corporate units and directly managed business units will 
contribute to this growth.<p>In the passenger car sector at Mercedes-Benz, sales are 
expected to reach well over 600,000 vehicles. Because of the 
success of the new vans in Western Europe, sales in the 
Commercial Vehicle division will again surpass the 1995 
record of 320,000 units. The recently launched Actros should 
give new impetus in the fourth quarter to the difficult truck 
business in Western Europe.</p>
<p>After making adjustments for structural changes, Dasa is 
expecting a revival of business for the current fiscal year 
primarily in the civil sector.</p>
<p>Because of the favorable order situation at debis and in the 
directly managed business units, we anticipate a double-digit 
increase in revenues in these segments for 1996.</p>
<p>Thanks to the clear advancements in productivity that we have 
realized in the various sectors of the Daimler-Benz group, and 
due to the more favorable currency relations, the higher 
business volume in almost every division is accompanied by a 
favorable development in profits. In the truck business in 
Western Europe and the Microelectronics division we have 
introduced measures to improve results, which will become 
effective as from 1997. We continue to expect that the 
group&#146;s profit will further improve in the second half of 
1996</p>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Ladies and Gentlemen!</FONT>
<p>

1995 was a dramatic year in the history of Daimler-Benz - a history that goes back more than 100 years. We, the Board of Management that has been running the company since May 1995, decided to make a clean break. We made some decisions that will bring Daimler-Benz back to the high profitability on which our companys outstanding reputation is founded.
<P>

Our primary objective was to cut losses. The Board of Management therefore analyzed the group portfolio using strict criteria of profitability, and took consistent steps to tighten up structures wherever there was an urgent need. We also cut divested business areas in which further investment no longer made good economic sense.
<P>

As a result of these decisions, your company, Daimler-Benz, now has a more concentrated group profile organized around 28 fields instead of 35. This process is still in progress.  These actions also called into question and, to a certain extent, reversed a number of policy decisions from earlier periods. Important changes in external factors forced us to take these actions. The decisions were necessary to quickly bring Daimler-Benz back to an internationally acceptable level of profitability.
<P>

The primary aim of the Board of Management is to offer you, the shareholders in Daimler-Benz AG, attractive prospects for return on investment. We continue to hold to the principle of being open with you, even with sensitive decisions, and to provide information as quickly as possible, offering you a transparent view with which to judge our course of action.
<P>

This includes the fact that we had to revise our anticipated profits to losses at the end of June 1995. It had become clear, contrary to our expectations at the time, that the devaluation of the dollar, which affects our aviation business in particular, is not just a short-term change. The tremendous realignments between the European currencies also negatively impacted our profits in 1995. For us, as a company with international activities, this is crystal clear evidence of the need for a European currency union, even if only a few countries currently fulfill the prerequisites for such an arrangement.
<P>

At our release of our half-year results in New York, in September 1995, we announced that the Board of Management would introduce fundamental solutions as quickly as possible for two large unprofitable companies: AEG Daimler-Benz Industrie and the aircraft division - especially the Dutch aircraft manufacturer Fokker. In October we informed you of negotiations aimed at settling the problems of AEG Daimler-Benz Industrie. In mid-November we announced the final decision on the Dasa competition initiative. Once this is implemented, all Dasa divisions will be profitable, even with the dollar as low 
as 1.35 marks over the long term.
<P>

On January 17, 1996, we decided to restructure AEG, which will lead to a merger of AEG Aktiengesellschaft with Daimler-Benz AG before the end of 1996. Finally, on January 22, we ended our financial support of Fokker. This happened after the other major stockholder, the Dutch government, was unwilling to make an adequate contribution to the rescue operation after seven months of negotiations. In view of our 40% share in Fokker it was no longer acceptable, in the interest of our stockholders, to continue shouldering the entire risk alone. On March 15 of this year Fokker filed for bankruptcy.
<P>

We also decided to restructure our business involvement in the French software company Cap Gemini Sogeti. We will now have more influence in working together with debis Systemhaus to bring about an internationalization of the information technology business.
<P>

We have thus reached decisions on all of the topics which we presented as urgent in September. In the 1995 financial statements, these streamlining measures appear as extraordinary charges and special influences amounting to DM 5.1 billion. Some of these measures take the form of structural expenditures and also cut into the profits from business activities. At the same time, the additional reserves set aside to cover impending losses in the aircraft business are not included in this figure. The Board of Management is convinced that the groundwork has now been laid to put the group back on a successful course as quickly as possible.
<P>

Due to the above factors, the annual shortfall of DM 5.7 billion in the consolidated financial statements does not reflect the progress that the group divisions were able to achieve in the past year through numerous new and successful products and services, additional streamlining, and especially through increasing internationalization, which will expand net productivity into future-oriented markets. Mercedes-Benz has set new standards in these areas.
<P>

Despite operational improvements - results of operational activities were in the black again in the second half of the year - and the companys continuing high asset value, the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management have recommended that no dividend be paid for 1995.
<P>

A decisive measure of our management, however, is the market price of our stock. Our goal is not to maximize short-term profits, but to ensure high medium- and long-term profitability.
<P>

You will therefore also see in this report that despite forceful measures, our investments were significantly higher in 1995 than in previous years. We have expanded sites or opened new ones, both at home and abroad, wherever we anticipate positive results. We have kept research spending at a high level, in order to keep our position at the forefront of pioneering innovations and continuing developments in our markets.
<P>

The basis of our success is the dedication of our employees to our ambitious goals. Their potential for advancement certainly does not go unnoticed. In fact, advancement is guaranteed by the new and more efficient structures in the group headquarters that were implemented in June 1995. Responsibility will be transferred even more clearly than before to those employees close to operations. Only such flat hierarchies, organized into decentralized, flexible units, set free the entrepreneurial initiative in which a corporate culture can develop. That also includes the introduction of performance-based compensation and new dimensions of control, which measure the companys results directly against the reference figures produced according to U.S. standards. These reforms are being pushed forward in all parts of the group.
<P>

For many employees this is a challenge, but there are also some to whom it is a painful process, especially if improving efficiency means eliminating their jobs. But we at Daimler-Benz are not the only ones who have had to learn that clinging to received traditions ultimately leads to a dead end. In the future, our social structures, our work and production methods, our cost base must stand up much more consistently to those of successful international competitors. We must therefore channel our entire creativity into inventing new structures and forms of cooperation. 
<P>

We must do everything in our power to make Germany an attractive and internationally competitive business site. Willingness to pursue such a dynamic course must be the standard by which we measure those who hold positions of responsibility in Germany, as well as the sense of sociopolitical responsibility of its business leaders.
<P>

Given this background, if we decide in favor of foreign sites, for reasons of currency or the market, this is not a rejection of Germany as a business location. Instead, we thereby secure jobs by supplying high-value components to those production sites abroad.
<P>

We, the Board of Management of Daimler-Benz, will face up to this responsibility. This is evident in the results of negotiations between management and employees in 1995 and again in recent weeks, in which operating agreements, some of the many necessary work alliances, were reached to confirm and secure German operations. We will also display the necessary pioneering spirit and the resolve to follow new paths in 1996.
<P>

The course we have set will return the company back to the profit column during this year. However, it is our desire to satisfy both your justifiable expectations and our ambitious goals. For that reason we will continue to inform you of further forceful measures in the months to come. At the same time, we intend to be just as deliberate in building up businesses that meet our income and profit expectations. We are convinced that we are on the right track with this new orientation.

<TD VALIGN=TOP align=right width=275>Consolidated revenues at Daimler-Benz reached DM 103.5 billion in 1995. The 1% increase over the previous year was largely attributable to the favorable business development at Mercedes-Benz. In the interest of permanently improving the earning power of the company, we reviewed and restructured all of our activities in the second half of the year. At AEG Daimler-Benz Industrie and at Dasa<br> 

<TD width=20>

<TD VALIGN=TOP align=left width=275>in particular, we introduced rigorous measures to eliminate the sources of loss that in recent years have had a negative effect on the company,s income position. The DM 5.7 billion consolidated loss is predominantly the result of non-recurring expenses related to streamlining the group portfolio. In view of our latest decisions, these expenses had to be taken into account in the 1995 financial statements.<br>

This tool, which facilitates the investigation of component installation and removal and the verification of dimensions and fitting clearances, greatly expedites the development of new products.<p>With this software, all original CAD data - irrespective of its origin - is fed to the computer. The programme can integrate data from various CAD systems, at the same time presenting it in visual form. The projection of a CAD model can be rotated, or modified in other ways, on a real-time basis - i.e. without delay due to computation. Cross-sections can be presented, for instance; individual components can be removed or exploded views generated, and the viewer can even "fly through" the model.<p>For the presentation of data within the computer programme, the researchers have selected two models with which modifications to an object can be carried out in real time. The so-called "advanced b-rep" (boundary representation) model makes use of all data acquired, whilst the "faceted" model makes do with a much smaller volume of data for presentation on the computer screen. A constant link exists between the individual facets and the precise b-rep model, so that the calculations required for rotating or otherwise modifying the model are based on the precise b-rep model at all times.<p>Computer-aided design (CAD) in the development of new products dispenses with the need for making scale models: with the help of CAD data, objects can be presented on screen in three-dimensional form. With the development of CAD software, the Daimler-Benz researchers are helping expedite this process.</TABLE><P><BR><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="61230_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../news_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Research &amp; Technology</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="61223_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>  <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 12/30/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

These cells, which take the form of interconnected channels of conducting material, are only a thousandth of a millimetre across. The researchers have ascertained that light has a highly sensitive effect on the conductivity of these narrow channels; this effect can be utilised in the development of a new type of light sensor with a high degree of internal amplification.<p>The small structural size of the individual photosensitive pixels (photoelectric cells) opens up interesting opportunities for application as light sensors in the form of a pixel array - for image analysis in road traffic, for instance, or as an "artificial eye" for multimedia applications. The detector properties of the individual nanosensors (pixels) can be readily influenced by modifications to their lateral geometry. In addition to these qualities, the new component from Daimler-Benz Research is distinguished above all by its ease of manufacture.</TABLE><P><BR><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="61223_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../news_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Research &amp; Technology</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="61217_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>  <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 12/23/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

It was, they argued, a        project which could help prevent further destruction of        the Brazilian rainforest, which &#150; it is now        recognised &#150; is so important for the stability of        the global climate. </p>        <p>The main question directed at Daimler-Benz was whether        the technological expertise of Daimler-Benz /        Mercedes-Benz do Brasil could be used to find a method of        processing the natural materials of the rainforest using        &quot;appropriate technologies&quot; and whether the        company might also be interested in making use of such        raw materials.</p>        <p>Daimler-Benz and Mercedes-Benz do Brasil joined in        this project, supplying financial and technological        support from mid-1992 onwards for a period of three years        in conjunction with UNICEF. During that period, the        Daimler-Benz group provided funding to the tune of 1        million US dollars &#150; in addition to its own research        costs and other technological expenditure, especially the        &quot;Tecnologia Ecol&Ucirc;gica&quot; project launched by        Mercedes-Benz do Brasil and the work undertaken by        Daimler-Benz Research.</p>        <p>Since the completion of the first phase in mid-1995,        the project has continued to run under the aegis of the        University of Bel&egrave;m and Daimler-Benz, and has received        further financial and technological support from        Daimler-Benz. The aim of the 1995 to 1997 phase is to        explore the scope for utilising natural products such as        natural fibres for reinforcement materials and for using        vegetable oils and resins to produce constituent        components for plastics.</p>        <p>From 27th to 29th November 1996, with financial        support from Daimler-Benz, the POEMA programme is        organising a scientific congress in Bel&egrave;m on the scope        for technology transfer to other tropical regions of the        world &#150; and this has attracted participants from all        parts of the globe.</p>        <p><b>The challenge of the &quot;Bel&egrave;m Project&quot;</b></p>        <p>Three main requirements had to be fulfilled if the        project was to have any success:</p>        <p>1. First, cleared areas had to be re-forested in such        a way as to ensure continuous yield in the form of fruit,        fibre and wood and to allow several &#150; if possible        different &#150; harvests per year.</p>        <p>2. A permanent supply of water had to be made        available, in order to provide a further incentive for        the inhabitants not to leave their homes again        (normalisation).</p>        <p>3. In relation to the question of yields, there had to        be scope for making industrial use of raw materials        derived from the forest.</p>        <p>The project succeeded in finding appropriate solutions        to all three problems.</p>        <p><b>1. The &quot;agro-forestry system&quot; in Bel&egrave;m</b></p>        <p>The project launched by the university, under the        aegis of POEMA project leader Prof. Dr. Thomas Mitschein,        aimed at scientific re-forestation of environmentally        damaged regions. Small communities were identified whose        inhabitants were interested in new forms of        afforestation. The land made available was divided up        into plots 20 x 20 metres in size.</p>        <p>The &quot;agro-forestry principle&quot; can be        described in simple terms as follows: in the centre of        each plot, a particularly tall tree was either already        growing or was specially planted &#150; for example a        mango or Brazil nut tree. Around these, trees and shrubs        were planted according to agro-forestry rules, ensuring        that, depending on the species, the higher trees offered        a greater or lesser degree of protection from the sun.        Thus a mixed tropical forest was created, with several        &quot;layers&quot; such as are typical of the rainforest.</p>        <p>This kind of mixed forest &#150; which is, of course        not a natural rainforest and is in fact more like our        normal commercial woodland &#150; includes coconut palms,        cocoa trees, coffee and uruc. bushes. It is a mix of        plants which is suited to the fertility of the soil and        which also enables a variety of products to be harvested        and slash-and-burn techniques to be avoided. Furthermore,        the range of plants creates a new layer of humus in the        long term, which in turn prevents soil erosion.</p>        <p><b>2. Clean water: an essential element in the project</b></p>        <p>In the municipality of Praia Grande in Ponta de        Pedras, on the island of Maraj&Ucirc;, a water station was        established consisting of an elevated tank, a        wind-powered water pump and a solar plant to which an        electrolysis unit is attached. A solution of water and        sodium chloride is passed through the cell, which        releases germicidal hypochloride, which is then pumped up        to the tank.</p>        <p>It should be emphasised that the government of the        federal state of Par&sdot; has undertaken to set up 1,047        such treatment plants in rural communities which do not        at present have a clean water supply.</p>        <p><b>3. Industrial aspects of POEMA: the example of        &quot;fibres&quot;</b></p>        <p>The possibility of making industrial use of renewable        raw materials from the &quot;rainforest&quot; provoked        genuine interest within the Daimler-Benz group.        Experiments in S"o Paulo, Ulm and Stuttgart looked in        particular at the usefulness of natural fibres &#150;        especially coir (coconut fibre) &#150; for automotive        production. </p>        <p>Once it was established that they could, indeed, be        used in principle, the next question to be answered was        whether &#150; and at what cost &#150; the raw materials        could be acquired in the Amazon delta and could at least        be protected against rotting. In addition, it had to be        established to what extent it would be feasible to        process the materials in the Amazon delta itself, in        order to increase the local value-added element.</p>        <p>There were two further considerations: the end product        had to compare favourably with conventional materials in        terms of cost; and the equipment and plant required for        conservation and processing had to meet the criterion of        being &quot;appropriate technology&quot; &#150; i.e. they        had to be capable of being maintained and repaired on the        spot by local staff. </p>        <p>A considerable amount of literature had to be examined        in order to formulate the necessary research objectives.</p>        <p>Realising that the usefulness of such fibres as        industrial materials had been underestimated in the past,        Daimler-Benz quickly developed an extensive research        programme entitled &quot;Renewable Raw Materials&quot;.        Within a few years such natural fibres were increasingly        being used in motor vehicles. (In the case of Brazilian        factories, raw materials from the rainforest were used,        and in German ones, fibres from domestic cultivation, for        example flax and hemp.)</p>        <p><b>Headrests made of coir fibre</b></p>        <p>Shortly after the project was established, the        inhabitants of the settlement of Praja Grande on the        Amazon island of Maraj&Ucirc; began supplying Mercedes-Benz do        Brasil in S"o Paulo with headrests made of coir fibre.        Once removed from the external mantle of coconuts by        simple technical means, the fibres are processed into        cords before being conveyed to the small head restraint        factory, where they are combined with natural rubber        (latex) and formed into headrests.</p>        <p>The processes of removing the fibres, making the cords        and ultimately creating the headrests are carried out by        the locals, working within a cooperative. Every week        another family is &quot;on duty&quot;.</p>        <p>The individual production processes have now been        refined and optimised by the locals. Thus, for example,        they have developed simple industrial techniques for        removing the fibres from the fruit. They have also        improved efficiency in cord-making to such an extent that        production has increased ninefold from 3 kg to 26 kg per        day. </p>        <p>And they have come up with their own ideas for        improving and facilitating production of the headrests        themselves.</p>        <p>The cooperative in Praja Grande now supplies        Mercedes-Benz with some 2,500 headrests per month (30,000        per year). The costs involved &#150; including transport        from the Amazon basin to S"o Paulo &#150; are marginally        lower than those of producing components from man-made        materials. If one takes ecological aspects into account        (recycling) &#150; as is standard practice at        Daimler-Benz nowadays &#150; then production on Maraj&Ucirc;        is highly competitive. </p>        <p><b>Acceptance and involvement</b></p>        <p>The high degree of acceptance with which the project        has met is demonstrated by the way it has been extended.        In 1992, one municipality took part in POEMA, with 50        families among the inhabitants of Praja de Grande, a        small settlement on the island of Maraj&Ucirc; in the Amazon        delta, close to the city of Bel&egrave;m with its 1,400,000        inhabitants.</p>        <p>In 1996, some 35 municipalities were participating in        the projects, with about 2,000 families. An increasing        number of inhabitants of neighbouring settlements are        currently seeking information directly from the project        partners, in order to secure as many economic advantages        for themselves as well. The expected snowball effect has        become a reality.</p>        <p>Thus POEMA, in conjunction with Daimler-Benz AG and        Mercedes-Benz do Brasil, has paved the way for the        development of innovative forms of cooperation between        very different partners which can benefit the inhabitants        of the region and help reduce the burden on the        rainforests. The Bel&egrave;m congress has been planned as a        forum which will demonstrate to partners from the spheres        of science, industry and politics how similar action can        be taken and this approach extended &#150; on as global a        scale as possible. </p>        <p><b>Evaluation</b></p>        <p>The project has demonstrated how people in one of the        poorest regions on earth can be given the prospect of        survival in the future. It has also clearly refuted some        of the most frequently heard prejudices, for example that        people in such poor regions are not capable of bettering        their own situation.</p>        <p>Today the people of Praja Grande are &#150; relatively        speaking &#150; rich. They are now doing more than just        selling coconuts on the market, and Mercedes-Benz's        purchasing of headrests has become a major source of        income for them. In addition to this, further income is        generated by harvesting other products from the new        forest over the course of the entire year. </p>        <p>The success and the new social status it has        engendered have created a stronger sense of        self-confidence. The locals are now coming up with their        own ideas for modifying the forest cultivation methods        and have successfully introduced improvements into the        production processes as well.</p>        <p>The inhabitants of the region are now looking to        further improve their quality of life. The have acquired        a wind generator, which for the first time will provide        them with electricity; this environmentally compatible        technology helps reduce the cost of processing the        fibres. And of course electricity will also bring further        advantages such as refrigerators.</p>        <p><b>Mercedes-Benz and renewable raw materials</b></p>        <p>Mercedes-Benz has been quick to convert its        recognition of the potential offered by renewable raw        materials into actual production. Increasing numbers of        vehicle components now incorporate these materials. </p>        <p>The following components in the C-Class are already        being made from renewable raw materials (grown in        Germany):</p>        <table border="1" cellpadding="4" width="500">            <tr>                <td width="50%">Boot structure</td>                <td width="50%">Cotton fibre composite material</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%">Front seat-back</td>                <td width="50%">Coir fibres, animal hair, <br>                natural rubber (latex)</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%">Rear seat-back</td>                <td width="50%">Cotton fibre composite material</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%">Sound insulation elements in                transmission tunnel</td>                <td width="50%">Cotton fibre composite material</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%">Sound insulation (dashboard)</td>                <td width="50%">Cotton fibre composite material</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%">Lower covering of dashboard</td>                <td width="50%">Cotton fibre composite material</td>            </tr>        </table>        <p>&nbsp;</p>        <p>Mercedes-Benz do Brasil is currently using or        investigating the following components made from natural        materials in its commercial vehicle production:</p>        <table border="1" cellpadding="4" width="500">            <tr>                <td width="50%">Cabin interior trim</td>                <td width="50%">Jute and cotton fibre, sisal                fibre instead of fibreglass</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%">Seat-back and headrests</td>                <td width="50%">Coir fibre with natural rubber</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%">Dashboard</td>                <td width="50%">Sisal fibre instead of fibreglass                and natural polyhydric alcohols</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%">Tyres</td>                <td width="50%">Natural rubber</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%">Wheel covers, air and fuel lines</td>                <td width="50%">Natural polyamides</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%">Heat and sound insulation</td>                <td width="50%">Jute or cotton fibre</td>            </tr>        </table>        <p>&nbsp;</p>        <p>Further processes utilising natural materials are        currently under development:</p>        <table border="1" cellpadding="4" width="500">            <tr>                <td width="50%">Protective paint for engine</td>                <td width="50%">Based on indigo pigments</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%">Vehicle bumpers</td>                <td width="50%">Jute, sisal or ramie fibre,                together with natural thermoplastics (replacing                fibreglass)</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%">Sun visors</td>                <td width="50%">Coir or sisal fibre with natural                thermoplastics</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%">Paint</td>                <td width="50%">Based on natural dyes</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="50%">Tool box</td>                <td width="50%">Plant-based leather (cotton with                natural rubber)</td>            </tr>        </table>        </td>    </tr></table></center></div><p align="center"><br><img src="../../lines/db_592.gif" width="592" height="16"></p><div align="center"><center><table border="0">    <tr>        <td align="center" width="550"><h5><a href="61218a_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Deutsch</i>&nbsp;]</a>        <a href="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Home</i>&nbsp;]</a>        <a href="../news_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Research &amp;        Technology</i>&nbsp;]</a> <a href="61218_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Next</i>&nbsp;]</a>        <a href="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Search</i>&nbsp;]</a>        <a href="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Dialog</i>&nbsp;]</a>        <a href="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Help</i>&nbsp;]</a>        </h5>        </td>    </tr></table></center></div><div align="center"><center><address>    &#169; Daimler-Benz, last update: 12/18/1996</address></center></div></body></html>

A., S"o Paulo, Brazil</i></p>        <p>S"o Paulo/Bel&egrave;m, November 1996. &quot;Tecnologia        Ecol&Ucirc;gica&quot; &#150; under this title, Mercedes-Benz        do Brasil presented its plan of activities for the        realisation of environment-friendly concepts for its        products and manufacturing plants in 1992. The        significance of this programme lies above all in the        design and application of new technologies, systematic        analyses and solutions as well as international        cooperation between the industrialised and threshold        countries.</p>        <p><b>In retrospect</b></p>        <p>In the years from 1952 to 1956, the Brazilian        government invited the international automotive        manufacturers to invest in Brazil and to establish an        efficient automotive industry. The potential of this        country &#150; with a territory larger than the USA        (excluding Alaska), a population at the time of 54        million (now 162 million) and the high transport        requirements of an agriculturally oriented economy &#150;        prompted a rapid reaction, which within only a few years        brought about the establishment of an automotive        manufacturing and supply industry in Brazil under the        aegis of American and European enterprises. This        breakthrough formed the backbone of the subsequent        upswing in the entire industrial sector, the construction        industry and the spheres of trade and banking &#150; and        the situation remains unchanged today. We in S"o Paulo        are quite proud of the fact that we are now the world's        largest German industrial city, measured on the basis of        the number of local German companies and the size of        their workforce.</p>        <p>This phase of Brazil's industrial development thus        constitutes an example of international cooperation, as a        result of which the Brazilian automotive industry        currently enjoys a strong position and &#150; with an        export volume of over 18,000 units annually &#150;        represents a major factor in Brazil's positive export        balance.</p>        <p>Daimler-Benz has played a formative role in this        success story. Having been on the scene in S"o Paulo        since 1955 as the first European automotive manufacturer,        Daimler-Benz introduced the diesel engine to the country        as a technological contribution; thanks to its highly        economical operation, this engine has held its own in the        commercial vehicle sector against the petrol engines of        the American companies Ford and GM, and it has maintained        market leadership ever since 1969 with a share of over        50% of all commercial vehicle engines produced in Brazil.</p>        <p><b>A symbiosis </b></p>        <p>The preparations for cooperation with a country on the        threshold of modern industrial development and the        application and transfer of promising modern technologies        has paid off for Daimler-Benz in the form of success in        this country, but also through the feedback of expertise.</p>        <p>The &quot;heavy-duty&quot; requirements of a country        like Brazil &#150; characterised by high operational        demands such as economy, low costs, low downtimes, low        maintenance, ease of repairs, in harsh conditions of        operation resulting from bad road conditions and        consequent requirements for off-road mobility,        overloading capability, high-altitude mobility and        long-distance operations &#150; have brought about        product and component developments which differ greatly        from those to be found under European conditions.</p>        <p>The Daimler-Benz group has benefited from the        successful establishment of this &quot;heavy-duty&quot;        production in Brazil: with Brazilian products, is has        conquered the markets of those southern hemisphere        countries which could no longer be serviced with European        products (costs, technologies). In this world region,        too, market leadership in the category of commercial        vehicles in excess of 6 tonnes has thus been maintained.</p>        <p><b>&#132;Tecnologia Ecol&Ucirc;gica&quot;</b></p>        <p>From this macroscopic survey of the international        cooperation between industrialised and developing        countries, their historical development and its fruitful        effect for both partners, let us now now turn our        attention to &quot;Tecnologia Ecol&Ucirc;gica&quot;. In a        threshold country, exemplary and progressive behaviour in        the social, technological and entrepreneurial fields is        expected of a renowned industrial partner. This is        particularly the case with environmental compatibility.</p>        <p>Right from the start, Daimler-Benz has invariably        accorded prime significance to this matter in the design        of its production facilities in Brazil. Mercedes-Benz do        Brasil, which established the first emissions laboratory        in that country, has been actively involved in government        programmes for the development and testing of commercial        vehicle engines operating on the basis of alcohol,        natural gas and natural oils and is actively and        progressively working together with the government in        matters of environmental legislation.</p>        <p>All this leads us to the vision of &quot;technologies        with a system&quot; &#150; a holistic view of the        vehicle, transport and the environment, in which the        individual processes of product design, utilisation and        impact are transformed into sustainable processes which        ultimately bring about stable situations in the        interaction between industry and the environment.</p>        <p>In specific terms, for example in the design of        products in Brazil, this means:</p>        <blockquote>            <blockquote>                <p>1. Low-emission diesel engines (using the same                technologies as in Europe and the USA)</p>            </blockquote>        </blockquote>        <p>2. Gas engine development</p>        <p>3. Avoidance of hazardous materials (e.g. asbestos)</p>        <p>4. CFC-free systems and manufacturing processes</p>        <p>5. Noise reduction (in vehicles and production)</p>        <p>6. Reduced fuel consumption in operation (lightweight        design, aerodynamics, engine electronics etc.)</p>        <p>7. Recyclability and resistance to corrosion</p>        <p>8. Closed-circuit processes (operating fluids, waste)        and conservation of resources (energy, water, materials)        in the production process</p>        <p>9. The use of biomaterials </p>        <p>10. Emission surveillance in the service sector and in        the field</p>        <p>Expertise developed in Germany has been adopted in        many of these fields, in close cooperation with        Daimler-Benz and Mercedes-Benz. In some areas, impetus        was in turn given by Brazil &#150; e.g. in gas engines        and biomaterials, which the parent companies have also        been applying and pursuing for some years with increasing        interest. </p>        <p><b>The use of renewable raw materials</b></p>        <p>Within this programme, it is the use of renewable raw        materials which comes closest to the ideal of achieving a        permanently sustainable balance between the environment        and technology. In this field, the technological        materials cycle in component manufacture is integrated        into a natural materials cycle, which throughout all        stages &#150; the cultivation of the plants, the        extraction of the materials, the processing and        subsequent disposal of the components &#150; is in this        very state of permanent equilibrium with regard to        materials and CO2.</p>        <p>In 1992, a research programme was established between        Daimler-Benz and the University of Par&sdot; in the Brazilian        Amazon region. This programme &#150; whose four points of        emphasis are natural fibres, natural oils, natural dyes        and natural rubber/adhesives &#150; is concerned with the        extraction, processing and application of natural        materials. The rich diversity of Amazon flora is opening        up interesting new perspectives. Especially in the case        of fibre-reinforced plastics, natural fibres are in some        cases performing much more favourably than fibreglass        reinforcement elements with regard to elasticity of        bending and tension, splintering or lightweight        characteristics; they are also proving more        cost-efficient.</p>        <p>These positive characteristics have paved the way for        a rapid transition from the research stage to series        production. Jute and sisal fibre are used for passenger        compartment linings (e.g. roof, rear wall, doors) and        &#150; in conjunction with cotton &#150; in        thermo-acoustical insulation. Coir (coconut fibre) is        used for seats. </p>        <p>Developments in the area of natural oils are marked by        similar success. Castor oil is proving to be a good basis        for glues, paints, polyamides and polyurethane;        Mercedes-Benz do Brasil uses over 300 tonnes of this        material per year in polyamide brake linings for its        commercial vehicles. In collaboration with Glasurit, a        natural pigment is currently being prepared for        industrial application; resistant to temperature and        light, this pigment is derived from the indigo blue dye        of the feranil plant. </p>        <p>Whilst natural rubber (latex) is already in use (4,000        tonnes per year in MBBras products), the research        programme is particularly concerned with obtaining        biologically degradable natural rubber, e.g. on the basis        of sugar cane or banana trees.</p>        <p>Intensive research work is also being carried out into        achieving a high utilisation factor for plants: the        trunks or stalks are used for fibre and the seed for the        manufacture of oils or plastics; wherever possible, a        combination of both is used in the production of        bio-composites reinforced with natural fibre.</p>        <p><b>Environmental technology &#150; the third        technology wave in automotive production </b></p>        <p>The use of biomaterials constitutes an entirely new        field of technology in research, process engineering and        automotive manufacture. At the turn of the century, the        transition from the horse-drawn carriage to the        automobile succeeded through the use of classical        mechanical engineering technologies (mechanics,        thermodynamics and electrical engineering). The present        situation is characterised by the utilisation of        electronics and of information, communications and        computer technologies, with which a transition from the        automobile to the integrated transport system is being        effected (e.g. in the PROMETHEUS Project). </p>        <p>These two technology waves will be followed by a        third, which will be concerned with environmental        technologies: the transition from open-end processes to        sustainable closed-cycle processes. Not only        technological, but also &#150; to quite a significant        degree &#150; social aspects will have to be incorporated        into this process; i.e. a fairer distribution of both the        positive and the negative consequences of industrial        activity will have to be effected in sociological terms.</p>        <p>Of fundamental significance in this process will be        dialogue between industrialised and developing countries,        between poor and rich regions, along with willingness to        cooperate. Brief mention can be made here of one        particular consideration. </p>        <p>The retention of the tropical forest regions &#150; a        global environmental objective &#150; can definitely not        be effected if this at the same time amounts to        perpetuating poverty in these regions while securing        wealth and luxury for the well-to-do countries together        with a high rate of energy consumption and CO2 emission.</p>        <p><b>The project &quot;POEMA &#150; Poverty and the        Environment in Amazonia&quot;</b></p>        <p>Integrating technology in sustainable processes is a        process which must be negotiated in many small steps. One        such step is the utilisation of renewable raw materials.        This goes hand in hand with sociologically based projects        such as &quot;Poverty and Environment in Amazonia&quot;,        supported by Daimler-Benz. </p>        <p>In Brazil, there is a particularly wide economic gap        between the industrial centres in the south and the        agricultural regions of the north and north-east. One of        the consequences of this gap is an exodus, which is        having a particularly taxing effect on the cities: the        &quot;favelas&quot; &#150; the slums of the major cities        &#150; are constantly growing. This process can only be        halted if the basic conditions of life in the poorer        regions can be improved.</p>        <p>The project &quot;Poverty and the Environment in        Amazonia&quot; of the University of Par&sdot;, carried out by        Daimler-Benz with UNICEF involvement, has precisely this        objective.</p>        <p>Pilot projects in four selected municipalities of the        Amazon region are concerned with devising ways of        improving basic living conditions. The project comprises        the establishment of</p>        <p>&#150; a social basis &#150; developing communal        structures (administration, education, cooperatives) and        supporting the health scheme (water supply, sanitary        concepts, medical care)</p>        <p>&#150; a basis of agriculture and forestry &#150;        establishing a sustainable system of agriculture and        forestry for the planting, cultivation and harvesting of        crops <br>        and</p>        <p>&#150; the industrial basis &#150; providing for the        application and preliminary processing of plants into        industrial products (raw materials, semi- finished and        finished goods).</p>        <p>This concept of agriculture and forestry derives from        the ancient native Indian tradition of terrace        cultivation. In structural terms, it is based on the        tropical rainforest: a dense community of plants is        formed which afford each other protection against        excessive solar radiation, prevent the ground from drying        out and maintain humidity, thus helping avoid the        consequences of monoculture &#150; which has led to        extreme nutrient depletion &#150; and of slash-and-burn        techniques for the purpose gaining new agricultural land.</p>        <p>Quite importantly, the concept of economical crop        utilisation is based on the principle of retaining a        significant local value-added element; the products are        thus processed within the various rural communities. </p>        <p>This involves the use of adapted technologies, which        for the main part are based on home work and whose energy        and investment requirements are sufficiently modest to        allow this work to be carried out within individual        families and cooperatives. The initiative was launched        with the cultivation of coir for use in head restraint        elements.</p>        <p>The initial stages &#150; from obtaining the coir        fibre to the manufacture of semi-finished products &#150;        are carried out by the farmers' families. The further        processing of the semi-finished products, the application        of latex, drying and moulding the head restraints are        carried out by the cooperative at a central location in        Ponta de Pedra.</p>        <p>The first phase of this project, to the end of 1994,        provided for the production of 900 head restraints per        month, with an increase to in approx. 2,000 units per        month in a second phase in 1995. The project developed        well. Mercedes-Benz do Brasil is supplied punctually, the        quality is acceptable and the costs are at a competitive        level despite the long transport routes involved.</p>        <p>Following the conclusion of the first two phases,        further opportunities are being investigated both in        terms of quantity (supply of other Mercedes-Benz        locations or other automotive manufacturers) and in        product diversity (e.g. sun visors or floor mats).        Further possible applications of the cultivated materials        are being investigated in the laboratories of the        University of Par&sdot;, of Daimler-Benz AG in Ulm and of the        supplier companies' project partners in Brazil; as broad        a basis as possible is to be created by this means for        the economic use of the region's agricultural and        forestry products.</p>        <p>These projects in Par&sdot; have something of a pioneering        character: they can be &#150; and indeed should be &#150;        adopted in other regions of Brazil. In their general        objectives &#150; the utilisation of agricultural        products for industrial products and the development of        manufacturing concepts with adapted technologies in rural        areas &#150; they are indeed capable of being transferred        to other countries. (At the Ulm Research Institute,        favourable results have been achieved in investigations        now also being carried out into European plants,        especially flax and hemp.)</p>        <p>The objective of emphasising the concept of        closed-cycle processes in all areas of product design,        utilisation and impact &#150; in the sense of the        establishment of a &quot;Tecnologia Ecol&Ucirc;gica&quot;        &#150; has led to new approaches in the development and        combination of technological material cycles, natural        materials cycles as well as labour cycles. In many areas,        this calls for a new way of thinking, in which        cooperation between industry and developing or threshold        countries in particular can prove very fruitful, since in        such cases the threshold countries can learn from faulty        developments in the industrialised countries without        having to repeat their mistakes themselves. New        approaches, which once having proved their worth can then        be transferred to other regions, can be initiated there        much more easily than in the industrialised countries,        whose more highly developed structures often prove an        impediment to versatility.</p>        <p><b>A successful example: natural gas buses in Germany</b></p>        <p>This principle is borne out by the following example.        One of the closed-circuit processes investigated also        related to the use of natural gas as a fuel for our urban        buses. </p>        <p>Methane can be obtained in the form of natural gas; it        can also be recovered from landfills, or is available as        &quot;bio-gas&quot;. In Brazil, for instance, bio-gas is        obtained from sugar cane chaff; commercial vehicles are        powered by this means for the sugar cane harvest. Natural        gas engines have been developed which emit hardly any        particulates and whose gaseous emissions undercut those        of the Euro II diesel engines by more than 50%. The 500        or so urban buses now in operation for Mercedes-Benz do        Brasil are arousing increasing interest worldwide,        especially in Europe.</p>        <p>In Germany, the first test fleet was already presented        and commenced operation in Hanover in 1994 on the        occasion of the International Commercial Vehicle Show.</p>        <p>&quot;Tecnologia Ecol&Ucirc;gica&quot; represents the        endeavour to develop thoroughly ecological concepts which        are at the same time economically viable. By the same        token, it represents the endeavour to devise        &quot;technologies with a system&quot; and to implement        these in specific stages. </p>        <p>International cooperation, especially within the        Daimler-Benz group between the partners in the industrial        and threshold countries, has proved particularly        promising and will continue to provide the basis both for        industrial activity in Brazil and for the development of        future joint projects such as &quot;Tecnologia        Ecol&Ucirc;gica&quot;.</p>        </td>    </tr></table></center></div><p align="center"><br><img src="../../lines/db_592.gif" width="592" height="16"></p><div align="center"><center><table border="0">    <tr>        <td align="center" width="550"><h5><a href="61218b_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Deutsch</i>&nbsp;]</a>        <a href="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Home</i>&nbsp;]</a>        <a href="../news_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Research &amp;        Technology</i>&nbsp;]</a> <a href="61218a_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Next</i>&nbsp;]</a>        <a href="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Search</i>&nbsp;]</a>        <a href="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Dialog</i>&nbsp;]</a>        <a href="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Help</i>&nbsp;]</a>        </h5>        </td>    </tr></table></center></div><div align="center"><center><address>    &#169; Daimler-Benz, last update: 12/18/1996</address></center></div></body></html>

Series        production of the new panels for the G-class began at the        end of 1994. A total of 350 tonnes of natural fibres are        required every year, half of which come from German        production sources. By using a combination of flax and        sisal, weight reductions of 20% compared with traditional        materials can be achieved, thus helping cut the overall        weight and fuel consumption of the vehicle. Furthermore,        these natural materials are extremely durable and have        good crash stability and excellent recycling qualities.        Research projects launched by Mercedes-Benz are now        exploring the scope for using other natural materials        such as jute, banana, hemp or ramie.<p>A modern vehicle        like a Mercedes-Benz car consists of a huge variety of        materials, of which the best known are steel, plastics,        glass and rubber. But if you take a closer look        underneath the bodywork of a car you can find an        increasing number of new materials which one would not        normally associate with car manufacture: cotton, flax,        coir (coconut fibre), sisal and latex.</p>        <p>Back to nature. For some years now, Daimler-Benz and        Mercedes-Benz have been developing the use of natural        materials. In doing so they have been following the goals        of the Rio de Janeiro Environment Conference, which        called especially for careful, sustainable and        responsible use of raw materials. &quot;Renewable raw        materials help reduce consumption of traditional energy        resources such as coal, natural gas or oil,&quot;        explains Dr. Dieter Zetsche, Board Member of        Mercedes-Benz AG. &quot;This also helps reduce the impact        on the world's climate by cutting carbon dioxide        emissions produced in the combustion of fossil        fuels.&quot;</p>        <p><strong>Climate protection and recyclability: the        advantages of natural materials</strong></p>        <p>In fact, raw materials taken from the inexhaustible        supplies of Mother Nature have a whole range of further        advantages:</p>        <p>&#150; Vegetable raw materials can be regrown and are        therefore available indefinitely &#150; in stark contrast        to fossil resources.</p>        <p>&#150; Natural materials can be processed with minimal        impact on the environment and do not contain any toxic        substances.</p>        <p>&#150; Car components made from renewable raw        materials are recyclable and can be easily reused for        other purposes.</p>        <p>&#150; Materials derived from vegetable fibre meet the        same rigorous safety and quality requirements which        Mercedes-Benz imposes on all its automotive components.</p>        <p>So there can be no doubt that renewable raw materials        have a great future &#150; not just at Mercedes-Benz and        not only in the automotive industry.</p>        <p><strong>Flax and sisal: new candidates for inclusion        amongst Mercedes' approved materials</strong></p>        <p>Mercedes-Benz is a pioneer in this area of materials        technology. Take the G-Class, for example. Although the        support for the rear window shelf and seat backs for this        model have already been made of natural fibre from the        very outset, a further &quot;natural product&quot; is now        used. It goes by the name of &quot;Flexiform&quot;, and        is used as a support for the door trim panels. It is thus        one of those many essential components hidden away inside        the body of a car whose existence most car owners are not        even aware of.</p>        <p>But Mercedes engineers put careful thought into even        these invisible components and are constantly looking for        innovations which bring advantages for the customer. Thus        it was that they came across two natural fibres which,        when combined, offer an excellent basis for the door trim        panel supports: flax and sisal.</p>        <p>&quot;At present, we use some 175 tonnes of each of        these two natural fibres. Our factories enquire some        4,000 Flexiform door trim panels every day, and these now        head the list of components made of renewable        materials,&quot; says Bruno Stark, Head of Materials and        Recycling at Mercedes-Benz Car Development.</p>        <p><strong>Shedding bulk and cutting consumption: Nature        helps the weight-watchers</strong></p>        <p>You can be sure that further uses will be found for        the flax-sisal mixture, for in addition to the        environmental benefits offered by this material, it also        has certain technical advantages which single it out from        other materials. The most important of these is weight.        &quot;When you are trying to cut down the weight of cars        and thus reduce their fuel consumption, every single gram        counts. Natural fibres have many pores but are still very        strong, and this often gives them an advantage in this        respect,&quot; explains Professor Guntram Huber, Head of        Bodywork Development at Mercedes-Benz. The Flexiform door        trim panels, for example, offer weight savings of 20%        over the material traditionally used &#150; and this adds        up to a savings of about one kilogram per vehicle. </p>        <p><strong>Harvesting and processing: from fibre to car        trim</strong></p>        <p>The flax fibre for the new door trim panels comes from        Germany. Bavarian farmers deliver it to specialist        textile factories which first of all separate the long        from the short fibres. This is necessary because it is        only the long fibres which are used to produce the linen        jackets, trousers, tablecloths and sheets sold by        department stores and textile retailers. The shorter        fibres &#150; some 10 to 50 centimetres in length &#150;        are mainly used for industrial purposes, by Mercedes-Benz        for example. In collaboration with its suppliers, the        company has developed a process by which domestically        produced fibre is mixed with sisal from overseas and made        up into mats a centimetre thick.</p>        <p>The next step involves special presses which, after        addition of a bonding agent, shape the flax/sisal mats        into the supports for the interior door trim. And here        another advantage of the natural fibres comes to the        fore: the process is not only easier and more        environmentally friendly than the usual materials, but        also offers greater scope for the designers, for the        flax/sisal mats can be formed into even the most        complicated shapes and curves &#150; in one simple        process.</p>        <p><strong>Quality and safety: flax/sisal combination        highly rated</strong></p>        <p>Supports made from Flexiform also scored very highly        in tests carried out in Mercedes' laboratories.        &quot;Compared to other natural fibres, the flax/sisal        combination has good mechanical characteristics,&quot;        states Uwe Siehler, development engineer at        Mercedes-Benz. &quot;The material passed our climate        tests, impact tests and quality inspections with flying        colours.&quot; As always with Mercedes-Benz, safety was        the most important aspect, and the engineers carried out        various different impact tests in an attempt to work out        how the natural material would behave in an accident. It        emerged that the flax/sisal supports are extremely        impact-resistant and do not splinter, so that in the case        of a side impact no sharp pieces penetrate the vehicle        interior and endanger the occupants. As Uwe Siehler put        it: &quot;Here, too, flax/sisal is superior to many other        materials.&quot;</p>        <p><strong>History and future: flax makes a comeback</strong></p>        <p>In the past, flax was the most important raw material        for the textile industry. In the Middle Ages, the Allg&auml;u        and neighbouring regions in southern Germany boasted        Europe's biggest concentration of these plants with their        bright blue flowers. But then came cotton, which proved        to be so powerful a rival that the acreage devoted to        flax in Europe shrank drastically. By the end of the        Second World War, flax fields were a thing of the past in        Germany.</p>        <p>It was only in recent years that flax has started to        make something of a comeback. There have even been times        when linen was one of the fashion industry's favourite        materials &#150; and the manufacturing industry has also        discovered many other possibilities for processing flax        fibre. Nowadays it is used not only to make post-office        bags but also shoe-making thread, non-woven fabrics and        even bank notes! At present some 1,700 hectares of land        are devoted to flax cultivation &#150; a mere ten years        ago, it was only two. </p>        <p>The other renewable raw material used for the interior        door trim of the Mercedes-Benz G-class is a genuine        recycled material. Mercedes' suppliers use the sisal        sacks in which South American coffee plantations send        their coffee beans to Europe.</p>        <p><strong>Cotton and coir: natural raw materials for        supports and seat cushions</strong></p>        <p>Apart from flax and sisal, other materials have also        started to be used in some Mercedes models in recent        years. Cotton and coir fibre, for example, have proved        useful at various points in the interior of the G-class.</p>        <p><strong>Research projects: good prospects for natural        fibres</strong></p>        <p>Other natural fibres are also currently under        consideration by researchers, and in a few years these,        too, may be fit for use in series production &#150;        either as raw materials for manufacturing automotive        components or as reinforcement in man-made materials. An        example of the latter would be a combination of a        thermoplastic material such as polypropylene and a        natural fibre such as flax or coir. This is stronger and        more easily recyclable than plastics reinforced with        fibreglass. The ultimate, of course, would be        &quot;bio-plastics&quot; produced from a vegetable base        like castor oil, reinforced with flax or coir fibres.        Researchers are already working on such developments.</p>        <p>The table shows which natural fibres are already used        in the automotive industry or are likely to be used in        the future.</p>        <p><strong>From banana to sisal: Excellent prospects for        natural fibres in automotive manufacturing</strong></p>        <table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="1"        width="604">            <tr>                <td width="25%" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Raw material</td>                <td width="31%" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Origin</td>                <td width="44%" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Possible uses</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="25%">Banana</td>                <td width="31%">Philippines, Central America</td>                <td width="44%">Reinforcement of polyester resins</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="25%">Cotton</td>                <td width="31%">Africa, China, USA, India,                Pakistan, Brazil, Russia</td>                <td width="44%">Manufacture of interior trims and                supports and sound insulation mats</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="25%">Flax</td>                <td width="31%">Germany, Canada, Russia</td>                <td width="44%">Manufacture of interior supports;                reinforcement of plastics</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="25%">Hemp</td>                <td width="31%">India, Thailand, China</td>                <td width="44%">Backing for carpets</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="25%">Jute</td>                <td width="31%">India</td>                <td width="44%">Reinforcement fibres and filling                for automotive plastics</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="25%">Coir</td>                <td width="31%">Africa, South Pacific</td>                <td width="44%">Rubber/hair matting for seats and                head-rests; reinforcement fibres for plastics</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="25%">Ramie</td>                <td width="31%">China, Japan, Brazil</td>                <td width="44%">Reinforcement for composite                materials; creation of blended fabrics for car                textiles</td>            </tr>            <tr>                <td width="25%">Sisal</td>                <td width="31%">Mexico, Brazil</td>                <td width="44%">Manufacture of supports for                interior; reinforcement for plastics</td>            </tr>        </table>        </td>    </tr></table></center></div><p align="center"><br><img src="../../lines/db_592.gif" width="592" height="16"></p><div align="center"><center><table border="0">    <tr>        <td align="center" width="550"><h5><a href="61218c_g.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Deutsch</i>&nbsp;]</a>        <a href="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Home</i>&nbsp;]</a>        <a href="../news_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Research &amp;        Technology</i>&nbsp;]</a> <a href="61218b_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Next</i>&nbsp;]</a>        <a href="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Search</i>&nbsp;]</a>        <a href="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Dialog</i>&nbsp;]</a>        <a href="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<i>Help</i>&nbsp;]</a>        </h5>        </td>    </tr></table></center></div><div align="center"><center><address>    &#169; Daimler-Benz, last update: 12/18/1996</address></center></div></body></html>

After all, who can gain a lucid impression of the burden placed on nature and the environment simply by studying columns of figures?<p>Mercedes-Benz, a corporate unit of Daimler-Benz AG, is using various plants at its manufacturing site in Sindelfingen to assess in clearly visible form the effects of pol-lutants in the air: every fourteen days, the scientists examine tomato shrubs, spinach and nasturtiums for the effects of solvent emissions from the painting facilities.<p>The first stage of the project - the "process engineering" - was concerned with the search for suitable indicator plants. This was followed by the actual bio-monitoring, i.e. the process of surveillance and assessment of the waste air from the painting facility, carried out by these plants. <p>At six different locations - directly on the site and in the immediate vicinity - some-thing of a hobby gardener's paradise is now keeping a watchful eye on air quality. The positive result of the long-term surveillance: none of the test plants has suffered any damage which could be traced back to the Mercedes-Benz paining facility. Even at sites subject to maximum environmental load, the concentration of noxious sub-stances has been found to be too low by a factor of 50 to 100 to cause any damage to the plants.</TABLE><P><BR><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="61217_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../news_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Research &amp; Technology</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="61210_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>  <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 12/17/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

In view of the veritable forest of signs lining our roads, it is very easy to overlook the odd one or two - and if one of them happens to indicate a speed limit, we are sometimes made aware of the fact by the flash of a camera. As a rule, this costs a dollar or two and possibly a couple of points on the driver's record.<p>A system which recognises roadside signs and conveys this information to the driver would be of invaluable assistance. The Daimler-Benz researchers have already developed such am image processing system. A camera on the rear-view mirror monitors the surroundings of the vehicle, and the images thus obtained are evaluated on the basis of two salient features of road signs: colour and shape.<p>German traffic is regulated by about 400 different road signs, the predominant colours of which are red, blue, yellow, black and white. From the overall panorama, the image processing system initially selects prominent elements distinguished by these characteristic colours, after which it concentrates on those objects which are seen as even more likely "candidates" on the basis of their colour combinations and distinctive shapes.<p>Following this pre-selection process, the system then proceeds to search for the circular and polygonal contours highly characteristic of road signs. It finally compares this interlinked information with the images of road signs stored in its memory. Once identified, the sign in question is displayed on a small screen in the driver's area.This is all carried out by a high-performance computer located in the luggage compartment. The computer processes the visual information just as rapidly as the human eye and brain, but without lapses in concentration or signs of fatigue. The image processing system thus affords genuine assistance amidst the jungle of road signs.</TABLE><P><BR><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="61203_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../news_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Research &amp; Technology</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="61126_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>  <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 12/03/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

But there are no red Santa Claus hoods to be espied here between snow-covered pine trees, even on very close inspection. And this would indeed be rather surprising: what at first sight resembles a pine forest at Christmas time is in fact raw quartz. In this form, the material has been providing the basis for piezoelectric quartz research at Daimler-Benz AG for several years.<p>Piezoelectric quartz consists of pure silica in the form of small crystals. A high-frequency alternating electric field stimulates these crystals to a state of intensive mechanical oscillation; this is referred to as the inverse piezoelectric effect. Thanks to this characteristic, piezoelectric quartz has already been used for several years in the most diverse applications.<p>Piezoelectric quartz crystals serve to regulate quartz clocks and digital electronic systems; they are also used as transmitters or receivers in pressure sensors and electronic filters. But now especially, with Christmas rapidly approaching, it is not so much the components but the raw material itself which holds our attention; throughout the years of technological progress, it has lost nothing of its beauty and continues to create the impression of a winter landscape enshrouded in thick snow. </TABLE><P><BR><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="61126_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../news_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Research &amp; Technology</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="61119_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>  <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 11/26/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

An oil-water mixture sprayed between the tool and the steel provides lubrication; but the steel is so hot that some of the cooling lubricant evaporates and rises into the factory air, thus impairing the working atmosphere.<p>From an environmental point of view, cooling lubricants are not entirely "cool": since they are difficult to separate from the metal filings produced in the grinding process, they hinder recycling of the metal waste. Furthermore, they produce noxious vapours and sludges. The Daimler-Benz researchers hope to remedy this situation by working on a new method of machining hardened components which dispenses with the use of cooling lubricants. <p>It is above all due to the high circumferential speeds involved that in the conventional grinding of hardened components, large quantities of heat are produced between the grinding wheel and the workpiece; this necessitates the use of a cooling lubricant. With the new method - hard lathing with a geometrically specific blade, or simply hard lathing for short - considerably lower interface speeds between tool and workpiece are feasible. Moreover, some eighty percent of the heat produced in the lathing process is carried off by the filings removed. A cooling lubricant can thus be dispensed with.<p>The dry lathing of hardened components with geometrically specific blades has been made feasible by the development of new, superhard blade materials. The metal is no longer removed by a grinding wheel, but is shaved from the surface by a blade made from cubic boron nitride or a special ceramic material. Acquisition and disposal costs for coolant lubricants can be spared; and the filings produced are free from impurities, which makes direct recycling possible.<p>Along with the ecological aspects, however, the economic side of the new process must not be forgotten. The prime objectives of the Daimler-Benz researchers are achieving a satisfactory tool service life whilst maintaining the required component surface quality and further improving the process with a view to economic considerations.</TABLE><P><BR><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="61119_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../news_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Research &amp; Technology</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="61112_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>  <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 11/19/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

There are neither petrol fumes nor foul-smelling exhaust gases to pollute the air; in fact, the exhaust pipes which all too often used to discharge thick clouds of soot are nowhere to be seen. And the major winner is the environment, which is now burdened by exhaust gases only to a minimal extent, if at all. Whilst this may still seem something of a pipe dream - or rather, a non-pipe dream - it is the shape of things to come in automotive technology.<p>Alternative drive technology first took the form of battery-powered cars. But as has been shown by the Necar II research vehicle recently presented by Daimler-Benz in Berlin and by the World Hydrogen Conference in Stuttgart, fuel cell technology with hydrogen as an energy medium seems to be becoming an increasingly hot favourite as the drive system of the future.<p>Energy systems based on the low-temperature combustion of hydrogen are in fact old hat: so-called alkaline fuel cells have been used in space technology ever since the sixties. These cells owe their name to the electrolyte used - caustic potash, a solution whose extremely aggressive nature precludes this form of energy supply from everyday use in automotive technology.<p>Since only very few materials can withstand the corrosive effect of the caustic potash, this substance is difficult to handle. Furthermore, the electrolyte only makes for sufficiently long periods of operation if the air supply is free of carbon dioxide - a tall order in engineering terms. These considerations make alkaline fuel cell systems too expensive for everyday application. <p>Nevertheless, hydrogen technology is making an appearance on our roads. The development of high-performance membranes in the mid-eighties paved the way for a new generation of fuel cells. The flow of ions within the cell is now regulated not by an aggressive caustic potash solution, but by plastic foils. Here, too, the name of the fuel cell system is derived from the electrolyte - the proton exchange membrane, or PEM for short.<p>The Daimler-Benz research vehicle Necar II is powered by PEM technology. Compared with the alkaline fuel cell, these electrochemical cells are considerably easier to handle, with higher power efficiency levels. The materials used are also cheaper, so that costs can be kept to a level which will make the system affordable even to the average motorist.</TABLE><P><BR><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="61112_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../news_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Research &amp; Technology</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="61105_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>  <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 11/12/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

But some time ago, the misuse of cannabis as a hallucinogenic drug led to a ban on its cultivation in Germany: wherever it still did exist, it was on the "wanted" list. As of 1996, however, the cultivation of fibrous hemp - which produces only small quantities of the resin containing the ignoble drug - is now permitted again in Germany for industrial applications.<p>Hemp has long held the interest of the scientists from the Daimler-Benz Research Centre in Ulm. But it was only the relaxation of legislation in Germany relating to its cultivation that paved the way for intensive research. The scientists are currently investigating opportunities for using hemp fibre in place of glass fibre for the reinforcement of plastics.<p>In automotive applications, fibreglass-reinforced plastics are used in both interior and exterior vehicle components. The glass fibres embedded in the plastics, however, hinder the environmentally compatible disposal of disused components. For this reason, ecologically more suitable fibres such as flax are already being used in place of fibreglass - and more recently, hemp fibre has come into consideration.<p>The researchers have determined that hemp has a number of advantages over flax: it is excellently suited to processing, its fibres are more rigid and it can be cultivated without the use of insecticides. These advantages, however, would not be sufficient in themselves: in addition to being ecologically superior, hemp fibre must at least be on a par with flax in meeting the demands of safety, reliability, performance and comfort. Appropriate harvesting technology and standardisation of fibre quality, for instance, are still to be resolved.<p>Initial investigations carried out by the Daimler-Benz researchers have shown that in most criteria, hemp matches and even surpasses flax in terms of performance potential; and although precise statements cannot yet be made regarding costs, hemp fibre promises to be even more economical than flax.</TABLE><P><BR><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="61105_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../news_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Research &amp; Technology</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="61029_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>  <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 11/05/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

The salient feature of these so-called heterostructural bipolar transistors developed by the Daimler-Benz researchers, however, is not their aesthetic qualities, but their physical characteristics.<p>In the field of telecommunications in particular, the Daimler-Benz researchers are expecting an increase in demand for transistors with very high cut-off frequencies. The heterostructural bi-polar transistors developed at Daimler-Benz from the elements silicon and germanium (Si/SiGe-HBT for short) attain a frequency of 160 Gigahertz, or 160 billion oscillations per second - a world record. They also have the advantages of economy, low space requirements as a result of large-scale integration and low power consumption thanks to their high efficiency factor.<p>The market advantage of Si/SiGe heterostructural bipolar transistors over so-called III-V semi-conductors such as gallium arsenide or indium phosphide lies in the availability of the materials and the matured processing technology with regard to silicon. Further advantages are their natural oxide coating, which lowers the metal's reactivity (i.e. increases its passivity), and their high thermal conductivity, which makes for efficient heat dissipation.<p>According to the scientists, the advantages of Si/SiGe heterostructural bipolar transistors speak in favour of their use in such applications as cellular radio technology, which calls for large production quantities; the use of standard silicon production lines would keep manufacturing costs to a minimum.</TABLE><P><BR><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="61029_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../news_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Research &amp; Technology</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="61022_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>  <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 10/29/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

When uttered by a human being, such an exclamation is nothing out of the ordinary. But there are some metals, too, that could make such a claim - if only their exceptional memory were supplemented by vocal cords.<p>The remarkable characteristic of so-called shape-memory alloys - also known as "memory metals" - is their ability to repeatedly resume specific shapes following distortion. The Daimler-Benz researchers have been utilising this effect in aviation and space technology. Shape-memory alloys, however, are now also finding increasing application in the fields of automotive engineering, medicine, data processing and energy technology.<p>One objective of the Daimler-Benz research team is to extend the service lives of satellites. To this end, the scientists are now starting to use shape-memory alloys instead of plastics for the belts which serve to bind the low-temperature tanks to the exterior structure. Due to the reduced force of gravity encountered in space, the belts need only be tightened before and during the start, and not in the further course of operation. Thanks to shape-memory alloys, the belts can now be loosened in space independently of temperature, thus preventing the flow of heat towards the tanks. This brings about a drastic reduction in fuel consumption and extends the satellites' service life.<p>The shape-memory alloys currently being given the most attention are those based on nickel and titanium. A memory metal component subjected to distortion assumes its original shape on being heated to a specific "pre-programmed" temperature; this dependence on temperature is a result of the abrupt reorganisation of atomic structures into different crystalline lattices. In macroscopic terms, these transitions are perceivable as changes in length, volume or electrical resistance. The process can be reversed by cooling - the metal "remembers" its original shape in each case.</TABLE><P><BR><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="61022_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../news_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Research &amp; Technology</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="61015_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>  <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 10/22/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

In this case, however, it is not the backer who is calling, but an employee from the foundry. In this process, the casting moulds for the metal components are baked from so-called core sand. The interest of the engineers from the Daimler-Benz corporate unit Mercedes-Benz focuses not so much on the baking process itself, but rather on the waste air produced.<p>The waste air from the foundry contains the gaseous catalyst dimethyl isopropyl amine in high concentrations; this substance serves to expedite the hardening of the core sand, binding agents and resins used in the baking process. At present, an acid scrubber in the waste air stream diverts the amine into a saline solution for subsequent disposal. The environmental engi-neers are currently devising a method of recovering the catalyst from the waste air and returning it to the baking process.<p>The test rig comprises several units. Preliminary filters first of all remove dust, dirt and excess binding and hardening agents from the foundry waste air, which then flows through a rotary adsorption unit containing polyurethane foam on an active carbon base. The amine accumulates on the active carbon foam, which has an immense surface area, and the purified air is discharged into the atmosphere.<p>When air at a temperature of about 150 &#176;C is added to a certain section of the rotary adsorption unit, the gaseous amine can be separated from the active carbon foam. Before the amine can be returned to the baking process to serve as a catalyst, however, it must be completely free of water. The engineers achieve this by means of a downstream dehumidification wheel, which operates on the same principle as the adsorption unit.<p>The final phase is the recovery of the catalyst. A refrigerating machine cools the gas stream containing amine to -40 &#176;C, and the amine condenses. The engineers can thus recover about eighty percent of the amine in liquid form.<p>Having successfully completed preliminary tests on a laboratory scale, the unit must now prove its mettle under conditions of everyday operation in the Mettingen iron foundry of the Mercedes-Benz Untert&uuml;rkheim plant. The declared aim of the scientists is to reach at least break-even point; in other words, the costs of recovery and reuse of the amine are not to exceed the procurement price of the catalyst plus the waste disposal costs.</TABLE><P><BR><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="61015_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../news_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Research &amp; Technology</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="61008_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>  <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 10/15/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

<i>Stuttgart, October 8, 1996</i><br>

What we see here are neither sea anemones nor the bases of uprooted trees, but in fact a field effect transistor incorporating a completely new class of semiconductors developed by Daimler-Benz: the so-called III-V components.
<p>

These components have two decisive advantages over those most frequently used today, the silicon (Si) semiconductors. They are considerably faster, which makes them suitable for application above all in the field of communication and sensor technology; and they can be designed with "tailor-made" optical and electrical characteristics.
<p>

These semiconductors owe their name to their chemical constituents - elements from the third and fifth main groups of the periodic system. Typical representatives are gallium arsenide (GaAs) and indium phosphide (InP).
<p>

The III-V semiconductor components open up a wealth of new opportunities for suppliers, manufacturers and users of sensor and communication systems. Developments include weather-resistant sensor systems in the field of vehicle safety.

<i>Stuttgart, September 23, 1996</i><br>

The outline is perhaps reminiscent of a squashed stag beetle, and the pattern reminds us of a zebra: this is what the boost air housings of commercial vehicles look like when Daimler-Benz researchers set them into vibration.
<P>

These boost air housings, approximately 60 x 80 cm in size, develop strong sound propagation during engine operation. Only when the sources of this noise are located can specific measures be taken to reduce it.
<P>

The scientists are therefore using analyses of sound spectra to determine the precise frequencies at which strong noise develops. With the help of a physical measurement method known as holographic interferometry, the researchers then create a vibration image - the squashed stag beetle - for each of these so-called critical resonance frequencies.
<P>

With the help of the vibration images, which are a representation of the two-dimensional distribution of the respective vibrations from the boost air housing, the designer responsible can then modify the housing to eliminate noise-producing vibration patterns.

<i>Stuttgart, September 17, 1996</i><br>

For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair ... No, this is not the kiss of two extraterrestrial creatures, but a new type of mixer diode produced at the Daimler-Benz Research Centre in Ulm.
<p>

Compact and micro-radar systems call for increasingly high-performance microelectronic components; on the other hand, their manufacture is to be simple and economical. These were the guiding principles for the Daimler-Benz researchers in developing the new mixer diodes for contact-free automotive sensor systems and for radiometric application in guidance and steering systems.
<p>

The researchers found the solution in the form of the mixer diode, based on gallium-arsenide. It is distinguished from comparable, conventional diodes by new heterostructures incorporating layers of thickness in the order of mere nanometres (a nanometre is one millionth of a millimetre) and containing indium near the surface. The microelectronic characteristics of the diode can thus be further improved while maintaining manufacturing costs at a low level.
<p>

Within a short time, these new structures left the confines of research and development to bring about very favourable results in the product sector. The researchers are currently preparing the diode for series production; this is opening up promising opportunities in the fields of high-frequency sensor technology and communications technology.

By refining and combining methods already used in spray film analysis, the scientists have developed a technique which yields both locally restricted measurements and three-dimensional, high-resolution images of the entire spray film caused by a vehicle. These measurements are assessed by the aero-dynamics engineers, after which they are incorporated into vehicle design.<p>The principal parameter used in this method is the intensity of light which is scattered when the water droplets of the spray mist are illuminated. The scientists carry out the light scattering measurements by a combination of so-called light-section technology (two-dimensional development of light rays) and video technology, which allows pictorial presentation of the measurements. Initial findings have been gained in investigations carried out in the wind tunnel, which by means of individual images above all provide locally restricted spray film measurements.<p>The light scattering measurements on the test track set out to record the entire spray film caused by a vehicle. Only the combination of local and temporal changes in the spray mist characteristics - expressed in scattered light intensities - provides an objective measure of impairment to visibility. The scientists therefore record an entire series of individual images, each of which shows the local distribution of mist intensity at a given time, i.e. at a specific distance to the vehicle.<p>The conversion of mist intensities into visibility distances permits objective evaluation of measures for the reduction of spray film formation. And less spray mist means enhanced road safety in wet conditions.</TABLE><P><BR><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="60910_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../news_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Research &amp; Technology</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="60903_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>  <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 09/10/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Environmental protection thus starts at home, for everyone - in a relatively simple way. <p>Operating an enterprise such as a manufacturing company in an environment-friendly manner, on the other hand, is a highly complex undertaking. Assistance is now available in the form of "Cumpan", a computer programme for lifecycle assessment developed by Daimler-Benz Research in collaboration with the University of Hockenheim. The acronym "Cumpan" stands for "computergest&uuml;tze, umweltorientierte Produktanalyse" (computer-aided, environment-oriented product analysis).<p>In the first stage - abstract assessment - Cumpan registers all environmentally relevant data in connection with each stage of a product's life. This begins with the raw materials required and the energy used in obtaining them and continues through manufacture and the waste produced in the process and incorporates such matters as water pollution and noxious exhaust emissions. <p>In the subsequent environmental impact assessment, Cumpan sorts the individual items of data obtained from the abstract assessment according to their effects on the environment. These factors include contributions to the greenhouse effect or to the ozone deficiency and summer smog, ground acidity levels and fertiliser concentrations in water. The data are constantly based on the latest findings of the internationally recognised Society of Environment, Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) and the German Federal Environmental Office. </TABLE><P><BR><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="60903_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../news_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Research &amp; Technology</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="60827_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>  <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 09/03/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

About20 x 20 cm in size, this plate is a component of the so-called fuel cell, the core of the environment-friendly drive system currently under development at Daimler-Benz Research. <p>Two plates separated by an electrically conductive polymer foil together with an exterior circuit constitute a fuel cell. Hydrogen flows through the many tortuous channels on the one side of the foil, and oxygen from the air on the other side. The two gases react with each other through the polymer foil in the course of their protracted passage along the plates.<p>The reaction produces a potential of 0.6 V, which in turn gives rise to an electric current along the exterior circuit; at the same time, water is produced on the oxygen side of the foil. The power of 100 W developed by one single cell, however, is by no means adequate to drive a vehicle.<p>Sufficient power is produced only by a number of cells connected in series - so-called fuel cell stacks. In the Daimler-Benz research vehicle Necar II, two high-performance stacks each con-sisting of 150 cells together produce an output of 50 kW. </TABLE><P><BR><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="60827_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../news_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Research &amp; Technology</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="60820_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>  <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 08/27/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

And even in the laboratory of engineer Eberhard Holder, the mercury still indicates well over twenty degrees Celsius. In the middle of the room, however, winter seems to have broken out: small ice crystals cover the research engine with a white coating.<p>Daimler-Benz researchers are using the "deep-frozen engine" to investigate fuel combustion at temperatures as low as -20 &#176;C. But instead of transforming the laboratory into a freezer, the scientists banish fuel, air and coolant to a freezer outside the laboratory and then direct them, appropriately tempered, into the engine.<p>The advantages of this method are self-evident; the effects can be realised by relatively simple means. Fuel, air and coolant rapidly reach the desired temperature, so that according to the scientists, up to 15 measurements a day can be carried out - not to mention the considerably more pleasant working conditions made possible.<p>The cold-start investigations have been motivated by the stringent emission limits to come into force in future. Such low values cannot be attained with the catalytic converter alone, explains Holder: at low temperatures, such as prevail directly after the engine is started, catalytic converters do not yet operate optimally.<p>The research engine is a single-cylinder unit, whose characteristics have been adapted to those of a complete engine. The scientists are thus able to investigate and evaluate the cold-start and warming-up behaviour of complete engines at an early stage of development. Optical methods are being used to analyse the transportation of fuel to the engine interior.<p>The findings obtained with the research engine can be immediately incorporated in the form of improvements to the automotive engine. The arrangement and droplet spectrum of the intake valves or the air flow into the intake port, for instance, can considerably influence the exhaust values during cold starts.</TABLE><P><BR><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="60820_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../news_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Research &amp; Technology</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="60813_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>  <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 08/20/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

In former times, dented chrome bumper-bars were a case for the scrap heap. These days, however, bumpers are of painted plastic and thus no longer suffer such an ignominious fate.<p>Scientists from the Daimler-Benz Research Centre in Ulm have launched into new dimensions in the recycling of painted plastic components. The advantages of their newly developed method is that the components are treated with great care, and the separated paint is returned to the production cycle.<p>Appropriate paint removal can be effected by environmentally compatible swelling agents, which swell the paint on the granulated plastic components and transform it into a paste-like substance; this can then be removed with weak rubbing forces. Using the so-called vibratory grinding technique, the scientists are capable of carefully removing the paint from the entire surface of the plastic bumper.<p>The further stages involve separating the plastic components, the paint particles and the swelling agent. In order to further process the paint, the scientists create conditions under which it is transformed together with the remaining swelling agent into a so-called polyol, a raw material used in paint manufacture. The cleansed plastic granules are recycled in the manufacture of new components, and the swelling agent is reused in paint removal. There are no resides left at the end of the process - the cycle for painted plastic components is complete.<p>In view of the paint quantities obtained through repairs and the return of disused vehicles, a yield of about four bumpers per vehicle can be expected on average. Paint removal using swelling agents ensures high-quality recycling of these plastic components.</TABLE><P><BR><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="60813_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../news_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Research &amp; Technology</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="60806_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>  <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 08/13/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

But there are no "ah's" and "oh's" to accompany this light show, since it is everyday routine for the Daimler-Benz researchers at Ottobrunn. <p>These weird and wonderful visual effects are a by-product of laser welding tech-nology. The special feature of this "no-touch" technique is the absence of rivets between the aluminium workpieces - a characteristic which makes this welding method indispensable in today's era of lightweight design. <p>The researchers have unravelled the mystery of the physical and material-related complexities which this new technique entails. Trouble-free laser welding is only possible when the laser beam characteristics are precisely matched to the physi-cal properties of the material.<p>In automotive manufacture, economic and ecological considerations call for a re-duction in structural weights - "lightweight design". Laser welding thus opens up new opportunities not only in the production of road vehicles, but also in the fields of rail transport and aviation.</TABLE><P><BR><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="60806_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../news_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Research &amp; Technology</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="60730_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>  <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 08/06/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

But it can happen to a post office employee that he opens an envelope only to find not the expected love letter, but a flexible piece of microelectronics.<p>With the help of this electronic time-and-motion letter, the postal services can precisely retrace the path of mail items from the sender to the recipient and locate any weak points. The electronic time-and-motion letter constitutes the core of the so-called quality test system (QTS), a product of the Daimler-Benz subsidiary AEG Electrocom. The quality test letter fits into a normal C6 envelope and is externally indistinguishable from an ordinary letter.<p>Postal delivery services work to precise time schedules which require mail items to remain constantly on the move. This is the basis of the QTS measuring system. The time-and-motion letter constantly records its own movements throughout its journey. The measurements, presented in the form of an intensity/time graph, show a characteristic curve for each particular mode of transport - on foot, by car, by rail and by air. When these are compared with the time schedule, any weak points in the transport chain can thus be made out.<p>A long interruption to the letter's journey, for example, would be one such weak point. This would appear on the intensity/time graph as a "zero line" longer than is allowed by the schedule. With a resolution of as little as half a minute, this standstill can then be ascribed by the postal services to the clearing of the letter box, sorting at the post office of origin, renewed sorting at the destination post office or final delivery to the recipient, as the case may be.<p>Unlike conventional test procedures, QTS is a rapid, precise method which most importantly registers the entire delivery process - from the sender to the recipient - in order to allow delays in the transport of mail items to be pinpointed and these problems to be rectified. The quality test system is already used by several postal services, and according to AEG Electrocom, the interest in QTS is steadily increasing.</TABLE><P><BR><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="60730_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../news_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Research &amp; Technology</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="60723_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>  <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 07/30/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

When these towns threaten to suffocate, immediate action is called for - but until now, the individual has only been able to make a contribution at the expense of his own personal mobility: by leaving his car in the garage.<p>But this situation can soon change. With the development of an alternative drive system known as the fuel cell, the Daimler-Benz researchers have reconciled environmental compatibility with mobility. In the fuel cell, electricity is produced by electro-chemical means from hydrogen and oxygen. The only product of this reaction is pure water, which issues from the exhaust pipe in the form of vapour. The environment is thus polluted neither by carbon dioxide nor by the nitrogen oxides, and no soot particles contaminate the air. Man and nature can breathe a sigh of relief.<p>The first step into the future has already been taken: the completely pollutant-free, low-noise "Necar II" research vehicle can already be seen on the streets today. Powered by fuel cells, it provides space for six people and has an operat-ing range of over 250 kilometres. And with a top speed of 110 km/h, driving on the motorway is no problem either.<p>Developments are continuing. Daimler-Benz will first realise this emission-free drive system in urban buses; and by the year 2010, fuel cell drive is expected to be ready for installation in the A-class vehicle.</TABLE><P><BR><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="60723_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../news_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Research &amp; Technology</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="60716_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>  <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 07/23/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Not exactly: they are radar sensors developed by scientists from the Daimler-Benz Research Centre in Ulm. <P>The active semiconductor component of the miniature radar chips is a so-called avalanche propagation time diode. In addition to emitting radiation themselves, the chips are capable of receiving reflected radiation thanks to the special characteristics of these diodes. Our photograph shows two such miniature radar sensor heads arranged at an angle of 90&#176; to each other; this configuration allows the simultaneous measurement of speed and distance by means of dual-frequency radar. Further uses of miniature radar chips with combined transmission and reception characteristics are as motion sensors, speed sensors and close-range radar sensors.<P>The miniature radar sensor head consists of a silicon chip only a few millimetres across, which is mounted on a round transistor casing; it is connected to the attachment lugs of the casing by two fine gold wires. The high-frequency circuitry with the avalanche propagation time diode is affixed to the chip by means of silicon millimetre-wave integrated circuit (SIMMWIC) technology developed by Daimler-Benz.</TABLE><P><BR><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="60716_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../news_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Research &amp; Technology</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="60709_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>  <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 07/16/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

The surgeon is handed a scalpel and proceeds to open up the patient's body. Contrary to expectations, however, he does not perform an elongated incision, but merely makes a small opening in the skin, through which he inserts a long endoscope. The operation has begun.<P>Scenarios such as this are no longer science fiction. An increasing number of developments in the field of minimal-invasive surgery are paving the way for such operations using long, rigid instruments under endoscopic control. With the so-called tactile forceps, researchers from Daimler-Benz AG - in cooperation with Dornier Medizintechnik and with Prof. Gerhard Buess and his team from the Department of Minimal-Invasive Surgery at the University of T&uuml;bingen - are making contributions to this field of research and thus to the comfort of the patient.<P>Endoscopic operations have one weak point as compared with conventional "open" surgery: they have to dispense with the functional unity of the surgeon's hand and his instrument - the surgeon thus cannot directly "feel" internal organs and surrounding tissue. And this is where the tactile forceps enter the scene: pressure applied to the instrument inside the patient's body is conveyed to the handle, where it can be "felt" by the surgeon.<P>The jaws of the forceps are fitted with an array of microsensors and a pressure sensor. When an object comes into contact with the jaws, the sensors measure the tactile impulses, which are processed and conveyed to the handle, where an array of actuators converts this information into a corresponding counterpressure at the surgeon's fingertips. The sensors and actuators thus induce tactile impulses in the surgeon's hand; this ensures safe, reliable endoscopic surgery.<P>The tactile forceps provide impressive documentation as to how the use of microsystems technology can provide tactile information for minimal-invasive surgery. The forceps also allow minimal-invasive palpation for the detection and location of pathologically diseased tissue. Large, compact organs (e.g. the liver or pancreas) can be examined just as conveniently as organs of more indeterminate shape (e.g. the intestines).<P>The tactile forceps reduce the burden placed on the patient through surgery. At the same time, they enhance the quality of patient care while reducing the risk of complications. Prototypes of the tactile forceps are currently undergoing clinical tests.</TABLE><P><BR><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="60709_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../news_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Research &amp; Technology</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="60702_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>  <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 07/09/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

However, these are not the mystical doings of a sorcerer, but the work of the Daimler-Benz researchers, who are feeding soiled elements of foamed polyurethane (PU) waste into a recycling unit.<p>The chemistry of polyurethane recycling - so-called glycolysis - is by no means enshrouded in mystery; on the contrary, it can be put to use without difficulty for processing sorted PU waste. A mechanical trick has now enabled the scientists from the Daimler-Benz Ulm Research Centre to also recycle soiled foamed materials. PU waste from composite components, exterior panelling elements, seat padding and paint residues can thus be further processed for renewed automo-tive application.<p>And this is how it works. Prior to the actual conversion process, the scientists carry out pre-glycolysis. In a torsion reactor, two feed screws mix the viscous PU waste, which is heated to 180&#176; C, with glycol. This produces a "pre-glycolysate", the basis for further recycling. Without this preliminary treatment, the substances would soon stick to the reactor's stirring mechanism. Due to the high torsion exerted in the kneading process, the impurities are pulverised to a size of about thirty micrometres. At this size, the substances can no longer damage the stirring mechanism - finely distributed, they in fact prove useful as a filling agent for the plastic.<p>The recycled polyurethane from soiled waste elements can well stand up to a comparison with polyurethane components made from "fresh" materials. Mechanical characteristics such as bending resistance or impact strength are comparable with those of elements made from new raw materials. A preliminary cost estimate at Daimler-Benz has shown the recycling of soiled polyurethane to be quite viable in economic terms.</TABLE><P><BR><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="60702_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../news_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Research &amp; Technology</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="60625_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>  <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 07/02/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

In der Daimler-Benz Aerospace wurden die Traditions-<wbr>Unternehmen Dornier, Messerschmitt-<wbr>B&ouml;lkow-<wbr>Blohm GmbH (MBB), MTU Motoren- und Turbinen-<wbr>Union M&uuml;nchen und Telefunken Systemtechnik (TST) zusammengef&uuml;hrt und neu geordnet, um die internationale Wettbewerbsf&auml;higkeit der deutschen Luft- und Raumfahrtindustrie zu sichern. 

<P>



Diese Industrie nimmt eine technologische Schl&uuml;sselrolle ein, die entscheidenden Einflu&szlig; auf die

Wettbewerbsf&auml;higkeit und wirtschaftliche Zukunft der hochindustrialisierten L&auml;nder hat. Da sie &uuml;ber Spitzentechnologien wie Mikroelektronik, Materialtechnik, Mikrosystemtechnik, Sensorik,

Informationsverarbeitung und das zugeh&ouml;rige Know-how in den Bereichen Fertigung und

Integration verf&uuml;gt, ist sie Impulsgeber und Schrittmacher f&uuml;r den technologischen Fortschritt in

vielen anderen Bereichen. 

<P>





Die F&auml;higkeiten und Aktivit&auml;ten der Ausgangsgesellschaften wurden in der Dasa in die

vier strategischen Gesch&auml;ftsfelder Luftfahrt, Raumfahrt, Verteidigung und Zivile Systeme sowie

Antriebe eingebracht. Die vier Gesch&auml;ftsfelder sind wiederum in Produktbereiche unterteilt. 

<P>



Innerhalb von nur zwei Jahren gelang es, die Ausgangsgesellschaften zu einem einheitlichem

Unternehmen zusammenzuf&uuml;hren. Dieser Proze&szlig; wurde 1992 mit dem Aufgehen von TST und MBB in der Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG weitgehend vollendet. Heute hat die "neue" Daimler-Benz Aerospace als operative Kerngesellschaft noch drei wichtige Tochterunternehmen, die aus strategischen Gr&uuml;nden auch weiterhin eigenst&auml;ndige Einheiten bleiben sollen: Daimler-Benz Aerospace Airbus, Dornier und MTU M&uuml;nchen.

Die Mercedes-<wbr>Benz-<wbr>Werke in Deutschland arbeiten in einem modernen Produktionsverbund mit gegenseitigen Zulieferungen von Aggregaten und Teilen. Hauptverwaltung und Entwicklungszentrum befinden sich in Stuttgart-<wbr>Untert&uuml;rkheim. Hier werden auch alle Pkw-<wbr>Motoren, -Getriebe und -Achsen hergestellt. Das gr&ouml;&szlig;te Werk des Unternehmens ist das Karosserie- und Montagewerk Sindelfingen, das in einem engen Produktionsverbund mit den Montagewerken in Bremen und Rastatt steht. Zum Pkw-<wbr>Bereich geh&ouml;ren auch die Werke Berlin-<wbr>Marienfelde und Hamburg-<wbr>Harburg. Insgesamt waren im Gesch&auml;ftsfeld Personenwagen rund 76.400 Mitarbeiter besch&auml;ftigt.

<P>





Traditionell werden Mercedes-<wbr>Benz Personenwagen in Deutschland gefertigt. Ausl&auml;ndische Montagestandorte existieren aber schon seit vielen Jahren in L&auml;ndern des Fernen Ostens und in der Republik S&uuml;dafrika. Die weltweite Pr&auml;senz als Anbieter von Personenwagen wird Mercedes-<wbr>Benz nun auch verst&auml;rkt im Produktionssektor ausbauen. Die Erfahrungen mit der Produktion bzw. Montage von Personenwagen zum Beispiel in der Republik S&uuml;dafrika und in Mexiko zeigen, da&szlig; die Mercedes-<wbr>Philosophie ohne Qualit&auml;tseinbu&szlig;en ebenso au&szlig;erhalb Deutschlands zu realisieren ist: "Made in Germany" wird sich in Zukunft zu "Made by Mercedes-<wbr>Benz" weiterentwickeln. Auch die Aktivit&auml;ten in China, Indien, Indonesien, Malaysia, S&uuml;dkorea, Thailand und Vietnam unterstreichen die Neuausrichtung im Pkw-<wbr>Bereich. Ein weiterer Meilenstein in der Internationalisierungs-<wbr>Strategie wird das neue Werk in den USA sein. In Tuscaloosa im Bundesstaat Alabama sollen von 1997 an j&auml;hrlich etwa 60.000 bis 70.000 Einheiten des neuen allradgetriebenen Freizeitfahrzeugs gebaut werden.

Die Werke W&ouml;rth (Lastwagen) und D&uuml;sseldorf (Transporter) stehen mit Mannheim (Omnibusse der EvoBus GmbH sowie Nutzfahrzeug- und Industriemotoren), Gaggenau (Unimog und Nutzfahrzeuggetriebe) und Kassel (Achsen) im Produktionsverbund. 

<P>



Ab Februar 1991 wurden dar&uuml;ber hinaus bei der Nutzfahrzeuge Ludwigsfelde GmbH (NLG) s&uuml;dlich von Berlin leichte Lastwagen der W&ouml;rther Baureihe LN 2 montiert. Im September 1991 begann dort au&szlig;erdem die Montage des Transporters vom Typ T2. Die NLG ist seit Januar 1994 eine 100prozentige Tochtergesellschaft der Mercedes-<wbr>Benz AG. Seit August 1994 wird in Ludwigsfelde ausschlie&szliglich der Transporter T2 gefertigt.

<P>



Bedeutende &uuml;berseeische Tochtergesellschaften produzieren in Brasilien, den USA und Kanada, Mexiko, Argentinien und in der Republik S&uuml;dafrika. In Europa spielen Spanien und die T&uuml;rkei als Produktionsstandorte eine wichtige Rolle. Mit der &Uuml;bernahme der Karl K&auml;ssbohrer GmbH im Februar 1995 und der Gr&uuml;ndung der EvoBus GmbH wurde der europ&auml;ische Produktionsverbund von Mercedes-<wbr>Benz im Omnibusbereich um die Werke in Ulm, Neu-<wbr>Ulm und im franz&ouml;sischen Ligny erweitert. Ziel von Mercedes-<wbr>Benz ist es, als Full-<wbr>Line-<wbr>Anbieter und Weltmarktf&uuml;hrer f&uuml;r Lastwagen &uuml;ber sechs Tonnen und Busse &uuml;ber acht Tonnen den internationalen Produktionsverbund weiter auszubauen.

Daneben sind British Aerospace mit 20 Prozent und die spanische Casa mit 4,2 Prozent beteiligt. Die Daimler-Benz Aerospace Airbus liefert wesentliche Gro&szlig;bauteile f&uuml;r die Airbus-Flugzeuge und ist f&uuml;r die komplette Innenausstattung der Maschinen - mit Ausnahme der A330 und A340 - zust&auml;ndig. <P>Bereits seit Juni 1992 erfolgt in Hamburg die Endmontage der A321. Im Januar 1994 wurde das erste Flugzeug dieses Typs an die Lufthansa ausgeliefert. Zus&auml;tzlich wird in Hamburg seit M&auml;rz 1995 das kleinste Mitglied der Airbus-Familie, die A319, endmontiert. Dieser 135-Sitzer hatte seinen offiziellen Programmstart im Juni 1993. Im August 1995 fanden Roll-out und Erstflug der A 319 statt. Durch die Endmontage der A321 und der A319 werden erstmals seit 1945 wieder gr&ouml;&szlig;ere Passagierflugzeuge in Deutschland komplett gebaut. <P>In Folge der deutschen Vereinigung verf&uuml;gt die Daimler-Benz Aerospace Airbus seit Juli 1991 auch im Osten Deutschlands &uuml;ber Produktionskapazit&auml;ten. Dazu wurden Teile der Flugzeugwerft Dresden GmbH in die neugegr&uuml;ndete Elbe Flugzeugwerke GmbH (Dresden) eingebracht, an der die Daimler-Benz Aerospace Airbus 100 Prozent h&auml;lt. Hier werden unter anderem Airbus-Teile gefertigt. Au&szlig;erdem haben die Elbe Flugzeugwerke im Juli 1993 die europ&auml;ische Zulassung f&uuml;r die Wartung der Boeing 737 erhalten. <P>Neue Flugzeuge zu entwickeln kostet viel Zeit. Deshalb arbeitet die Daimler-Benz Aerospace Airbus schon heute in internationalen Kooperationen an den Flugzeugen f&uuml;r morgen. Mit positiven Erkenntnissen abgeschlossen wurde bereits die Machbarkeitsstudie f&uuml;r das Cyroplane, das in deutsch-russischer Kooperation entwickelt wird. Dieses Flugzeug kann mit fl&uuml;ssigem Wasserstoff anstelle von Kerosin fliegen. Im Rahmen einer Machbarkeitsstudie untersuchen Airbus Industrie und ihre Partnerfirmen Chancen und technische L&ouml;sungen f&uuml;r ein sehr gro&szlig;es Verkehrsflugzeug mit mehr als 400 Sitzen. Das Konzept: ein Flugzeug mit vier Triebwerken in einem v&ouml;llig neuen Airbus-Design mit zwei Passagierdecks. L&auml;nge und Spannweiten werden in den Weiterentwicklungen jeweils 80 Meter nicht &uuml;berschreiten. Die Geschwindigkeit wird bei Mach 0,85 liegen. Der Arbeitstitel des Projekts ist "A3XX". Ein derartiges Gro&szlig;raumflugzeug erf&uuml;llt den Bedarf der prognostizierten Verdoppelung des Luftverkehrsaufkommens innerhalb der n&auml;chsten 15 Jahre und erg&auml;nzt die heutige Airbus-Familie nach oben hin. Die geforderte deutliche Verbesserung der Wirtschaftlichkeit und Umweltvertr&auml;glichkeit wird durch Einbeziehung neuer Techniken erreicht.<P>Auch die Programm-Organisationen des geplanten europ&auml;ischen Milit&auml;rtransportflugzeuges FLA findet ab 1996 unter dem Dach des Airbus-Konsortium statt. Neben den vier Airbus-Partnern werden sich auch die italienische Alenia sowie an der Airbus Military Aircraft Company beteiligen. <A NAME="mili"></A><P><br><B>Milit&auml;rflugzeuge</B><P>Der Schwerpunkt des Produktbereichs Milit&auml;rflugzeuge liegt auf der Entwicklung des europ&auml;ischen Jagdflugzeugs Eurofighter 2000. Der erste Prototyp hat am 27. M&auml;rz 1994 vomFlugerprobungszentrum Manching der Dasa aus erfolgreich seinen Erstflug absolviert. AmEurofighter-Projekt sind neben der Dasa auch British Aerospace (Gro&szlig;britannien), Alenia (Italien) und Casa (Spanien) beteiligt.<P>Am trinationalen Tornado-Programm (Deutschland, England, Italien) ist der Produktbereich ebenfalls beteiligt: Im Werk Augsburg werden komplette Rumpfmittelteile gefertigt, am Standort Manching Wartungs- und Instandsetzungsarbeiten ausgef&uuml;hrt. Manching wird zum Betreuungszentrum der Dasa f&uuml;r die bei der Bundeswehr eingesetzten Milit&auml;rflugzeuge ausgebaut. <A NAME="hubschrauber"></A><P><br><B>Hubschrauber</B><P>Um die Wettbewerbsf&auml;higkeit der europ&auml;ischen Hubschrauberindustrie zu steigern, brachte die Dasa ihre Aktivit&auml;ten in diesem Bereich im Januar 1992 in eine gemeinsame Gesellschaft mit der franz&ouml;sischen Aerospatiale ein: Die daraus entstandene Eurocopter Holding (Beteiligung der Daimler-Benz Aerospace 40 Prozent, Aerospatiale 60 Prozent) deckt das gesamte Produktspektrum von einmotorigen Leichthubschraubern bis hin zu mittelschwerenTransporthubschraubern ab. Das binationale Gemeinschaftsunternehmen wurde durch denZusammenschlu&szlig; zum weltweit zweitgr&ouml;&szlig;ten Anbieter von Hubschraubern und zum gr&ouml;&szlig;tenExporteur von zivilen Helikoptern &uuml;berhaupt.</TABLE><P><br><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="aircr2_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>English</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Daimler-Benz</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../group_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>&Uuml;berblick</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="aircra_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Zur&uuml;ck</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Suche</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>  <A HREF="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Hilfe</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 14.06.1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Beispiele hierf&uuml;r sind das bemannbare Columbus-Raumlabor COF (Columbus Orbital Facility), das an die geplante Internationale Raumstation Alpha angedockt werden soll und die erste europ&auml;ische freifliegende und r&uuml;ckf&uuml;hrbare Forschungsplattform Eureca. Im Bereich der konventionellen und zuk&uuml;nftigen Raumtransportsysteme ist die Dasa ma&szlig;geblich an der europ&auml;ischen Tr&auml;gerraketen-Familie Ariane 4 und 5 sowie deren Nachfolgesystemen beteiligt. Dar&uuml;ber hinaus arbeitet die Dasa an einem automatischen Transferfahrzeug ATV (Automated Transfer Vehicle) und an zukunftsweisenden Technologien f&uuml;r k&uuml;nftige bemannbare europ&auml;ische Raumtransportsysteme der nahen und fernen Zukunft.<P>Die Satellitenaktivit&auml;ten der Dasa, die an den Standorten Friedrichshafen und Ottobrunn lokalisiert sind, wurden in der Dornier Satellitensysteme GmbH (DSS) zusammengefa&szlig;t. Die beiden Produktionsstandorte bleiben bestehen, Sitz des Unternehmens ist Friedrichshafen. Gesch&auml;ftszweck der DSS sind Entwicklung, Bau und Vermarktung von Satellitensystemen, Nutzlasten, Instrumenten, Untersystemen und Komponenten f&uuml;r zivile und sicherheitspolitische Anwendungen in Wissenschaft, Erdbeobachtung/ Meteorologie, Kommunikation und Navigation. Die DSS engagiert sich auch im Bereich der Nutzung von Satellitendaten und bietet einen eigenen Kunden-Datenservice an.<P>Zu den herausragenden Aktivit&auml;ten der DSS geh&auml;ren die Erderkundungssatelliten ERS-1 und ERS-2 und das Multifrequenz-Radarinstrument SIR-C/X-SAR. Die DSS entwickelt und baut als Systemf&uuml;hrer auch Instrumente zur wissenschaftlichen Erkundung des Weltraums: Die Faint Object Camera im Hubble Space Telescope, die Sonnensonde Ulysses, der R&auml;ntgenstrahlensatellit Rosat und neben anderen wesentlichen Komponenten das Infrarotinstrument Isophot f&uuml;r das Weltraumobservatorium ISO. Sie erf&uuml;llen bereits ihre Aufgaben. Auf ihren Start vorbereitet wird derzeit die Titan-Sonde Huygens. F&uuml;r die Deutsche Agentur f&uuml;r Raumfahrtangelegenheiten entwickelte die DSS den wiederverwendbaren Wissenschaftssatelliten Astro-Spas, der bereits drei Eins&auml;tze erfolgreich beendet hat. <P>Im Bereich der Satellitenkommunikation arbeitet die heutige DSS seit vielen Jahren mit dem franz&auml;sischen Aerospatiale-Konzern zusammen. Die Partner verf&uuml;gen zur Zeit &uuml;ber einen Auftragsbestand von &uuml;ber 10 Kommunikationssatelliten. Mit dem 1994 plazierten Auftrag f&uuml;r Entwicklung und Fertigung von wesentlichen Untersystemen f&uuml;r 56 Globalstar-Satelliten, kommt der DSS eine Schl&uuml;sselrolle bei diesem satellitengest&uuml;tzten Mobilfunksystem zu.<P>Im Mai 1993 trat die Dasa erstmals auch als Satellitenbetreiber auf dem Weltmarkt auf. So betreibt ein internationales Konsortium unter Dasa-F&uuml;hrung den Aufbau und Betrieb eines satellitengest&uuml;tzten Kommunikationssystems f&uuml;r den s&uuml;dlichen Teil Lateinamerikas mit argentinischer Lizenz. Am internationalen Mobilfunksystem Globalstar ist die Dasa ebenfalls beteiligt.</TABLE><P><br><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="space2_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>English</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Daimler-Benz</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../group_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>&Uuml;berblick</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="space_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Zur&uuml;ck</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Suche</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>  <A HREF="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Hilfe</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 19.11.1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

In order to strengthen the company's market position in Germany and to obtain access to international markets, debis Systemhaus entered into a strategic alliance with <A HREF="http://www.cgs.fr">Cap Gemini Sogeti</A> in 1992.<p>The range of products offered by Germany's leading independent IT service company addresses the specific needs of each sector of the economy, and covers the entire spectrum of information processing. Through its core competences in consultancy, development and marketing, debis Systemhaus is in a position to offer its customers information technology solutions that will transform and revitalise their businesses - and all from a single source. As an example, debis Systemhaus will take over responsibility for the maintenance and servicing of applications systems. Business Transformation Services will not only design, implement and service the customer's IT-related corporate functions - for instance the computer centre and network services - but also take over operational responsibility. "The crucial advantage for the customer," says Karl-Heinz Achinger, the member of the Board of Management of debis AG responsible for Systemhaus, "is that on the one hand he receives high-value services which can be provided with flexibility and yet within planned time schedules and budgets; whilst on the other hand he can rely on the corporate strength and expertise of one of the biggest suppliers of comprehensive IT services in the European market that is not tied to any specific manufacturer."<p>In 1994 debis Systemhaus with its staff of more than 6,000 achieved total turnover of DM 1.8 billion in this market, which will generate some DM 22 billion worth of business in Germany  this year. </TABLE><P><br><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="syste2_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../group_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>At a Glance</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="system_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Up</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 04/11/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

But once the useful life of a computer comes to an end, this vital entity becomes a significant problem: a board joins both valuable and polluting materials cheek-by-jowl in an inseparable unit. Until now the tendency has been to consign the boards-lock, stock, and barrel-to the garbage heap.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Pilot plant<br>in operation<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>Thanks to Daimler-Benz researchers, however, electronic scrap recycling has just taken a significant step forward. By modifying and combining a number of different individual processes, the researchers have succeeded in reducing the boards to their material constituents. Indeed, a pilot plant using their process has already been running in Ulm for a few months now.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110> <B>A multi-stage process<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>The populated circuit boards are initially shredded, before being selectively comminuted at low temperature in the second stage of the process. A magnetic separator then removes the larger nickel and iron components from the coarse fraction. And once the dust particles have been separated from the fine fraction, the latter is then separated into plastic and metal fractions by means of dry mechanical separation. Once again, the iron and nickel components of the metal fraction are removed by the magnetic separator.<p><a href="../pics/14_2.jpg"><img align=left vspace=3 hspace=-2 width=100 height=80 border=0 src="../pics/14_2.gif"></a><img align=left vspace=3 hspace=-2 width=6 height=80 src="../../icons/abstand.gif"><p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Purer materials,<br>lower emissions<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>In comparison to rival methods, this four-stage process offers a number of advantages: the metal recyclates are purer, and therefore easier to reprocess; the emissions are lower; no dioxins or furans are produced; and the process technology is simpler.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Valuable scrap<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>The recycling technique is also economically interesting. Costs of DM 300 to DM 500 per tonne of circuit board scrap give returns of DM 800 to DM 3000, depending on the gold content.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Still being tackled<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>One outstanding problem is how to reprocess the residual fraction with its high plastics component. Cracking this nut is now the task of Daimler-Benz's partner Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which is already working intensively on a gasification and methanoly synthesis plant. The Japanese engineers can already gasify 99 percent of the residual fraction, although at present, the pollutant levels formed in this process are still significantly in excess of the levels permitted in Germany.<p><TD WIDTH=20><tr><td><br></table><p><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="14_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../envir_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environment</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../ub96_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environmental Report '96</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../schlag_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Highlights</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="15_1_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 08/06/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Mercedes-Benz's investment in the construction of the pre-assembly area, the main assembly line, and the wide-ranging modernization of component manufacturing amounted to DM 300 million.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110> <B>Biological oil<br>replaces emulsion<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>One major step on this particular route to reducing environmental strain was the introduction of a synthetic oil ester into the production process. Until then, the cooling and lubricating agents used in cutting processes, for example, where made up of an oil-in-water emulsion. This has now been replaced by biological oils. Consequently, Mercedes-Benz's Mannheim plant is the world's first engine plant to utilize such an oil ester in cutting processes.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Tandem project<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>The innovative and progressive firm behind this new family of biological oils is the Mannheim-based lubricant manufacturer FUCHS. Working in close cooperation with the machine tools manufacturing industry, FUCHS carried out extensive preliminary tests to investigate such things as the elastomer-compatibility of cabling and sealing compounds which are used for the machine tools and come into contact with the new ester oils.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Zero hazard<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>In addition, it is also possible to utilize these ester oils in the hydraulic equipment, and as lubrication for the bed track and gearing which are to be found in today's machine tools. Whereas traditional machine oils are generally made up of more than 90 percent mineral oil, the new synthetic esters are manufactured from vegetable raw material, and have been classified as totally harmless to water supplies. Moreover, the new oils have other advantages: unlike traditional water-in-oil emulsions, they are resistant to bacteria, which results in much reduced machine servicing. They also require less frequent changing, and therefore do not have to be disposed of so often. Finally, the disposal process itself is totally unproblematic.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Versatility saves!<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>Thanks to their versatility, the ester oils can be used to replace cooling lubricants, hydraulic oils, and machine lubricating oils. They can therefore be utilized in a series of consecutive production steps which means that the wash processes between the individual production steps can be eliminated. The result is not only a reduction in cleaning agents, fresh water, and waste water, but also a lower energy requirement at the plant's clarification works.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Easy on the skin<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>Last but not least, as well as marking another milestone on the road towards a better environment, the introduction of the ester oils is also much appreciated by the skin of staff working at the plant.<p><TD WIDTH=20><tr><td><br></table><p><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="15_1_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../envir_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environment</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../ub96_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environmental Report '96</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../schlag_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Highlights</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="15_2_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 08/06/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

The victorious advance of the aerodynamic, high-technology bumper system has led to increased traffic safety and reduced repair costs. Progress, however, has its price: in this case, a new problem for the recyclers. Exactly how do you dispose of a sophisticated mixture of 10 percent metal, 10 percent foam, 35 percent elastomers or thermosets, and 45 percent painted thermoplastics such as polycarbonate and polypropylene?<p>A few months ago, engineers at Daimler-Benz's Ulm Research Center broke the back of this problem. Their solution is a plant capable of separating and recycling all of the components up to a 0.5 percent dust and a 10 percent plastics residue fraction. Scaled up to handle 200 000 bumpers, such a plant would be able to produce raw material to the value of DM 30 from every bumper-for a processing cost of just DM 3.50.<p>This new process consists in fact of two separate stages: first of all, the preliminary mechanical preparation-including disassembly of the bumper bracket, cutting mill, grading, plus low-intensity and high-intensity magnetic separation; and, secondly, the chemical reprocessing, which involves removing paint from polypropylene and polycarbonate components, and separating polycarbonate and polypropylene blend in the dense-medium separator.<p>The latest advance to be achieved is in the paint removal process, which-as a result-is now even more environmentally-friendly. The reason: the barrel finishing plant now uses a new, completely non-toxic, two-component mixture in place of conventional swelling agents, which are a hazard to water supplies.<p></table><p><br><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="15_2_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../envir_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environment</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../ub96_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environmental Report '96</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../schlag_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Highlights</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="16_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 08/06/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Inside, metal components are submerged in baths of highly concentrated and often poisonous metal salts which, under the influence of an electric current, yield elemental metals that are then deposited as a shining coating on the surfaces of the immersed parts.<p>So far so good, but once the baths are exhausted, the problems really begin. At this stage, although the metal salt concentrations in the baths are too low for electroplating, they are still way too high for the solutions to be simply poured down the drain. Disposal of the poisonous brew is thus a major headache. Of course, the most elegant answer is to stretch, save, and reprocess the baths so that the residues are minimized.<p>This recycling philosophy has been thoroughly taken on board at Daimler-Benz Aerospace's (Dasa) Augsburg electroplating facility, which is primarily responsible for chrome-anodizing aluminum and pickling titanium. The facility, which was commissioned in 1995, includes the following features:&bull;  The baths remain "fresh" for longer thanks to innovations such as a cascade washing process, which returns media carry-over; edge-spraying equipment fed from the subsequent wash bath; evaporation techniques for concentrating and recycling drag-out rinse water and process solutions; and, finally, an ion exchange plant to remove polluting trivalent metal ions from the anodizing baths.<p>Compared to the old, closed facility, the waste-water discharges are down to just fifteen percent of their original value. Such advances have been achieved courtesy of a multiple rinsing technique, ion exchanger cycles, settable drip times, spray protection, and reclaiming materials.Moreover, the pollutant levels which are contained in the remaining effluents can now be reduced by more than 90 percent thanks to the use of a selective ion-exchange plant, which binds the dissolved metals.</table><p><br><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="16_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../envir_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environment</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../ub96_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environmental Report '96</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../schlag_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Highlights</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="17_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 08/06/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Der Siegeszug des aerodynamischen High-Tech-Sto&szlig;f&auml;ngersystems erh&ouml;hte, wie erwartet, die Sicherheit im Stra&szlig;enverkehr und senkte die Reparaturkosten. Doch der Knautschpuffer stellte die Schrottverwerter vor ein neues Problem: Wie sollten sie das kunstvolle Stoffgemisch aus 10 Prozent Metall, 10 Prozent Schaumstoff, 35 Prozent Elastomeren oder Duromeren und     45 Prozent lackierten Thermoplasten wie Polycarbonat (PC) und Polypropylen (PP) blo&szlig; entsorgen?Vor wenigen Monaten l&ouml;sten Ingenieure des Daimler-Benz Forschungszentrums in Ulm dieses Problem weitgehend: In einer Laboranlage k&ouml;nnen sie bis auf 0,5 Prozent Staub und 10 Prozent Restkunststoffe alle Bestandteile voneinander trennen und weiterverwerten. Eine f&uuml;r 200000 Sto&szlig;f&auml;nger ausgelegte Recyclinganlage w&uuml;rde aus jedem Sto&szlig;f&auml;nger Rohmaterial im Wert von 30 Mark zur&uuml;ckholen, und das bei Aufbereitungskosten von nur 3,50 Mark.Das Verfahren besteht aus zwei Schritten: Einer mechanischen Aufbereitung (mit Demontage des Biegetr&auml;gers, Doppelwellenschneider, Klassierung, Schwach- und Starkmagnetscheidung) folgt eine chemische Aufbereitung (Entlakkung der PP- und PC-Kunststoffteile und   anschlie&szlig;end Trennung von PC- oder PP-Blend im Schwertr&uuml;bescheider).Bei der Entlackung wurden j&uuml;ngst Fortschritte erzielt, die auch diesen Einzelproze&szlig; umweltvertr&auml;glicher machen: In der Gleitschleifanlage wird ein im Vergleich zu herk&ouml;mmlichen, wassergef&auml;hrdenden Quellmitteln absolut ungiftiges Zwei-Kom-ponenten-Gemisch verwendet.</table><p><br><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="15_2_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>English</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../envir_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Umwelt</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../ub96_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Umweltbericht '96</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../schlag_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Schlaglichter</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="16_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Weiter</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Suche</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Hilfe</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 06.08.1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

So it was that engineers developed a composite palladium/rhodium coating for the catalytic converter cells used in the four-cylinder E 200 and E 230 models. The result: warming up time is reduced which cuts down hydrocarbon emissions by up to 35 percent compared to conventional catalytic converters. In the new E 420, too, a computer corrects ignition timing and fuel supply so that the catalytic converter can reach optimal performance in a shorter space of time. As for nitrogen oxide emissions from the new diesel sedan, these have been cut by as much as half thanks to an oxidizing catalyst and recycling of the exhaust gases.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Less than 5 liters<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>And it's the same story for fuel consumption: compared to previous models, the new E class range is a real thrifty operator. Gasoline models are down by up to ten percent and the E 290 turbodiesel has even managed to crack the magical 5-liter barrier. With an average consumption of 4.6 liters per hundred kilometers at a speed of 90 km/h, one full tank of 65 liters will take you all the way from Berlin to Venice.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110> <B>Slimming down costs<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>Such savings on fuel are partly due to a commitment to light-weight construction. Thanks to high-strength steels, some alloyed with titanium, engineers were able to slim down the parts used. Although members of the E-class still weigh anything from 1.44 to 1.69 tonnes, the increased space that they offer means a relative weight reduction of up to 9 percent.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Minimal drag<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>Low drag values (Cd values) also play a special part in curbing fuel consumption. At a value of 0.27 both the E 200 and the E 220 diesel outperform any other series production sedan. Authors of this particular success story are the engineers and designers who managed to quell even the smallest ripple of turbulence after testing a variety of different forms for the spoiler, external mirrors, rear window, radiator grille, front apron, sun roof, and the trailing edge of the trunk, where the airflow breaks away from the vehicle.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Even quieter<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>But environmental protection also means cutting noise pollution -which is why the Mercedes designers have been doing their best to make the new E-class quieter. And not without success: All models satisfy the strict EU standards in this area, with the automatic version of the E 220 diesel, for example, being 3 decibels under the specified level. In fact, the new models are no more than a quarter as loud as cars from ten years ago.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Recycled and<br>natural materials<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>Last but not least, the E-class also incorporates a range of recycled and natural materials. Indeed, 17 components are already manufactured from natural materials: the interior door paneling is made from a flax/sisal mixture; driver and passenger are actually cushioned by natural mattresses filled with coconut fiber, animal hair, and latex; and trim for the arm rests and door pillars contains cotton, as do the supports for the rear parcel shelf.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>85 percent<br>re-use<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>Although a car completely constructed from natural materials is still little more than a designer's dream, the fully recyclable vehicle could soon become reality. Around 85 percent of a Mercedes-Benz already flows back into the cycle of reusable materials. Moreover, thanks to the Mercedes-Recycling-System (MeRSy), used parts and materials are now being collected from service and repair workshops and recycled whenever possible.<p><TD WIDTH=20><tr><td><br></table><p><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="17_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../envir_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environment</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../ub96_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environmental Report '96</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../schlag_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Highlights</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="18_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 08/06/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

In alliance with Daimler-Benz, Euro- natur is also sponsor of a national parks program in the new federal states of Germany, chief example of which is the M&uuml;ritz National Park in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, and of the Northern Sporades marine national park in the Greek Aegean.<tr><td><br></TABLE><p><TABLE border=0><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110> <B>Extremadura,<br>Spain<br></B><br><a href="../pics/18_1.jpg"><img vspace=3 hspace=-2 width=100 height=80 border=0 src="../pics/18_1.gif"></a><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>The Iberian peninsula is crossed by ancient long-distance paths which, since before the days of Don Quixote, have been used by shepherds driving their flocks to different regions in accordance with the rhythm of the seasons. In an initial project, two routes in the Extremadura are now to be protected and opened up to for a gentler sort of tourism. The first successes of this approach may already be seen. Recently, three shepherds with a total of 3000 sheep have again begun to use the paths-a first, important step towards establishing a new kind of conservation area: the world's first national trail park.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Provence,<br>France<br></B><br><a href="../pics/18_2.jpg"><img vspace=3 hspace=-2 width=100 height=80 border=0 src="../pics/18_2.gif"></a><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>Situated in southern France, hemmed in between the cities of Marseille, Arles, and Aix-en-Provence, lies the area known as the Crau. On closer examination, this barren steppe turns out to be veritable herb garden. Thyme, lavender, rosemary, and other herbs flourish there, as do rare species of fauna, including fourteen species of grasshoppers alone. Intensive farming practices, garbage dumps, a military air base, and monotonous peach plantations have made threatening incursions into the once 600-square-kilometer area. "Naturally Mobile" is doing everything within its power to preserve the remaining 115 square kilometers of breathtaking landscape.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110> <B>Bremer Becken,<br> Germany<br></B><br><a href="../pics/18_3.jpg"><img vspace=3 hspace=-2 width=100 height=125 border=0 src="../pics/18_3.gif"></a><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>Encircled by a largely intact green belt, Bremen has long been the envy of other cities. Natural river plains, meadowlands, and flood plains such as those on the stretches around W&uuml;mme and Ochtum, where the River Weser has been restored to its natural state, provide a home for rare flora and fauna, plus a dust filter and oxygen source for Bremen itself. Located on the city's very doorstep, the Bremer Becken is also a priceless recreational area. Protection of this green belt-one of the aims of the "Naturally Mobile" project-will mean that the citizen of Bremen can continue to enjoy this rural tranquillity without having to burden the environment with journeys farther afield.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Green Bridges,<br> Hungary<br></B><br><a href="../pics/18_4.jpg"><img vspace=3 hspace=-2 width=100 height=80 border=0 src="../pics/18_4.gif"></a><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>Like many areas in the former eastern bloc countries, southern Hungary is threatened by intensive use.

So bringt eine neuentwickelte Beschichtung der Katalysatorzellen mit einem Palladium/Rhodium-Gemisch die Kats der Vierzylindermodelle E 200 und E 230 schneller "auf Touren", so da&szlig; sich die Aufw&auml;rmphase verk&uuml;rzt und sich die Kohlenwasserstoff-Emissionen gegen&uuml;ber herk&ouml;mmlichen Kats um bis zu 35 Prozent verringern. Beim neuen E 420 korrigiert ein Computer nach dem Start Z&uuml;ndeinstellung und Kraftstoffzufuhr, so da&szlig; der Kat schneller seine volle Leistung erreicht. Der Stickoxidaussto&szlig; der Diesellimousinen konnte mit Hilfe eines Oxidationskatalysators und einer R&uuml;ckf&uuml;hrung der Abgase sogar um etwa die H&auml;lfte reduziert werden.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Unter 5 Liter<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>Auch der Kraftstoff-Verbrauch der neuen E-Klasse-Modelle liegt weit unter dem ihrer Vorg&auml;nger, bei den Benzinern sind es bis zu zehn Prozent.

This reduces CO2 emissions by 70 percent-the equivalent of 48000 tonnes of this greenhouse gas-or the amount emitted from 9600 family dwellings.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=110><B>Air Conditioning</B><br><a href="../pics/31_2.jpg"><img vspace=3 hspace=-2 width=100 height=80 border=0 src="../pics/31_2.gif"></a><img vspace=3 hspace=-2 width=6 height=80 src="../../icons/abstand.gif"><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>Thanks to intelligent building design, the rooms do not overheat in the summer. Not only does this dispense with the need for air-conditioning, it also means that occupants can open windows as they please. And when it is too cold outside to do just that, a ventilation system sees to it that there's sufficient fresh air. In computing rooms, for example, where extra cooling is required, water chilled to a temperature of 18&#176;C circulates in cooling "ceilings". All in all, this means that heating and cooling requirements consume only half as much energy as would be required by a conventional air conditioning system.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=110> <B>Heat Insulation</B><br><a href="../pics/31_1.jpg"><img vspace=3 hspace=-2 width=100 height=80 border=0 src="../pics/31_1.gif"></a><img vspace=3 hspace=-2 width=6 height=80 src="../../icons/abstand.gif"><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>With thick thermal insulation layers in the exterior walls plus thermal insulation glass instead of conventional double glazing, the buildings have a much higher thermal insulation rating than normal and use up to 30 percent less energy on heating.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=110><B>Lighting<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>It is a well known fact that sunlight is not only free, but also induces a better frame of mind than artificial lighting.

Part of the water is soaked up by the vegetation planted on the roof, part tops up the lake by the National Library, and part is used to water the plants in the borders below. Anything left is used to fill w.c. cisterns. This represents a saving of 20 million liters of drinking water a year-the equivalent of 6500 crates of water every day.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=110> <B>Building materials</B><br><a href="../pics/31_3.jpg"><img vspace=3 hspace=-2 width=100 height=80 border=0 src="../pics/31_3.gif"></a><img vspace=3 hspace=-2 width=6 height=80 src="../../icons/abstand.gif"><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>These were chosen according to environmental and health criteria.

A specially constructed bridge over the Landwehr Canal and a private road now link the site with the logistics center located in the Anhalt freight depot. Here, ships and railway freight cars-the two forms of transport least damaging to the environment-maintain the supply of building materials. This represents a saving of around 42000 truck kilometers a day, and also keeps the lid on dust and exhaust emissions-not to mention the tempers of the Berliners who need not face any extra traffic jams as a result of the construction work.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=110> <B>Groundwater</B><br><a href="../pics/31_4.jpg"><img vspace=3 hspace=-2 width=100 height=125 border=0 src="../pics/31_4.gif"></a><img vspace=3 hspace=-2 width=6 height=125 src="../../icons/abstand.gif"><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>Thanks to special "dry basement waterproofing" techniques, groundwater is hardly affected by the work.

Unsere Kollegen von der Bauabteilung haben kreative Arbeit geleistet", sagt Gerhard Winter. Der Umweltschutzbeauftragte des Mercedes-Benz-Werkes in Untert&uuml;rkheim deutet auf die geschwungenen Hallen-d&auml;cher, die auf breiten Fensterfronten sitzen. Das Geb&auml;ude wirkt leicht, fast beschwingt in der H&uuml;lle aus Glas, Stahl und Stein. "Ein Drittel der Dachfl&auml;che soll begr&uuml;nt werden." Winters Worte mischen sich mit dem Geratter der S-Bahn, die in einigem Abstand von der Baustelle des Motorenwerks in Bad Cannstatt vorbeif&auml;hrt.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>V6- und V8-Motoren<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>Im Innern der rund einen halben Kilometer langen und 120 Meter breiten Halle, in der gerade die Maschinen aufgestellt werden, dr&ouml;hnen Hammerschl&auml;ge. Kreischende Bohrger&auml;usche machen es manchmal schwer, das Gesagte zu verstehen, zumal der promovierte Chemiker kein Freund lauter Worte ist. Doch Winters Begeisterung &uuml;ber das neue, helle, sch&ouml;ne "Center", in dem ab Oktober V6- und V8-Motoren f&uuml;r PKWs und Gel&auml;ndewagen vom Band laufen sollen, ist auch so sp&uuml;rbar.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110> <B>Integrierter<br>Umweltschutz<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>Die "Fabrik der Zukunft", so der Mercedes-Slogan, soll dann aber beileibe nicht nur architektonisch gl&auml;nzen. Ein weiteres Highlight verspricht der "integrierte Umweltschutz" zu werden, der von Anfang an beim Neubau mitgestaltet werden konnte - ein neues Gef&uuml;hl f&uuml;r das Planungsteam, die &ouml;kologischen Bed&uuml;rfnisse von vornherein ber&uuml;cksichtigen zu k&ouml;nnen.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Schlanke Fabrik<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>In Bad Cannstatt soll eine "schlanke Fabrik" entstehen, in der selbstverantwortliches Arbeiten in der Gruppe, kosteng&uuml;nstige Fertigung und &ouml;kologische Vernunft Hand in Hand gehen. "Logistisch ist alles in einer Linie", erkl&auml;rt Winter. Der "Rohling" wandert eine Stra&szlig;e hintereinandergeschalteter Maschinen entlang und kommt am Ende der Montagelinie als fertiger Motor heraus. Die fein aufeinander abgestimmten Bearbeitungsschritte schonen auch Ressourcen, da sie weniger Energie ben&ouml;tigen und weniger Abf&auml;lle erzeugen.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Planung im Team<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>Gleich nachdem vor drei Jahren der Bau des neuen Motorenwerks in Bad Cannstatt beschlossen war, fing ein Team aus Planung, Produktion und Umweltschutz an, sich den Kopf &uuml;ber Umweltaspekte beim Gestalten des Werkes zu zerbrechen. "Der Terminplan war sehr eng", erinnert sich Winter an den gestalterischen Dauerlauf seit Juni 1993. Damals erhielt der Standort in dem Stuttgarter Stadtteil, in dem vor &uuml;ber 100 Jahren Gottlieb Daimler und Wilhelm Maybach den ersten schnellaufenden Verbrennungsmotor konstruierten, den Vorzug vor der Konkurrenz in Lothringen.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Im Einzugs-<br>bereich von Mineralquellen<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>Vor dem eigentlichen Baubeginn mu&szlig;ten allerdings erst S&uuml;nden der Vergangenheit beseitigt werden. Denn das im Einzugsbereich sch&uuml;tzenswerter Mineralquellen gelegene Gel&auml;nde - ehemals Standort eines Ausbesserungswerkes der Bundesbahn - war mit Schadstoffen durchtr&auml;nkt. Statt dem neuen Mercedes-Werk ein St&uuml;ck "gr&uuml;ne Wiese" zu opfern, wurde so ein Altstandort saniert. F&uuml;r die Natur bleibt unter dem Strich ein dickes Plus.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Erhebender Bauschutt<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>Zum Schutz der Mineralquellen dachte sich die Bauabteilung dann einen besonderen Trick aus: Der verwendbare Teil des beim Geb&auml;udeabriss anfallenden Bauschutts sowie das f&uuml;r Stuttgarter U-Bahn-Sch&auml;chte ausgehobene Erdreich war genug, um das Gel&auml;nde des Motorenwerks um eineinhalb Meter aufzuf&uuml;llen. Durch diese "Erhebung" kann das Abwasser ohne Hilfe von Pumpen abflie&szlig;en. Ein weiterer Vorteil ist, da&szlig; die Versorgungskan&auml;le ohne Eingriffe ins Grundwasser gebaut werden konnten.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Dichte Wanne<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>Das Bauteam schaffte es au&szlig;erdem, die Produktionshalle so gr&uuml;ndlich abzudichten, da&szlig; keine Fl&uuml;ssigkeiten austreten k&ouml;nnen. Das Fassungsverm&ouml;gen von rund 3000 Kubikmetern reicht auch aus, eventuell anfallendes L&ouml;schwasser zur&uuml;ckzuhalten. Der f&uuml;r die "dichte Wanne" - so Winter - verwendete Spezialbeton bietet erdreichverseuchenden und wassergef&auml;hrdenden Stoffen keinen Durchla&szlig;, was auch die Tests des Materialpr&uuml;fungsamtes best&auml;tigten. Der porenarme Werkstoff wurde unter fachlicher Aufsicht schichtweise eingebaut.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Rinnen f&uuml;r<br>alle F&auml;lle<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>Ob der Boden wirklich dicht h&auml;lt, wird jedoch im sp&auml;teren Betrieb wohl nie eine Rolle spielen. Denn Chemikalien, &Ouml;le und Schmierstoffe k&ouml;nnen eigentlich gar nicht aus den gekapselten Maschinen austreten. Und passiert es doch, gelangen die Fl&uuml;ssigkeiten auf dem mit zwei Grad leicht "gebuckelten" Hallenboden zwangsl&auml;ufig in Auffangrinnen.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Spezielle Kreis-<br>laufsysteme<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>Um die Sicherheit noch zu erh&ouml;hen, wird die Menge an problematischen Fl&uuml;ssigkeiten von vornherein klein gehalten. So kommen als K&uuml;hlschmierstoffe nur Mineral&ouml;le zum Einsatz, die fast ohne umweltrelevante Zusatzstoffe auskommen und keine schwer abbaubaren aromatischen Kohlenwasserstoffe enthalten. Auch ist der Ozonkiller FCKW aus den K&auml;lteanlagen ebenso verbannt wie die Chlorkohlenwasserstoffe aus den Waschanlagen f&uuml;r &ouml;lverschmutzte Werkst&uuml;cke. Doch auch die alternativen w&auml;ssrigen Verfahren haben Nachteile, sobald gro&szlig;e Mengen verschmutzten Abwassers anfallen. Deshalb wurden spezielle Kreislaufsysteme entwickelt, in denen die K&uuml;hlschmierstoffe rund zwei Jahre halten, das Waschwasser etwa sechs Monate. Auf Privathaushalte &uuml;bertragen bedeutet dies, da&szlig; ein kleiner Zehn-Liter-Eimer ausreichen w&uuml;rde, um das im ganzen Jahr bei einem t&auml;glichen Duschbad mit jeweils 100 Liter Verbrauch anfallende Abwasser aufzufangen. Die Mercedes-&Ouml;kologen m&ouml;chten auch den Anteil an aufwendig gereinigtem Trinkwasser m&ouml;glichst gering halten.

Hinter dem K&uuml;rzel, das f&uuml;r Natural Gas Technology steht, verbirgt sich ein neuartiges Einblassystem f&uuml;r Erdgas, das der Benzineinspritzung entspricht. Bislang wurde bei Gasfahrzeugen die kontinuierliche Einspritzung verwendet, die dem Vergaserprinzip bei Benzinmotoren vergleichbar ist. Die Software des Benzin PMS-Motorsteuerger&auml;tes wurde auf die speziellen Anforderungen eines Gasmotors angepa&szlig;t. Diese Technik ist nicht nur einfacher, sie beschert dem ohnehin schadstoffarmen Gasantrieb noch weiter reduzierte Abgaswerte: Sie ist derzeit die "Antriebstechnik mit den niedrigsten Schadstoff-Aussto&szlig; auf Basis fossiler Brennstoffe", sagt Rolf Bartke, Leiter der Transport-Sparte bei Mercedes-Benz. <p>Trotz seiner hervorragenden Werte ist der NGT-Sprinter beinahe so leistungsstark wie ein vergleichbarer Benziner. Die Gr&ouml;&szlig;e der Druckgasbeh&auml;lter, die unterflur (130 Liter) oder im Laderaum (160 Liter) untergebracht sind, bestimmt dabei die Reichweite: Bei 160 Litern betr&auml;gt sie 250 bis 300 Kilometer. Die NGT-Sprinter kommen pro Liter Gas also doppelt so weit wie bisherige Erdgas-Fahrzeuge.</table><p><br><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="27_1_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>English</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../envir_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Umwelt</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../ub96_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Umweltbericht '96</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../projek_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Schlaglichter</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="27_2_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Weiter</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Suche</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Hilfe</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 06.08.1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Our colleagues from the building department have done a first-class job." The building gives a strong impression of lightness and cheerfulness in its envelope of glass, steel, and stone. "Greenery will cover about a third of the roof areas," says Winter, above the rattle of a light railway train as it passes close to the site where the Bad Cannstatt engine plant is under construction.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>V6 und V8 engines<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>Inside the huge hall, which measures almost half a kilometer in length and 120 meters in width, machines are being assembled in position. The thunder of a hundred hammers mixed together with the whine of drills makes conversation difficult-particularly, since Dr. Winter is soft-spoken by nature. But despite the bedlam the chemistry specialist's enthusiasm for the new center, which should be mass producing V6 and V8 engines for cars and off-road vehicles by October, is clear to see.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110> <B>Integrated<br>environmental protection<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>And Mercedes is proud of more than just the aesthetic appearance of its "Factory of the Future." In particular, "integrated environmental protection" has enjoyed a high priority right from the start-something of a novelty for the planning team.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Lean plant<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>When finished, as well as being a "lean" operation, the Bad Cannstatt factory will be a place where responsible group work, low-cost production, and ecological sense go hand in hand. "Logistically seen, everything is in a line," explains Winter. The "raw product" passes through a series of interconnected machines and emerges from the assembly line as a finished engine. With each step in the process coordinated, resources can be used responsibly: less energy is required and less waste produced.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Team work<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>Immediately following the decision to build the new engine plant in Bad Cannstatt, a team representing planning, production, and environmental aspects was put together to come up with ways of ensuring environmental considerations would be appropriately integrated into the factory design. That was three years ago, shortly after the Bad Cannstatt area of Stuttgart had successfully fought off competition from Lothringen. And Bad Cannstatt has excellent credentials-it is the place where Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach constructed the first fast-running combustion engine more than a century ago. Reflecting on the pace of developments over the last three years, Winter is quick to point out how "tight" the schedule has been.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Within the<br>catchment area<br>of mineral springs<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>The decision to use a contaminated site rather than a green-field one was clearly good news for the environment. However, it was first necessary to atone for the sins of the past: the site-a former German Railways repair yard located in a mineral springs catchment area-was saturated with pollutants.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Getting a lift<br>from building rubble<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>To protect the mineral springs, the building department had an ingenious trick up its sleeve. Utilizing reusable demolition rubble plus earth removed in tunnel construction for the Stuttgart subway, it was possible to raise the plant by one and a half meters. As a result, waste water simply flows away; pumping systems are unnecessary. Moreover, it was possible to construct the supply channels without interfering with the groundwater.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Sealed tub<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>The building team also managed to seal the production hall so thoroughly that it is impossible for liquids to escape. The roughly 3000-cubic-meter water catchment capacity is also sufficient to retain any water which may one day be used in a fire-fighting operation. The special concrete used for what Winter jokingly refers to as the "sealed tub" is impermeable to materials which are hazardous to soil or water because it is devoid of cracks and fractures-a fact confirmed in tests conducted by the Materials Testing Authority. The low-porosity material was integrated in layers under the watchful eye of experts. In fact, given that chemicals, oils, or lubricants cannot escape from the encapsulated machines, the sealed floor is really the reserve line of defense. <p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Gutters for all<br>eventualities<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>However, should such an event somehow occur, the liquids would be forced to flow from the hall floor, which is slightly inclined at two degrees, into catchment channels.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Special cycle system<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>For reasons of environmental protection and work safety, the mineral oils used exclusively as cooling lubricants at Mercedes are almost completely devoid of environmentally-harmful additives and contain no aromatic hydrocarbons, which do not degrade easily. CFCs, the cause of the ozone hole, have been banished from the refrigerating plant. Chlorinated hydrocarbons, a danger to both man and environment, have long since disappeared from the washing plant for oil-smeared workpieces. However, the alternative water-based processes are not without their disadvantages as soon as large volumes of polluted waste-water are produced. Used in special recycling systems, the cooling lubricants last for around two years; the wash-water for about six months. To gain a better insight into what this means, it is useful to consider a parallel domestic situation in which a ten-liter bucket would be sufficient to catch the waste water accumulating over an entire year from a daily shower using 100 liters of water. Yet, the Mercedes ecologists are interested in more than just reducing the overall quantity of water used. Given the cost and effort necessary for its purification, they also want to minimize the proportion of drinking-quality water used. "We now obtain about two-thirds of our water from the Neckar river or from springs," says Winter.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Utilizing<br>district heating<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>While this approach is good news for the company's finances, the decision to utilize district heating at Bad Cannstatt and Untert&uuml;rkheim is by no means the most economical solution: For example, block-type thermal power plants would be less expensive. From an ecological point of view, however, it is better to use the energy provided by the utilities for combined heat and power purposes.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Europe`s largest<br>photovoltaic installation<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>Moreover, a further 435 kilowatts of energy comes from the roof, where Europe's largest building-based arrangement of photovoltaic cells is busy converting solar energy into electricity. Although uneconomical to operate, this 5000-square-meter solar energy "generator" is providing us with valuable experience of solar electricity generation.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>59 percent heat<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>By extracting the heat from the spent air flowing from the halls and-for the first time ever-from cooling lubricants, heat exchangers are also doing their bit to cut energy bills. The heat removed in this way is subsequently used to preheat fresh air. And the savings are impressive: 59 percent of the entire energy is being retrieved thanks to the optimization of heat circulating systems.<p><TD WIDTH=20><tr><td><br></table><p><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="24_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../envir_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environment</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../ub96_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environmental Report '96</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../projek_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Projects</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="27_1_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 08/06/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Only the letters NGT emblazoned upon the gleaming coachwork of the vehicles hint at their secret-Natural Gas Technology. Behind the abbreviation is a new injection system for natural gas engines, which is comparable to a gasoline injection system. Until now, gas-driven vehicles have always used continuous injection-similar to the carburetor principle in a gasoline engine. The gasoline PMS engine control system software has now been adapted to the special requirements of a gas engine. Not only is the technology simpler, it also extorts even lower emission values from the already low-emission gas drive. In the words of Rolf Bartke, head of the Transport department at Mercedes-Benz, it is "the fossil-fuel-based drive technology with the lowest pollutant emissions." <p>Moreover, despite its low emissions, the NGT Sprinter is almost as powerful as a comparable gasoline-powered vehicle. The pressurized gas container can either be fitted under the floor (130-liter version) or in the load bay (160-liter version). The range depends on the capacity of the gas container-some 250 to 300 kilometers in the case of the 160 liter-and, on a liter for liter basis, is double that of previous gas-powered vehicles.</table><p><br><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="27_1_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../envir_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environment</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../ub96_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environmental Report '96</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../projek_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Projects</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="27_2_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 08/06/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Vor wenigen Monaten haben Daimler-Benz-Forscher auf der Suche nach einer Alternative einen Durchbruch erzielt: Im DASA-Werk Augsburg stellten sie erstmals ein Flugzeugbauteil "trocken" her. Zumindest so gut wie trocken: Statt 3000 Liter eines K&uuml;hlschmiermittels ben&ouml;tigten sie pro Stunde nur 20 Tausendstel Liter (ml) eines Spezial&ouml;ls.

Da die Sp&auml;ne bei diesem Verfahren nicht mehr in einer Suppe aus Sp&uuml;lfl&uuml;ssigkeit schwimmen, sondern an jedem Span nur 0,01 Milliardstel Liter (nl) haften, und sie damit so gut wie trocken sind, k&ouml;nnen sie ohne weitere Reinigung metallurgisch recycelt werden. Mit dem Super&ouml;l alleine ist es allerdings nicht getan: Anders geformte Werkzeuge, Beschichtungen mit Diamant oder anderen ultraharten, w&auml;rmeleitenden Stoffen und eine Absauganlage f&uuml;r die Sp&auml;ne schaffen die n&ouml;tigen Rahmenbedingungen. </table><p><br><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="27_5_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>English</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../envir_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Umwelt</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../ub96_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Umweltbericht '96</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../projek_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Projekte</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="28_1_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Weiter</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Suche</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Hilfe</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 06.08.1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Durch seine Kompressibilit&auml;t wirkt der Kraftstoff wie ein Druckspeicher. Die Pumpe pre&szlig;t den Treibstoff mit einem Druck bis zu 1350 bar in die gemeinsame Leitung, die sich &uuml;ber einzelne Leitungen zu den Einspritzd&uuml;sen aufzweigt.<p>Der Druck auf der gemeinsamen Leitung kann zu jeder Drehzahl und Last frei geregelt werden. Sensoren messen die Drehzahl an der Nocken- und Kurbelwelle sowie den Druck an der Rail und schicken die Me&szlig;daten an das Steuerger&auml;t. Ein Druckregelventil stellt den Druck in der Rail pr&auml;zise ein. Den optimalen Zusammenhang zwischen Drehzahl, Last und Druck haben die Motorenentwickler in aufwendigen Versuchen getestet und dem Steuerger&auml;t einprogrammiert.<p>Das eigentliche Herzst&uuml;ck des gesamten Systems ist ein Magnetventil in jeder Einspritzd&uuml;se, das in Bruchteilen einer Millisekunde die D&uuml;se &ouml;ffnet und schlie&szlig;t. So kann Spritzbeginn und Einspritzmenge selbst bei hohen Dr&uuml;cken extrem genau gesteuert werden. Die Vorteile gegen&uuml;ber den herk&ouml;mmlichen Einspritzsystemen: Ein hoher Einspritzdruck kann auch bei niedrigen Drehzahlen erreicht werden und ist nicht erst bei hohen Drehzahlen verf&uuml;gbar. Durch die kurze Schaltzeit des Magnetventils ist eine "Piloteinspritzung" m&ouml;glich; das hei&szlig;t: Knapp vor der Haupteinspritzung &ouml;ffnet die D&uuml;se kurz und dr&uuml;ckt einen tr&ouml;pfchengro&szlig;en Spritzer Kraftstoff in den Brennraum. Dadurch startet die folgende Haupteinspritzung weicher und d&auml;mpft das Ger&auml;usch des verbrauchsg&uuml;nstigen Direkteinspritzers auf das Niveau eines Vorkammermotors. Au&szlig;erdem ist der Temperaturanstieg bei der Verbrennung nicht so hoch. Das wiederum bedeutet weniger umweltsch&auml;dliche Stickoxide.<p>Karl Heinz Hoffmann, Projektleiter Common Rail bei Mercedes-Benz, bringt die Vorteile auf den Punkt: "Je gr&ouml;&szlig;er der Einspritzdruck, desto kleiner sind die Einspritztr&ouml;pfchen, um so besser verbrennt das aufbereitete Kraftstoff-  Gemisch." </table><p><br><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="28_1_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>English</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../envir_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Umwelt</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../ub96_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Umweltbericht '96</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../projek_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Projekte</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="28_2_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Weiter</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Suche</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Hilfe</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 06.08.1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Liters of a special cooling fluid are required to cool component, tool, and machine-and to rinse the swarf away. Of course, getting rid of the heat and swarf brings other troubles in their stead. The cooling lubricants themselves represent a danger to the environment and contaminate both component and workplace. Vaporized lubricant precipitates everywhere in the production hall, attacking rubber seals, paintwork, and-most importantly-the health of the employees themselves. Thanks to a breakthrough made by Daimler-Benz researchers, however, an answer could now be at hand. For the first time, aircraft components are being manufactured using an effectively "dry" process in Dasa's Augsburg plant. Instead of the usual 3000 liters of conventional cooling lubricant, the components now require just 20 thousandths of a liter (ml) per hour. And it is not simply a question of the volume-the new process uses a special oil called FD 1-30 which is completely non-toxic. So much so, in fact, that it could even be eaten. The swarf produced by this process no longer swims in a brew of rinsing fluid, but is effectively dry, with just 0.01 millionth of a liter clinging to every fragment. Metallurgical recycling of the swarf is thus possible without any further cleaning. A few other tricks are also necessary in addition to the super-oil: differently-shaped tools, diamond or other ultrahard, heat-conductive coatings, and a vacuum swarf collection system all play their part in the new process.</table><p><br><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="27_5_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../envir_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environment</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../ub96_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environmental Report '96</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../projek_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Projects</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="28_1_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 08/06/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Bremer Wissenschaftler testen Ramie als Ersatz f&uuml;r die Innenausstattungsteile des Airbus. Das im Flugzeugbau notwendige Materialkriterium der Unbrennbarkeit l&auml;&szlig;t sich wohl erf&uuml;llen. Das gr&ouml;&szlig;ere Problem f&uuml;r die Bremer Entwickler war, einen kundigen Verarbeiter der asiatischen Pflanze aufzutreiben: Ein K&auml;setuchhersteller aus der Schweiz wurde schlie&szlig;lich ihr Mann. Beinahe so gro&szlig;en Ziehkr&auml;ften wie Ramie h&auml;lt auch Flachs stand, der hierin sogar - zumindest bezogen auf sein geringes Gewicht - die Glasfaser &uuml;bertrifft.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Fasern in Kunststoff<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>Neben den Fasern gilt das Interesse der Forscher vor allem kunststoffgetr&auml;nkten Matten aus Naturstoffen. Die Mischung aus Natur und Chemie ist zwar ein Kompromi&szlig;, aber immerhin schraubt es den Anteil an Naturstoffen wieder ein St&uuml;ckchen h&ouml;her. Doch einfach umzusetzen ist der Kompromi&szlig; keineswegs: Denn Naturfasern halten keine allzu gro&szlig;e Hitze aus. "Schon" bei 230 Grad ist es mit der Belastbarkeit vorbei - im normalen Pflanzenalltag ist das irrwitzig hoch. Um die Fasern dennoch in Kunststoff zu betten, bleiben den Forschern zwei M&ouml;glichkeiten. Entweder sie verwenden einen "duromeren" Kunststoff wie Polyurethan, der sich schon bei niedrigen Temperaturen verarbeiten, aber bez&uuml;glich Festigkeit zu w&uuml;nschen &uuml;brig l&auml;&szlig;t. Oder sie nehmen einen thermoplastischen Kunststoff wie Polypropylen, dessen klassischer Verarbeitungsweg sich jedoch verbietet.

What's more, the injection timing depended on the cam setting. <p>The common-rail system handles the job rather differently. It makes use of a single high-pressure pump, which provides a constant high pressure for all cylinders. The real trick, however, is to be found in the common fuel line-the common rail-where around 30 cubic centimeters of fuel are compressed at a pressure of up to 1350 bar. The individual cylinders are then served by lines branching to the injection nozzles.<p>The pressure in the common rail can be adjusted to any engine speed and load. Sensors measure camshaft and crankshaft speeds, as well as the pressure in the rail, and then pass on this data to the control unit. Finally, a pressure control valve sets the precise pressure in the rail. The optimal relationship between engine speed, load, and pressure has been determined and programmed into the control unit by the engine developers in the course of comprehensive experimental engine studies.<p>At the heart of the system are the injection nozzles. Here, a magnetic valve, which can open and close the nozzle in fractions of a millisecond, allows extremely precise control of both the quantity to be injected and when the process should begin-even at the high pressures used. Unlike conventional injection systems, which require a high r.p.m. to achieve high injection pressures, the common rail manages such a feat at low revolutions. The fast closing time of the magnetic valves also allows a pilot-injection process, whereby the nozzle opens briefly and a minute quantity of fuel-smaller than a pinhead in volume-is injected into the combustion chamber immediately before the main fuel injection. This technique results in a softer start to the main injection and reduces the noise level of a direct-injection engine to that of a prechamber engine. It also limits the temperature rise during combustion, thereby reducing the amount of polluting nitrogen oxides produced.<p>Karl-Heinz Hoffmann, Common Rail Project Director at Mercedes-Benz is enthusiastic about the consequences: "High injection pressure means small injected droplets of fuel which, in turn, results in better combustion of the fuel-air mixture."</table><p><br><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="28_1_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../envir_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environment</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../ub96_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environmental Report '96</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../projek_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Projects</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="28_2_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 08/06/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Heute allerdings besinnen sich Ingenieure wieder auf die Vorbilder der Natur.<tr><td><br></TABLE><p><table><tr><td valign=top align=left width=380><a href="../pics/29_1.jpg"><img align=left vspace=3 hspace=-2 width=100 height=125 border=0 src="../pics/29_1.gif"></a><img align=left vspace=3 hspace=-2 width=6 height=125 src="../../icons/abstand.gif">Wissenschaftler der Daimler-Benz Aerospace Airbus in Bremen beispielsweise geben das Konzept der starren Fl&uuml;gel zum Teil wieder auf, um Flugzeuge noch windschl&uuml;pfriger und damit sparsamer zu machen: Sie statten die Tragfl&auml;chen mit einer variablen W&ouml;lbung aus. Wie bei einem Vogelfl&uuml;gel pa&szlig;t sich dieser sogenannte adaptive Fl&uuml;gel nicht nur bei Start und Landung, sondern auch im Reiseflug st&auml;ndig den Druck- und Str&ouml;mungsverh&auml;ltnissen an. Dutzende kleiner Sensoren ermitteln Daten, mit denen ein Computer die optimale Stellung der Fl&uuml;gelklappen ermittelt, sie mit Geschwindigkeit, Flugh&ouml;he und Gewicht verrechnet und die resultierende Stellung an die Klappenmotoren &uuml;bermittelt.Mit diesem und anderen Konzepten wollen die Wissenschaftler den Treibstoffverbrauch bei k&uuml;nftigen Airbus-Flugzeugen um rund 15 Prozent senken - eine enorme Menge, ist doch seit der Zeit vor dem Airbus-Erstmodell A 300 von 1972 der Treibstoffverbrauch bereits um die H&auml;lfte gesunken. Das "Reduktion aerodynamischer Widerstand" oder kurz "RaWid" genannte Projekt, das Daimler-Benz und die Bundesregierung mit je knapp 20 Millionen Mark finanzieren, lief im vergangenen Jahr an.Projektleiter Dr. Joseph Mertens glaubt, die angepeilte Einsparung sogar noch &uuml;bertreffen zu k&ouml;nnen: "Wenn wir 15 Prozent des Widerstands durch neue Technologien einsparen k&ouml;nnen, dann summieren sich die umweltrelevanten Wirkungen nach dem Schneeballprinzip." Ein Beispiel: Geringerer Widerstand bedeutet weniger Treibstoffverbrauch, der reduziert die ben&ouml;tigte Kerosin-Zuladung, was wiederum Sprit spart. Mertens folgert daraus, "da&szlig; man realistischerweise mit rund 25 Prozent weniger Treibstoffverbrauch pro Passagierkilometer rechnen kann."Auf lange Sicht ist auch das noch nicht das letzte Wort. Bis 2015 k&ouml;nnte der Widerstand sogar um 36 Prozent reduziert werden. Der L&ouml;wenanteil soll dann die Laminartechnologie an Fl&uuml;geln, Leitwerk, Gondel und Rumpf bringen. Hierbei denken die Experten zum Beispiel an selbstreinigende Tragfl&auml;chen, da schon kleinste Schmutzpartikel die Gl&auml;tte der Oberfl&auml;che beeintr&auml;chtigen und Wirbel erzeugen k&ouml;nnen.Neben den anpassungsf&auml;higen Fl&uuml;gelklappen sollen bewegliche Konturbeulen auf den Tragfl&auml;chen den adaptiven Fl&uuml;gel perfektionieren.

"Our next project is to replace traditional glass fiber with natural fiber reinforcement." No small undertaking, indeed: with its immense resistance to tearing, glass fiber has long proved practically irreplaceable in automobile construction.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Better and cheaper <br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>Further problems dog the rapid extension of natural products to other areas of automobile manufacture. Not only are natural materials usually temperature-sensitive, they tend to retain water and often exhibit extreme variation in quality.<p>Finally, automobile industry specifications are extremely stringent: "The ecological car still has to satisfy standard criteria with regard to safety, reliability, comfort, and performance," emphasizes Dr. J&uuml;rgen G&uuml;nter from the Mercedes-Benz plant in Sindelfingen. His Brazilian colleague Ferdinand Panik agrees: "We can't get carried away with ecological wish fulfillment. Any natural material must be cheaper and, if possible, better than the material it is replacing."<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110> <B>Great advantages<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>However, the 2000 natural materials from which man has extracted, spun, and woven fibers also have qualities which make them attractive for the engineer. And this is true, despite high-technology competition from steel and plastics. Natural materials not only represent a potential new source of income for farmers, they are also good humidity regulators, insulate against heat and noise, and are renewable. Both biodegradable and usually comparatively cheap, they rarely present a health risk, and although normally light they are extremely strong for their weight.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Ramie takes off<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>Ramie-a 2.5-meter high Chinese relation of the common stinging nettle and more correctly known as Boehmeria nivea-yields fibers which are practically as tearproof as those made from glass. Developers in Bremen are currently testing ramie as a possible replacement to be used for the interior fittings of the Airbus. The fiber already satisfies one vital requirement for aircraft construction-it is fireproof. Happily, the problem of finding someone expert enough to process the material was also solved when the Bremen team managed to locate a cheesecloth manufacturer in Switzerland. Flax, too, is not only able to withstand almost the same tensile force as ramie, but even out-performs glass fiber on a weight-for-weight basis.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Fiber in plastic<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>Research interest is also focused on plastic-impregnated matting made from natural materials. Although this mixture of nature and chemistry represents a compromise, anything which increases the proportion of the former is welcome. However, this is by no means as straightforward as one might think. For one thing, natural fibers are not particularly resistant to heat and at about 230&#176;-extremely hot for your average plant-the game is generally up. Just two options are therefore left when it comes to embedding the fibers in plastic: either to use a "thermosetting" plastic such as polyurethane which can be processed at low temperatures but is not as strong as one might wish; or to take a thermoplastic polymer such as polypropylene and circumvent the classical processing procedures it normally requires. Here, an extrusion compression molding technique developed by Daimler-Benz researchers at Ulm has contributed to taking some of the heat out of the process, though it still requires further optimization.<p><tr><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=110><B>Fiber in natural matrix<br></B><TD WIDTH=5><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=360>"The dream ecological partnership would be a natural fiber in a genuinely biological matrix," says Thomas F&ouml;lster from Daimler-Benz Research. Natural starch or resin would be ideal fillers which, combined with individual fibers, would allow load-bearing sheets to be molded. The fiber-reinforced natural polymer car would then be truly biodegradable. However, it will take a few more harvests yet, before cars really do "grow on trees."<p><tr><td><br></table><p><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="28_2_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../envir_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environment</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../ub96_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environmental Report '96</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../projek_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Projects</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="29_1_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 08/06/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Before long, however, the early pioneers of flight realized that a plane with flapping wings was no better than<br><TD width=20><TD ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=275 valign=top>a dead duck-it was only with the development of the rigid wing that air travel really took off. But today engineers are taking a another look at those first images from nature. <tr><td><br></TABLE><p><table><tr><td valign=top align=left width=380><a href="../pics/29_1.jpg"><img align=left vspace=3 hspace=-2 width=100 height=100 border=0 src="../pics/29_1.gif"></a><img align=left vspace=3 hspace=-2 width=6 height=100 src="../../icons/abstand.gif">In order to come up with a more streamlined and thriftier aircraft, scientists at Daimler-Benz Aerospace Airbus in Bremen have begun in part to put the rigid wing concept behind them. Once the wings are given a variable camber, they behave just like those of a bird. This so-called adaptive wing can now adjust to pressure and flow variations not only during takeoff and landing, but at any time during flight. Processing the data received from dozens of tiny sensors, a computer then calculates the optimal wing flap position, offsets this against speed, altitude, and weight, and finally transmits the resulting adjustment to the wing flap motors.With the help of adaptive wing technology plus another few tricks, scientists hope to reduce fuel consumption for future Airbus aircraft by around 15 percent-an enormous amount when one considers that consumption has already been halved since the birth of the first Airbus model, the A300, back in 1972. In line with this offensive, "RaWid"-the German acronym for a project to reduce aerodynamic drag-was launched last year. The project is being jointly financed by Daimler-Benz and the German government, with each partner providing funds in the region of DM 20 million.According to project leader Dr. Joseph Mertens, the target savings here might well even be bettered: "Once technological improvements bring about a 15 percent drop in resistance, the environmental results begin to snowball." For example, less drag means less fuel consumption, which in turn means less weight of fuel to be transported which itself results in less fuel consumption. According to Mertens, "realistic estimates suggest a drop in fuel consumption of around 25 percent per passenger kilometer."Long-term perspectives even go so far as to offer the prospect of a 36 percent reduction in drag by 2015, with the lion's share of the savings coming from the application of laminar technology to the wing, tail, nacelles, and fuselage. One of the key ideas currently being scrutinized by the experts is the introduction of self-cleaning wings. Given that even the tiniest particle of dirt can radically affect the smoothness of the wing surface, thereby causing turbulence, the advantage of such an arrangement is obvious.In addition to adjustable wing flaps, movable contouring or "bulges" on the wings should help perfect the adaptive wing. According to the designers, this controllable cambering should weaken the effect of a so-called compression wave-a sudden build up of pressure on the wing. The source of an unwanted increase in drag, this type of wave arises when the air flowing over the wing of a jet flying subsonically is accelerated to a supersonic velocity. </table><p><br><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="29_1_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../envir_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environment</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../ub96_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environmental Report '96</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../projek_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Projects</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="29_2_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 08/06/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Up to 60 percent of these air pollutants originate in vehicle exhaust and they are held responsible for our dying forests, summer smog, high ozone levels, and acid rain.<br>A catalytic converter removes around 90 percent of the nitrogen oxides produced by conventional SI engines, but does not work with diesel and lean-burn SI engines-i.e., those running on excess oxygen. Fortunately, Daimler-Benz scientists have devised an alternative solution. The fruit of two projects-"Low-Emission Diesel Motor" and "Post-Engine Purification"-the new method involves installing absorbers in the exhaust system which retain the nitrogen oxides in the exhaust gases. When the absorbers are full, the nitrogen oxides are desorbed and added to the engine intake air. Once in the combustion chamber the pollutants are reduced to harmless substances such as elemental nitrogen.Officially, the method is known as "Selective NOx Recycling with Inner-Engine Non-Catalytic NOx Reduction" or "SNR" for short. Preliminary tests with a diesel engine have been very promising. Without special optimization, nitrogen oxide emission was already down by 50 percent. An environmental success, the process also functions perfectly both at low exhaust gas temperatures and for engines which permanently run on excess oxygen. Finally, it functions without any additional reducing agent.</table><p><br><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="29_2_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../envir_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environment</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../ub96_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environmental Report '96</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../projek_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Projects</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="30_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search/I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 08/06/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Eine Optionsschuldverschreibung von nominal DM 1.000,- berechtigt zum Bezug von einer am 27. Juni 1996 zu bestimmenden Anzahl von Aktien der Daimler-Benz AG. Der Nominalzins und der Optionspreis werden ebenfalls am 27. Juni 1996 festgesetzt.   <p>Wir nutzen damit die g&uuml;nstigen Kapitalmarktbedingungen und verbreitern gleichzeitig unsere instrumentelle Basis zur Fremdkapitalaufnahme, sagte Finanzchef Dr. Manfred Gentz anl&auml;&szlig;lich der Bekanntgabe der Anleihe. <p>Daimler-Benz nimmt somit teilweise das bedingte Kapital in Anspruch, das die Hauptversammlung im Mai 1994 in H&ouml;he von insgesamt DM 300 Mill. einger&auml;umt hatte. Die bei Optionsaus&uuml;bung zu begebenden neuen Aktien werden maximalDM 45 Mill. des bedingten Kapitals beanspruchen.<p>Die Anleihe kann in zwei Stufen auf ein Volumen von bis zu DM 1,2 Mrd. aufgestockt werden, und zwar bis zum 5. Juli 1996 um DM 200 Mill. und bis zum9. August 1996 um weitere DM 250 Mill. Die f&uuml;r diese Erh&ouml;hungs-Option ben&ouml;tigten Daimler-Benz-Aktien stammen nicht aus dem bedingten Kapital des Unternehmens, sondern aus im Umlauf befindlichen Aktien, die von einem Optionsverk&auml;ufer abgegeben werden.<p>Die Besonderheit dieser Optionsanleihe besteht darin, da&szlig; der Optionsschein untrennbar mit der Teilschuldverschreibung verbunden bleibt und der Investor bei Optionsaus&uuml;bung die Wahlm&ouml;glichkeit hat, die Teilschuldverschreibung in Zahlung zu geben oder den Optionspreis in bar zu leisten und die Teilschuldverschreibung ohne Optionsschein weiter zu halten.    <p>Ein Bankenkonsortium unter der gemeinsamen F&uuml;hrung der Deutsche Morgan Grenfell und Goldman Sachs hat die Plazierung dieser Optionsschuldverschreibungen &uuml;bernommen und wird sie den Daimler-Benz-Aktion&auml;ren anbieten. Daimler-Benz-Aktion&auml;re k&ouml;nnen ihr Bezugsrecht auf diese Optionsschuldverschreibung vom 20. Juni bis zum 3. Juli aus&uuml;ben, wobei auf je 69 Aktien im Nennbetrag von je DM 50 eine Optionsschuldverschreibung bezogen werden kann. Im Falle der Erh&ouml;hung w&uuml;rden die hieraus resultierenden Optionsschuldverschreibungen ebenfalls von dem oben erw&auml;hnten Bankenkonsortium plaziert werden.      <p>Hintergrund: Die Daimler-Benz AG verf&uuml;gt &uuml;ber ein Grundkapital von DM 2,56 Mrd.. Mit &uuml;ber 51 Mill. Aktien zum Nennwert von DM 50 betr&auml;gt die Marktkapitalisierung derzeit knapp DM 43 Mrd. (Basis Schlu&szlig;kurs Ibis vom 12. Juni). Gro&szlig;aktion&auml;re sind die Deutsche Bank mit 24,4 % sowie der Staat Kuwait mit 12,9 %.</TABLE><P><BR><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="60613_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>English</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../news_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Nachrichten</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="60522_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Weiter</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Suche</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Hilfe</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 13.06.1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Mai 1996</i><br>In einem schw&auml;cheren konjunkturellen Umfeld in wichtigen M&auml;rkten hat der Daimler-Benz-Konzern in den Monaten Januar bis April 1996 seinen Umsatz um 9 % auf 32,1 Mrd. DM verbessert. &Uuml;ber diese Aufw&auml;rtsentwicklung berichtet Daimler-Benz anl&auml;&szlig;lich seiner 100. Hauptversammlung in Stuttgart.<P>Zur Steigerung des Gesch&auml;ftsvolumens trugen alle Unternehmensbereiche des Konzerns bei. In der Europ&auml;ischen Union und in den USA waren die Zuw&auml;chse mit 15 bzw. 14 % &uuml;berdurchschnittlich hoch, w&auml;hrend die Ums&auml;tze in den &uuml;brigen M&auml;rkten um 6 % zur&uuml;ckgingen. F&uuml;r das Gesamtjahr 1996 erwartet Daimler-Benz einen Umsatz, der deutlich &uuml;ber dem vergleichbaren Vorjahreswert von 97,4 Mrd. DM liegt. <P>"Angesichts dieser Umsatzentwicklung, die uns vorsichtig-optimistisch stimmt, ist es jetzt umso wichtiger, die Entscheidungen zur Verbesserung der Ertragssituation weiter konsequent umzusetzen", sagte der Vorstandsvorsitzende der Daimler-Benz AG, J&uuml;rgen E. Schrempp, anl&auml;&szlig;lich der Hauptversammlung des Unternehmens in Stuttgart: "Wir haben einen gewaltigen Kraftakt hinter uns, der Voraussetzung ist, um Daimler-Benz wieder auf die alte Ertragsst&auml;rke zu bringen. Wir haben strenge Rendite-Ma&szlig;st&auml;be angelegt. Deshalb werden wir weitere Entscheidungen treffen m&uuml;ssen, ehe wir ein Ergebnis erreichen, das wir als zufriedenstellend akzeptieren k&ouml;nnen". Die Steigerung des Unternehmenswertes werde aber nicht auf Kosten der Zukunftsf&auml;higkeit, der Investitionen oder der Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter erreicht: "Nur mit einer leistungsstarken, marktorientierten und motivierten Mannschaft k&ouml;nnen wir die Produkte herstellen, die unsere Kunden begeistern", so Schrempp.<P>Von Januar bis April 1996 konnte Mercedes-Benz trotz eines sehr labilen konjunkturellen Umfelds, vor allem in Deutschland, seinen Umsatz gegen&uuml;ber dem Vorjahr um 8% auf 24,7 Mrd. DM steigern. Mit der Einf&uuml;hrung der neuen E-Klasse, deren Absatz um 53 % auf 93.700 Fahrzeuge sprunghaft anstieg, verbesserte der Bereich Personenwagen seine Umsatzerl&ouml;se um 12 % auf 14,4 Mrd. DM. &Uuml;berdurchschnittliche Zuw&auml;chse verzeichnete der Pkw-Bereich in Deutschland und Japan. <P>Die Mercedes-Benz-Nutzfahrzeugsparte erreichte in einem extrem schwierigen Markt dank des Erfolges der neuen Transporterbaureihen Sprinter und Vito ein Wachstum der Erl&ouml;se um 4 % auf 10,2 Mrd. DM. Besonders auf dem Schwerlastwagenmarkt in Westeuropa fordert aber ein extrem harter Preis- und Konditionenwettbewerb weitere Ma&szlig;nahmen zur Steigerung von Produktivit&auml;t und Profitabilit&auml;t, um die im Daimler-Benz-Konzern definierten Renditeanspr&uuml;che zu erf&uuml;llen.<P>Die Daimler-Benz Aerospace (Dasa) konnte aufgrund der g&uuml;nstigen Gesch&auml;ftsentwicklung, insbesondere im April, mit 2,9 Mrd. DM den vergleichbaren Vorjahresumsatz um 7 % &uuml;bertreffen. Positiv zu vermerken sind h&ouml;here Auslandsums&auml;tze und der Auftragseingang in der Sparte Luftfahrt. Airbus verzeichnete von Januar bis April 1996 mit 132 Bestellungen mehr neue Flugzeug-Auftr&auml;ge als im gesamten Jahr 1995. Die verbesserte Marktsituation befreit die Dasa jedoch nicht von der Notwendigkeit, sich weiter an die internationale Wettbewerbssituation anzupassen. Die Dasa h&auml;lt daher uneingeschr&auml;nkt an ihrer "Wettbewerbsinitiative" fest, die diesen Unternehmensbereich auch bei niedrigerem Dollarkurs dauerhaft profitabel machen soll. <P>Der Unternehmensbereich Daimler-Benz InterServices (debis) kn&uuml;pfte bis April mit einem deutlichen Umsatzplus von 17 % auf 4,1 Mrd. DM an den guten Verlauf des Vorjahres an. Dank des Gesch&auml;ftsausbaus mit externen Kunden und einer energischen Internationalisierung legten in der Berichtsperiode sowohl das Systemhaus als auch die Finanzdienstleistungen um 13 % im Umsatz zu. Die Mobilfunkdienste setzten mit einem Erl&ouml;sanstieg von ann&auml;hernd 70 % ihre &uuml;beraus positive Entwicklung fort.<P>Die im Konzern verbliebenen Gesch&auml;ftsfelder der bisherigen AEG Daimler-Benz Industrie erzielten von Januar bis April 1996 einen um 23 % auf 2,2 Mrd. DM gesteigerten Umsatz.</TABLE><P><BR><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="60522_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>English</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../news_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Nachrichten</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="60426_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Weiter</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Suche</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Hilfe</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 22.05.1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

<i>Stuttgart, 26. April 1996</i><br>

Der Vorstand der Daimler-Benz AG hat beschlossen, dem gemeinsam mit ABB gegr&uuml;ndeten Bahn-<wbr>Joint-<wbr>Venture ABB Daimler-Benz Transportation (Adtranz), die Berufung von Rolf Eckrodt zum Mitglied der Adtranz-<wbr>Konzernleitung als Deputy Chief Executive Officer vorzuschlagen. Eckrodt folgt auf Axel Gattung, der dieses Amt seit Jahresanfang innehatte und zum 31. M&auml;rz ausgeschieden war.
<p>

Rolf Eckrodt, Jahrgang 1942, Diplom-Ingenieur, ist seit 1992 Vorsitzender der Gesch&auml;ftsf&uuml;hrung der Mercedes-Benz do Brasil, der gr&ouml;&szlig;ten ausl&auml;ndischen Produktionsgesellschaft im Daimler-Benz-<wbr>Konzern. Er arbeitet seit 1966 bei Daimler-Benz. Eckrodt &uuml;bernimmt sein neues Amt zum 1. August.
<p>

Nachfolger von Rolf Eckrodt bei der Mercedes-Benz do Brasil wird, wie der Vorstand der Daimler-Benz AG weiter beschlossen hat, Ben van Schaik, bis M&auml;rz 1996 Vorstandsvorsitzender des niederl&auml;ndischen Flugzeugbauers Fokker. Der 51j&auml;hrige geb&uuml;rtige Niederl&auml;nder van Schaik ist seit 1966 im LKW-Gesch&auml;ft t&auml;tig. 1974 kam er als Nutzfahrzeugverkaufsleiter zu Mercedes-Benz. Nach verschiedenen leitenden Positionen im Nutzfahrzeugvertrieb von Mercedes-Benz in den Niederlanden und Gro&szlig;britannien &uuml;bernahm er im Dezember 1992 den Vertrieb Nutzfahrzeuge Europa bei Mercedes-Benz, bevor er im M&auml;rz 1994 den Vorstandsvorsitz bei Fokker &uuml;bernahm.

Dieser kurz "&Ouml;ko-Audit-Verordnung" genannte Gesetzestext appelliert an Unternehmen, sich freiwillig an der Umweltpr&uuml;fung zu beteiligen. Bei Daimler-Benz fand der   Appell Geh&ouml;r: Unmit- telbar nach der Bekanntgabe der Verordnung formulierten Experten in den Standorten Grunds&auml;tze f&uuml;r eine Umweltpolitik, listeten alle umweltgef&auml;hrdenden Anlagen auf, bestimmten Emissionen sowie Abf&auml;lle und dokumentierten die umweltbezogene Organisation sowie die verantwortliche Aufgabenverteilung. Au&szlig;erdem entwarfen sie f&uuml;r jeden Standort ein Umweltprogramm, das den betrieblichen Umweltschutz weiterentwikkeln und bekannte M&auml;ngel beheben soll. Der Erfolg: Bis Juni 1996 bekamen bereits 10 Werke das G&uuml;tesiegel verliehen.

Da die Luft dabei nur handwarm wird, kommt der Greenbag mit unbeschichtetem Bagmaterial aus.

The text of this legislation provides companies with guidelines on how they can obtain an EU seal of approval validating the quality of their environmental management. Widely referred to as the "Eco-Audit Regulation," and uniform throughout the EU, this legal document appeals to companies to participate voluntarily in the process of environmental auditing. Daimler-Benz's response was prompt-experts from the various locations met to formulate environmental policy, to list all environmentally-threatening plants, to determine emissions and wastes, and to document the environmentally-relevant organization and division of responsibilities. An environmental program was drawn up for every location, which aims to continue developing operational environmental protection and eliminate known problems. With success: by June 1996, ten plants had already been awarded the seal of approval-and a range of others are due to be validated in the immediate future.</table><p><br><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="12_2_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../envir_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environment</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../ub96_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environmental Report '96</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../schlag_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Highlights</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="12_3_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 08/06/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Doch gerade im Winter gehen dadurch gro&szlig;e Mengen an Energie verloren. Ingenieure des Rastatter Mercedes-Benz PKW-Montagewerkes fragten sich, ob sie nicht die W&auml;rme der Abluft auf die Zuluft umleiten k&ouml;nnten. Schlie&szlig;lich installierten die Ingenieure sogenannte W&auml;rmer&auml;der in die Hallenzuluftanlage. Das 20 Zentimeter breite Rad mit 5 Metern Durchmesser hat eine feine Wabenstruktur, an der die Luft entlangstreicht, wenn sie in die Halle hinein oder aus ihr herausstr&ouml;mt. Die warme Hallenluft heizt beim hinausstr&ouml;men die Wabenstege auf. Der Trick an dem Rad ist, da&szlig; es sich langsam dreht. Dadurch wandern die angew&auml;rmten Waben allm&auml;hlich in den Bereich, den die kalte Au&szlig;enluft durchstr&ouml;mt. Die Waben geben ihre W&auml;rme an die Luft ab, die so schon vorgew&auml;rmt in die Halle kommt. Die Einsparungen entsprechen dem Energiebedarf von 600 Einfamilienh&auml;usern.</table><p><br><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="12_4_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>English</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../envir_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Umwelt</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../ub96_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Umweltbericht '96</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../schlag_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Schlaglichter</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="13_1_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Weiter</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Suche</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Hilfe</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 06.08.1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Standard supplementary restraint systems use a pyrotechnic propellant set, which produces almost pure nitrogen to inflate the airbag. The Greenbag, which was developed by the Daimler-Benz subsidiary TEMIC Bayern-Chemie in the southern German city of Aschau and has been produced in Laage near Rostock since May 1996, is not only lighter than the standard airbag, it's also technically simpler. Known in the jargon as a "hybrid gas generator," the Greenbag uses its pyrotechnic charge to open the seal of a gas bottle containing an argon-helium mixture at a pressure of 240 bar. The gas mixture which is released to inflate the bag is no hotter than body temperature, allowing the use of uncoated bag material. Once the Greenbag has been discharged, the generator can be melted down and recycled as scrap metal.</table><p><br><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="12_3_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../envir_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environment</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../ub96_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environmental Report '96</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../schlag_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Highlights</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="12_4_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 08/06/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Of course, this leads to massive energy losses, particularly in winter. Which is why engineers at the Mercedes-Benz automobile assembly plant in Rastatt asked if it would not be possible to divert the heat from the discharged air to the incoming air? The problems of large volume flows and small temperature differences were solved by the installation of so-called heat wheels in the hall ventilation system. Five meters in diameter and 20 centimeters wide, these wheels have a honeycomb structure through which the air must pass both on its way in and out of the hall. As the outgoing warm air heats the honeycomb structure, the wheel slowly rotates, thereby bringing the warm section of the wheel into the area through which the incoming cold air flows. As a result, the heat stored by the honeycomb preheats the fresh air on its way into the hall, saving energy equal to that required by 600 family houses.</table><p><br><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="12_4_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../envir_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environment</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../ub96_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environmental Report '96</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../schlag_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Highlights</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="13_1_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 08/06/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Take benzene, for example. According to the draft of the 23rd ordinance of the Federal law on protection against harmful emissions, benzene concentrations should not exceed an annual average of 15 micrograms per cubic meter (&#181;g/m3). But measuring such low concentrations is very difficult. One problem to date has been that measuring and sampling equipment must be regularly calibrated on-site to ensure that it continues to give valid results. Now, collaboration between two working groups at Daimler-Benz and an external partner has produced an answer: an ingenious calibration generator, which constantly gives off benzene and other organic pollutants of reproducible composition, means that measuring and sampling equipment can now be reliably calibrated at concentrations of between 0.1 and 50 &#181;g/m3.</table><p><br><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="13_1_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../envir_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environment</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../ub96_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environmental Report '96</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../schlag_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Highlights</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="13_2_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 08/06/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

However this is now an unlikely fate, thanks to Mercedes-Benz's policy of accepting the return of old vehicles via the service network, and recycling their components. First implemented in 1991, the system was extended two years later to include old components from the repair business. Sophisticated controls ensure that all the materials collected reach the recycling companies involved. To disassemble the old vehicles, Mercedes-Benz founded ATC GmbH in November 1995.</table><p><br><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="13_2_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../envir_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environment</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../ub96_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environmental Report '96</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../schlag_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Highlights</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="13_3_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 08/06/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Thanks to internal de-watering and de-oiling, a particularly dramatic fall in the amount of sludge from the oil separation plant was recorded. In addition, disposable filter systems were replaced with long-life materials, and other special wastes were also significantly reduced. And this trend is set to continue with a bold plan to cut waste quantities at Untert&uuml;rkheim by a factor of four over the next few years.

For TEMIC green design means much more than just a touch of greenery. Indigenous trees and shrubs, wooded copses, grassy meadows and sandy areas all help provide a valuable habitat for wildlife.

In den kommenden Jahren sollen alle Lokomotiven dieser Baureihe modernisiert werden. Nicht nur die Umwelt, auch die Fahrg&auml;ste k&ouml;nnen dann aufatmen: In Personenz&uuml;gen mit Klimaanlage und einer Luftansaugung am Wagendach hatten Passagiere in den letzten Jahren wiederholt &uuml;ber Geruchsbel&auml;stigungen durch die Motorenabgase der Lok 218 geklagt. Diese insgesamt bew&auml;hrten Lokomotiven, von denen rund 500 St&uuml;ck zwischen 1970 und 1979 mit Motoren der MTU Friedrichshafen ausgeliefert worden sind, haben inzwischen teils Laufleistungen von &uuml;ber drei Millionen Kilometern erreicht. Doch f&uuml;r eine Verj&uuml;ngungskur scheint es noch nicht zu sp&auml;t: An einem Prototyp konnte inzwischen gezeigt werden, da&szlig; die Nachr&uuml;stung der alten Lokomotiven erfolgreich funktioniert. Sie beruht vor allem auf einer verbrennungstechnischen Optimierung, die durch ein verbessertes Einspritzsystem, eine ver&auml;nderte Form des Brennraums sowie eine Konfiguration mit Abgasturbolader erreicht wurde. Die Kohlenmonoxid-Emissionen gingen um fast zwei Drittel, die Kohlenwasserstoff-Emissionen um 84 Prozent und der Ru&szlig;-Anfall sogar um 86 Prozent zur&uuml;ck. Me&szlig;fahrten im fahrplanm&auml;&szlig;igen Dienst zeigten, da&szlig; zugleich der Diesel-Verbrauch um &uuml;ber zehn Prozent gesenkt wurde.</table><p><br><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="13_6_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>English</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../envir_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Umwelt</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../ub96_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Umweltbericht '96</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../schlag_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Schlaglichter</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="14_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Weiter</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Suche</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Hilfe</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 06.08.1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Not only the environment, but the passengers too can now breathe a sigh of relief: repeated complaints about the smell of exhaust emissions from the 218-Series percolating into air-conditioned trains with their air-intakes on the car roofs should now be a thing of the past. These tried-and-tested locomotives-500 of which were delivered with engines from MTU between 1970 and 1979-have clocked up over three million kilometers of service, and still look capable of quite a few more. A prototype has already demonstrated the success of the locomotive rejuvenation procedure, which is primarily based on optimizing the combustion process. This is accomplished by means of an improved fuel injection system, modifications to the shape of the combustion chamber, and a configuration incorporating a turbocharger. The drop in exhaust emissions is impressive: carbon monoxide has been reduced by two-thirds; hydrocarbons by 84 percent; and soot by 86 percent. Test journeys conducted in the course of scheduled service have also revealed that diesel consumption of the rejuvenated locomotive has been cut by a factor of more than ten percent.</table><p><br><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="13_6_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../envir_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environment</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../ub96_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environmental Report '96</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../schlag_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Highlights</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="14_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 08/06/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Karimov und Mitgliedern seiner Regierung zu f&uuml;hren und die Umsetzung des im November letzten Jahres mit der Regierung Usbekistans unterzeichneten Memorandums zu f&ouml;rdern. Klaus Mangold, Vorstandsvorsitzender der Daimler-Benz InterServices (debis), ist zugleich im Daimler-Benz-Vorstand f&uuml;r die Regionen Mittel -/Osteuropa, Ru&szlig;land und Zentralasien verantwortlich.<p>Um die M&auml;rkte der Region Zentralasien - neben Usbekistan auch Aserbaidshan, Kasachstan, Kirgisien, Tadshikistan und Turkmenistan mit insgesamt rund 80 Millionen Menschen - besser betreuen zu k&ouml;nnen, er&ouml;ffnet Daimler-Benz am 5. Juli 1996 in Taschkent eine Vertretung. Das B&uuml;ro wird von Ulrich Fischer geleitet, einem Manager aus dem Daimler-Benz-Konzern mit langj&auml;hriger Erfahrung auf den M&auml;rkten Osteuropas und Zentralasiens.<p>Staatspr&auml;sident Karimov hat in den letzten Jahren mehrfach den Daimler-Benz-Konzern besucht und war im November letzten Jahres mit Konzernchef J&uuml;rgen E. Schrempp und debis-Chef Klaus Mangold zusammengetroffen. Jetzt sollen die Gespr&auml;che &uuml;ber die Vertiefung der Zusammenarbeit Usbekistans mit den Unternehmen des Daimler-Benz-Konzerns fortgesetzt werden. Gespr&auml;chspartner sind u.a. Ministerpr&auml;sident Sultanov sowie die Minister f&uuml;r Automobilindustrie und Luftfahrt, Parpijew und Rusmetow.<p>Themen sind die Weiterentwicklung der Zusammenarbeit mit Mercedes-Benz, die zusammen mit Usautosanoat in Choresm 400 Mercedes-Benz Lkw vom Typ 1835 montiert hat. Weiter wird die Planung und Umsetzung eines G&uuml;terterminals in Taschkent mit Dornier Consult diskutiert, die Fortf&uuml;hrung der Lieferbeziehungen im Flugzeug-Langstreckenverkehr (Airbus) sowie die Kooperation im Logistik- und Servicebereich. Debis Handel, auf Gegengesch&auml;fte z. B. mit Baumwolle und Metallen spezialisiert, hat bereits erfolgreich den Kauf von 200 Mercedes-Stadtbussen aus Deutschland organisiert. Weitere Lieferungen sind Thema der laufenden Gespr&auml;che.</TABLE><P><BR><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../news_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Nachrichten</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="60614_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Weiter</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Suche</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Hilfe</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 05.07.1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Die Einstellzahl von Auszubildenden richtet sich generell am Fachkr&auml;ftebedarf in den einzelnen Unternehmen aus. Dabei mu&szlig; bei der derzeit &uuml;blichen Ausbildungsdauer von drei bis dreieinhalb Jahren heute der Bedarf an kaufm&auml;nnischen und technischen Fachkr&auml;ften des Jahres 2000 und sp&auml;ter ber&uuml;cksichtigt werden. <p>Die &Uuml;bernahmezahlen nach Beendigung der Ausbildung liegen mit &uuml;ber 80 Prozent wiederum sehr hoch. Insgesamt befinden sich in den inl&auml;ndischen Unternehmen des Konzerns derzeit knapp 10.000 junge Menschen in der Berufsausbildung. An den weit &uuml;ber 100 Daimler-Benz-Standorten in Deutschland werden rund 60 technische und 10 kaufm&auml;nnische Ausbildungsberufe angeboten.

Juni 1996</i><br>Der Daimler-Benz-Konzern hat das Einkaufsvolumen in Berlin und Brandenburg von 1994 auf 1995 um weitere 240 Mio. DM auf 1,2 Mrd. DM gesteigert und in dieser Region 15.000 Arbeitspl&auml;tze gesichert bzw. neu geschaffen. Insgesamt wird der Daimler-Benz-Konzern aus den neuen Bundesl&auml;ndern (einschlie&szlig;lich Berlin), kumuliert von Anfang 1993 bis Ende 1996 f&uuml;r nahezu 7,6 Mrd. DM G&uuml;ter und Dienstleistungen bezogen haben. Diese die Erwartungen weit &uuml;bertreffende Zahl, die trotz eines stark ver&auml;nderten Konsolidierungskreises erreicht werden konnte, teilte Dr. Manfred Gentz, im Vorstand der Daimler-Benz AG, verantwortlich f&uuml;r Finanzen und Personal und als Konzernbeauftragter f&uuml;r die neuen Bundesl&auml;nder auch verantwortlich f&uuml;r die Einkaufsoffensive, anl&auml;&szlig;lich eines Pressegespr&auml;chs in Berlin mit.<p>Nach den Worten von Gentz haben seit 1993 rund 230 ostdeutsche Firmen das Beratungsangebot durch das von Daimler-Benz entwickelte Patenmodell genutzt. Damit und mit einer Vielzahl von unterst&uuml;tzenden Ma&szlig;nahmen sei es gelungen, das Einkaufsvolumen des Daimler-Benz-Konzerns in den neuen Bundesl&auml;ndern von 175 Mio. DM in 1991 auf 1,4 Mrd. DM im vergangenen Jahr und rund 1,6 Mrd. im laufenden Jahr zu steigern. Hinzuzurechnen seien weitere 700 Mill. DM f&uuml;r Berlin. In Brandenburg lagen die Eink&auml;ufe der Unternehmen des Daimler-Benz-Konzerns im vergangenen Jahr bei einer halben Mrd. DM. Besondere Nachfrageimpulse gingen von den Produktionsstandorten der Adtranz in Hennigsdorf, der Nutzfahrzeuge Ludwigsfelde GmbH in Ludwigsfelde und der Mercedes-Benz AG in Marienfelde und den Aktivit&auml;ten am Potsdamer Platz aus.<p>F&uuml;r das laufende Jahr rechnet Gentz in den neuen Bundesl&auml;ndern und Berlin mit einem Einkaufsvolumen des Konzerns von rund 2,4 Mrd.

Denn nur laufende Kontrollen dokumentieren zuverl&auml;ssig den Anlagenbetrieb und bieten optimale Voraussetzungen zur Beurteilung der Umweltbelastung. Seit Ende 1995 betreiben die Mercedes-Benz-Werke Mettingen und Untert&uuml;rkheim ein Pilotme&szlig;netz, da&szlig; kontinuierlich alle relevanten Abluft- und Abwasserstellen &uuml;berwacht. Drei Jahre soll es im Dauerbetrieb auf Herz und Nieren gepr&uuml;ft werden. Rund um die Uhr werden in den beiden Werken insgesamt 58 verschiedene Parameter wie Staub, Stickoxide oder Kohlenmonoxid an 39 Abluftkaminen, zwei Abwasserabl&auml;ufen und zwei Wetterstationen gemessen. Die Me&szlig;daten werden laufend an einen Zentralrechner &uuml;bermittelt, ausgewertet und gespeichert. Falls Unregelm&auml;&szlig;igkeiten auftreten, werden die verantwortlichen Mitarbeiter automatisch per Funk alarmiert. Die st&auml;ndig erhobenen Me&szlig;werte geben ihnen eine optimale Grundlage f&uuml;r Entscheidungshilfen, damit ein vorsorglicher Schutz der Nachbarschaft stets gew&auml;hrleistet ist. Ziel des Pilotprojektes ist nicht allein die Einhaltung von Me&szlig;werten, sondern auch die Optimierung von Reinigungsanlagen der Abluft. Auf diesem Wege k&ouml;nnen beispielsweise durch Trendanalysen optimale Wartungstermine ermittelt werden.</table><p><br><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="12_1_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>English</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../envir_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Umwelt</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../ub96_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Umweltbericht '96</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../schlag_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Schlaglichter</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="12_2_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Weiter</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Suche</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Hilfe</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 06.08.1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Constant analysis is vital if harmful emissions are to be avoided and the success of protection measures confirmed. Since the end of 1995, the Mercedes-Benz plants at Mettingen and Untert&uuml;rkheim have been operating a pilot measurement network which continually monitors all of the relevant exhaust air and waste-water outlets. Initially, the network will run continuously for a three year test phase. 39 exhaust chimneys, two waste-water outlets, and two weather stations measure a total of 58 different parameters including dust, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide-24 hours a day. The results are fed continuously to a central computer, where they are evaluated and stored. In the event of an irregularity, the personnel responsible are automatically notified by radio. This constant flow of measurement data provides an ideal basis upon which decisions can be made to guarantee the protection of the surrounding environment. But the pilot project encompasses much more than merely observing the stipulated emissions regulations. It also offers a chance to optimize the exhaust air treatment facilities and to use trend analyses, for example, to determine the optimal maintenance and repair dates.</table><p><br><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="12_1_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../envir_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environment</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../ub96_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environmental Report '96</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../schlag_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Highlights</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="12_2_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 08/06/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Halbjahr 1996 einen Operating Profit von 827 Mill. DM erwirtschaftet (1. Halbjahr 1995: - 613 Mill). F&uuml;r das 2. Halbjahr 1996 erwartet das Unternehmen eine Fortsetzung des positiven Ertragstrends. Damit hat der Daimler-<wbr>Benz-<wbr>Vorstand mit einem um wesentliche Verlustbringer bereinigten und insgesamt deutlich profitableren Gesch&auml;fts-<wbr>Portfolio die nachhaltige Steigerung der Ertragskraft des Konzerns eingeleitet. Der Operating Profit, die Me&szlig;latte f&uuml;r den Erfolg der betrieblichen Aktivit&auml;ten, wurde erstmals nach amerikanischen Bilanzierungsstandards (US-GAAP) ermittelt.<p>In dem in London vorgestellten <A HREF="../../facts/facts_g.htm">Konzern-<wbr>Zwischenbericht</A> f&uuml;r Januar bis Juni 1996 beziffert Daimler-<wbr>Benz das Konzernergebnis nach US-GAAP auf 782 Mill. DM. Gegen&uuml;ber den ersten sechs Monaten des Vorjahres hat sich das Konzernergebnis damit um 2,4 Mrd. DM verbessert. Der Konzernumsatz stieg in der Berichtsperiode vergleichbar gerechnet um rund 9 % auf 49,1 Mrd. DM.<p>"Nach den harten Einschnitten zeigen sich erste Erfolge. Das von 35 auf 25 Gesch&auml;ftsfelder reduzierte Konzern-<wbr>Portfolio ist damit wesentlich profitabler. Dennoch ist die Ertragssituation insgesamt noch nicht befriedigend", sagte der Daimler-<wbr>Benz-<wbr>Vorstandsvorsitzende <A HREF="../../group/daimler/bofm/schrem_g.htm">J&uuml;rgen E. Schrempp</A> auf der Halbjahres-<wbr>Pressekonferenz in London. "Jetzt liegt die Aufgabe des Daimler-<wbr>Benz-<wbr>Vorstands darin, alle Gesch&auml;ftsfelder des Konzerns auf einen wachstumstr&auml;chtigen und langfristig profitablen Kurs zu bringen. Wir m&uuml;ssen internationale Ertragsstandards erreichen", so Schrempp.<p>Priorit&auml;t h&auml;tten nun L&ouml;sungen f&uuml;r die Gesch&auml;ftsfelder im Portfolio mit unzureichenden Ergebnissen. In den problematischen Bereichen seien bereits die Weichen f&uuml;r k&uuml;nftigen Ertrag gestellt, betonte Schrempp. "Der Vorstand wird den Konzern durch Wachstum der bestehenden Gesch&auml;ftsfelder weiterentwickeln. Neue Aktivit&auml;ten werden wir nur dann in das Portfolio aufnehmen, wenn sie gesunde Renditeaussichten bieten und in die Konzernstrategie passen", sagte der Daimler-<wbr>Benz-<wbr>Chef in London.<p><br><B>Abschlu&szlig; nach US-Bilanzierungsstandards</B><p>Daimler-<wbr>Benz hat den Zwischenbericht &uuml;ber die ersten sechs Monate des Jahres 1996 erstmals ausschlie&szlig;lich nach US-<wbr>Bilanzierungsstandards erstellt. "Den Anlegern und weltweiten Kapitalm&auml;rkten pr&auml;sentiert Daimler-<wbr>Benz damit einen transparenten Abschlu&szlig;, der internationalen Ma&szlig;st&auml;ben entspricht und einen direkten Vergleich mit Unternehmen in aller Welt erm&ouml;glicht", sagte Daimler-<wbr>Benz-<wbr>Finanzvorstand <A HREF="../../group/daimler/bofm/gentz_g.htm">Dr. Manfred Gentz</A> anl&auml;&szlig;lich der Erl&auml;uterung des Zwischenberichtes in London. <p>Mit dem Operating Profit stellt Daimler-<wbr>Benz eine Kennzahl in den Mittelpunkt der externen Berichterstattung, die k&uuml;nftig auch der internen Steuerung der Konzerngesch&auml;ftsfelder dient. So errechnet sich auch die f&uuml;r alle Gesch&auml;ftsfelder als Me&szlig;latte herangezogene Kapitalrendite - gefordert ist hier eine Mindestverzinsung auf das eingesetzte Kapital von 12 % f&uuml;r jedes Gesch&auml;ftsfeld - aus dem Verh&auml;ltnis von Operating Profit zu Kapitalbindung.<p><br><B>Mercedes-Benz: Absatz- und Umsatzrekord im Pkw-Bereich</B><p>Bei Mercedes-Benz war die Gesch&auml;ftsentwicklung des ersten Halbjahres 1996 vor allem durch den positiven Trend im Personenwagen-<wbr>Gesch&auml;ft gekennzeichnet, der sich auch im Juli fortsetzte. Die ersten Erfolge aus der Produktoffensive, vor allem die mit der Einf&uuml;hrung der E-Klasse erzielten Produktivit&auml;tsfortschritte haben diesen Trend gepr&auml;gt. Gleichzeitig erzielte der Pkw-<wbr>Bereich neue Absatz- und Umsatzrekorde. Die Situation bei den Nutzfahrzeugen stellt sich differenzierter dar: W&auml;hrend das Transportergesch&auml;ft &auml;u&szlig;erst erfolgreich verlief und die nordamerikanischen Lkw-<wbr>Aktivit&auml;ten nochmals zulegten, war das europ&auml;ische Lkw-<wbr>Gesch&auml;ft vom schwachen Marktumfeld und vom Auslauf der schweren Klasse bestimmt. Daher m&uuml;ssen die eingeleiteten Programme zur Produktivit&auml;tssteigerung weiter konsequent umgesetzt werden. Zum Operating Profit trug Mercedes-<wbr>Benz im ersten Halbjahr 1,4 Mrd. DM bei (+ 3%). W&auml;hrend der ersten sechs Monate 1996 stieg der Umsatz um 6% auf 37,8 Mrd. DM.<p><br><B>Dasa: Operating Profit um 1 Mrd. DM verbessert, aber noch negativ</B><p>Bei der Daimler-Benz Aerospace (Dasa) haben die Konzentration der Gesch&auml;ftsaktivit&auml;ten und Kostensenkungsma&szlig;nahmen wie die Wettbewerbsinitiative zu einer nachhaltigen Steigerung der Ertragskraft gef&uuml;hrt. Der Operating Profit verbesserte sich um nahezu 1 Mrd. DM, wozu die g&uuml;nstigere W&auml;hrungsentwicklung ebenfalls beitrug. Dennoch ist der Operating Profit mit -0,7 Mrd. DM weiterhin deutlich negativ und eine konsequente Fortsetzung der Kostensenkungsprogramme erforderlich. Der Umsatz im ersten Halbjahr 1996 stieg, vergleichbar gerechnet um 9% auf 5,3 Mrd. DM.<p><br><B>debis steigert Operating Profit und setzt dynamisches Wachstum fort</B><p>Die Daimler-Benz InterServices (debis) konnte im ersten Halbjahr ihr Ergebnis in den Gesch&auml;ftsfeldern Systemhaus, Finanzdienstleistungen und Mobilfunkdienste verbessern und erzielte einen von 156 Mill. DM auf 212 Mill. DM deutlich gesteigerten Operating Profit. Gleichzeitig setzte die debis ihr dynamisches Wachstum fort; der Umsatz wuchs von Januar bis Juni 1996 um 21% auf 6,5 Mrd. DM.<p><br><B>Direkt gef&uuml;hrte Gesch&auml;ftsfelder</B> <p>Die direkt gef&uuml;hrten Gesch&auml;ftsfelder Bahnsysteme (Gemeinschaftsunternehmen ABB Daimler-<wbr>Benz Transportation, Adtranz), Erkennungs- und Sortiersysteme sowie Dieselantriebe trugen mit einem deutlich positiven Ergebnis zum Operating Profit bei, w&auml;hrend die Mikroelektronik den Operating Profit belastete. Ebenso verzeichneten jene AEG-<wbr>Gesellschaften, die im Abschlu&szlig; des ersten Halbjahres noch enthalten sind und bilanziell noch zu dieser Kategorie z&auml;hlen, einen negativen Operating Profit, der daher insgesamt -132 Mill.

<TABLE border=0>
<TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=380> 
<i>Stuttgart, 3. April 1996</i><br>

Vorstand und Aufsichtsrat der Daimler-Benz AG werden der Hauptversammlung am 22. Mai in Stuttgart vorschlagen, f&uuml;r das Gesch&auml;ftsjahr 1995 keine Dividende auszusch&uuml;tten. Dies hat der Aufsichtsrat in seiner heutigen Sitzung auf Vorschlag des Vorstands entschieden.
<P>

Die seit dem Sommer 1995 konsequent durchgef&uuml;hrte Bereinigung des Konzernportfolios sowie Strukturaufwendungen schlagen sich im Konzernabschlu&szlig; 1995 mit einer Belastung von insgesamt rund 5,1 Mrd. DM nieder, ein Einmal-Aufwand, mit dem sich Daimler-Benz von Verlusttr&auml;gern trennt und das Konzernprofil auf ertragreiche Gesch&auml;ftsfelder ausrichtet. Davon entfallen 3,9 Mrd. DM auf die Bereinigung der AEG-Aktivit&auml;ten sowie auf die absehbaren Folgen des Konkurses des holl&auml;ndischen Flugzeugherstellers Fokker. Weitere 1,2 Mrd. DM wurden f&uuml;r Rationalisierungsprogramme und weitere Strukturanpassungen  in die Bilanz 1995 eingestellt.
<P>

Der Daimler-Benz-Vorstand hat keinerlei Abstriche an den 1995 zu verbuchenden Vorsorgema&szlig;nahmen f&uuml;r absehbare Risiken gemacht. Dennoch liegt der Jahres-Fehlbetrag in der Konzernbilanz 1995 mit 5,7 Mrd. DM be&szlig;ser als die am 22. Januar 1996 ver&ouml;ffentlichte Sch&auml;tzung eines  Fehlbetrags von 6 Mrd. DM. Nach US-Rechnungslegung (US GAAP) betr&auml;gt der Nettoverlust 1995 ebenfalls 5,7 Mrd. DM.
<P>

Bereits im 2. Halbjahr verzeichnete Daimler-Benz trotz eines anhaltend negativen W&auml;hrungsumfelds eine deutliche Besserung des Ergebni&szlig;ses der betrieblichen T&auml;tigkeit, das f&uuml;r das Gesamtjahr 1995 einen Fehlbetrag von 1,1 (1. Halbjahr 1995: 1,2) Mrd. DM ausweist. Die Gesch&auml;ftsbereiche Mercedes-Benz und debis haben 1995 erfolgreich gewirtschaftet. Der Vorstand betonte seine Erwartung, 1996 wieder einen deutlichen Gewinn erzielen zu k&ouml;nnen. "Der Kraftakt der vergangenen Monate hat gezeigt, da&szlig; der Vorstand entschlossen Ma&szlig;nahmen ergreift, um den Daimler-Benz-<wbr>Aktion&auml;ren eine attraktive Rendite zu bieten", sagte Vorstandschef J&uuml;rgen E. Schrempp.
<P><BR>

<B>Aufsichtsrat best&auml;tigt Umtauschverh&auml;ltnis der AEG-Aktien von 7:1</B>
<P>

Weiterhin hat der Daimler-Benz-Aufsichtsrat in seiner Sitzung best&auml;tigt, da&szlig; den Aktion&auml;ren der AEG Aktiengesellschaft nach der Verschmelzung des Unternehmens ein Umtausch ihrer Aktien im Verh&auml;ltnis von 7:1 in Daimler-Benz-<wbr>Aktien angeboten wird. Wie bekannt, soll die AEG Aktiengesellschaft auf die Daimler-Benz AG verschmolzen werden.  
<P>

Dieses Umtauschverh&auml;ltnis hatten die Vorst&auml;nde von Daimler-Benz und AEG bereits am 13. M&auml;rz bekanntgegeben. Dabei war aber betont worden, da&szlig; bis zum Wirksamwerden der Verschmelzung der AEG auf Daimler-Benz die seit 1988 bestehende Umtauschofferte von 5:1 weiterhin gilt. Am 5. Juni soll die AEG-Hauptversammlung &uuml;ber die Verschmelzung entscheiden. Das Umtauschverh&auml;ltnis ist inzwischen auch von einem unabh&auml;ngigen Gutachter best&auml;tigt worden.

<i>Stuttgart, 3. April 1996</i><br>

Der Aufsichtsrat hat Dr. Eckhard Cordes (45 Jahre) mit Wirkung zum 1. Juli 1996 zum stellvertretenden Vorstandsmitglied der Daimler-Benz AG berufen. Er wird den neugeschaffenen Vorstandsbereich "Konzernentwicklung und Bahn, Mikroelektronik" leiten und damit unter anderem jene Gesellschaften f&uuml;hren, die bis dato Teil der AEG Aktiengesellschaft sind und k&uuml;nftig direkt von der Daimler-Benz AG gef&uuml;hrt werden. Cordes war bisher Direktor mit Generalvollmacht des Ressorts Konzernentwicklung von Daimler-Benz und zuvor in leitenden Positionen in Frankfurt und Brasilien t&auml;tig. 
<P>

Prof. Hartmut Weule (55 Jahre), Vorstandsmitglied der Daimler-Benz AG f&uuml;r das Ressort Forschung und Technik, scheidet auf eigenen Wunsch mit Ablauf seiner Bestellung zum Jahresende aus dem Unternehmen aus. Er kehrt an die Technische Universit&auml;t Karlsruhe zur&uuml;ck, wo er seine T&auml;tigkeit im Institut f&uuml;r Werkzeugmaschinen und Betriebstechnik wieder aufnehmen wird. Prof. Weules Beurlaubung als Hochschullehrer endet mit Ablauf des Jahres 1996. 
<P>

Weule hat sich jetzt daf&uuml;r entschieden, aus Verbundenheit zur Forschung diese Option  wahrzunehmen. Der Aufsichtsrat der Daimler-Benz AG hat daher in seiner heutigen Sitzung seinem Wunsch entsprochen, den 1996 auslaufenden Vertrag als Vorstandsmitglied der Daimler-Benz AG nicht zu verl&auml;ngern. Weule wird k&uuml;nftig dem Vorstandsvorsitzenden in Fragen der Forschung und Technik beratend zur Seite stehen. &Uuml;ber die Regelung einer Nachfolge Weules wird zur gegebenen Zeit entschieden werden.
<P>

Der hervorragende Ruf der Daimler-Benz-<wbr>Forschung weit &uuml;ber Deutschland hinaus ist wesentlich mit dem Engagement von Prof. Weule verbunden, der am 1. September 1990 die Leitung des Vorstandsressorts Forschung und Technik &uuml;bernommen hatte. In dieser Funktion ist er verantwortlich sowohl f&uuml;r die als unternehmerische Einheit betriebene Daimler-Benz-<wbr>Forschung als auch f&uuml;r die Sicherung und den Ausbau der Technologieposition der Gesch&auml;ftsfelder des Konzerns. "Herrn Prof. Weule verdanken wir die erfolgreiche Neuformierung der Daimler-Benz-Zentralforschung zur Technologie-Drehscheibe des Unternehmens", sagte Vorstandschef Schrempp.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Bilanzpressekonferenz:<br> Bericht &uuml;ber das Gesch&auml;ftsjahr 1995</B></FONT>
<P>


<TABLE border=0>
<TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=380>
<i>Stuttgart, 11. April 1996</i><br>

Das seit Mai 1995 in der neuen Zusammensetzung arbeitende Daimler-Benz-Vorstandsteam hat in den vergangenen elf Monaten das Konzernportfolio auf ertragreiche Gesch&auml;ftsfelder konzentriert. Dabei wurden in erster Linie verlusttr&auml;chtige Gesch&auml;fte bereinigt oder verkauft. Die daf&uuml;r angefallenen Kosten sowie der Aufwand f&uuml;r weitere Personal- und Sachstrukturma&szlig;nahmen im Konzern sind im Jahresabschlu&szlig; 1995 im Rahmen der bilanziellen M&ouml;glichkeiten vollst&auml;ndig ber&uuml;cksichtigt worden.
<P>

"Damit haben wir die Weichen f&uuml;r eine deutlich bessere Ertragskraft im Konzern gestellt", sagte J&uuml;rgen E. Schrempp, der Vorstandsvorsitzende von Daimler-Benz, anl&auml;&szlig;lich der Bilanz-Pressekonferenz des Unternehmens in Stuttgart. "Bevor wir aber eine im internationalen Vergleich akzeptable Rendite ausweisen k&ouml;nnen, m&uuml;ssen wir 1996 weitere gravierende Entscheidungen f&auml;llen."  
<P>

Schrempp wies darauf hin, da&szlig; sich das Portfolio des Konzerns mit 28 statt ehemals 35 Gesch&auml;ftsfelderns in erheblich strafferer und ertragreicherer Zusammensetzung pr&auml;sentiere. Der Vorstand steuert den Konzern auf Basis neu definierter, auf amerikanische Rechnungslegung aufbauende Planungsgr&ouml;&szlig;en, die nach innen wie au&szlig;en transparent sind. 
<P>

Schrempp: "Wir sind auf gutem Wege, unsere ehrgeizigen Ertragsziele zu erreichen. Dies verdanken wir der einmaligen Produktoffensive von Mercedes-Benz, dem erfolgreichen und zukunftstr&auml;chtigen Gesch&auml;ft der debis, aber auch den Ma&szlig;nahmen der Dasa zur Steigerung der Produktivit&auml;t und Verringerung der W&auml;hrungsabh&auml;ngigkeit sowie dem gelungenen Start des Bahn-Joint-Ventures Adtranz."
<P><BR>


<B>Umsatz im 1. Quartal um 7 % h&ouml;her, 1995 stagnierend</B>
<P>

Das neue Jahr hat mit einem Umsatzplus von 7 % auf 23,6 Mrd. DM in den Monaten Januar bis M&auml;rz 1996 trotz widriger konjunktureller Umst&auml;nde erfolgversprechend begonnen. Wie aus dem parallel ver&ouml;ffentlichten Zwischenbericht &uuml;ber das 1. Quartal hervorgeht, trugen zu diesem Zuwachs vor allem Mercedes-Benz 
(+1,15 Mrd. DM) und die debis (+350 Mill. DM) bei. W&auml;hrend sich die Erl&ouml;se in Deutschland um 16 % erh&ouml;hten, stiegen sie im Ausland nur leicht. 
<P>

Nach dem Ausscheiden von AEG- und Dasa-Bereichen besch&auml;ftigte der Daimler-Benz-Konzern Ende M&auml;rz 1996 weltweit 292.478 Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter.
<P>

Mercedes-Benz hatte trotz einer zur&uuml;ckhaltend bewerteten Automobilkonjunktur einen guten Start. Der Umsatz stieg in den ersten drei Monaten des Jahres um 7 % auf &uuml;ber 18 Mrd. DM an - allein in Deutschland um 15 % auf rund 7 Mrd. DM. Mit einem weltweiten Absatz von 145.400 Personenwagen wurde das gute Niveau des Vorjahres um 4 % &uuml;bertroffen; in Deutschland stieg der Marktanteil deutlich auf 8 %, was besonders auf den Erfolg der neuen E-Klasse zur&uuml;ckzuf&uuml;hren ist. Die Entwicklung im Inland wird durch die im Jahressteuergesetz verankerte Neuregelung f&uuml;r Dienst- und Gesch&auml;ftswagen beeinflu&szlig;t. Ohne die daraus resultierende Mehrbelastung f&uuml;r h&ouml;herwertige Fahrzeuge k&ouml;nnte sich der deutsche Markt in diesem Segment deutlich besser entwickeln. Im Ausland legten Japan (+50 %), die USA (+ 22 %) und Italien (+17 %) besonders stark zu. Der Nutzfahrzeugabsatz stieg von Januar bis M&auml;rz um mehr als 12 % auf 83.300 Einheiten. Besonders erfreulich war hier die Entwicklung bei Transportern. 
<P>

Die AEG Daimler-Benz Industrie erzielte mit den im Konzern verbleibenden Bereichen einen Quartalsumsatz von 1,5 Mrd. DM; Steigerungen konnten die Temic und die Postautomatisierung erzielen. Die Erl&ouml;se der Daimler-Benz Aerospace (Dasa) stiegen gegen&uuml;ber dem vergleichbaren Vorjahreswert um 6 % auf 2,2 Mrd. DM; die gr&ouml;&szlig;te Steigerung konnte der Gesch&auml;ftsbereich Antriebe verbuchen. Die Daimler-Benz InterServices (debis) erzielte einen Umsatz von 3,0 Mrd. DM (+13 %); zur Gesch&auml;ftsausweitung trugen hier vor allem das Systemhaus, die Finanzdienstleistungen und die Mobilfunkdienste bei. 
<P>

Im Gesamtjahr 1995 liegen die Erl&ouml;se im Konzern mit 103,5 Mrd. DM in etwa auf dem Vorjahresniveau. Mercedes-Benz verzeichnete im vorigen Jahr ein Plus von 2 % auf 72 Mrd. DM, die debis einen Zuwachs von 9 % auf 11,8 Mrd. DM und die AEG Daimler-Benz Industrie von 2 % auf 10,3 Mrd. DM. Die Dasa erreichte trotz Markt- und W&auml;hrungsproblemen den vergleichbaren Vorjahresumsatz von 15 Mrd. DM.
<P><BR>


<B>Deutliche Verbesserung im Ergebnis<br> der betrieblichen T&auml;tigkeit<br>
- Generalbereinigung f&uuml;hrt dennoch<br> zu hohem Jahresverlust</B>
<P>

Angesichts der Generalbereinigung durch die Straffung des Portfolios erwartet der Daimler-Benz-Vorstand in diesem Jahr im operativen Gesch&auml;ft wieder ein positives Ergebnis. Vom ersten auf das zweite Halbjahr 1995 verzeichnete der Konzern im Ergebnis der betrieblichen T&auml;tigkeit eine wesentliche Besserung: Nach -1,2 Mrd. DM Verlust im 1. Halbjahr betrug das Ergebnis der betrieblichen T&auml;tigkeit im Gesamtjahr -1,1 Mrd. DM. Darin enthalten sind Strukturaufwendungen f&uuml;r weitere Rationalisierungsprogramme (wie zum Beispiel die Dasa-Wettbewerbsinitiative) von insgesamt 1,2 Mrd. DM. 
<P>

"Alle aus heutiger Sicht erkennbaren Risiken sind im Rahmen der bilanziellen M&ouml;glichkeiten 1995 ber&uuml;cksichtigt", betonte Finanzchef Dr. Manfred Gentz. Der Jahresfehlbetrag im Konzern betr&auml;gt nach deutscher Rechnungslegung 5,7 Mrd. DM. Nach amerikanischer Rechnungslegung (US GAAP, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) verbuchte Daimler-Benz einen Nettoverlust von ebenfalls 5,7 Mrd. DM.
<P>

Der Vergleich der Jahresergebnisse 1995 gegen&uuml;ber 1994 wird durch Sonderfaktoren in beiden Jahren erschwert. 1994 beeinflu&szlig;ten Einmalertr&auml;ge von 1,4 Mrd. DM das Ergebnis positiv, wogegen 1995 keine solchen Ertr&auml;ge anfielen. Dagegen schlagen im Jahresabschlu&szlig; 1995 negativ die Bereinigung von Verlusttr&auml;gern (Fokker, AEG) mit Einmal-Aufwendungen von 3,9 Mrd. DM zu Buche. Wie bereits ver&ouml;ffentlicht, handelt es sich hier um au&szlig;erordentliche Belastungen f&uuml;r Fokker von 2,3 Mrd. DM sowie 1,6 Mrd. DM f&uuml;r die Bereinigung der AEG-Aktivit&auml;ten.
<P><br>


<B>Neues genehmigtes Kapital vorgeschlagen, aber derzeit keine Kapitalerh&ouml;hung vorgesehen</B>
<P>

Der mit der Neuausrichtung verbundene Aufwand hat die Eigenkapitalquote des Konzerns auf 15 % (Vorjahr: 21 %) reduziert. Stark gepr&auml;gt ist diese Quote vom wachsenden Gesch&auml;ft mit Leasing und Absatzfinanzierung. Ohne diese Finanzdienstleistungen weist der Daimler-Benz-Konzern eine Eigenkapitalquote von etwas &uuml;ber 20 % (nach 28 %) aus. 
<P>

Der Hauptversammlung am 22. Mai 1996 wird vorgeschlagen, ein genehmigtes Kapital in H&ouml;he von 500 Mill. DM bis 30. April 2001 zu beschlie&szlig;en, da das noch nicht genutzte genehmigte Kapital in H&ouml;he von 367 Mill. DM zum 30. Juni 1996 ausl&auml;uft. "Wir haben aber nicht vor, in diesem Jahr mit einer Kapitalerh&ouml;hung an den Markt zu gehen. Zusammen mit dem bis zum Jahr 1999 befristeten bedingten Kapital in H&ouml;he von 300 Mill. DM f&uuml;r die Ausgabe von Options- oder Wandelanleihen bis zu einem Gesamtbetrag von nominal 2 Mrd. DM verf&uuml;gen wir &uuml;ber hinreichend Spielraum, um auch mit innovativen Finanzinstrumenten an die Kapitalm&auml;rkte zu gehen", betonte Finanzchef Dr. Gentz.
<P><BR>
								

<B>Mercedes-Benz und debis positiv,<br> Dasa und AEG mit Verlusten</B> 
<P>

Mercedes-Benz profitierte von der erfolgreichen Modellpolitik und Kostensenkungsprogrammen, die negative W&auml;hrungseinfl&uuml;sse aus der Abwertung des Dollar sowie verschiedener europ&auml;ischer W&auml;hrungen kompensieren konnten. Das Ergebnis der betrieblichen T&auml;tigkeit (Beitrag zum Ergebnis der betrieblichen T&auml;tigkeit des Daimler-Benz-Konzerns) lag mit rund 2,3 Mrd. DM leicht &uuml;ber dem Vorjahresniveau. 
<P>

Die AEG Daimler-Benz Industrie verzeichnet im Ergebnis der betrieblichen T&auml;tigkeit einen Fehlbetrag von 502 Mill. DM, was einer deutlichen Verschlechterung gegen&uuml;ber dem Vorjahr (-111 Mill. DM) entspricht. Der dar&uuml;ber hinaus notwendige Aufwand von 1,6 Mrd. DM, der durch die Aufl&ouml;sung dieses Unternehmensbereichs verursacht wird, f&uuml;hrt zusammen mit dem Finanzergebnis und Steuern zu einem Nettoverlust von -2,3 Mrd. DM.
<P>

Bei der Daimler-Benz Aerospace (Dasa) schlagen sich im Ergebnis der betrieblichen T&auml;tigkeit vor allem die W&auml;hrungssituation, Strukturaufwendungen (u.a. "Wettbewerbsinitiative") und der drastische Preisverfall f&uuml;r zivile Verkehrsflugzeuge nieder. In dem Fehlbetrag von 2,7 Mrd. DM sind allein Strukturaufwendungen und Drohverlustr&uuml;ckstellungen von 1,7 Mrd. DM enthalten. Zusammen mit dem durch die absehbaren Fokker-Belastungen ber&uuml;cksichtigten Aufwand von 2,3 Mrd. DM weist die Dasa einen Jahresfehlbetrag von 4,2 Mrd. DM aus.
<P>

Die Daimler-Benz InterServices (debis) weist ein Ergebnis der betrieblichen T&auml;tigkeit von 245 Mill. DM aus. Der R&uuml;ckgang gegen&uuml;ber dem Vorjahresergebnis (375 Mill. DM) ist im wesentlichen verursacht durch die Ausgliederung des inl&auml;ndischen Leasinggesch&auml;fts im Jahr 1994, dessen Ergebnisbeitrag sich im Finanzergebnis niederschl&auml;gt, sowie durch &uuml;berwiegend w&auml;hrungsbedingte R&uuml;ckg&auml;nge in den USA und Mexiko.

<B>Deutliche Absatz- und Umsatzsteigerungen erwartet -<br>
Jahres&uuml;berschu&szlig; von 1,85 auf rund 2,3 Mrd. DM gestiegen</B>
<p>

<i>Stuttgart, 11. April 1996</i><br>

Mercedes-Benz plant durch die Produktoffensive bei Personenwagen und Nutzfahrzeugen sowie die weitere Internationalisierung des Gesch&auml;fts f&uuml;r die kommenden Jahre eine deutliche Steigerung von Absatz und Umsatz. Bis zur Jahrtausendwende wird Mercedes-Benz ein j&auml;hrliches Produktionsvolumen von &uuml;ber1 Mill. Pkw und &uuml;ber 400.000 Nutzfahrzeugen erreicht haben. Mit diesem Ausbau des Gesch&auml;ftsvolumens soll auch eine weitere deutliche Verbesserung des Ergebnisses einhergehen.
<P>

Helmut Werner, Vorstandsvorsitzender der Mercedes-Benz AG: "Die Produktoffensive im Pkw- und Nutzfahrzeugbereich wird von einer umfassenden Weiterentwicklung unserer internen Strukturen und Prozesse begleitet. Nur dadurch ist es m&ouml;glich, unsere Kostenposition in einem aggressiven Wettbewerbsumfeld nachhaltig zu verbessern und schnell auf die Ver&auml;nderungen der M&auml;rkte zu reagieren. Damit werden wir von der Kosten- wie auch von der Produktseite her die Voraussetzungen f&uuml;r die Realisierung unserer Wachstumsstrategie und einer dauerhaft positiven Ertragsentwicklung schaffen."
<P>

Mercedes-Benz setzt 1996 im Pkw-Bereich auf Wachstum durch Aussch&ouml;pfung regionaler Marktchancen, aber auch durch zus&auml;tzliche neue Modelle, wie die T-Modelle der C- und E-Klasse, die V-Klasse und den Roadster SLK. Dazu tr&auml;gt bei, da&szlig; Mercedes-Benz seit dem Modellwechsel bei der E-Klasse zur Jahresmitte 1995 sowie den 
umfangreichen Leistungserweiterungen in den &uuml;brigen Baureihen zur Zeit &uuml;ber ein sehr junges Fahrzeugprogramm verf&uuml;gt. Dieses wird in den kommenden Jahren durch neue Modelle weiter aktualisiert: ein kleines Coup, die A-Klasse und die M-Klasse. Dar&uuml;ber hinaus rollt der Smart, der in einem Joint Venture zwischen Mercedes- Benz und der schweizerischen SMH produziert wird, ab 1998 vom Band. Das Unternehmen positioniert sich damit sowohl in bestehenden als auch in neuen, wachstumsstarken M&auml;rkten und Marktsegmenten mit Mercedes-Benz-Potential als Premium-Anbieter.
<P>

Bei den Nutzfahrzeugen wird Mercedes-Benz 1996 seine im vergangenen Jahr erfolgreich begonnene Produktoffensive fortsetzen. Als Beispiele daf&uuml;r stehen der ab M&auml;rz in Europa verf&uuml;gbare Transporter "Vito" aus spanischer Produktion, der "Vario" aus Ludwigsfelde sowie die neue Schwere Klasse, die auf der IAA Nutzfahrzeuge im September in Hannover erstmals der ffentlichkeit vorgestellt wird.
<P>

Zur Erschlie&szlig;ung neuer Wachstumsm&auml;rkte, vor allem im asiatisch-pazifischen Raum, wurde mit einer Reihe von Projekten und mit speziell auf die jeweiligen Markterfordernisse zugeschnittenen Produkten in S&uuml;dkorea, Indonesien, China und Vietnam eine erste Basis geschaffen. Im lateinamerikanischen Transportermarkt wird Mercedes-Benz ab 1996 durch den Aufbau einer Produktion des "Sprinters" in Argentinien verst&auml;rkt pr&auml;sent.
<P>

Nach der Verschmelzung der AEG Aktiengesellschaft auf die Daimler-Benz AG wird der Dieselmotorenhersteller MTU Motoren und Turbinen-Union Friedrichshafen, bisher eine Gesellschaft unter dem Dach der AEG, von der Mercedes-Benz AG gef&uuml;hrt werden. Die MTU Friedrichshafen entwickelt, produziert und vertreibt - vor allem in Europa und Asien - Antriebssysteme f&uuml;r Schiffe, Schienen- und Schwerfahrzeuge sowie f&uuml;r die Energieerzeugung. Sie arbeitet eng mit dem amerikanischen Dieselmotorenhersteller Detroit Diesel Corporation (DDC) zusammen, an dem Daimler-Benz einen Anteil von 20% h&auml;lt.
<P><BR>


<B>Absatzsteigerungen und Kosteneinsparungen trugen 1995 zur Ergebnisverbesserung bei</B>
<P>

Im Jahr 1995 erzielte Mercedes-Benz ein Ergebnis aus der betrieblichen T&auml;tigkeit von 2,3 Mrd. DM (2,2 Mrd. DM in 1994). Die negativen Auswirkungen aus dem Kurseinbruch des US-Dollars und einiger europ&auml;ischer W&auml;hrungen gegen&uuml;ber der D-Mark und die Vorleistungen f&uuml;r neue Produkte wurden durch Absatzsteigerungen und Kosteneinsparungen mehr als ausgeglichen. Die Erh&ouml;hung des Jahres&uuml;berschusses um 426 Mill. DM auf 2,275 Mrd. DM ist dabei auch auf ein h&ouml;heres Finanzergebnis zur&uuml;ckzuf&uuml;hren.
<P><BR>


<B>Neue H&ouml;chstmarke beim Export von Personenwagen</B>
<P>

Bei Mercedes-Benz stand das Pkw-Gesch&auml;ft 1995 im Zeichen der neuen E-Klasse, die im Juni in Westeuropa und im Oktober in den M&auml;rkten in &Uuml;bersee eingef&uuml;hrt wurde. Aufgrund des Modellwechsels erreichte der Pkw-Absatz mit insgesamt 583.400 
Fahrzeugen der C-, E-, S- und SL-Klasse nicht ganz das Rekordniveau des Vorjahres mit 592.400 Einheiten. Nach dem kr&auml;ftigen Anstieg im Jahr 1994 sind die Neuzulassungen in Deutschland um 5 Prozent auf 236.800 Pkw zur&uuml;ckgegangen. Au&szlig;erhalb Deutschlands konnte Mercedes-Benz dagegen 345.800 Fahrzeuge absetzen (+ 1%) und damit ein neues Exportrekordvolumen in der Firmengeschichte erzielen.

Im westeurop&auml;ischen Ausland stieg der Absatz auf 154.600 Pkw (i.V. 153.300). Mit 76.800 verkauften Fahrzeugen in den USA konnte das Vorjahresniveau um 5 Prozent &uuml;bertroffen und die gute Position im oberen Marktsegment ausgebaut werden. Erfreulich war auch die Gesch&auml;ftsentwicklung in Japan. Dort legten die Neuzulassungen um 4 Prozent - und damit st&auml;rker als der Gesamtmarkt - auf 34.900 Pkw zu. Kr&auml;ftige Absatzzuw&auml;chse waren in Gro&szlig;britannien und S&uuml;dostasien sowie in der Republik S&uuml;dafrika zu verzeichnen.
<P>

Aufgrund der anhaltend gro&szlig;en Nachfrage nach Mercedes-Benz Personenwagen und der Neutypen belief sich die Produktion im Berichtsjahr auf 594.900 Fahrzeuge (i.V. 590.100).
<P><BR>


<B>Absatz von Nutzfahrzeugen auf Rekordniveau</B>
<P>

Besonders positiv hat sich 1995 das Nutzfahrzeuggesch&auml;ft von Mercedes-Benz entwickelt. Weltweit stieg der Absatz um 10 Prozent auf 320.100 Transporter, Lastwagen, Busse und Unimog - der mit Abstand h&ouml;chste Wert in der Geschichte des Unternehmens. Die Wachstumsimpulse kamen vor allem aus Nordamerika, dem westeurop&auml;ischen Ausland und aus Brasilien. In Deutschland stiegen die Neuzulassungen von Mercedes-Benz Nutzfahrzeugen um 7 % auf 84.200 Einheiten und entwickelten sich damit deutlich besser als der Gesamtmarkt.
<P>

Bei Lkw konnten vor allem durch kr&auml;ftige Zuw&auml;chse im zweiten Halbjahr die Neuzulassungen auf 63.100 Einheiten um 11 % gegen&uuml;ber 1994 gesteigert werden. Mit einem Marktanteil von 25 % (i.V. 27 %) konnte Mercedes-Benz seine f&uuml;hrende Position in Westeuropa mit gro&szlig;em Abstand behaupten, und dies, obwohl das Unternehmen als Folge von Zulieferengp&auml;ssen zu Beginn des Jahres und wechselkursbedingte Preisvorteile wichtiger Wettbewerber nicht in vollem Umfang am Marktwachstum partizipieren konnte. Im Transporterbereich von 2 bis 6 Tonnen konnte die Zahl der Erstzulassungen in Westeuropa um 10 % auf 93.400 Fahrzeuge und der Marktanteil auf 13,1 % (i.V. 12,8 %) gesteigert werden.
<P>

Zur positiven Gesch&auml;ftsentwicklung in &Uuml;bersee trug erneut die Tochtergesellschaft Freightliner bei. Sie konnte ihre Verk&auml;ufe in den USA um 19 Prozent auf 60.900 Lastwagen steigern und ihre Spitzenposition im US-Markt f&uuml;r Lkw der Klasse 8 (ab 15 t) mit einem Anteil von &uuml;ber 26 (i.V. 25) Prozent ausbauen. Auch Mercedes-Benz do Brasil konnte den Absatz deutlich erh&ouml;hen.
<P>

Der Absatz der neugegr&uuml;ndeten EvoBus GmbH mit den Marken Mercedes-Benz und Setra- die mit ihren Produktionsst&auml;tten in Mannheim, Ulm/Neu-Ulm, Ligny (Frankreich) und Istanbul (T&uuml;rkei) als "Sparte Omnibus Europa" zu den Kerngesch&auml;ftsfeldern der Mercedes-Benz AG geh&ouml;rt - lag im vergangenen Jahr bei 6.600 Fahrzeugen. Einschlie&szlig;lich der Produktions- und Montagewerke in &Uuml;bersee wurden bei Mercedes-Benz 1995 konzernweit 27.800 Busse und Busfahrgestelle (i.V. 25.800) gefertigt. Damit konnte Mercedes-Benz seine Position als weltweit f&uuml;hrender Hersteller von Omnibussen &uuml;ber 8 t behaupten. 
<P>

Insgesamt liefen im Mercedes-Benz Konzern mehr als 329.700 Nutzfahrzeuge 
(i.V. 291.900) von den B&auml;ndern. Auf die Standorte in Deutschland entfiel ein Fertigungsvolumen von 171.300 Fahrzeugen (i.V. 143.000).
<P><BR>


<B>Besch&auml;ftigung an den Standorten stabilisiert</B>
<P>

Mercedes-Benz besch&auml;ftigte zum Jahresende 1995 weltweit 197.164 Mitarbeiter 
(i. V. 197.568), davon 150.457 (i.V. 148.194) in Deutschland und 46.707 (i.V. 49.374) im Ausland. Die Ver&auml;nderungen resultieren im Inland insbesondere aus der &Uuml;bernahme der Karl K&auml;ssbohrer GmbH und im Ausland aus dem Verkauf der Gie&szlig;erei Sofunge in Brasilien sowie der Getriebefertigung in Argentinien.
<P>

Ende 1995 befanden sich 6.524 junge Menschen in einem Ausbildungsverh&auml;ltnis bei Mercedes-Benz in Deutschland; rund 1.900 Auszubildende wurde im Berichtsjahr neu eingestellt. Insgesamt 1.921 Auszubildende wurden im vergangenen Jahr in ein festes Arbeitsverh&auml;ltnis &uuml;bernommen.

<b>Vier Gesch&auml;ftsfelder werden nach der Verschmelzung<br> auf die Daimler-Benz AG im Konzern weitergef&uuml;hrt </B><p>

<i>Stuttgart/Frankfurt, 11. April 1996</i><br>

Die vier bisherigen AEG-Gesch&auml;ftsfelder Bahnsysteme, Mikroelektronik, Dieselantriebe und Postautomatisierung werden auch nach der Verschmelzung der AEG Aktiengesellschaft auf die Daimler-Benz AG im Konzern fortgef&uuml;hrt. Ihre Marktposition und Systemf&auml;higkeit soll unter der operativen F&uuml;hrung der Daimler-Benz AG bzw. der Mercedes-Benz AG (Dieselantriebe) gezielt weiter ausgebaut werden. Die Bereiche Energietechnik, Anlagen- und Automatisierungstechnik sowie weitere AEG-Gesellschaften werden im Zuge der Straffung des Konzernportfolios an wettbewerbsstarke industrielle Partner ver&auml;u&szlig;ert.
<p>

"Mit dieser Neuordnung der Gesch&auml;ftsaktivit&auml;ten entsprechen wir den zunehmenden Wettbewerbsversch&auml;rfungen, anhaltenden Struktur- und Ergebnisproblemen sowie neuen strategischen Priorit&auml;ten im Daimler-Benz-Konzern", sagte AEG-Vorstandsvorsitzender Ernst Georg St&ouml;ckl. Alle operativen Einheiten, so St&ouml;ckl weiter, best&uuml;nden fort und seien auch weiterhin am Markt t&auml;tig. Dies gelte gleicherma&szlig;en f&uuml;r die Firmen- und Markenbezeichnung AEG, die von zahlreichen Unternehmen innerhalb wie au&szlig;erhalb des Daimler-Benz-Konzerns genutzt werde.
<p>

Die noch ausstehenden strukturellen Ver&auml;nderungen sehen vor, da&szlig; die AEG Aktiengesellschaft r&uuml;ckwirkend zum 1. Januar 1996 alle wesentlichen Verm&ouml;gensgegenst&auml;nde und Verbindlichkeiten einschlie&szlig;lich der Pensionsverpflichtungen auf eine Zwischenholding in der Rechtsform einer GmbH &uuml;bertr&auml;gt. Die AEG Aktiengesellschaft selbst soll mit Beschlu&szlig; der ordentlichen Hauptversammlung vom 5. Juni 1996 auf die Daimler-Benz AG verschmolzen werden. Es wird angestrebt, die Vertr&auml;ge zum Verkauf der Energietechnik an GEC-Alsthom und zur mehrheitlichen Abgabe der Anlagen- und Automatisierungstechnik an Cegelec bis zur Jahresmitte unterschriftsreif zu verhandeln.
<p>

Als weltgr&ouml;&szlig;tes Unternehmen auf dem Gebiet der Bahntechnik hat ABB Daimler-Benz Transportation (Adtranz) zum 1. Januar 1996 die Gesch&auml;ftst&auml;tigkeit aufgenommen. Das 50:50-Joint-Venture verf&uuml;gt regional und technologisch &uuml;ber au&szlig;erordentlich starke Marktpositionen. TEMIC ist im Rahmen der Portfolio&uuml;berpr&uuml;fung als Kompetenzzentrum des Daimler-Benz-Konzerns f&uuml;r Mikroelektronik und als eigenst&auml;ndiger Anbieter anwendungsspezifischer Produkte best&auml;tigt worden. Im Gesch&auml;ftsfeld Dieselantriebe verlagert MTU Friedrichshafen die Aktivit&auml;ten zunehmend auf Antriebssysteme f&uuml;r kommerzielle Anwendungen. AEG Electrocom baut die f&uuml;hrende Weltmarktstellung in der Briefverteiltechnik konsequent aus - in Asien unter anderem gemeinsam mit Hitachi.
<p><br>


<B>Fehlbetrag 1995 von au&szlig;erordentlichem Verlust aufgrund der Umstrukturierung gepr&auml;gt</B>
<p>

Der Jahresfehlbetrag 1995 des AEG-Konzerns von ann&auml;hernd 2,3 Mrd. DM ist vor allem durch die au&szlig;erordentlichen Aufwendungen aus der Umstrukturierung gepr&auml;gt: Mehr 
als 1,5 Mrd. DM werden als au&szlig;erordentliche Belastung ausgewiesen. In diesem Betrag wurden insbesondere die Risikovorsorge f&uuml;r die vorgesehenen Ver&auml;u&szlig;erungen und die einschneidenden Ver&auml;nderungen der ausl&auml;ndischen Vertriebsorganisation und der Frankfurter AEG-Zentrale ber&uuml;cksichtigt. Ein direkter Vergleich der Ergebniszahlen zum Vorjahr wird auch dadurch erschwert, da&szlig; das Ergebnis 1994 durch Einmalertr&auml;ge in H&ouml;he von 0,4 Mrd. DM aus der Ver&auml;u&szlig;erung der Bereiche Hausger&auml;te, Z&auml;hler und Lichttechnik positiv beeinflu&szlig;t war.
<p>

Die Verschlechterung des Ergebnisses der betrieblichen T&auml;tigkeit gegen&uuml;ber dem Vorjahr resultiert vor allem aus der Gesch&auml;ftsentwicklung bei Bahnsystemen, Mikroelektronik und Energietechnik, die allesamt negativ abschlossen. Am st&auml;rksten war der Ergebnisr&uuml;ckgang bei Bahnsystemen, verursacht durch Vorsorge f&uuml;r Auftragsrisiken und  Unterauslastung der Kapazit&auml;ten.
<p>

Das Gesch&auml;ftsfeld Dieselantriebe erreichte vor allem durch Steigerung der Effizienz und weitere Internationalisierung ein wiederum positives Ergebnis. Im Gesch&auml;ftsfeld Automatisierungstechnik verlief die Ergebnisentwicklung uneinheitlich: W&auml;hrend die Industrieautomatisierung erneut einen Verlust verzeichnete, konnte die Postautomatisierung den Gewinn gegen&uuml;ber dem Vorjahr nochmals verbessern.

<b>Konsequenter Kurs zur Steigerung<br> der Wettbewerbs- und Ertragskraft -<br>
Deutliche Ergebnisverbesserung f&uuml;r 1996 erwartet</B><p>

<i>Stuttgart/M&uuml;nchen, 11. April 1996</i><br>

Die Daimler-Benz Aerospace (Dasa, M&uuml;nchen) setzt konsequent ihren Kurs der Konzentration auf Kernkompetenzen und der Steigerung der Wettbewerbs- und Ertragsf&auml;higkeit fort. Die im November 1995 beschlossene Wettbewerbsinitiative schafft entscheidende Voraussetzungen, um die Konkurrenzf&auml;higkeit der Gesch&auml;ftsfelder Luftfahrt und Luftfahrt-Antriebe auf den Weltm&auml;rkten auch bei einem Dollarkurs von 1,35 DM sicherzustellen, nachdem umfangreiche strukturelle und strategische Ma&szlig;nahmen in den Gesch&auml;ftsfeldern Raumfahrt sowie Verteidigung und Zivile Systeme bereits positiv wirken.
<p>

Dr. Manfred Bischoff, Vorstandsvorsitzender der Daimler-Benz Aerospace: "Oberstes Ziel ist f&uuml;r uns die Wiedererlangung dauerhafter Wettbewerbs- und Ertragsf&auml;higkeit. Nur mit neuen unternehmerischen Perspektiven und wirtschaftlichem Erfolg sowie der St&auml;rkung europ&auml;ischer Strukturen kann die Dasa als Deutschlands gr&ouml;&szlig;tes Unternehmen der Luft- und Raumfahrtindustrie Besch&auml;ftigung und Wachstum sichern und ihrer volkswirtschaftlichen und sicherheitspolitischen Bedeutung gerecht werden. Daf&uuml;r haben wir nun entscheidende Grundlagen geschaffen, die gemeinsam mit neuen, innovativen Produkten und Technologien sowie unserer internationalen Marktoffensive die Zukunft der Dasa langfristig gestalten werden."
<p>

Beim Airbus erfordern der weiter zunehmende Wunsch der Fluggesellschaften nach Flotten-Kommonalit&auml;t und das amerikanische Monopol im Segment oberhalb 400 Sitzen die Fortf&uuml;hrung des Ausbaus der Produktpalette innerhalb der Airbus-Familie im Sinne der Anforderungen des Marktes und seiner Wettbewerbsstrukturen. 
<p>

Im Bereich der Satelliten und Lenkflugk&ouml;rper stellte die Dasa 1995 entscheidende Weichen f&uuml;r die Schaffung von zwei geplanten Gemeinschaftsunternehmen mit dem franz&ouml;sischen Partner Aerospatiale auf der Grundlage der Entscheidung der deutschen und franz&ouml;sischen Regierung, gemeinsam ein System zur satellitengest&uuml;tzten strategischen Aufkl&auml;rung zu realisieren. Die Gr&uuml;ndung der beiden Joint-Ventures soll noch 1996 vollzogen werden. F&uuml;r die Dasa bedeutet dies einen wesentlichen Schritt bei der Umsetzung ihrer Strategie, wettbewerbsf&auml;hige Strukturen in der europ&auml;ischen Luft- und Raumfahrt zu schaffen.
<p>

In der Raumfahrt steht der Abschlu&szlig; des Gro&szlig;projektes Polare Plattform an. Eine Belebung in fast allen Bereichen des Gesch&auml;ftsfeldes Verteidigung und Zivile Systeme wird ebenfalls erwartet. Im Gesch&auml;ftsfeld Luftfahrt wird 1996 eine Umsatzsteigerung durch h&ouml;here Abrechnungen bei den Programmen Tornado und Eurofighter erwartet. Bei Luftfahrt-Antrieben kommen in gr&ouml;&szlig;erem Umfang Triebwerksbaugruppen f&uuml;r Tornado-Flugzeuge zur Auslieferung; auch das zivile Triebwerksgesch&auml;ft wird Beitr&auml;ge zum Wachstum liefern.
<p><br>


<B>Ergebnis der betrieblichen T&auml;tigkeit von -2,7 Mrd. DM vor allem durch Restrukturierung und Dollarkursr&uuml;ckgang gepr&auml;gt
</B>
<p>

Das deutlich negative Ergebnis der betrieblichen T&auml;tigkeit von -2,7 Mrd. DM ist vor allem von der verschlechterten W&auml;hrungsrelation gegen&uuml;ber dem US-Dollar und von Aufwendungen f&uuml;r Restrukturierungsprogramme, die zur Erreichung der mittel- und langfristigen Kostenziele unabdingbar sind, gepr&auml;gt. Der R&uuml;ckgang des Dollarkurses - das gesamte zivile Flugzeug- und Teile des weiteren Gesch&auml;ftes werden in Dollar abgerechnet - hat das laufende Ergebnis mit 0,4 Mrd. DM belastet, au&szlig;erdem waren weitere Drohverlustr&uuml;ckstellungen in H&ouml;he von 0,8 Mrd. DM notwendig. Die Aufwendungen f&uuml;r Restrukturierungsma&szlig;nahmen beliefen sich auf 0,9 Mrd. DM; hiervon entfielen 0,6 Mrd. DM auf Strukturaufwendungen im Rahmen der Wettbewerbsinitiative. 
<p>

Im Jahresfehlbetrag von ann&auml;hernd 4,2 Mrd. DM sind zus&auml;tzlich au&szlig;erordentliche Aufwendungen in H&ouml;he von 2,3 Mrd. DM f&uuml;r die Beendigung des Engagements bei Fokker enthalten. Diese R&uuml;ckstellungen decken das gesamte Risiko aus einem Konkurs von Fokker ab, so da&szlig; das Ergebnis des laufenden Gesch&auml;ftsjahres 1996 hierdurch nicht mehr belastet wird. Allein durch den Wegfall eines Verlustes von Fokker, die 1995 einen operativen Fehlbetrag von 1 Mrd. DM verbuchten, wird eine wesentliche Entlastung erwartet.
<p>

Die Dasa erwartet f&uuml;r 1996 durch den Wegfall der hohen Einmalbelastungen des Vorjahres und einer Verbesserung des operativen Gesch&auml;fts ein substantiell verbessertes Ergebnis.

<b>debis strebt 1996 1 Mrd. DM mehr Umsatz<br> und die Schaffung von 1.000 neuen Arbeitspl&auml;tzen an -<br>
Ergebnis der betrieblichen T&auml;tigkeit<br> mit 245 Mio. DM auch 1995 zufriedenstellend</B><p>


<i>Stuttgart/Berlin, 11. April 1996</i><br>

F&uuml;r die Daimler-Benz InterServices (debis) AG, Berlin, war 1995 ein gutes Gesch&auml;ftsjahr. debis hat den Umsatz um rund 1 Mrd. DM 
(plus 9 %) auf 11,8 Mrd. DM gesteigert und 1995 fast 1.000 neue Arbeitspl&auml;tze geschaffen. Die debis-Gruppe besch&auml;ftigt damit erstmals &uuml;ber 10.000 Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter. Trotz schwieriger Rahmenbedingungen erzielte die debis mit 245 Mio. DM ein zufriedenstellendes operatives Ergebnis. Das Ergebnis der gew&ouml;hnlichen Gesch&auml;ftst&auml;tigkeit der debis AG betr&auml;gt 389 Mio. DM, der Jahres&uuml;berschu&szlig; 91 Mio. DM.
<p>

Seit der Gr&uuml;ndung hat die debis-Gruppe den Umsatz von rund 4 Mrd. DM auf nunmehr fast 12 Mrd. DM verdreifacht. Gleichzeitig stieg die Zahl der debis-Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter im Zeitraum von 5 Jahren von 3.600 auf &uuml;ber 10.200 an. Dr. Klaus Mangold, Vorsitzender des Vorstandes: "Wir sind auf Erfolgskurs, und wir werden es weiter bleiben. In allen Gesch&auml;ftsbereichen arbeitet die debis-Gruppe profitabel."
<p>

Ganz wesentlich haben die Ausweitung des Leistungsangebotes und die zunehmende Internationalisierung zum Wachstum der debis-Gruppe beigetragen. Wie bereits in den Vorjahren stieg auch 1995 das Gesch&auml;ft mit nicht zum Daimler-Benz-Konzern geh&ouml;renden Kunden &uuml;berproportional an. Alle Gesch&auml;ftsbereiche der debis-Gruppe wickeln inzwischen mehr als die H&auml;lfte des Umsatzes mit externen Kunden ab.
<p>

Die positive Entwicklung in den ersten f&uuml;nf Jahren ist die Basis f&uuml;r eine dynamische Zukunft des Dienstleistungsunternehmens debis. Dabei konzentriert sich die debis AG auf M&auml;rkte, die fast &uuml;berall hohe Wachstumsraten aufweisen. Dr. Klaus Mangold: "Wir sehen gro&szlig;e Chancen in den zukunftstr&auml;chtigen M&auml;rkten der Dienstleistungen. Mit unserem Angebot hochwertiger, innovativer und anspruchsvoller Dienstleistungen aus einer Hand bauen wir im Rahmen unserer Expansionsstrategie die Marktpositionen weiter aus." 
<p><br>


<B>Neustrukturierung der Zusammenarbeit mit Cap Gemini Sogeti</B>
<p>

&Uuml;ber 200 Niederlassungen in 23 L&auml;ndern der Welt sind ein deutliches Zeichen f&uuml;r die internationale Ausrichtung der debis-Gesch&auml;ftsbereiche. Durch Partnerschaften mit f&uuml;hrenden Unternehmen erschlie&szlig;t debis neue M&auml;rkte, gewinnt internationale Kunden und garantiert eine optimale Kundenbetreuung weltweit. Durch die Neustrukturierung des Engagements mit der Cap Gemini Sogeti-Gruppe in Frankreich, dem gr&ouml;&szlig;ten unabh&auml;ngigen Anbieter von IT-Services in Europa mit Aktivit&auml;ten in den USA, entwickelt debis die internationale Pr&auml;senz weiter. Mit knapp 25 % wird die debis AG den gr&ouml;&szlig;ten Anteil an der neuen, fusionierten, b&ouml;rsennotierten Gesellschaft halten. Im Rahmen der Umstrukturierung der Sogeti-Gruppe hat die debis AG eine Neubewertung ihres Beteiligungsengagements vorgenommen und die daraus erforderlichen Wertkorrekturen mit den Konzernr&uuml;cklagen verrechnet.
<p>

Durch den kundenorientierten und innovativen Ausbau des Leistungsangebotes und durch die Erschlie&szlig;ung neuer Gesch&auml;ftsfelder - so in den Bereichen Multimedia, Online-Dienste und Telematik - nutzt die debis AG die starken, vielversprechenden Wachstumspotentiale des Dienstleistungssektors, um als Dienstleister in den M&auml;rkten der Zukunft aktiv zu sein. So wird das debis Systemhaus die bereits 1993 eingeleitete Ausrichtung auf neue Branchen, M&auml;rkte und Regionen bzw. Leistungssegmente ausbauen. F&uuml;r debis Finanzdienstleistungen steht auch 1996 die Sicherung der f&uuml;hrenden Wettbewerbsposition als sechstgr&ouml;&szlig;ter Leasinganbieter der Welt - bezogen auf das Neugesch&auml;ft in 1994 - im Vordergrund der weltweiten Aktivit&auml;ten. 
<p>

debis Assekuranz, drittgr&ouml;&szlig;ter Versicherungsmakler in Deutschland, gibt dem Ausbau eines weltweiten Servicenetzes eine ganz besondere Bedeutung, um die Anforderungen der Kunden national und international erf&uuml;llen zu k&ouml;nnen. debis Handel wird durch den Ausbau von Partnerschaften seine Gesch&auml;ftst&auml;tigkeit noch internationaler ausrichten und auf noch breitere Basis stellen. debis Marketing Services wird den Wachstumstrend fortsetzen und die Kooperation auf europ&auml;ischer Ebene ausbauen. debitel plant, auch in sterreich, Belgien, Italien und Spanien t&auml;tig zu werden. debis Immobilienmanagement hat sich neben der Realisierung des Daimler-Benz-Projektes "Potsdamer Platz" in Berlin zum Ziel gesetzt, ein Immobilienmanagement aufzubauen, das Planung, Bau, Vermarktung und Verwaltung von Geb&auml;uden jeder Art aus einer Hand erm&ouml;glicht.
<p>

Insgesamt strebt die debis-Gruppe in 1996 eine Steigerung des Gesamtumsatzes um mehr als 1 Mrd. DM auf rund 13 Mrd. DM an. Dabei will debis rund 1.000 neue Arbeitspl&auml;tze schaffen und die Mitarbeiterzahl auf &uuml;ber 11.000 erh&ouml;hen.
<p>

Die IT-Services-Aktivit&auml;ten der debis AG bilden durch die immer gr&ouml;&szlig;ere Bedeutung f&uuml;r die Bereiche Telekommunikation und Verkehr eine gute Ausgangsbasis zur Weiterentwicklung der Kompetenzen des Daimler-Benz-Konzerns in den Bereichen Mobilfunk und Telematik. Im Bereich der Neuen Medien wird debis vorwiegend teilnehmerbezogene Dienstleistungen &uuml;bernehmen. 
<p><br>


<B>Positiver Ergebnistrend setzt sich fort 
- R&uuml;ckgang im Ergebnis der betrieblichen T&auml;tigkeit vor allem durch Entkonsolidierung der Mercedes-Benz Leasing KG</B>
<p>

Auch 1995 konnte die debis AG trotz schwieriger Rahmenbedingungen - vor allem im Ausland - ein zufriedenstellendes Ergebnis der betrieblichen T&auml;tigkeit erzielen. Der R&uuml;ckgang um 130 Mio. DM ist vor allem auf die Entkonsolidierung eines Teils des inl&auml;ndischen Leasinggesch&auml;fts zur&uuml;ckzuf&uuml;hren, deren operativer Ergebnisbeitrag 1994 zum Teil noch ber&uuml;cksichtigt war. Daneben wurde das Ergebnis durch die schwierige Verfassung des Gebrauchtwagenmarktes in den USA und die Wirtschaftskrise in Mexiko beeintr&auml;chtigt. 
<p>

Der insgesamt positive Ergebnistrend kommt im Ergebnis der gew&ouml;hnlichen Gesch&auml;ftst&auml;tigkeit zum Ausdruck, das in der Konzern- Gewinn- und Verlustrechnung der debis AG von 335 auf 389 Mio. DM anstieg. Der Jahres&uuml;berschu&szlig; erh&ouml;hte sich von 86 auf 91 Mio. DM. Deutliche Verbesserungen des operativen Ergebnisses erzielten das Systemhaus und die Mobilfunkdienste, aber auch Marketing Services und debis Immobilienmanagement. Neben dem bedeutenden Ergebnisbeitrag der Finanzdienstleistungen haben auch alle anderen Gesch&auml;ftsbereiche zum positiven Ergebnis der betrieblichen T&auml;tigkeit beigetragen.
<p>

Mit der erneuten Umsatzausweitung plant debis f&uuml;r das laufende Gesch&auml;ftsjahr 1996 auch eine weitere deutliche Verbesserung des Ergebnisbeitrages.

The reason for this is that it was possible to collect data for certain solvents-mainly from disparate sources such as cleansing-for the first time in the year under review. The largest items here are the emissions from various sources in the Mercedes-Benz plant in Sindelfingen (426 tonnes) and MTU-Friedrichshafen (35 tonnes). The remaining chlorinated hydrocarbon emissions (15 tonnes in 1994, 9 tonnes in 1995) can be traced back to tetrachloroethane used to clean individual engine components at MTU-M&uuml;nchen and to dichloromethane used to strip the paint from aircraft in Oberpfaffenhofen.With the expiration of the exemption permit granted to Dasa for its CFC cleaning unit for electronic components in Ulm, the last plant of its kind in the group was closed down. CFCs are now only employed in older air conditioning units.<p>Responsibility for the remaining extremely low CFC emissions (0.01 tonnes) lies with leaks occurring in those older air conditioning and refrigeration installations which it has not been technically feasible to update.Traditional air pollutants such as dust, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides have once again seen significant reductions for the operational year 1995. Chiefly responsible for this drop are modifications at the power stations which have led to a 17 percent reduction in the amount of dust emitted and a 13.4 percent fall for nitrogen oxides. In addition, the increased use of catalytic converters-as installed, for example, in the Mercedes-Benz plant in Untert&uuml;rkheim-have also helped to reduce the figures for nitrogen oxides even further.<p>The 23.5 percent reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions was achieved largely as a result of the closure of a series of coal-fired power stations at the Dasa plant in Manching, at MTU-Friedrichshafen, and in Schorch. The conversion from coal to natural gas at Manching alone has reduced sulfur dioxide emissions by 23 tonnes a year.</table><p><br><table><tr><td><td><td align=middle colspan=3 valign=bottom><b>Solvents</b><td><td align=middle colspan=3 valign=bottom><b>Dust</b><tr><td valign=bottom><font size=-1>Quantities in tonnes</font><td><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1993</b><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1994</b><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1995</b><td><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1993</b><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1994</b><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1995</b><tr><td align=right width=100 valign=top><td><tr><td colspan=9><hr><tr><tr><td align=right><B>AEG</B><td><td align=right>72<td align=right>63<td align=right>127<td><td align=right>63<td align=right>2<td align=right>3<tr><td align=right><B>DASA</B><td><td align=right>133<td align=right>133<td align=right>126<td><td align=right>19<td align=right>11<td align=right>9<tr><td align=right><B>MBAG</B><td><td align=right>4570<td align=right>3650<td align=right>4123<td><td align=right>240<td align=right>234<td align=right>193<tr><td align=right><B>DB Group</B><td><td align=right>4775<td align=right>3846<td align=right>4376<td><td align=right>322<td align=right>247<td align=right>205<tr><td colspan=9><hr></table><p><br><table><tr><td><td><td align=middle colspan=3 valign=bottom><b>Sulfur dioxides</b><td><td align=middle colspan=3 valign=bottom><b>Nitrogen oxides</b><tr><td valign=bottom><font size=-1>Quantities in tonnes</font><td><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1993</b><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1994</b><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1995</b><td><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1993</b><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1994</b><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1995</b><tr><td align=right width=100 valign=top><td><tr><td colspan=9><hr><tr><tr><td align=right><B>AEG</B><td><td align=right>540<td align=right>11<td align=right>21<td><td align=right>88<td align=right>48<td align=right>200<tr><td align=right><B>DASA</B><td><td align=right>123<td align=right>60<td align=right>15<td><td align=right>411<td align=right>410<td align=right>223<tr><td align=right><B>MBAG</B><td><td align=right>86<td align=right>48<td align=right>55<td><td align=right>599<td align=right>568<td align=right>466<tr><td align=right><B>DB Group</B><td><td align=right>749<td align=right>119<td align=right>91<td><td align=right>1098<td align=right>1026<td align=right>889<tr><td colspan=9><hr></table><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="emiss_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../envir_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environment</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../ub96_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environmental Report '96</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../daten_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Facts &amp; Figures</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../daten_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 08/06/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Der Grund liegt darin, da&szlig; einige L&ouml;semittelemissionen, haupts&auml;chlich aus diffusen Quellen, wie beispielsweise der Reinigung, im Berichtsjahr erstmalig genauer erfa&szlig;t werden konnten. Die gr&ouml;&szlig;ten Positionen hierbei sind die Emissionen aus diffusen Quellen des Mercedes-Benz Werkes Sindelfingen (426 Tonnen) und bei der MTU-Friedrichshafen   (35 Tonnen). Die restlichen Chlorkohlenwasserstoff-Emissionen   (1994: 15 Tonnen, 1995: 9 Tonnen) sind auf die Reinigung von Triebwerkseinzelteilen mit Tetrachlorethen bei der MTU-M&uuml;nchen und die Flugzeugentlackung mit Dichlormethan in Oberpfaffenhofen zur&uuml;ckzuf&uuml;hren.<p>Bei DASA wurde mit dem Auslaufen der Ausnahmegenehmigung f&uuml;r die mit FCKW betriebene Reinigungsanlage f&uuml;r elektronische  Bauteile in Ulm die letzte derartige Anlage im Konzern  stillgelegt. Es werden nur noch &auml;ltere Klimaanlagen mit FCKWs betrieben.<p>Die im Konzern noch vorhandenen geringen FCKW-Emissionen (0,01 Tonnen) entstehen durch Lecks. Verantwortlich sind alte, technisch nicht umr&uuml;stbare Klimaanlagen und K&auml;ltemaschinen.<p>Die klassischen Luftschadstoffe wie Staub, Schwefeldioxid und Stickoxide haben im Berichtsjahr 1995 wieder erheblich abgenommen. Grund daf&uuml;r waren weitere Umstellungen bei den Kraftwerken, die sich positiv auf die Staubemissionen (minus 17 Prozent) und auf die Stickoxidemissionen (minus 13,4 Prozent) auswirkten. Der verst&auml;rkte Einsatz von Katalysatoren wie im Mercedes-Werk Untert&uuml;rkheim dr&uuml;ckte die Stickoxidemissionen weiter nach unten.<p>Der R&uuml;ckgang der Schwefeldioxid-Emissionen um 23,5 Prozent konnte durch die Stillegung verschiedener mit Kohle befeuerter Kraftwerke im DASA-Werk Manching, bei MTU-Friedrichshafen und bei Schorch erreicht werden. Allein die Umstellung von Kohle auf Erdgas im Werk Manching reduziert die Schwefeldioxid-Emission j&auml;hrlich um 23 Tonnen.</table><p><br><table><tr><td><td><td align=middle colspan=3 valign=bottom><b>L&ouml;semittel</b><td><td align=middle colspan=3 valign=bottom><b>Staub</b><tr><td valign=bottom><font size=-1>Angaben in t</font><td><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1993</b><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1994</b><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1995</b><td><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1993</b><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1994</b><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1995</b><tr><td align=right width=100 valign=top><td><tr><td colspan=9><hr><tr><tr><td align=right><B>AEG</B><td><td align=right>72<td align=right>63<td align=right>127<td><td align=right>63<td align=right>2<td align=right>3<tr><td align=right><B>DASA</B><td><td align=right>133<td align=right>133<td align=right>126<td><td align=right>19<td align=right>11<td align=right>9<tr><td align=right><B>MBAG</B><td><td align=right>4570<td align=right>3650<td align=right>4123<td><td align=right>240<td align=right>234<td align=right>193<tr><td align=right><B>DB-Konzern</B><td><td align=right>4775<td align=right>3846<td align=right>4376<td><td align=right>322<td align=right>247<td align=right>205<tr><td colspan=9><hr></table><p><br><table><tr><td><td><td align=middle colspan=3 valign=bottom><b>Schwefeldioxid</b><td><td align=middle colspan=3 valign=bottom><b>Stickoxide</b><tr><td valign=bottom><font size=-1>Angaben in t</font><td><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1993</b><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1994</b><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1995</b><td><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1993</b><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1994</b><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1995</b><tr><td align=right width=100 valign=top><td><tr><td colspan=9><hr><tr><tr><td align=right><B>AEG</B><td><td align=right>540<td align=right>11<td align=right>21<td><td align=right>88<td align=right>48<td align=right>200<tr><td align=right><B>DASA</B><td><td align=right>123<td align=right>60<td align=right>15<td><td align=right>411<td align=right>410<td align=right>223<tr><td align=right><B>MBAG</B><td><td align=right>86<td align=right>48<td align=right>55<td><td align=right>599<td align=right>568<td align=right>466<tr><td align=right><B>DB-Konzern</B><td><td align=right>749<td align=right>119<td align=right>91<td><td align=right>1098<td align=right>1026<td align=right>889<tr><td colspan=9><hr></table><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="emiss_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>English</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../envir_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Umwelt</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../ub96_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Umweltbericht '96</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../daten_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Daten &amp; Fakten</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../daten_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Weiter</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Suche</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Hilfe</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 06.08.1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Die Menge von 237 Gigawattstunden (GWh) sind beim Vergleich mit den Vorjahresdaten entsprechend herauszurechnen. Bedingt durch den Produktionszuwachs, erh&ouml;ht sich der  gesamte Energieverbrauch an fossiler und elektrischer Energie   (Fremdbezug) und Fernw&auml;rme um 1,75 Prozent.<p>Der Gesamtwasserverbrauch sank zwar im Berichtsjahr, doch von Unternehmen zu Unternehmen schwankt diese allgemeine Tendenz. Zum ersten Mal taucht der Bereich Opto- und Vakuumelektronik bei der AEG in der Statistik auf. Dadurch stieg der Wasserverbrauch f&uuml;r die Produktion bei der Mikroelektronik um fast 500000 Kubikmeter. Die neue Durchlaufk&uuml;hlung mit Brunnenwasser bei der MTU-M&uuml;nchen verbrauchte 900000 Kubikmeter. Au&szlig;erdem ben&ouml;tigte die MTU-Friedrichshafen 500000 Kubikmeter mehr K&uuml;hlwasser. Auf der anderen Seite wurden rund 900000 Kubikmeter Wasser im Mercedes-Benz-Werk W&ouml;rth durch die Umstellung von Durchlauf- auf Kreislaufk&uuml;hlung der Druckluftversorgung eingespart. Auch der Bahnbereich bei ASF N&uuml;rnberg und Hennigsdorf reduzierte den Wasserverbrauch um 160000 Kubikmeter.

Comparisons between the overall figure and data from previous years must therefore take this extra change of 237 Gigawatt hours (Gwh) into account. As a result of a general growth in production, total consumption of fossil and electric energy (externally generated) plus district heating grew by 1.75 percent.<p>Although total water consumption fell during the year under review, there were extreme variations between operations. For the first time, the Optoelectronics and Vacuum Electronics division has been included in the AEG statistics, which has led to a rise in water consumption of almost 500000 cubic meters for production in the micro-electronics area. MTU-M&uuml;nchen's new continuous cooling system, which uses spring water, consumed 900000 cubic meters. In addition, MTU-Friedrichshafen used an extra 500000 cubic meters of cooling water. On the other side of the balance sheet, around 900000 cubic meters was saved at the Mercedes-Benz plant in W&ouml;rth thanks to conversion of the compressed air unit from continuous-flow to closed-cycle cooling. The Rail division at ASF N&uuml;rnberg and Hennigsdorf also cut water consumption by 160000 cubic meters. Further savings were achieved at Dasa through modifications to the electroplating shop in Augsburg.</table><p><br><table><tr><td><td><td align=middle colspan=7 valign=bottom><b>Electrical

Besonders deutlich wird das im Bereich der "hausm&uuml;ll&auml;hnlichen Gewerbeabf&auml;lle", vor allem bei AEG und DASA. Die Steigerung dieser Abfallart bei der Mercedes-Benz AG kommt durch fast 10000 Tonnen  Gie&szlig;ereisand mehr als 1994 bei der Achsfertigung in Mannheim zustande. Durch vermehrtes Recycling wird dieser Gie&szlig;ereisand-Abfall in den n&auml;chsten Jahren erheblich sinken.<p>In der umweltkritischen Kategorie "besonders &uuml;berwachungsbed&uuml;rftige Abf&auml;lle" verminderte sich die Abfallrate um &uuml;ber 16 Prozent. In der Klasse "wiederverwertete Reststoffe" sind auch R&uuml;ckst&auml;nde enthalten, die verkauft werden konnten, wie &uuml;ber 400000 Tonnen Metallschrott. Bei der AEG und der DASA wurden f&uuml;r insgesamt 8,3 Millionen Mark Gutschriften mit Metallschrott erzielt.</table><p><br><table><tr><td><td><td align=middle colspan=3 valign=bottom><b>Wiederverwertbare<br> Reststoffe</b><td><td align=middle colspan=3 valign=bottom><b>Hausm&uuml;ll&auml;hnliche<br> Gewerbeabf&auml;lle</b><tr><td valign=bottom><font size=-1>Angaben in t</font><td><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1993</b><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1994</b><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1995</b><td><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1993</b><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1994</b><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1995</b><tr><td align=right width=100 valign=top><td><tr><td colspan=9><hr><tr><tr><td align=right><B>AEG</B><td><td align=right>9977<td align=right>13863<td align=right>15002<td><td align=right>17921<td align=right>13025<td align=right>8846<tr><td align=right><B>DASA</B><td><td align=right>22863<td align=right>14600<td align=right>16865<td><td align=right>12559<td align=right>9810<td align=right>6611<tr><td align=right><B>DBAG</B><td><td align=right>2573<td align=right>1098<td align=right>1046<td><td align=right>1949<td align=right>491<td align=right>253<tr><td align=right><B>MBAG</B><td><td align=right>409163<td align=right>525075<td align=right>509818<td><td align=right>48286<td align=right>49086<td align=right>56191<tr><td align=right><B>DB-Konzern</B><td><td align=right>444576<td align=right>554636<td align=right>542731<td><td align=right>80715<td align=right>72412<td align=right>71902<tr><td colspan=9><hr></table><p><br><table><tr><td><td><td align=middle colspan=3 valign=bottom><b>Besonders &uuml;berwachungs-<br>bed&uuml;rftige Abf&auml;lle</b><td><td align=middle colspan=3 valign=bottom><b>Bauschutt</b><tr><td valign=bottom><font size=-1>Angaben in t</font><td><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1993</b><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1994</b><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1995</b><td><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1993</b><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1994</b><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1995</b><tr><td align=right width=100 valign=top><td><tr><td colspan=9><hr><tr><tr><td align=right><B>AEG</B><td><td align=right>2344<td align=right>2272<td align=right>1849<td><td align=right>1044<td align=right>3267<td align=right>1012<tr><td align=right><B>DASA</B><td><td align=right>5871<td align=right>5070<td align=right>4410<td><td align=right>1975<td align=right>2420<td align=right>271<tr><td align=right><B>DBAG</B><td><td align=right>14<td align=right>22<td align=right>25<td><td align=right><td align=right><td align=right><tr><td align=right><B>MBAG</B><td><td align=right>29775<td align=right>12048<td align=right>9972<td><td align=right>2601<td align=right>17577<td align=right>16969<tr><td align=right><B>DB-Konzern</B><td><td align=right>38004<td align=right>19412<td align=right>16256<td><td align=right>5620<td align=right>23264<td align=right>18252<tr><td colspan=9><hr></table><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="abfall_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>English</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../envir_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Umwelt</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../ub96_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Umweltbericht '96</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../daten_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Daten &amp; Fakten</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="energy_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Weiter</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Suche</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Hilfe</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, Stand: 06.08.1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

This is particularly evident in the area of "Commercial Wastes similar to Domestic Garbage"-above all at AEG and Dasa. The increase in this type of waste at Mercedes-Benz, on the other hand, was the result of almost 10000 extra tonnes of foundry sand used in axle production at Mannheim compared to 1994. However, increased recycling will significantly reduce foundry sand waste in the years to come.<p>A fall of over 16 percent has been recorded in the highly sensitive area of "Wastes requiring Special Monitoring," while the figures for "Recycled Waste Materials" also incorporate residues which were able to be sold, such as over 400000 tonnes of scrap metal. AEG and Dasa logged a total of DM 8.3 million in credits for sales of scrap metal.</table><p><br><table><tr><td><td><td align=middle colspan=3 valign=bottom><b>Recycled waste<br> materials</b><td><td align=middle colspan=3 valign=bottom><b>Commercial wastes similar<br> to domestic garbage</b><tr><td valign=bottom><font size=-1>Quantities in tonnes</font><td><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1993</b><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1994</b><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1995</b><td><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1993</b><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1994</b><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1995</b><tr><td align=right width=100 valign=top><td><tr><td colspan=9><hr><tr><tr><td align=right><B>AEG</B><td><td align=right>9977<td align=right>13863<td align=right>15002<td><td align=right>17921<td align=right>13025<td align=right>8846<tr><td align=right><B>DASA</B><td><td align=right>22863<td align=right>14600<td align=right>16865<td><td align=right>12559<td align=right>9810<td align=right>6611<tr><td align=right><B>DBAG</B><td><td align=right>2573<td align=right>1098<td align=right>1046<td><td align=right>1949<td align=right>491<td align=right>253<tr><td align=right><B>MBAG</B><td><td align=right>409163<td align=right>525075<td align=right>509818<td><td align=right>48286<td align=right>49086<td align=right>56191<tr><td align=right><B>DB Group</B><td><td align=right>444576<td align=right>554636<td align=right>542731<td><td align=right>80715<td align=right>72412<td align=right>71902<tr><td colspan=9><hr></table><p><br><table><tr><td><td><td align=middle colspan=3 valign=bottom><b>Wastes requiring<br> special monitoring</b><td><td align=middle colspan=3 valign=bottom><b>Building rubbish</b><tr><td valign=bottom><font size=-1>Quantities in tonnes</font><td><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1993</b><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1994</b><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1995</b><td><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1993</b><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1994</b><td align=right width=60 valign=bottom><b>1995</b><tr><td align=right width=100 valign=top><td><tr><td colspan=9><hr><tr><tr><td align=right><B>AEG</B><td><td align=right>2344<td align=right>2272<td align=right>1849<td><td align=right>1044<td align=right>3267<td align=right>1012<tr><td align=right><B>DASA</B><td><td align=right>5871<td align=right>5070<td align=right>4410<td><td align=right>1975<td align=right>2420<td align=right>271<tr><td align=right><B>DBAG</B><td><td align=right>14<td align=right>22<td align=right>25<td><td align=right><td align=right><td align=right><tr><td align=right><B>MBAG</B><td><td align=right>29775<td align=right>12048<td align=right>9972<td><td align=right>2601<td align=right>17577<td align=right>16969<tr><td align=right><B>DB Group</B><td><td align=right>38004<td align=right>19412<td align=right>16256<td><td align=right>5620<td align=right>23264<td align=right>18252<tr><td colspan=9><hr></table><IMG WIDTH=592 HEIGHT=16 SRC="../../lines/db_592.gif"><P><TABLE><TD ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=550><H5><A HREF="abfall_g.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Deutsch</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../index_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Home</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../envir_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environment</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../ub96_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Environmental Report '96</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../daten_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Facts &amp; Figures</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="energy_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Next</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../search/search_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Search</I>&nbsp;]</A><A HREF="../../mail/mail_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Dialog</I>&nbsp;]</A>   <A HREF="../../help/help_e.htm">[&nbsp;<I>Help</I>&nbsp;]</A></H5></TABLE><ADDRESS>&copy; Daimler-Benz, last update: 08/06/1996</ADDRESS><P></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
