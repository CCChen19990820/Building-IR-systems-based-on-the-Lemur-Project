SRC="peepers.gif" WIDTH="582" HEIGHT="9"></A><A></A></CENTER>
<P><B>High School graduates or applicants who will graduate from a recognized
or accredited secondary school prior to enrollment at NIU will be considered for
admission if they meet the following criteria:</B></P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Class Rank and ACT/SAT Scores: </B>Applicants who rank in the upper
half of their graduating class must have an ACT composite score of at least 19
or an SAT score of 910 (recentered).<BR>OR<BR>Applicants who do not rank in
the upper half of their class but who rank in the upper two-thirds of their
graduating  class must have an ACT composite score of at least 23 or an SAT
score of 1060 (recentered).</LI>
<LI><B>High School Course Requirements: </B>All applicants must have
successfully completed 15 units of the following high school courses (one unit
equals one year).<BR><B>English:</B> Four units (three of which must be from
NIU-recognized courses emphasizing written and oral communication and
literature).<BR><B>Mathematics:</B> Two to three units (two of which must be
NIU-recognized courses in college preparatory mathematics, including one year of
introductory algebra and a second year of plane geometry or advanced algebra).<BR><B>Science:</B>
Two to three units (two of which must be from NIU-recognized courses in the
physical or biological sciences). One unit must be a laboratory science.<BR><B>Social
Studies:</B> Two to three units (two of which must be from NIU-recognized
courses, one of which must be U.S. history or a combination of U.S. history and
government).<BR><B>Foreign Language, Art, Music, or Vocational Education:</B>
One to two units (one of which must be NIU-recognized course work in foreign
language, art, or music).<BR><B>Additional Course Work:</B>Up to three units
of the required 15 units may be distributed throughout any of the five
categories of course work listed above. Vocational education may satisfy up to
four of the units. Ten of the 15 units must be NIU-recognized courses and,
therefore, must meet the NIU high school subject pattern introduced in 1988.<BR>Students
whose 15 units in college preparatory courses include two years of a foreign
language, advanced mathematics, composition, literature, and at least one unit
chemistry or physics will be more likely to (a) qualify for Advanced Placement
or proficiency credit and (b) complete their programs of study within the
traditional four-year time frame.<BR><BR><I>Note:</I> Courses specified as
NIU-recognized have been examined for content according to the guidelines
established by NIU faculty to ensure that students have an appropriate
background necessary for a college education.<BR><BR><B>Applicants who are
not high school graduates or who will not graduate from an accredited or
recognized secondary school prior to enrollment at NIU must:</B><BR></LI></OL>
<OL>
<LI>Have attained high school equivalency through General Educational
Development (GED) tests.</LI>
<LI>Have an ACT composite score of at least 23 or an SAT score of 1060

<H1>Transfer Admission Criteria</H1><A><IMG SRC="peepers.gif"></A></CENTER>
<P><B>Applicants who have attempted up to and including 12 semester hours of
credit</B> will be evaluated as freshmen for admission purposes and must meet
the current freshman admission requirements. The grade point average earned for
the attempted 12 hours or less will not affect the admission decision. (This
policy has been developed to encourage students to take advantage of local
post-secondary educational opportunities, either during their senior year in
high school or during the summer before NIU enrollment, without jeopardizing
their admission to Northern.)<BR><BR><B>Applicants who have attempted more
than 12 semester  hours but who have earned fewer than 24 semester hours of
transferable college-level credit</B> at the time of application must:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Have at least a C grade point average (2.00 on a 4.00 scale) from all
colleges attended (as computed by NIU standards).</LI>
<LI>Be in good standing at the last college attended.</LI></OL>

<LI>Be in good standing at the last college attended.</LI>
<LI>Satisfy Northern's competitive transfer grade point average.<BR>Enrollment
into courses offered at NIU which fulfill NIU's core competency requirement in
mathematics requires an entry-skill level, determined through placement testing
and/or explicit prerequisite, at least equal to that expected from the
successful completion of an intermediate algebra course. Because intermediate
algebra is not offered at NIU, you will be expected to have attained this skill
level prior to enrollment into NIU core competency mathematics courses.</LI></OL>

<H3><A NAME="general">Final Examinations</A></H3>
<P>Except with the written approval of the dean of the college, all
undergraduate classes are to meet for examination or other instructional
purposes at the time assigned in the final examination schedule. Class meetings
scheduled during the final examination period are considered part of the regular
semester. Evening classes scheduled for a final meeting during the final
examination period also fall under this policy.
</P>

<P></P>
<H3><A NAME="twofnls">Policy governing students scheduled for two finals at
the same time:</A></H3>
<P>Students whose class schedule commits them to take two examinations at the
same time may have the examination in the higher-numbered course rescheduled. If
the occurrence of two finals at the same time, however, is the result of the
examination in a particular course having been rescheduled (with appropriate
approval), the examination which does not conform to the announced schedule is
the one which the student may elect to have rescheduled.<BR>The final exam
schedule is subject to change if scheduling conflicts are created by subsequent
changes in the university semester calendar.</P>
<H3><A NAME="threefnls">Policy governing students scheduled for three finals
in the same day:</A></H3>
<P>Students whose class schedule commits them to take three final examinations
in one day may elect to have the examination in the highest-number course of the
three rescheduled. If the occurrence of three finals in one day, however, is the
result of the examination in a particular class having been rescheduled (with
appropriate approval), the examination which does not conform to the announced
schedule is the one which the student may elect to have rescheduled.</P>
<H3><A NAME="closure">Policy governing rescheduling of examinations due to
closure of the university:</A></H3>
<P>In an extreme situation, it may be necessary for the university to close and
cancel all scheduled activities, including final examinations. If such a
situation should arise, closure information will be made available to students
through various radio and television networks in the northern Illinois area.<BR>By
the end of the first working day after the closure, a detailed examination
schedule will be made available by the Office of Registration and Records. This
schedule will be distributed to departmental, college, personnel, and other
university offices. Students should contact their departmental offices, Campus
Assistance, (815) 753-1157, or Registration and Records, (815) 753-0681, to
obtain rescheduled examination information.</P>

<BODY><H2>TIME TO DEGREE</H2>
<P>Of the students who graduated in the last five years, an average of 51
percent graduated within four years and nearly 93 percent graduated within five
years.  The following chart displays the number of academic years it took within
the six-year time frame to graduate from NIU, examining data on five freshman
cohorts, fall 1985 through fall 1989.</P> 
<H4>TIME TO DEGREE</H4>
<PRE>            <B>4 YEARS     5 YEARS     6 YEARS</B>

<P><I>Source:  NIU Institutional Research</I></P>
<P>Reasons for not graduating in four years include changing majors and needing
additional courses; not taking a full schedule (15 to 18 hours) because of work
and other factors; stopping out for one or more semesters; and classes in a
required sequence not always available when needed.</P>

<H2><I><B>FIGs at NIU</B></I></H2>
<P>A new curricular initiative in the college will enhance and broaden
students' educational experience.<BR><I>We're talking about FIGs.</I></P>
<H2>What are FIGs?</H2>
<P>FIGs is short for Freshmen Interest Group or Focused Interest Group, either
of which enrolls a common cohort of students in a small, personal &quot;learning
community&quot; by linking general education or other undergraduate courses
around a common theme or area of interest. Typically, a <B>Focused Interest
Group,</B>designated as FIGS 200, consists of two or three courses taken in
conjunction with each other, which examine a common theme in disciplines within
or across the humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences. Students are
enrolled automatically in each of the courses. Faculty members focus on the
common theme while teaching their own courses as discrete classes.<BR><B>Freshmen
Interest Groups,</B> designated as FIGS 100, on the other hand, link general
education courses commonly taken by freshmen. These FIGs are identified under
the general headings of Humanities and the Arts, Social Sciences, Natural
Sciences, and the like. While they typically link LA&amp;S general education
courses, they can also include courses from art, music, and theater as well.</P>
<H2>Why should students consider enrolling in a FIG?</H2>
<P>There are some compelling personal and academic reasons for doing so.
Studies repeatedly have shown that participation in focused learning communities
throughout the freshman and undergraduate years broadens students' college
experience and contributes significantly to their success. By linking courses to
a central theme or area of interest, a FIG integrates ideas across disciplinary
boundaries and allows students to explore different intellectual perspectives,
while synthesizing their own. At the same time, a FIG fulfills key university
requirements.<BR>Because students are automatically enrolled in three related
courses with students of similar interests, they all will have a chance to get
to know fellow FIG participants more readily than in isolated classes. As a
member of a FIG, each student is an active participant in a constant and stable
group of peers taking classes together, so each member has greater intellectual
interaction and more opportunity for collaborative learning. A FIG provides a
wonderful opportunity to form study groups with students in a learning community
who share common interests; and it is a great way to make friends.<BR>Equally
important is the fact that students enrolled in a FIG have an opportunity to
interact with faculty more readily than they might in other courses taken
separately. By participating in a FIG, students can work with faculty from
different disciplines and see how they approach a central theme; and students
can learn more about the ways of thinking and knowing that underlie many fields
of study. Moreover, because some FIG courses share a common theme, they provide
opportunities to study material in a more focused way, thereby making study time
more efficient.</P>
<H2>What are the requirements to enroll in a FIG?</H2>
<P>Registration for a FIG is not difficult at all. Students simply register in
T.R.A.C.S. with a single reference number for the particular FIG they are
interested in. Students who participate in a FIG are thus registered for each of
the courses that comprise the FIG. In Focused Interest Groups, students also
participate in some out-of-class activities, such as informal discussion groups,
field trips, guest lectures, or films.<BR>Focused and Freshmen Interest Groups
will continue to be a priority in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. We
believe that FIGs foster greater intellectual interaction among students and
faculty, while also enhancing academic and social relations among students
themselves. This means an enriched learning environment and a broader
educational experience for everyone.</P>
