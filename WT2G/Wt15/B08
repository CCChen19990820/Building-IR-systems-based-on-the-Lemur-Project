</HEAD> 
<BODY> 
                                 
                                    
                                    
         <CENTER><H2>JOINT STATEMENT OF PUBLIC INTEREST PRINCIPLES
              ON ELECTRIC INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING</H1></CENTER>
                                    
     The undersigned parties offer the following joint 
statement of principles to guide the Minnesota Public Utilities 
Commission in its investigation of proposals to restructure the 
electric utility industry in Minnesota.  This statement is 
reflective of discussions held by a diverse group of interested 
stakeholders in an effort to define the public's interest in 
any gradual move to greater competition in Minnesota's electric 
industry.  It is our hope that the Commission will insist that 
the public interest criteria for competition contained in these 
principles be met in whole before authorizing the 
implementation of any restructuring plan.  Many of the parties 
to these joint principles will file their own detailed reply 
comments.<P>



     On the subject of electric utility industry restructuring, 
the listed organizations agree on the following principles:<P>


<UL>
       <LI>Any proposal to restructure the industry must be 
        considered in accordance with the public interest, and 
        must take effect over an appropriate period to assure 
        a smooth transition.
       
       <LI>Wholesale competition, involving multiple wholesale 
        power suppliers, should be allowed to take effect 
        first, and its consequences thoroughly evaluated, 
        before the need for retail competition is considered.
       
       <LI>Universal electric service, through the obligation to 
        serve within assigned service areas at reasonable 
        cost, must be maintained.
       
       <LI>Recognized stranded costs must be subject to equitable 
        recovery from departing customers.
       
       <LI>Environmental quality and stewardship of resources 
        must be maintained through an effective integrated 
        resource planning process or similar public process 
        that assures consideration of, but is not limited to, 
        the following: 
            <UL><LI>Cost-effective demand-side management programs, 
            and; 
            <LI>Portfolio diversity, including cost-effective 
            renewable resources.
       </UL>
       <LI>The existing need and siting review of power supply 
        facilities and transmission lines by state regulatory 
        agencies must be maintained.
       
       <LI>Restructuring must not degrade safety, reliability, or 
        customer service standards.
       
       <LI>Public interest objectives, such as shutoff protection 
        for fixed- and low-income consumers, must be met.

 <CENTER><B>UNLIKELY ALLIANCE FORMED TO PROTECT PUBLIC INTEREST IN DEBATE
 OVER ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING</B></CENTER>
                                    
     A broad alliance of Minnesota electric cooperatives, 
municipal utilities, low-income energy advocates and clean 
energy advocates announced today that they will be working 
together in the debate over restructuring of the electric 
utility industry.  These groups, often opponents on many energy 
issues, have joined together to ensure that the future of the 
electric industry is shaped with the public interest firmly in 
mind.<P>



     The seven groups in the alliance represent several million 
Minnesotans statewide.  They have prepared a joint statement to 
be filed with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, laying 
out public interest criteria on which any decision on electric 
industry restructuring should be based.  The principles include 
maintaining such public interest objectives as safety, 
reliability and customer service standards; protection of 
residential ratepayers and low- and fixed- income customers; 
stewardship of the environment through cost-effective 
conservation and renewables; and continued regulatory oversight 
such as integrated resource planning.<P>



     "The electric utilities in Minnesota are in an enviable 
position, with low rates, excellent reliability, strong 
financial health and sound environmental practices," said Mark 
Glaess, general manager of the Minnesota Rural Electric 
Association. "The proposals by some large utilities and large 
industrial customers to move toward retail competition and 
deregulation should not be allowed to jeopardize this position 
or to place residential and small business customers at risk of 
paying more and having fewer choices."<P>



     The debate before Minnesota's Public Utilities Commission 
mirrors discussions going on around the country about how 
utilities should be structured and allowed to compete for 
customers.  As in deregulation discussions in other industries, 
the largest utilities who are in a position to dominate markets 
favor a system that frees them from such requirements as 
service territories and the obligation to serve certain 
customers.  Smaller utilities, environmentalists, and 
low-income advocates want to ensure that the public interest 
obligations that are current state policy are maintained.<P>



     Pam Marshall, director of the EnergyCENTS coalition, noted 
that, "Industries that provide energy for basic human survival, 
such as heating and cooling, ought to be overseen by a body 
whose duty it is to maintain those services for everyone and to 
ensure against the public harm that energy tragedies can 
cause."<P>



     "People want low rates and reliable electric service that 
doesn't harm the environment," said Michael Noble of 
Minnesotans for an Energy-Efficient Economy, "Clean, renewable 
energy is in the public interest and these radical proposals to 
restructure the electric industry promise to undermine 
Minnesota's progress toward a sustainable energy future."<P>



     "We support open and robust competition at the wholesale 
level, which is now in the process of developing," said Jack 
Kegel, executive director of the Minnesota Municipal Utility 
Association.  "We should wait and see how this competition 
shakes out before jumping into retail competition, which may 
simply allow large customers to get better rates at the expense 
of small customers."<P>



     "The question that Minnesotans must answer, " added Bill 
Grant of the Izaak Walton League, "is how to restructure 
electric utility regulation to obtain the benefits of greater 
competition while strengthening our fundamental commitment to 
environmental protection."<P>



     "These principles are motherhood and apple pie," said 
Craig Johnson of Clean Water Action Alliance, "which is why 
such a large and diverse alliance has been formed."<P>

<p>
<I>January 18, 1996</I> <p>
<p>
<p>
The IWLA and ME3 are pleased to submit these comments on the PUC's suggested
guidelines for the restructuring and re-regulation of Minnesota's electric
industry. With only a few reservations, noted below, IWLA and ME3 find the
direction of the draft principles to be an encouraging start for the
restructuring of electric industry regulation. Creating principles to guide the
discussion and establishing a step-wise approach to electric industry
restructuring and re-regulation is a sensible approach. IWLA and ME3 also agree
with most of the content and tone of the proposed guidelines. The draft
principles lay a solid foundation for evaluating where restructuring will lead
us before we set out on that journey, and acknowledge the role that renewable
and DSM resources should play in the future electric industry. <p>
<p>
IWLA and ME3 do, however, offer suggestions to clarify the intent of some
principles, and raise some issues that may need to be considered when applying
the principles. First, while the principles address the key issues when
evaluating and proceeding with <p>
regulatory restructuring, IWLA and ME3  perceive that many of the principles
focus on how to bring about retail competition. IWLA and ME3 believe that a
step-wise approach to restructuring requires the Commission to evaluate the
potential benefits of direct retail access against the risks and costs of that
form of regulatory restructuring. Retail competition is not the inevitable
result of industry and regulatory restructuring, and the Commission should
proceed down that path only subsequent to an explicit decision that retail
competition is the preferable structure. <p>
<p>
The Commission should consider, therefore, additional principles that clearly
identify the standards by which restructuring options will be evaluated. Rather
than assuming retail competition to be at the end of the restructuring process,
the Commission should examine the myriad of alternatives with the following in
mind: <p>
<p>
  <!-- List Tag -->
<UL>
<LI> the costs and risks posed by the restructuring alternative;

<LI>   the potential benefits of the restructuring alternative;  and

<LI>   the match between statutory goals of regulation and the benefits offered by
the         
   restructuring alternative.<p>
</UL>
<p>
Second, industry and regulatory restructuring offer an opportunity to better
accomodate the unique benefits of renewable resources and DSM in the electric
industry's investment decisions. Whether restructuring leads to retail
competition or another alternative to the existing regulatory structure, IWLA
and ME3 believe that the current state policy of using all renewable energy
options in the public interest must  be incorporated. Restructuring should lead
to enhanced ability to meet public policy goals, rather than changing public
policy goals. <p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b><i>Proposed Principles</i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b><p>
1. 	<B>A deliberate, step-wise approach to restructuring.</B>  IWLA and ME3
strongly endorse 	the Commission's commitment to incremental or marginal
movement toward 	restructuring and re-regulation. In particular, IWLA and ME3
support the 	Commission's recognition that robust wholesale competition must
necessarily 	precede retail restructuring. IWLA and ME3 do, however, caution
the 	Commission to proceed toward retail competition only after determining
that 	doing so is consistent with the statutory principles and goals
surrounding electric 	service and regulation. <p>
<p>
2. <B>The benefits of competition should be available to all customer
classes.</B>  IWLA and ME3 	strongly endorse this principle, and presume that
benefits should not only be 	available but must be <u>realized</u> by all
customer classes. The Commission should 	also: 1) be attentive to the magnitude
of the risk associated with restructuring 	relative to the potential benefits
of competition; and, 2) ensure that the potential 	benefits of competition are
commensurate with the risks of restructuring. Finally, 	while the benefits of
competition may be available to all customer classes, the 	costs of such
competition may make some customers worse off. The Commission 	should commit
that any regulatory change designed to encourage efficient 	provision of
electric service will make all customer classes better off than they are 	under
existing forms of regulation.<p>
<p>
3.<B>Competitively neutral laws and regulation.</B>  IWLA and ME3 believe that
the intent of 	this principle needs to be more clearly stated. Competitors for
the same service 	should be subject to identical regulation. Essential
components of electric service,<p>
	and the risks associated with the provision of electric service, should be
borne by 	all competitors with no opportunity for bypass. The Commission must
recognize, 	however, that electric service providers sometimes provide
different services (the 	"products" are not direct substitutes) and different
service may warrant different 	laws or regulation.<p>
<p>
4. 	<B>Equitable and efficient unbundling of generation, transmission and
distribution rates and 	services.</B>  IWLA and ME3 believe that unbundling at
the wholesale level is a 	necessary precondition for robust wholesale
competition. IWLA and ME3  also 	support  the PUC's condition of robust
competition at the wholesale level as a 	precondition to retail restructuring.
A step-wise approach to retail restructuring, 	however, does not  begin with
unbundling of retail rates; retail unbundling is the 	final step to one
restructuring scenario (retail competition) rather than a principle 	from which
the Commission might explore regulatory restructuring. Moving into 	retail
unbundling presupposes that the potential benefits of retail competition
outweigh its risks, a presupposition at odds with the step-wise approach to
electric industry restructuring.<p>
<p>
	To stimulate increased wholesale competition the Commission might investigate
whether electric utilities should divest natural gas distribution functions
from 	parent or affiliated companies. <p>
<p>
5. 	<B>Obligation to provide distribution service.</B>  Most visions of a
restructured electric 	industry require the distribution function to remain a
monopoly. The 	Commission must, however, address the uncertain distinctions
between 	generation, transmission, and distribution functions in the grid. DSM
serves 	generation, transmission, and distribution functions, as do some supply
technologies such as photovoltaics, fuel cells, battery or other storage, and
distributed generation. The neat distinctions often drawn between generation,
transmission, and distribution carry a theoretical elegance, but may have
little to	 	do with reality.<p>
<p>
	As the Commission considers the ongoing monopoly/common carrier role of the
distribution function, the Commission must be aware of the "split incentive"
that 	may be created if distribution is unbundled from transmission and
generation. 	DSM, for instance,  that is cost-effective for a utility providing
bundled service 	(taking advantage of both T&amp;D and generation benefits of
DSM) may not  be 	cost-effective when evaluated solely as a generation
resource. T&amp;D  benefits of 	DSM typically account for between 10 and 30
percent of total avoided costs. 	Photovoltaic and storage resources may be
similarly disadvantaged if the 	incentive to invest in them is split between
unbundled services in a vertically 	disconnected industry.<p>
<p>
	The Commission might consider the model of DSM investment by Minnesota gas
distribution companies to address the split incentive problems and
operationalize DSM and renewable mandates. <p>
<p>
6. 	<B>Universal energy service</B>. IWLA and ME3 strongly support the
continued emphasis 	on universal service. The Commission should remain open to
creative methods 	of ensuring universal service, and should investigate methods
of ensuring 	universal service without relying on universal service
assessments.<p>
<p>
7. 	A<B>ttention to the needs of residential consumers.</B> IWLA and ME3
endorse the 	Commission's concern with addressing the unique aspects of
providing a basic 	necessity to residential consumers and low-income consumers
in particular. 	IWLA and ME3 wish to point out, however, that this principle
addresses only 	one of a number of restructuring scenarios - retail
competition. Since a cautious 	and step-wise approach to restructuring only
considers retail competition at the 	end of the process (or not at all, if the
potential benefits do not warrant the risks), 	IWLA and ME3 believe that this
principle should be modified to address a 	broader range of potential
restructuring scenarios. <p>
<p>
8. 	<B>Public participation.</B>  IWLA and ME3 applaud and endorse the
Commission's 	commitment to public participation in the restructuring process.
The		 	Commission needs to extend this principle beyond the decision-making
processes that lead to restructuring, however, and commit to public
participation 	and public scrutiny in any resulting structure. Public
participation is not only 	necessary in forming the new industry structure; it
is equally important as part of 	the output. Integrated Resource Planning (IRP)
is one example of how public	 	participation is incorporated into the existing
regulatory structure. A modified 	IRP process to allow public participation in
both transitional and ultimate 	industry structure will continue to ensure that
public goals are valued in the 	planning process and statutory goals are
attained. <p>
<p>
	As the Commission has noted in the past in its support of intervenor
compensation legislation, providing a means of funding public participation
increases the number and quality of public voices in the regulatory process.
The 	Commission should extend the principle of public participation to ensure
both 	the opportunity for public participation in the new regulatory structure
and the 	maintenance of public participation. <p>
<p>
9. 	<B>Performance standards. </B> IWLA and ME3 support the concept of
developing 	customer-based performance standards. Such standards are of
particular value as 	utilities cut costs to competitively position themselves
for potential retail 	competition, and in light of the industry's own
restructuring (the rash of mergers 	and consequent shedding and reorganizing of
staff).<p>
<p>
	Given the Commission's previous commitment (principle #5) to retaining a
distribution monopoly, IWLA and ME3 must note that most reliability problems,
including outages and power quality problems, stem from failure or overloading
of distribution system elements. Outage, power quality, and safety risks can
often be mitigated by investment in DSM, some renewable supply options, and
appropriate cogeneration. Such investments are historically not considered as
within the province of distribution planning, nor have they been part of a
meaningful risk diversification strategy for reliability concerns. Such
benefits 	may never be realized if the incentive to invest in DSM, renewables,
or 	cogeneration is split among different companies in a vertically
disintegrated 	industry. <p>
<p>
	Substantial research by EPRI and other utilities demonstrates the value of
both 	targeted DSM and appropriate renewable investment for transmission and
distribution planning. The most cost-effective utility investment to meet
performance standards will likely include investment in appropriate DSM,
renewables, and cogeneration, if the generation benefits of such resources are
also included in resource planning. <p>
<p>
10. <B> 	Fair and immediate treatment of transition costs.</B> IWLA and ME3
support reasonable 	sharing of costs, but are concerned that several principles
regarding transition 	costs should precede the treatment of such costs. First,
the Commission should 	consider transition costs in evaluating the potential
benefits of retail competition 	against the risks and costs posed by retail
competition. Transition costs or 	stranded investment is likely to be an issue
only in one restructuring scenario. As 	with several previous principles, IWLA
and ME3 note that retail competition is 	one of a number of restructuring
scenarios, that should only come about at the 	end of the Commission's
step-wise movement toward a restructured industry.<p>
<p>
	Second, IWLA and ME3 believe that the driving principle should be to first
identify reasonable transition costs, if any. The parties entering a
competitive 	market have substantial economic incentive to claim all uneconomic
investment 	as "stranded." More importantly to IWLA and ME3, however, is the
prospect that 	"stranded" investment may become a viable asset soon after being
written off as 	stranded. Coal and nuclear plants may be written off, at the
expense of 	ratepayers, only to resurface and displace other less polluting
resources. 	Generating plant that is "stranded" should be retired, not sold at
bargain 	basement prices to a subsidiary. <p>
<p>
	Finally, while sharing of transition costs is in theory equitable, IWLA and
ME3 	believe that any stranded costs must be assigned to departing customers so
that 	other customers are not forced to pay for not choosing to escape the
utility's 	embedded costs.<p>
<p>
11.	<B>Environmental improvement.</B> IWLA and ME3 strongly endorse the
Commission's 	commitment to improving environmental quality as part of
regulatory 	restructuring. IWLA and ME3 believe that such a commitment should
not, 	however, be limited to a "transition to a retail competitive market."
Retail 	competition is one possible endpoint for a regulatory restructuring
effort. If, 	however, the Commission determines that retail competition is not
warranted, 	IWLA and ME3 believe that the restructuring process should still
incorporate the 	improvement or retirement of generating plant with
environmental liabilities, 	and the development of clean and renewable
resources. <p>
<p>
12.  	<B>State participation in transmission planning.</B>  IWLA and ME3 concur
that 	Minnesota's interests and concerns with transmission planning warrant
participation and advocacy by state agencies. It must also be noted, however,
that the rash of proposed mergers are threatening the viability of most
regulatory authority in regard to transmission planning. Given that the
industry 	may soon be regional even in regard to intra-state retail
transmission planning, 	IWLA and ME3 recommend that the Commission consider
what regional forms 	of regulation might be available in which to advocate for
Minnesota's 	environment and the cost and reliability of Minnesota's retail
electric services.<p>
<p>
13. 	<B>Diverse portfolio of energy resources</B>.  IWLA and ME3 wholeheartedly
support the 	Commission's commitment to fuel and energy diversity, and the
research and 	development of new generation and delivery methods. IWLA and ME3
recommend, however, that the Commission commit to building in structural
mechanisms to make the commitment to state support for diversity a reality in a
restructured industry. The Commission should ensure that the restructured
regulatory processes achieve fuel diversity, incorporate U.S.  climate change
goals voluntarily agreed to by major Minnesota utilities, actively address
environmental degradation such as mercury  bio-accumulation, and mitigate
environmental  and economic risks to ratepayeers.  In its response to the
Lignite 	Energy Council's appeal of the Commission's Interim Externality
Values, the 	Commission supported the effort to "help focus attention on
alternative resource 	options that would allow utilities to avoid environmental
and economic risks 	associated with this emission (carbon diozide)."<p>
<p>
14. 	<B>A competitive state economy.</B>  IWLA and ME3 endorse the
Commission's 	commitment to promoting the state's economy and fostering
cost-effective in-	state energy resources. <p>
<p>
15.<B> Streamlined regulation</B>.  IWLA and ME3 are concerned that decreased
regulatory	 	oversight is a siren call. Little evidence supports the contention
that regulatory 	change leads to less regulation or oversight. The vast body of
anti-trust law and 	enormous regulatory bodies associated with other industries
operating in a 	"competitive" environment testify to the likelihood that
regulatory and industry 	restructuring changes regulation, but does not
"streamline" it. The competitive 	market provides incentives for efficiency,
but also provides incentives to 	predatory price, shift costs onto captive
market share, shift environmental risk to 	the public sector or to externalize
environmental costs altogether, enhance the 	value of existing investment (such
as coal and nuclear power plants) at the 	expense of new investment, and
leverage the mobility of capital against the 	immobility of labor. <p>
<p>
	The Commission should commit to an appropriate level of oversight, and should
evaluate the new regulatory costs of different restructuring scenarios when
determining whether the potential benefits of a restructured industry are
worthy 	of the potential risk and costs. <p>

<H2><P ALIGN=CENTER>Restructuring the Electric Industry<p>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>December 1995</P></H2><p>
<p>
<H3>Summary</H3> <p>
<p>
Over the past few year, competition at the wholesale level of the electric
industry has been increasing throughout the country, due primarily to
technological advances and to changes in federal laws and regulations.  Both
nationally and in Minnesota, state legislators and regulators are feeling
pressure from large industrial electricity customers and non-utility
electricity generators to restructure the electric industry to allow
competition at the retail level.<p>
<p>
This report analyzes and assesses the need for restructuring the electric
industry in Minnesota.<p>
<p>
<H4>1.  <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="restruct1.html">The Traditional Rationale for Regulation</A></H4><p>
<p>
The first chapter informs readers, perhaps unfamiliar with the issue, about the
traditional rationale for regulation.  It describes the structure of the
electric industry in Minnesota and the regulatory compact it presently operates
under.  The provision of electricity services has traditionally been considered
to exhibit the characteristics of a "natural monopoly."  In theory, a natural
monopoly exists in a market if one service provider in the market can serve
customers more efficiently than many competing service providers.  IN markets
exhibiting the characteristics of a natural monopoly, government intervention
in the form of regulation over a single firm is considered necessary to provide
the market discipline that competition cannot provide.<p>
<p>
However, some in the electric industry argue that the generation sector of
industry no longer exhibits the characteristics of a natural monopoly, thus
continued regulation of this sector may no longer be necessary.  As the
underlying economic rationale is perceived to be eroding, the calls for
deregulation and increased competition increase.<p>
<p>
<H4>2.  <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="restruct2.html">The Regulatory Context for Competition in the Electric Industry</A></H4><p>
<p>
The second chapter discusses the regulatory context for competition and the
steps that both the U.S. Congress and Minnesota have taken to encourage
wholesale competition.  For example, in Minnesota, regulators and the
legislature have introduces competition into the state's regulatory structure
by encouraging generation by non-utilities; authorizing utilities to offer
competitive rates to retain customers; and instituting competitive bidding for
new generation capacity.  Currently, both the Minnesota Public Utilities
Commission and the Minnesota Department of Public Service are looking into
potential models for restructuring the electric industry, among other issues.<p>
<p>
<p>
<H4>3.  <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="restruct3.html">A Discussion of Issues and Options</A></H4><p>
<p>
The third chapter discusses issues and options concerned with restructuring the
electric industry.  The issues defined and then briefly discussed are market
structure, stranded costs, obligation to serve, long-range planning, stranded
benefits, and unbundling.  The options that the Minnesota Legislature can
consider are then described with a set of pros and cons following each option.
The legislature can do nothing; it can provide a list of principles to guide
the agencies and the industry in restructuring the electric  energy system in
Minnesota;  or it can encourage wholesale competition in the region, either
directly or by instructing the MPUC to initiate an investigation into the
benefits of expanding the use of competitive bidding.  Finally, the legislature
could create an organized statewide generation pool, as well as a kind of
"stock exchange" for electricity; or it could allow at least some customers to
choose their electricity vendor (retail wheeling) instead of requiring them to
purchase power from the utility in their service area.<p>
<p>
<p>
<H4>4.  <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="restruct4.html">Performance-Based Regulation</A></H4><p>
<p>
The final chapter discusses replacing traditional cost-based regulation with
performance-based regulation, an idea of great interest to many engaged in the
restructuring debate.  Proponents of performance-based regulation argue that
cost-based regulation results in inefficiently operated utilities and inflated
prices to customers.  Performance-based regulation refers to a variety of
regulatory approaches that attempt to provide or enhance incentives for
utilities to operate more efficiently.<p>
<p>
However, others argue that a move to performance-based regulation, if such a
move is accompanied by a decrease in oversight of the utility by regulators,
could lead to severe abuses by utilities, such as a decline in quality of
service or inflated returns to the utility.<p>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"> 

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>ME3 Position on Retail Wheeling<BR>
October 15, 1996 </H2>	
<!-- Font Tag --><B><FONT SIZE=4>W</FONT></B>e oppose radical restructuring of the electricity industry as proposed by advocates of "retail wheeling". Instead, we seek environmental improvement and economic development through energy efficiency and renewable energy. <P>

Retail wheeling would increase pollution, reduce reliability, shift costs to small consumers, and eliminate energy efficiency and renewable energy progress. Retail wheeling masquerades as "customer choice", but customer choice is meaningless in an industry controlled by monopolies and oligopolies. Winners will be lawyers, lobbyists and middlemen, and the losers will be most customers and the environment. Instead of retail wheeling, our proposals improve wholesale competition while increasing opportunities for renewables. Minnesota has made great progress towards a sustainable energy future. We need to keep moving forward, instead of returning to a past that ignored energy efficiency and renewable power. Minnesota needs to "cap" pollution emissions as it "capped" nuclear waste in 1994. Now is the time to move to the technologies of the future. <P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Moving From Polluting Energy To Sustainable Energy</H2>

<B>Capping Pollution Levels and Cleaning Up Old Coal Plants</B><BR>
The oldest coal plants are the most polluting. They are exempt from the pollution standards for new plants, giving them an economic advantage over cleaner sources. To eliminate the unfair advantage for old coal plants operating in our communities, Minnesota should establish a total maximum level of allowable power plant emissions , and require that old plants meet the same pollution standards as new ones.<P>

<B>Continuously Increasing Renewable Power</B><BR>
To achieve environmental benefits and economic development in Minnesota, we support a policy requiring that a steadily increasing percentage of all our electricity come from sources of renewable power.<P>

<B>Energy Efficiency Programs</B><BR>
Current Minnesota law requires minimal utility investments in energy efficiency. This requirement must be a permanent commitment. Control of energy-saving programs must be independent of owners of electricity generation, to avoid conflicting interests.<P>

<B>Green" Pricing</B> <BR>
"Green pricing" (the idea that willing rate-payers should pay more for clean electricity) may help get innovative renewable pilot projects underway, but cannot replace a comprehensive policy aimed at creating strong renewables markets with multiple competitors. Everyone benefits, so everyone should participate in progress toward sustainable energy.<P>

<BR>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Consumer Protection & Cost-Shifting</H2>

<B>Prevent Unregulated Monopolies</B><BR>
No competitor should be allowed to gain market power in electricity markets. Market power means monopoly prices. Domination of the market can be used to block new sources such as renewables from reaching customers.<P>

<B>Public Bail-Out of Utilities</B><BR>
No public bailout of utilities' bad investment decisions should be approved. Any calculation of so-called "stranded costs" must be offset by the increased value of power plants which become more economic as a result of regulatory changes.<P>

<B>Nuclear Power</B><BR>
Nuclear power poses enormous financial and environmental risks which are already largely borne by the public. The public has a right to know the full extent of these liabilities (such as the terms of the Westinghouse/NSP lawsuit settlement). Restructuring of the industry must not be used to further shift nuclear liabilities from private interests to the public. Minnesota's plan to gradually phase out nuclear power, as agreed to by lawmakers in 1994, is the right start. <P>

<B>Equity</B><BR>
Low-income Minnesotans are at risk of loss of service and higher cost. Equity and universal access in electric service are bedrock principles. Shifting of costs of service from industrial users to low-income communities must not be tolerated.<P>

<B>Legal Separation of Generation and Distribution Ownership</B><BR>
To prevent unfair control and manipulation of the system by the biggest utility, ownership of electricity generation assets must be legally separated from the ownership of the distribution system serving end users. To reduce the potential of gaming and unfair competition, there should be no affiliation of ownership interests between these two sectors.<P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Regulatory Reform</H2>
<B>Fair Prices Ð Full Cost</B><BR>
Improved rate flexibility for utilities and their industrial customers makes sense, but only if small residential and commercial customers can be guaranteed long-term rate caps. Otherwise, industrial costs will inevitably be shifted to small users. The full environmental cost of our electricity choices should be reflected in the price.<P>

<B>Public Participation in Planning</B> <BR>
Sensible reform requires improved efficiency and effectiveness of resource planning, certificate of need, and siting functions, but new processes must include meaningful public participation, including compensation for public interest intervenors.<P>

<html><head><title>Restructuring Position Paper:  Stranded Costs</title></head><!-- Body Tag --><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><H2>STRANDEDCOSTS:  A "BIGGER <BR>RIPOFF THAN THE S&amp;Ls"?</H2>Prepared for ME3 by Martha J. Hewett, Center for Energy and Environment, April, 1996<p><H3>What are "stranded costs"?</H3>In the policy debate about deregulation of the electric utility industry, therehas been a great deal of discussion about compensation of utility shareholdersfor  "stranded assets."  In this discussion, stranded assets are described asthe capital costs (depreciation and return on investment) for a generatingplant that cannot be fully recovered in a competitive market, because therevenue at the market price is less than total operating cost, including thecost of capital.  <p>The major driving force for deregulation of the electric utility industry is toreduce electricity prices.  Large industrial customers want to be able to buypower from any supplier precisely because the competitive market price will beless than the rate of return required to pay the full cost of power supplied bytheir current utilities.  The question is, who will pay for the utilities'resulting "stranded costs"?<p>The options are:<p><UL><LI>to write off these capital costs, that is, to make shareholders take theloss;<p><LI>to minimize the loss by improving the efficiency of utilities as businessentities, thereby reducing their overall operating costs;<LI>to redistribute these costs onto captive customers (i.e., residential andsmall commercial customers) who will not be able to buy power from competitivesuppliers until many years after large customers can do so;<LI>to distribute costs over all customers, through exit fees, transmission ordistribution surcharges, or other mechanisms;<LI>to distribute costs over all customers by delaying the transition to retailcompetition, to allow more time for capital recovery;<LI>to redistribute some of these costs onto the public sector throughnationalization of particularly uneconomic assets.</UL><p>Many utilities are claiming that because of the historical "regulatory compact"between shareholders and regulators, shareholders are owed full recovery ofthese costs and should not be required to accept any losses.  Large customersdo not want to pay stranded costs because it will delay the lower rates theywant from competition.  In the negotiation among Goliaths, captive customerscould be left holding a very large bag.<p>CEE believes that some utilities intend to use the "stranded cost" argument toshift large paper losses to ratepayers and shift problematic nuclear facilitiesto the public sector, while retaining for themselves the windfall profits fromlow cost plants that are the mirror image of "stranded costs."  In a fullycompetitive market, the true value of "stranded costs" in Minnesota would benegligible or even negative:  if anything, Minnesota utilities would owe moneyto ratepayers for the unexpected increase in value of assets, paid for byratepayers, that will arise from competition with expensive suppliers inmarkets like Chicago.  <p>Minnesota legislators and regulators have an obligation to the citizens ofMinnesota to assure that an unnecessary "stranded cost" bailout does not goforward.  Minnesota should say "NO" to recovery of stranded costs, and "NO" tothe portrayal of stranded costs as a legitimate bargaining chip in thederegulation process.<p><H3>The claim that the "regulatory compact" justifies shifting all so-called"stranded costs" to ratepayers doesn't hold water.</H3>Economist Robert Michaels points out that in the 220 years since Adam Smith,economists have never before invented the concept of stranded investment orproposed policies to deal with it.  In market-based economies, the shareholderseat the losses from bad business decisions.  Alfred Kahn (1994), former chairof the New York PSC, points out that "economic efficiency would be best servedby ignoring sunk costs and freeing utility companies to reduce their rates tomarginal costs to the extent necessary to meet competition."  Allowing recoveryof stranded costs would give the greatest reward to those utilities which madethe worst business decisions.<p>Many utilities claim that they are different, and that because of thehistorical "regulatory compact" between shareholders and regulators,shareholders are owed full recovery of these costs.  Because this claimprovides the entire rationale for recovery of stranded costs, it is importantto scrutinize it thoughtfully.<p>One of the common arguments is that because utilities have had an obligation toserve, all costs for capacity that they built to meet that obligation should befully recovered.  However, in a fully competitive market, simply owningcapacity does not create stranded costs; only owning capacity that costs morethan the market price creates stranded costs.  Therefore, recovery of strandedcosts in a fully competitive market should require utilities to show that "theservice obligation...forced the utility to use higher cost plants than it wouldotherwise have installed."  (Michaels 1994).  <p>One case where this might appear to be true on the face of things is wherespecific costs were incurred on orders by regulators.  The examples mostcommonly used in arguing for recovery of these costs are the high pricedpurchased power contracts that utilities in California and New York wereordered to sign with qualifying facilities under PURPA, based on regulators'overestimates of long run avoided costs.  Utilities have generally claimed thatsince they were forced to sign these contracts, they should be compensated forthem completely.  They calculate their stranded costs based on the assumptionthat without regulatory intervention,  they would have developed "an optimalsystem based on perfect foresight."  However, as Peter Bradford, former chairof the New York PSC and the Maine PUC points out, "their actual record duringthese years belies any assumption of perfect foresight in a world withoutPURPA... At best, the utilities were forecasting a future kW and kWh value10-15 percent below the [states'] adopted long-run avoided cost... Indeed,utilities trying to justify completing problem nuclear units were drivento...adopt figures at least as high as the states'. [Therefore], the utility'sown build or buy decisions would still have caused at least 75 percent of theactual...problem."  Likewise, utilities were forecasting load growth andcalling on regulators to approve construction of plants which, had they beenapproved, would be facing stranding today.<p>Another frequent argument is that stranded costs should be fully recoveredbecause regulators determined at the time that they were prudently incurred.But as Bradford says, "the proposition that regulators, as society'srepresentatives, have blessed as `prudent' every dollar of investment notspecifically disallowed, and must therefore assure full recovery of this moneyas part of a transition to competition..." is silly and naive.  Utilityregulation has a long history nationwide of either being grossly underfunded toconduct a thoroughgoing review of all utility investment, or being largelycontrolled by cozy relationships with the utilities.  It is ridiculous to claimthat utilities have been relying on prudency review to determine whetherparticular generation investments were a wise business decision.  <p>An additional argument commonly used for recovery of stranded costs is thatutility shareholders have accepted low returns based on low risk, and wouldhave invested their money elsewhere without this low risk, so they are owed thereturns.  This argument is wrong on two counts.  First, a study by staff of theNational Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners shows that returns toelectric utility investors over the past 25 years have been as high as orhigher than those to other industrial investors.  "This makes it hard to arguethat electric utility investors have not been adequately compensated"(Bradford 1995).  Second, the prospect of competition has not in fact taken theutility industry by surprise.  It has been discussed in trade publications forthe last decade.  And significant regulatory disallowances occurred even in the1970s, so, as Bradford says, "Not a single dollar invested (or left ininvestment) in an electric utility after 1980 came in justifiable ignorance ofthe possibility that it might not be recovered."<p>In summary, the argument that the regulatory compact justifies shifting allstranded costs to ratepayers doesn't hold water.  In a fully competitiveenvironment, utilites could at the very most claim compensation only for caseswhere they were forced to use higher cost plants than they can documentthat they would have chosen without regulatory oversight.  Even in this case,they cannot reasonably claim compensation for investments made after 1980, whendisallowances served notice on the investment community that utilities were nolonger a risk-free investment.  As Michaels says, "no other industry can tapwidows and orphans to undo $300 billion of retrospective mistakes."<p><H3>Utilities will use stranded costs as a business opportunity to shift aslarge paper losses as possible to someone else.</H3>Assuming for the moment that "stranded costs" are valid in concept, theiractual dollar value for a particular plant would be equal to the differencebetween the net present value of total future costs (including capital costsand uncertain future operating costs) and the net present value of total futurerevenues at competitive market prices.  Since these future costs and revenuesare unknowable, the valuation of stranded costs is a "shot in the dark at amoving target"  (Cearley and McKinzie 1995).  This creates an irresistableincentive for utilities to distort the valuation in their favor.<p>Any ratepayer who listens to the numbers thrown around in the stranded costdebate will realize that it's time to check his wallet.  The magnitude ofstranded cost estimates is on the order of $130 billion (Moody's, cited byIvins 1996) to $550 billion (ICF Kaiser, cited by Ivins 1996).  The latternumber, by the way, is bigger than the $500 billion bailout of the savings andloan industry.  Like the S&amp;L bailout, the so-called recovery of so-calledstranded costs has the potential to transfer enormous wealth from averagecitizens to a select group of individuals.  There is no question that manyinvestor-owned utilities will attempt to use stranded costs to rake in as muchmoney as possible.  As Dave Penn of the American Public Power Association hassaid, the IOUs need to "get real."  The total investment in the electricindustry is only $600 billion, the market value $250 to $300 billion, and thedepreciated book value only $175 to $190 billion (Penn, quoted by Maize 1994,and Black 1994).  Before getting out their checkbooks, ratepayers should askhow almost the entire value of the generating base in the country can suddenlybecome "stranded."<p>Utility applications to FERC for recovery of stranded investments and utilitycomments in response to a Public Utility Commission of Texas study of strandedcosts demonstrate that utilities intend to claim the entire lost revenue fromdeparting customers as stranded costs (Michaels 1994, Matlock 1995).  Thisimplies the dubious proposition that 100% of the capital value of the assetsserving these customers is unrecoverable.  Lost revenues have absolutely nonecessary relationship to stranded costs.<p>Minnesota legislators and regulators should view utility estimates of strandedcosts in the light of the utilities' obvious self-interest in inflating them.<p><H3>Utilities are strangely silent on the subject of the "stranded benefits"that will provide them with windfall profits.</H3>The transition to a competitive market creates "stranded benefits" as well as"stranded costs."  Stranded costs occur when revenues at the competitive marketprice cannot cover total costs (operating costs and capital costs).  In exactlythe same manner, stranded benefits occur when revenues at the competitivemarket price exceed total costs.  Utilities claim that in the former case,ratepayers should reimburse shareholders, but they have failed to mention thelatter case, leaving it to others to point out that stranded benefits cangenerate huge windfall profits for the utilities.  Many utilities own fullydepreciated generating plants that can generate power at total costs well belowthe market price, plants that were paid for with ratepayers' money.  There isabsolutely no conceptual distinction between stranded costs and strandedbenefits, only a different algebraic sign that affects whether the wealth flowsfrom ratepayers to shareholders or the reverse.  "Customers should becompensated for their lost benefits, just as investors should be compensatedfor their stranded costs.  If regulators allow a utility to recover strandedcosts only and do not consider the potential stranded benefits, then, ineffect, the utility is allowed to receive the protection of regulation as wellas the benefits of the free market.  Customers, on the other hand, pay thecosts of the regulated asset when the costs are high and never receive thebenefits of the lower price when the asset becomes fully depreciated.  Instead,they pay a price equal to the marginal cost of a new asset in a free marketsituation" (Cearley and McKinzie 1995).<p>A report by staff of the Public Utilities Commission of Texas found that thebook value of the nuclear plants owned by four IOUs in Texas was a phenomenal$2700 to $4400/kW, compared with a top-end cost of $750/kW for a brand-newcombined cycle turbine.  Ignoring stranded benefits, the potential strandedcost from these plants could be $11 to $15 billion, which amounts to 45% toover 100% of the total common equity of these utilities.  But the reportconcluded that "These four utilities appear, however, to have enoughundervalued assets (in the form of highly depreciated non-nuclear generation)to largely offset or in some cases completely offset any stranded nuclearinvestment."  The utilities naturally argued that the estimates of strandedbenefits were way too high, and that stranded costs should be based on lostrevenue, anyway (Matlock 1995).<p>Lawyer Bernard Black (1994) describes retail competition as giving utilitiesthe "ability to recover sunk costs from customers, especially small customers,during the transition period; [and the] opportunity... to form unregulatedsubsidiaries that can compete in the service territories of other utilities andkeep any above-market returns from doing so...The utility will do its best toload the sunk costs that it can no longer recover from large customers ontosmall, captive customers."  There is no question that utilities intend to usestranded costs to take ratepayers for a ride.  The question is, will Minnesotalegislators and regulators let them drive?<p>In a fully competitive market, the amount of so-called stranded costs will bevery unevenly distributed throughout the country, with the regions with thehighest electricity prices having the largest stranded assets.  All ofMinnesota's investor-owned utilities have industrial rates in the bottom halfof rates for the nation.  If anything, Minnesota's utilities stand to make akilling selling their low cost power to customers in traditionally high pricedmarkets.  In considering claims of "stranded costs," Minnesota legislators andregulators should be careful not to try to fix in Minnesota something that isonly broken in New York and California.  The Minnesota utilities own numeroushighly depreciated generating plants paid for by ratepayers that will be highlycompetitive in an open market; if anything, they may owe money to ratepayersfor the unexpected windfall profits they will make in a competitive market.<p><H3>Utilities intend to use the stranded cost argument to transfer futureresponsibility for their "safe, cheap, zero-emissions" nuclear facilities tothe public sector.</H3>Anyone who has been involved in energy policy in Minnesota for any length oftime knows that Minnesota utilities claim that nuclear power is safe, that thestorage and ultimate disposal of nuclear wastes will not be a problem, thatnuclear generation has no environmental externalities, and that nuclear poweris a valuable, low cost component of Minnesota's generation mix.<p>Yet there is widespread agreement that the bulk of the "stranded assets" in aderegulated utility industry will be nuclear plants (Sant and Naill 1994, Cohenand Kihm 1994, Kahn 1994).  When Britain privatized its electric powerindustry, it was unable to find buyers for the nuclear plants.  It is widelybelieved that there would be no buyers for nuclear plants if utilities in theU.S. were to attempt to divest them.  "Buyers would...require federal insuranceprotection to guarantee disposal of the plants' nuclear wastes anddecommissioning costs (no private investor is likely to be interested in takingon these risks)."  Proposals to nationalize nuclear power in the U.S. havealready been floated (Kahn 1994).  <p>It is ironic that an industry that has championed nuclear power over vociferousopposition for years, and has claimed that decommissioning and waste disposalare not a big concern and that nuclear power has no external environmentalcosts, is so eager to transfer these costs to the public in a competitiveenvironment.  It is estimated that underaccruals of funds for nucleardecommissioning costs nationwide could easily total $40 to $50 billion (Black1994).  Minnesota legislators should make sure that the costs of nucleardecommissioning and waste disposal in Minnesota are fully paid out of thewindfall profits from competition, not tranferred by slight of hand to thepublic or ratepayers.  "Stranded" nuclear costs would make recent corporatewelfare like the Target Center buyout look like pocket change.<p><H3>Utilities can significantly offset "stranded costs" by improving theeconomic efficiency of their operations.</H3>Roger Sant and Roger Naill, executives with AES, one of the largest independentpower producers in the world, have estimated that the overall cost ofelectricity in the U.S. could be reduced by 5 to 15%, or $15 billion per year,through efficient competitive operation (1994).  Others have estimated thepotential savings at 20 to 40%.  Utilities compensated on the basis ofcost-of-service have had little incentive to find these cost savings.  Undercompetitive pressure, utilities are asking regulators for performance-basedrates that will allow them to cut operating costs and retain some of thesavings for shareholders.  Minnesota legislators and regulators should assurethat any earnings from performance-based rates go first to pay off any claimedstranded costs.<p><H3>Large customers will attempt to bypass "stranded costs" even without retailcompetition.</H3>Nationwide, the largest utility customers are already attempting to use theirpolitical and market power to transfer "stranded costs" to others by securinglower rates for themselves.  One strategy they use is to propose toself-generate, and then accept an offer of flex rates or competitive rates fromtheir utility.  Another strategy to win rate concessions or switch to adifferent supplier is for large customers to attempt to convince a municipalityto form a new municipal utility that includes their plant, or to take advantageof obscure legal provisions to switch suppliers.  These piecemeal strategieshave been used in Minnesota, as well.  They are of particular concern because,if they succeed in idling part of a utility's capacity, they can in fact createreal stranded costs.  Even when utilities have assets that would have totalcosts below the market price in a truly competitive market, if there is nomarket and the capacity is idled, then its costs are indeed stranded.<p>Ron Matlock, a manager at the Public Utility Commission of Texas, describesutilities' reactive or pre-emptive redesign of rates and pricing as thecreation of stranded costs by "Chinese water torture."  Unless regulators arewatchful, the accumulation of competitive rate agreements and pre-emptivecreation of "innovative" rates will shift these stranded costs to captiveratepayers as surely as, if more slowly than, a transfer of stranded costsunder retail competition.<p>Minnesota regulators should review competitive rate proposals and "innovative"rate structures in the context of the overall impact on revenue allocation byclass and on equity of rates between classes and between customers within thecommercial and industrial classes.  Shareholders' should also accept a share ofresponsibility for decreased revenue from large customers.  The wealthtransfers inherent in changing rate designs and pricing are too significant tobe glibly approved on an incremental basis without an explicit policyevaluation of the cumulative impacts.<p><H3>Conclusion</H3>In summary:<p><UL><LI>The "regulatory compact" does not justify shifting all so-called "strandedcosts" to ratepayers.  The amount of "stranded costs" that can be legitimatelyclaimed based on the "regulatory compact" is only a small fraction of theamounts commonly proposed.<p><LI>The dollar value of "stranded costs" depends on many future factors that areunknowable today.  With estimates of "stranded costs" running as high as theentire first cost of utility investments, ratepayers should check theirwallets.  Minnesota legislators and regulators should recognize that theincentives for utilities to claim as large stranded costs as possible areirresistible.<p><LI>Deregulation will create "stranded benefits" as well as "stranded costs."Stranded benefits are conceptually identical to stranded costs, but becausethey imply a flow of money in the opposite direction, from shareholders toratepayers, utilities have neglected to mention them.  Especially in stateswith low electricity costs like Minnesota, it is highly likely that strandedbenefits will exceed stranded costs.  Minnesota legislators should make surethat ratepayers are fully compensated for the windfall profits arising fromgenerating assets that they paid for.  They should resist utility efforts torecover stranded costs for some plants while keeping the windfall profits fromothers, and look at the net value of all generating assets.<p><LI>Nuclear power is widely considered to account for the bulk of strandedassets, based on both the high cost of the plants and the liabilities ofdecommissioning, fuel reprocessing and waste disposal. Minnesota legislatorsshould make sure that the costs of nuclear decommissioning and waste disposalin Minnesota are fully paid out of the windfall profits from competition, nottranferred by slight of hand to the public.<p><LI>Utilities are eager to increase their earnings through performance-basedrates. Improvements in performance will come primarily from eliminating excesscosts that were of little concern to utility executives under cost-based rates.Minnesota legislators and regulators should assure that any earnings fromperformance-based rates go first to pay off any claimed stranded costs.<p><LI>Large customers will attempt to use their political and market power totransfer "stranded costs" to others regardless of the course of deregulation.Minnesota regulators should review competitive rate proposals and "innovative"rate structures in the context of the overall impact on revenue allocation byclass.  Shareholders' should also accept a share of responsibility fordecreased revenue from large customers.  </UL><p>It is widely agreed that most of the real efficiency gains from deregulationcan be achieved through wholesale competition in bulk power production.  In anytransition to retail competition, the legislative and regulatory treatment of"stranded costs" has the potential to transfer enormous amounts of wealthbetween ratepayers and shareholders and between classes of ratepayers.  It isthe prospect of being on the receiving end of these transfers of wealth, andnot true wealth creation through increased productivity, that has sparked theinterest in retail competition.  In light of the intractable complexitiesinvolved in the valuation and allocation of "stranded costs," responsiblepublic policy requires a rational and orderly process to assure that the validclaims of all parties are treated fairly.  Minnesota has one of the lowest costelectric utility systems in the world.  We should not rush to implementinadequately considered fixes to a system that is broken somewhere else, whenit is not in fact broken in Minnesota.  Minnesota legislators and regulatorsshould take the time to craft a responsible public policy on stranded costs.<p>In the case of higher cost renewables utilities should have to prove that therewill be no market for them as higher priced "green" power required underresource procurement plans and that they have net stranded costs after weighingrenewables off against their stranded benefits.<p><H3>References</H3>Black, Bernard, 1994.

<H4>A.  INTRODUCTION</H4>
On February 16, 1995, the Commission directed Staff to develop the scope of an investigation of the structural and regulatory issues currently facing the electric industry. On April 20, 1995, Staff's recommendations came before the Commission, at which time the Commission determined the scope of the investigation and the basic procedure for the investigation. On May 8, 1995, the Commission initiated the investigation of the structural and regulatory issues currently facing the electric industry in Minnesota by requesting all investor-owned utilities to respond to a set of questions enumerated in Attachment A of its' May 8, 1995 order. The Commission also expressed it interest in the comments of all other interested parties. The comments which follow are in response to this expression of interest on the part of the Commission. The comments respond to selected questions posed in the Order.<P>

<H4>D. REQUEST FOR AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT</H4>
ME3 will argue herein that conditions in Minnesota do not warrant a radical restructuring or deregulation of the state's electric utility industry. However, other parties may propose and the Commission may consider, some  radical restructuring schemes. ME3 believes that such proposals, now under active consideration in other jurisdictions, would pose grave risks to the state's authority to enforce environmental regulations on generators or to compel development of non-polluting energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies.  <P>
Accordingly, ME3 strongly encourages the Commission to order the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), perhaps in conjunction with the instant investigation, but prior to adoption of any formal rules in this area. Authority for such an order can be found under the state's environmental policy act at Minn. Stat. Chapter 116D, which specifies the need for an EIS in any proposed agency action that might result in adverse environmental impacts. The Commission may wish to consult with the Environmental Quality Board as to the selection of the Responsible Governmental Unity before proceeding.<P>

<H4>E.   Need for Change</H4>
<I>1.Is there a need to change the current structure and regulation of Minnesota's electric industry?</I><P>
Many parties to this proceeding will argue that the elimination of the traditional system of monopoly and cost-of-service regulation is inevitable. ME3 is not convinced, however, that the trend towards largely unregulated competition is necessarily in the public interest. While we recognize that the current system has significant flaws which must be remedied, we also believe that unregulated competition poses serious technical and public policy questions that cannot be answered by a generic reference to the ability of "market forces" to provide solutions to the most vexing and complex of issues.<P>
ME3 does not challenge the proposition that the future is likely to bring more rather than less competition to the energy system. ME3 also believes that competition can offer a smart change for the better. At the present time, however, the driving force behind many proposed changes are large industrial customers seeking relief from high energy prices that have resulted from poor capital investment decisions by utilities. Particularly in states where stranded investments are very large, industrial energy prices are often uncompetitive and the pressure for restructuring is great. <P>
None of these conditions exist in Minnesota. The state's industrial rates are comparatively low, some low-income customers are offered discounted rates, and major utilities have comparatively few capital investments which are uneconomic. Minnesota is also poised to take advantage of very significant clean renewable development opportunities. In addition, resource planning which considers the full social costs combined with forecasted growth in demand gives Minnesota an even greater opportunity to diversify its resource portfolio.<P>
Given these conditions, ME3 urges the Commission to proceed cautiously in its efforts to restructure Minnesota's electric energy system. As stated above, it is clear that major elements of the current energy system are in need of significant reform and that Minnesota can benefit from improved competition in wholesale and electric generation. However, while we support reforms which lead to smart competition, we are opposed to radical restructuring driven by the needs and desires of specific companies seeking to gain greater control over particular markets. The profound differences between these two approaches to reform are easily demonstrated:<P>
<B>SMART COMPETITION</B><P>
More competition through bidding and small, diverse, and distributed generators.<P>
Stable, low electricity costs for everyone.<P>
Increased energy conservation through  supply-side and end-use efficiency.<P>
Cleaner, safer, and more diverse energy resources through resource planning and cost analysis that includes environmental costs.<P>
Excellent system reliability for routine and emergency back-up requirements.<P>
More research, demonstration and commercialization for sustainable energy development.<P>
Regulatory institutions and practices capable of articulating and implementing public policy goals and objectives. <P>
<B>RADICAL RESTRUCTURING</B><P>
Opportunity for domination of Midwest electricity by one utility.<P>
Small customers pay more now; everyone pays more later.<P>
Increase excess generation  and /or capacity shortages while conservation programs disappear.<P>
Residential and small commercial customers left to rely on oldest, dirtiest, least efficient and least diverse resource.<P>
Low-income customers left with uncertain access to affordable service.<P>
Reduced reliability because of cost and coordination difficulties.<P>
No one willing to invest in research, development and demonstration of efficiency and renewable technologies.<P>
No regulatory institutions capable of articulating or implementing public policy goals and objectives.<P>
The question that Minnesota must answer is how to restructure utility regulation and the generation, transmission and distribution of energy in a manner which obtains the potential benefits of greater competition while strengthening its commitment to environmental protection and social equity.<P>
<I>2.What are the advantages and disadvantages of various models moving from a more regulated, monopolistic structure to a less regulated (or unregulated) competitive structure? (For example, the advantages and disadvantages of vertically integrated monopoly service providers versus robust wholesale competition versus various forms of retail competition?)</I><P>
Commissions across the country are being asked to deal with a great number and variety of restructuring proposals. Despite this diversity, all of them share a common attribute: uncertainty about the consequences which will flow from their implementation. This is true for both the benefits and the costs of greater competition. Among the issues that must be addressed by any proposal are the following:<P>
(1)  the potential evolution of unregulated monopoly/oligopoly in response to competitive restructuring;<P>
(2)  vertical disintegration and the impact of nuclear power plants on utility competitiveness;<P>
(3)  the stranded investment dilemma;<P>
(4)  the role of long-term integrated resource planning;<P>
(5)  increasing barriers to conservation the diminution of environmental protection;<P>
(6)  obligation to serve and other distributional/equity issues; and<P>
(7)  loss of state jurisdictional authority.<P>
Many of these issues are discussed elsewhere in these Comments. Detailed comments are limited to the problems of market structure, vertical disintegration, and nuclear power plants.<P>
<B>The Evolution of Unregulated Monopoly or Oligopoly</B> <P>
As can be seen in the wholesale market, competition is not guaranteed by merely opening the market to all comers. The rush towards competition presents the possibility for an evolution to a system of unregulated oligopolies or even monopoly, particularly if the retail market is opened to highly competitive forces. Examples of this evolution can be observed even at the earliest stages of a more competitive environment. This is certainly true in the case of Minnesota and Wisconsin where two sizable electric utilities are attempting to merge. How does the merger of two large utilities contribute to greater competition?<P>
<B>Vertical Disintegration </B><P>
By extending competition to the retail level, vertical disintegration likely becomes necessary. Generation, transmission, distribution and energy services must be separated in order to set accurate prices for unbundled services in a competitive market, and to minimize the conflict of interest and potential gaming that would likely occur. In other words, generation companies would not be allowed to own transmission or distribution assets, and so on. This creates the problem of planning for appropriate levels of reliability, since traditional cooperation among vertically integrated utilities would likely not withstand competitive pressures.<P>
Vertical disintegration is particularly difficult in the case of nuclear power plants. To a great extent, those utilities with a high degree of "nuclear exposure" are most likely to be experiencing higher electricity prices. In a restructured environment, these utilities will try to shed such inefficient generating assets. Unfortunately, there are likely to be few buyers for nuclear power plants; even more worrisome, there are likely to be even fewer buyers who are competent to operate such complex technology. The uncertain costs of decommissioning and spent fuel disposal has also proven to be too much of a risk for other countries experimenting with competitive markets, as evidenced by the failure of the United Kingdom to privatize its nuclear industry. <P>
<I>3.What is the best electric industry and regulatory structure for the state of Minnesota?</I><P>
ME3's view of what constitutes the "best" utility and regulatory structure for the State of Minnesota continues to evolve as more and more of the complexities associated with restructuring become clear. As discussed in the preceding two questions, however, we are certain about at least two things. First, we draw a strong distinction between smart competition and radical restructuring. Second, any restructuring plan carries with it both benefits and costs. <P>
Because of the highly tentative nature of many restructuring proposals, ME3 defers comment on the "best electric industry and regulatory structure for the state of Minnesota." We offer instead a number of Principles which we think should guide the Commission in its deliberations about any proposal.<P>
<B>Principles for Any Restructuring of the Electric Industry</B><P>
The test of a good proposal is the extent to which it:<P>
(1)  guarantees universal access to electric service;<P>
(2)  equitably allocates all costs across all classes of ratepayers;<P>
(3)  provides guarantees against market domination by any corporation or utility while simultaneously offering assurance regarding the existence of many sellers, including small-scale  energy producers;<P>
(4)  maintains and strengthens Minnesota's commitment to  environmental protection and to long-range resource planning;<P>
(5)  expands investment in cost-effective conservation and renewable energy;<P>
(6)  provides strong protection against job loss and the erosion of  bargaining power, worker pay and benefit levels.<P>
(7)  ensures affordable or more affordable electric service for all customer classes in both the short- and long-term and offers meaningful choice to those customer classes;<P>
(8)  increases investment in low-income customer assistance and energy efficiency programs<P>
(9)  establishes high standards for customer service, including consumer protection measures;<P>
(10)  informs the general public of potential changes in the electric industry and encourages broad public participation through statewide public hearings;<P>
(11)  maintains safe and reliable service; and<P>
(12)  enhances and improves regulatory practices and assures that states will have the ability to pursue and achieve public policy goals and objectives.<P>
Many of these Principles are discussed in other parts of our Comments. Detailed discussion is provided only for those Principles not elsewhere discussed.<P>
<B>Equitably Allocate All Costs Across All Classes of Ratepayers </B><P>
In a fundamental way, this issue is a driving force in the debate. Residential and small commercial users have benefited from some protection within the present regulatory system. If market power alone determines the pricing of electricity, the rates experienced by small users will inevitably go up as competition accelerates for industrial customers with large and stabilizing loads. It is only fair that classes of low-income residential and government purchasers have equal access to low-cost and/or stable cost power supply.<P>
Equally important, energy markets can only send the correct signals to ratepayers when all costs of energy production including appropriately allocated environmnetal costs that are presently externalized, are included in the price ratepayers pay for electric utility services.<P>
<B>Provide Guarantees Against Market Domination by Any Corporation or Utility While Simultaneously Offering Assurance Regarding the Inclusion of Small-Scale Energy Producers </B><P>
Monopoly, oligopoly and monopsony all confer excessive market power on a few companies. Such power oftentimes leads to a corresponding inefficiency in the pricing of energy. Vigorous but fair competition is welcome in the wholesale market, but for any radical restructuring, wholesale buyers and transmitters must be totally indifferent to who owns the generation of the power they buy (or transmit). Similarly, the distributors of the power must also be indifferent to who owns the generation. <P>
The restructuring discussion in Minnesota must not be driven by the proposed merger of two utilities well-positioned for market domination. In addition, small-scale producers of electricity must have ample opportunity in the market, especially providers capable of generating environmentally-benign electricity having long-term price stability.<P>
<B>Ensure Affordable or More Affordable Electric Service for All Customer Classes in Both the Short- and Long-Term </B><P>
Keeping electricity affordable in the long-term is a primary responsibility of the regulatory system. Any proposed price decrease through efficiency must be demonstrable; short-term rate freezes are no substitute for long-term price stability. If short-term competitive pricing drives the market, many investment decisions will err in favor of energy which is cheap now, but which may pose great risks to the consumer due to future escalation of fuel prices or future changes in environmental regulation. To avoid these imprudent investments, decisions must embody the full social costs of resource options, including the future risk of those costs being internalized in the price of energy.<P>
<B>Enhance and Improve Regulatory Practices While Assuring That States Will Have the Ability to Pursue and Achieve Public Policy Goals and Objectives  </B><P>
Radical restructuring will likely entail a significant reduction in state-level regulation and a parallel increase in the responsibilities of FERC. ME3 questions whether or not the loss of state autonomy, or more precisely, the loss of a state's ability to creatively respond to clearly voiced public policy goals and objectives, is desirable.<P>

<H4>F.  Specific Issues Relating to Structural and Regulatory Change</H4>
<P>
<B>2.Technical Issues</B><P>
<I>a.What impact would electric utility restructuring have on system reliability? How would system reliability be managed?</I><P>
Reliability standards for generation and transmission are currently established by MAPP, an organization composed largely of utilities that voluntarily agree to plan and operate their facilities to meet an agreed upon level of reliability under a range of circumstances. MAPP does not include any independent power producers. There are concerns that increased wholesale competition would have an adverse effect on reliability because IPP's might not build and operate their facilities in a way that is consistent with regional standards. <P>
Retail competition would add several additional elements of uncertainty into the system planning process, including unexpected loss of load to competing suppliers and the extent of competing loads requiring transportation over the existing transmission and distribution system. It could also affect the joint planning and coordination of Minnesota's municipals, cooperatives and investor-owned utilities.<P>
<I>b.Who would be responsible for power quality in a restructured industry?</I><P>
In a more competitive industry, whether wholesale or retail, MAPP will likely no longer be adequate to ensure reliability. With MAPP, the utilities use, own and control access to transmission. In a restructured, or vertically disintegrated, power supply system, opportunities will be created for self dealing and the erection of access barriers to parties not owning or controlling access. <P>
Since 1993, MAPP has been exploring the formation of a Regional Transmission Group (RTG). The RTG would be responsible for transmission pricing, planning and reliability. Under the 1994 recommendation of the MAPP RTG Management Advisory Group, "public utility regulatory and environmental agencies with ratemaking or permitting, siting or similar authority related to transmission in the region would have the right to attend Management Committee and other committee meetings. State agency representatives would not be voting members of the Management Committee or of any other committee in order to protect their agencies' ability to regulate."<P>
 <P>
The question remains whether RTGs can self-regulate (subject to FERC oversight) without detracting from existing state authority, and what role state regulatory and other interested and affected parties will have. While it may be possible for an independent party, such as a Regional Transmission Group, to play a major role in assuring reliability, appropriate public agencies must retain regulatory control over a natural monopoly such as a transmission system.<P>
Even more problematic is how to achieve coordination among vertically disintegrated generators, transmission systems and distribution companies. While RTGs may be able to coordinate the actions of transmission companies, this solves only a small part of the problem. Currently, the integrated utility is able to reasonably gauge the number of new transmission lines they will require given forecasted demand and new generation. How this will be accomplished in a restructured environment, and under whose authority, has yet to be resolved. <P>
<B>3.Long-Range Planning</B><P>
Whatever one's view of the future electric utility industry, there will unquestionably be a need to maintain functions that are presently addressed through Minnesota's Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) process. These necessary functions include the balancing of supply and demand resources, transmission and distribution planning, load forecasting, pricing, reliability, commitments to energy efficiency and renewable energy sources, environmental protection, and public involvement in decisions affecting the public interest. Of particular concern to ME3 are the latter three functions that we feel are crucial to the future sustainability of Minnesota's energy supply. <P>
We are aware of arguments that, in a more competitive industry, utilities will be reluctant to share information to conduct planning that may hurt their competitive positions; and that pressures to reduce costs may cause utilities to substantially reduce commitments to DSM, renewables and environmental quality in whatever planning does take place. Utility inclinations along these lines only serve to increase the importance the Commission should attach to continued oversight in these areas through its IRP process. Of course, much depends on the type and degree of restructuring that actually occurs in Minnesota.<P>
The differences between a fully competitive wholesale market (which ME3 generally supports) and a deregulated market for retail customers (which ME3 fears would be disastrous for ratepayers and the environment) are enormous and require vastly different regulatory responses to maintain an effective IRP process. Without speculating about which outcome is most likely for Minnesota, ME3 offers the following thoughts on long-range planning issues raised in the Commission's order.<P>
<I>a.How would the benefits of resource portfolio management (i.e., the selection and purchasing of a combination of generating resources, purchased power and energy efficiency improvements that minimize the life-cycle cost and environmental impacts of energy services) be delivered in a restructured environment?</I><P>
The Commission's initiative to allow competitive bidding for new generation acquisitions has fundamentally changed the traditional portfolio management function. Instead of considering proposals for utility constructed, owned and operated generating plants, the commission now considers utility RFP's for power to be purchased from third party generators or utility affiliates, then approves contracts after an independently evaluated competitive bidding process has selected a "least cost" vendor. Even so, the commission must still ensure that the RFP balances the various planning concerns (i.e., price, reliability, environmental impacts, and resource diversity, including the state's preference for renewable energy). This process has already begun, and has the potential to ensure that Minnesota ratepayers are able to take advantage of emerging competition in the generation market, while continuing to enjoy the benefits of prudent portfolio management.<P>
More radical restructuring, however, may require more creative regulatory responses. The American Wind Energy Association, for example, has proposed a renewables portfolio standard-a market-based strategy to further the integration of renewables into the market. The AWEA proposal would require, as a condition of doing business in a state, that every power supplier (vertically-integrated utility, distribution-only utility, direct access supplier, or power aggregator) purchase a percentage of its energy needs from renewable resources. The percentage would be determined by the commission after considering Minnesota's current resource diversity, environmental protection and economic development goals, and other factors. Individual requirements could be made tradable so that every power supplier need not become a renewable energy developer and to allow the standard to be met in most flexible and cost-effective manner. Commission involvement would likely be limited to monitoring compliance and facilitating trading.<P>
AWEA's suggested approach is competitively neutral in that it applies to all competitors equally; it eliminates the need for government financing guarantees or utility contracts because the market can be expected to develop workable contracts; it would hedge fuel price and supply risks; it accounts for public goods such as clean air that cannot be captured by consumers; and it provides a predictable market for renewables, which will drive technology costs down rapidly. In addition, because the standard sets a floor rather than a ceiling, it allows power marketers to sell renewable energy to consumers wishing to exceed the standard. ME3 expects that, when faced with increasing competition, utilities will resist any type of obligation that could place them at even a slight disadvantage in short term markets that will not reward environmental benefits or risk mitigation. The portfolio standard, or some similar mechanism, would give the commission assurance that renewables, as well as other preferred resources, will be a valuable commodities in future markets by involving all power suppliers in contributing to a diverse resource portfolio for Minnesota.<P>
<I>b.What efforts, if any, should be made to perform long-term planning and minimize long-run costs, including environmental costs, under a model which includes retail competition?</I><P>
The Commission must maintain, at least during a transitional period, its authority to conduct long-range planning to minimize long-run costs, including environmental costs. Over time, these functions might appropriately be devolved to a regional planning authority, similar to those that already exist in the Pacific northwest and Tennessee Valley. Rather than superseding the commission's authority, a regional planning entity would be able to work with the commission and other state PUCs to more effectively plan generation and transmission investment and siting decisions by inter-state holding companies and small IPP's alike. This would be especially critical in a retail competition environment in which responsibility for region-wide stranded costs, resource diversity and environmental quality might otherwise be vague or nonexistent.<P>
<I>c.How would Research and Development be funded in a restructured industry? How would new technologies be developed, demonstrated and commercialized?</I><P>
An alternative to a renewables portfolio standard is now under discussion in California and New England. Some writers have coined the term "stranded benefits" to describe any utility investment in energy efficiency, renewables R&AMPD, or environmental protection that a utility avoids because it might have the effect of raising the direct cost of electricity. <P>
These writers argue that state regulators need a near-term strategy that can sustain utilities' progress on crucial long-term investments while the restructuring debate proceeds. They propose that cost recovery for such things as energy efficiency, low-income services, and renewables R&AMPD be converted to a non-bypassable, usage-based "system benefits charge" (sometimes referred to as a "wires charge") on electric distribution services. This would create a cost recovery structure capable of accommodating strong performance-based incentives, while maintaining consistency with all plausible restructuring options. Further, it would prevent distribution system users from bypassing their share of contributions to stranded benefits by designating a new electricity provider elsewhere on the grid. In this manner, the commission would retain the authority to assure cost recovery for investments that are crucial to sustaining high quality electric service.<P>
<B>4.Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy</B><P>
<I>a.How should energy efficiency be delivered in a restructured industry?</I><P>
<P>
Energy efficiency programs are currently mandated by a number of laws and regulatory practices. These mandates are justified on the basis of the different planning and payback horizons experienced by customers and utilities. That is, while consumers demand relatively short pay-back periods when they purchase energy-saving equipment, utilities can readily amortize the costs of efficiency measures over a much longer period of time. Energy efficiency measures therefore appear more desirable to utilities than to individual energy consumers. The result of these varying economic perspectives is that utilities have traditionally been seen as the logical vehicle for implementing energy efficiency policies. However, in an era in which the focus is limited to lowering costs experienced by the consumer, there is likely to be little support for energy efficiency. Even now, the mere threat of restructuring is causing utilities around the country to back away from their efficiency commitments, in that they are seen as inefficient when viewed from the very short run perspective that will likely dominate competitive retail markets. <P>
Our review of both the early experiences with more competitive environments and the likely impact that short-term planning will have on energy efficiency programs lead us to the same conclusion: the critical principle to be maintained in any restructured environment is that which was codified in Minnesota state law in 1983 and again in 1993. This law states that when new energy resources are needed renewables and energy efficiency should be used wherever possible. In fact, no non-renewable resource may be permitted unless it is demonstrated that the renewable alternative is not in the public interest. We strongly urge the Commission to continue to move forward with these principles adopted by the Minnesota Legislature. <P>
<I>b.In a restructured industry, what strategies should be used to overcome market barriers to cost-effective energy efficiency and renewable generation?</I><P>
After California, Minnesota leads the nation on implementing renewable energy development. Despite this relative level of development and despite the importance placed on renewables and efficiency by Minnesotans, and the reflection of that support in the actions of Minnesota legislators and regulators, Minnesota remains virtually totally dependent on fossil and nuclear fuels. Without explicit recognition of the local economic benefits and the environmental benefits of renewable energy and efficiency, fossil fuels will dominate our energy resources as they did before Minnesota enacted legislation and regulation to support renewables and efficiency. <P>
While Minnesota state law requires that energy efficiency and renewables have the first priority in resource development, the market will not follow this law on its own. In any restructured environment, strategies such as the inclusion of environmental externality values, set-aside policies, and preferential procurement policies in integrated resource planning will be needed to preserve and enhance our investments in renewable and efficiency-based resources. The rationale behind the tools used today to promote the development of clean reliable energy resources should not be abandoned, and the tools themselves should be improved in any restructuring environment.<P>
The inclusion of externality values will compensate for the inability of markets to effectively internalize the full social costs of energy production and use. Renewable fuels, such as wind, photovoltaics, and biomass, will be more competitive in a planning environment that weighs environmental costs and benefits along with fuel costs, capital, and operations and maintenance. <P>
Portfolio standards for renewables are critical for several reasons. First, they help to prove the cost-competitiveness of renewable technologies, as in the case of wind development projects on the Buffalo Ridge, which are now cheaper than coal and on par with natural gas, even without including external environmental costs. Second, portfolio standards are critical for new technologies specifically of interest and importance to Minnesota, such as biomass technologies. Such technologies need extra help at the commercialization stage, which set-asides can provide.<P>
<B>5.Public Interest Issues</B><P>
<I>a.Should universal service at reasonable rates be a goal in a restructured industry? How should this goal be achieved?</I><P>
ME3's positions on the public interest issues within this section have been developed based on significant input from the Energy CENTS Coalition, which ME3 recognizes an important voice for the energy concerns of low-income Minnesotans. <P>
Under the current system of electric industry regulation, utilities are obligated to serve all residential customers in their assigned territories.  This obligation is perhaps the most fundamental benefit of current regulation; movement away from this principle is likely to be one of the most significant changes in a more competitive industrial structure. Even when paying more than 15% of their income for utility service, low- and fixed-income people at least have the opportunity to purchase electricity. Particularly with recent programs designed to make electric service more affordable, the burden for some households is mitigated somewhat. Without the obligation to serve and affordable rate regulation, however, low- and fixed-income people may either be priced out of the market completely or have difficulty gaining access to service.<P>
The question of universal access is at the heart of this matter since the goals of current regulation and proposed changes seem incompatible. ME3 does not believe that universal service at reasonable rates is a goal of those parties that seek extensive competition in the electric industry. The absence of this goal means that low- and fixed-income people, while retaining the theoretical right to electric service, will not be offered the privilege of obtaining it. Minnesota regulated utilities must offer service regardless of ability to pay, at the very least, under most circumstances during the winter months.<P>
<I>c.How would public policy goals, such as cold-weather shut-off protection, the provision of affordable electric service to low-income customers, community economic development and the creation of a state renewable energy industry, be addressed in a restructured industry?</I><P>
ME3 agrees that restructuring presents a host of critical public policy issues, a great number of which are addressed elsewhere in these Comments. The following comments are directed at what we perceive to be the most important issues not addressed elsewhere.<P>
<B>i. Affordability</B><P>
Current statute allows the Commission to consider ability-to-pay as a factor in setting utility rates. Recent legislation calls for at least two pilot programs designed to assist low-income utility customers by offering utility rate discounts. Minnesota has just recently made significant progress in creating ways to address the problem of unaffordable utility service. In a deregulated electric industry, however, reasonable rate provisions and affordability programs have, at best, an uncertain future and, in the worst case, no future at all. <P>
While affordability is not explicitly addressed in current regulation, there are provisions which promote increased affordability through rate design. Under a deregulated system, neither access nor affordability is guaranteed. In fact, inability to afford the service may prohibit access. In a deregulated electric industry, affordability and access may be the same thing, particularly for low-income people.<P>
<B>ii. Customer Service</B><P>
Especially with unknowns surrounding the question of reliability, adequate levels of customer service are of particular importance. This would be particularly true under a deregulated system which allows for retail wheeling, in that customers who take power from an IPP would have no regulatory body for recourse if reliability is not adequate. Any alternative regulatory plan for the electric industry must therefore contain a customer service index that monitors key factors of customer satisfaction and service reliability, such as meter reading, outage restoration efficiency, call answer time at phone centers, and PUC complaint ratios. <P>
<B>iii. Low-Income Programs<P>
</B>Making utility bills more affordable will result in customer service efficiencies to utility companies, regularity in customer payments and service and the lessening of energy burdens on low-income people. Although not as widespread as they should be, Minnesota has enacted some of the solutions to the problem of unaffordable energy and these issues need to remain important considerations before the Commission. Unfortunately, in those areas of the country in which changes to the electric industry are further along, the prospects for continuing such programs are bleak. Indeed, without regulatory mandates, many of these programs, the primary goal for which was to make energy services more affordable, would never have been created.<P>
<I>d.Given that the generation and transmission of electricity can have adverse impacts on the environment, what is the best way to avoid or mitigate those impacts under a restructured industry?</I><P>
Over the last two decades a number of mechanisms have evolved which work against the traditional supply-side biases historically favored by utility planners. IRP and DSM programs, which put demand-side resources on a par with supply-side investments, have demonstrated their ability to identify cheaper energy resources and to encourage the development of least-cost renewable resources. As a result of the application of these tools Minnesota now finds itself far ahead of the nation in the development of non-polluting and cheap renewable resources. <P>
Unfortunately, these programs are now threatened by the advent of competitive energy systems. The reason for this threat lies in the mistaken presumption on the part of some energy producers that environmentally-sound investments represent a cost that cannot be afforded in a competitive world. Indeed, in those places where competition has either been integrated into the system or is on horizon, investments in DSM and other environmentally-conscious systems has declined. Market advocates dismiss the importance of these early experience with competition, arguing that, over the long haul, consumers will be allowed to make the decision as to whether or not they value "green energy". ME3 does not believe that "market-discipline" is an adequate basis for preserving and enhancing environmental quality. It is well established that significant market barriers exist which prevent energy prices from reflecting their full social costs. Equally significant barriers exist regarding the adoption of energy efficient technologies and practices on the part of both households and businesses. Indeed, it is precisely these barriers which have led Commissions to mandate the adoption of DSM and IRP.<P>
The importance of the Commission maintaining a proactive stance with respect to sound resource planning and environmnetal quality is shown in a recent report issued by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This report documents several likely responses on the part of Commissions when faced with increased pressures for deregulation and restructuring. One such scenario is "chaos", or a partially restructured industry where Commissions would only require historically-regulated utilities to comply with existing IRP/DSM and other public policy mandates rather than all new entrants into the energy system. Such a situation will undoubtedly lead to many parties making demands upon Commissions that they exempt all parties from such requirements, including "full-service" companies (i.e., existing utilities). ME3 views any movement in this direction as inviting significant harm for the operation of the electrical system, and in particular, for the maintenance of long-term environmental quality. Rather than retreating from traditional environmental concerns, the Commission should extend all public policy requirements to any entity which seeks to generate, transmit, or distribute energy to customers of any type. <P>
The continued use and refinement of the IRP process is a reasonable first step in assuring environmentally-conscious regulation within the context of a more competitive system. ME3 does not believe that the IRP process and competition are incompatible. Indeed, it is quite likely that more aggressive use of IRP can serve as an effective bridge to smart competition by making information on resources and their selection criteria available to all smaller, less powerful competitors in order that they might win market share. Thus, making IRP a more flexible tool can serve the interests of all parties. An important aspect of IRP's refinement is the competitive bidding process discussed in Section B(2)(c) above. The Commission should expand the scope of the process and reinforce the importance of the environmental criteria included in the selection process. The AWEA proposal discussed in Section B(2)(c) serves as a useful starting point for this effort.<P>
The Commission should also continue its efforts to assure that the full costs of energy of reflected in the price of energy. The Minnesota Legislature has required that the all environmental externalities be incorporated into the resource planning process. Retail competition should, however, not be allowed undermine this expressed public policy goal. In a fully disintegrated system, environmental damage is seldom experienced as a direct cost of doing business. As a result, no individual party has any incentive to include these costs in the price of a unit of electricity. In a system driven by the spot price of electricity, the additional price/cost increment required to account for human health effects, atmospheric damage, or mercury contamination associated with energy production and use is left out of the price signals delivered to the customer. ME3 urges the Commission to explore ways in which all parties in the energy system be accountable for the full costs of generating, transmitting and distributing their product in a more competitive environment.<P>
The ability to continue the successful development of policy tools capable of maintaining and enhancing environmental quality will depend upon the specific outcomes of the restructuring debate. ME3 does not believe that wholesale competition, by and large, threatens the environmental gains of the last two decades. It is our view, however, that the closer reform edges towards radical restructuring, the greater the likelihood for significant environmental harm. In the same vein, we believe that radical restructuring will undermine the State's ability to fashion effective tools in response to public policy goals and objectives.<P>

<H4>G.  Transition Issues </H4>
<P>
<B>1.Role of Regulation</B><P>
<I>a.What should be the role and responsibility of the Commission in managing change in the electric industry?</I><P>
The electric industry is already changing, and has been for the last decade of two. The Commission has addressed these changes (and even initiated some of them) by reviewing the state's goals and desired outcomes, and examining the best method to achieve them. While the pace of change may be accelerating, ME3 believes that the Commission's central role should remain the same: to manage this change in a deliberate and orderly fashion. As we stated at the beginning of these comments, while we are convinced of the need for change, we are not convinced that widespread social benefits will be attained under the proposals for radical restructuring.<P>
<B>2.Treatment of Stranded Costs and Other Transition Costs</B><P>
<I>a.In the move to a more competitive market, what costs in Minnesota are likely to be stranded? What is your estimate of the stranded costs for any or all of Minnesota's utilities?</I><P>
Past investments, power purchase contracts, and public policy-driven programs that made sense in a era of cost-of-service regulation may not be cost-effective in a competitive power market. However, these investments were determined to be prudent by the Public Utilities Commission at the time they were made, and were based upon anticipated customer demand. Although some stranded investments may be created with wholesale competition, it has been estimated that the vast majority of stranded investments occur at the retail level. Stranded investments could include:<P>
1.  Stranded assets, primarily inexpensive power plants and excess capacity;<P>
2.  Stranded liabilities, primarily in power purchase contracts and  deferred income taxes; and<P>
3.  Regulatory assets, whose value is based on regulatory decisions  rather than on market forces, including deferred expenses and  costs for DSM paid for by all customers, special programs for  low-income customers, and support for energy research and   development; and<P>
4.  Fuel contracts and other long term agreements.<P>
The level of stranded costs that will occur in Minnesota will depend on many factors, not the least of which is the form that restructuring ultimately takes. A 1995 Oak Ridge report on Stranded Investments estimates that under a scenario where only industrial customers were allowed to leave the system, stranded costs might exceed 55 percent of Minnesota utility equity.1 <P>
<I>b.What are the legal and economic bases for stranded cost recovery by utilities?</I><P>
The issue of stranded investments is complicated by several fundamental issues. First, how are the value of the stranded assets and/or costs to be calculated? Second, suppose one observes that certain generating assets are less valuable today than last year and that, simultaneously, one or more major customers have left the system during this period. But suppose also that certain exogenous changes have taken place, say a recession. How does one distinguish the effects of these changes relative the decline in the value of the assets? Finally, who is to be responsible for paying for assets that were built due to forecasted system demand in prior periods, particularly when specific demand sectors can be identified (i.e., large industrial customers who might have sought to have nuclear power facilities built in the past and who are now seeking to remove themselves from the burden of these plants)? <P>
 <P>
A Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) approved on March 29, 1995 by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) seeks to provide at least a partial answer to these questions. FERC established the principle that utilities are entitled to full recovery of legitimate and verifiable stranded costs at both the state and federal level. FERC stated that utilities may seek recovery through FERC-jurisdictional transmission rates.<P>
FERC also said that state's are expected to deal with any costs stranded due to retail wheeling or direct access programs. However, there is still much uncertainty over the difference between FERC's jurisdiction over transmission in interstate commerce and the state's jurisdiction over local distribution. The line that is drawn will determine what will come under the state's authority to assess stranded costs. We urge that the Commission continue to participate in FERC's rulemaking process in this matter to protect the interest of Minnesotans.<P>
<I>c.Is there an appropriate mechanism to allocate and recover stranded costs? If so, what is it?</I> <P>
Any mechanism chosen for recovery and allocation of stranded costs must be fair to all parties. In addition, no party should be allowed to avoid their share of an investment that they were at least partly responsible for.<P>
Three primary options for dealing with this problem have been discussed. The first is to offset revenue losses from customers leaving the system by raising rates for the remaining customers. This is inequitable, and has the additional problem of setting off the chain reaction of more customers leaving the system. Alternatively, rates could be left unchanged and investors would be forced to absorb the impact. This could seriously compromise the health of the utility before it even had a chance to compete. The third option is to attach a charge to all parties for their share of the recovery of those investments through some service that does not face competition-such as a transmission charge. The most equitable option to all concerned would likely be recovery through a transmission tariff. However, states may lack authority to set and collect transmission fees to pay for stranded investment or other programs.<P>

<P>

<H3>1.  The "Structure of Benefits" Associated With Radical Restructuring: Big Winners, Big Losers</H3>
The Comments offered in this docket reveal a number of "fault lines" that fundamentally divide the parties to the restructuring debate. Perhaps the most important of these divisions involves the degree of support for radical restructuring and the likelihood of immediate benefit that will be obtained from unregulated markets. While not universal, most commentators supporting the radical reform proposals were those positioned to gain domination over electricity markets, or achieve substantial financial gain.<P>
We argued in our Initial Comments that radical restructuring is being advanced by those parties who, by virtue of their market power, will be able to reap substantial economic benefit in a radically restructured environment. The Comments offered by the parties to this Docket demonstrate the legitimacy of our argument. <P>
The Comments offered by the Large Power Intervenors (LPI) are typical of those parties most likely to reap immediate benefit should radical restructuring occur. LPI first asserts that the "question is not whether Minnesota's electric industry must change . . . (but) how to change"(LPI at 3). Claiming that both utilities and customers "have chafed under the strictures imposed by regulation"(LPI at 3) and citing the advantages brought about by the tentative steps towards wholesale competition, LPI asserts that retail wheeling would also produce similar benefits. Indeed, the LPI sees no need for the State "to wait ... to implement competition at the retail level"(LPI at 7).<P>
The arguments made by LPI are flawed in several respects. First, LPI acknowledges that the present system of regulation has yielded substantial benefits, most notably in the form of reliable service and guaranteed, if relatively high, rates (LPI at 3). Minnesotans for an Energy-Efficient Economy (the ME3 Coalition) and the Izaak Walton League of America, Midwest Office (IWLA) agree that service has been reliable and rates guaranteed. However, the argument that large customers pay high rates in Minnesota is not supported by any facts. LPI seems to be alone in their assertion that rates have been relatively high since it is an almost universally agreed upon point of fact in the Comments that Minnesota's electric rates, including those charged to industrial consumers, are among the lowest in the nation.<P>
Second, LPI asserts that "retail wheeling would involve both benefits and costs. For at least for some consumers (retail wheeling) would mean a choice of suppliers and a range of prices"(LPI at 4). The ME3 Coalition and IWLA agree. However, it is our view that the structure of benefits and costs would follow a predictable pattern: those with market power of the sort possessed by users represented by LPI would realize the benefits of restructuring while those customers without market power would be left to bear the costs of restructuring.<P>
Third, the road to restructuring, according to LPI, the Minnesota Energy Consumers (again representing the largest users of electricity), the American Forest and Paper Association, National Steel Corporation, and Northern States Power involves a retreat from the most important energy policy initiatives of the last two decades. In their zeal for radical restructuring, the Minnesota Energy Consumers (MEC), for instance, assert that "several barriers to competition must be removed in order to achieve a competitive electric industry . . . (including) certificate of need for the construction of new generation; energy efficiency program mandates; renewable generation mandates; and taxes and assessments"(MEC at 5). The ME3 Coalition and the IWLA emphatically reject the assertion that these policy instruments constitute a barrier to the achievement of a socially-efficient energy system. <P>
The supporters of radical restructuring do not, however, limit their proposals for change to policy provisions that have been successful at preventing the construction of unnecessary and polluting generating resources or to regulatory tools designed to bring on-line competitively-priced pollution-free electricity resources. Instead, MEC and others seek to establish a new and radically-narrow framework for Minnesota's energy policy goals. According to MEC, "the goal should not be universal service at reasonable rates. . . Instead the goal should be consumer choice, with varying levels of price and reliability based on that choice." This represent an extreme view of what should be the policy goals governing the electricity industry: nowhere in the Comments is the fault line between public and private interest more clearly articulated. The extension of this logic is quite profound. For instance, would those receiving no service due to an inability to pay be exercising that "consumer choice"? The ME3 Coalition and IWLA do not believe that any responsible body, including the PUC or the Minnesota Legislature should reject the notion that every home should have electricity. <P>
Far from being in the public's interest, radical restructuring will primarily serve the particular interests of large industrial customers, but even for them perhaps only in the short run. In fact, in the long run, the increased demand for electricity will drive up the price for natural gas, resulting in higher prices for everyone. In our view, the decision to discard the fundamental goal of universal service in pursuit of the hypothetical (and oftentimes arguable) benefits of retail competition is near the heart of the debate. In its most severe form, radical restructuring will not only mean that households with high enough incomes will have a cafeteria of electricity options for which there is little consumer demand; it will mean that those without adequate incomes may simply be left to freeze in the dark. <P>

<H3>2.The Market as A Universal Solution</H3>
<P>
This proposed new "public interest" standard -that customer choice should be the only policy goal-  also substitutes for other existing goals like thoughtful long-range planning and environmental protection. As envisioned by LPI, MEC and others, radical restructuring assumes an unlimited capacity of unfettered markets to achieve the public's interest. According to this argument, regulators can safely ignore, among other things, the environmental consequences of energy production and the problems of assuring sufficient levels of costly research and development. Regulators can also abandon any mandates for Integrated Resource Planning, Demand Side Management, and energy efficiency and renewable energy. Instead, "truly competitive power supply markets" will (1) furnish sufficient incentives for power generators and suppliers to provide the most efficient and reliable power at costs demanded by the market; (2) allow a determination as to whether it is in producer's and consumer's best interests to minimize environmental damage; (3) allow short-term considerations to dictate whether it is in producer's best interests to engage in research and development of emerging clean technologies, such as biomass gasification and photovoltaics; (4) allow consumers to make environmentally sound decisions, again, assuming it in their best economic interests to do so; and (5) allow cost-effective efficiency and renewable resources to enter the market. <P>
The ME3 Coalition and IWLA do not dispute that a competitive market represents one kind of social choice mechanism which is well-suited to achieve certain social goals. However, not only is the range of tasks assigned in this case is truly heroic, it is highly problematic. First, the MEC, LPI and others presume that economic efficiency is the only basis upon which to make critical social judgments. We argue that public interest criteria, including that of universal electric service, environmental protection and resource diversity, represent more sound bases upon which to craft public policies. <P>
<P>
Second, the argument that a competitive market will address significant public interest issues seems to be willfully ignorant of basic principles of economics regarding barriers which inhibit competitive markets from adopting long-run socially-efficient measures. Far from being barriers to competitive markets, mandates and other social policies such as cold-weather shutoff policy or inclusion of environmental costs in resource selection, are responses to structural failures that prevent competitive markets from achieving long-run social efficiency. These principles were enunciated in our Initial Comments and have been even more thoroughly addressed by the Comments of the Attorney General.<P>
Finally, the ME3 Coalition and IWLA question whether or not deregulated energy markets will yield a result that even marginally resembles the kind of competition presumed by many of the parties. "Perfect competition" as an ideal type of market system presumes the existence of many small companies producing similar, price-differentiated products. Yet, early indications are that competition in the energy field will produce oligopoly or perhaps even monopoly. "Merger-mania" is not limited to Minnesota and Wisconsin, but is currently affecting electricity markets in all regions of the country: this summer, proposed mergers were announced between Philadelphia Electric Company and Philadelphia Power and Light; Union Electric and Central Illinois Public Service near St. Louis: and Southwesterrn Public Service Company and Public Service of Colorado. Mega-mergers of regulated monopolies promises to result in bigger and fewer "competitors" rather than diversity and differentiation among many small suppliers of electricity.<P>

<H3>3.  Loss of Portfolio Diversity Through DSM and Renewables under Radical Restructuring: Why Resource Planning Remains in the Public Interest</H3>
<P>
ME3's initial comments in this docket stressed the critical need to maintain the PUC's integrated resource planning (IRP) process to assure the future sustainability of Minnesota's energy supply. Commentators supporting what the ME3 Coalition and IWLA would describe as "radical restructuring" uniformly endorse the elimination of the current IRP process because, "the market will determine the type, timing and size of generation need based on price signals from the market"(NSP at 24). These proposals are particularly alarming; in their simplicity they overlook the public interest goals achieved through an effective IRP process, none of which are attainable through a singular reliance on competitive markets. <P>
Supporters of radical restructuring have not demonstrated, for example, how the market will act to assure the public that power plants will be built only when needed and using the least environmentally damaging fuels and technologies. Minnesota Energy Consumers suggests instead that "competition cannot exist if the need for additional electric generating facilities is governed by regulatory approval rather than customer demand"(MEC at 9). And NSP contends that, "resource acquisitions would be dictated by customer wishes" carried out by individual (read: large power) customers, or "aggregators." Some may equate the competitive process with the public interest; however, this equation offers no assurance that the public's interest will be served. <P>
 <P>
Indeed, it is unreasonable to expect that the largest buyers and sellers of power in a radically restructured market will attend to any interest other than near-term pricing. NSP suggests that 'aggregators' of power could package a mix of resources to a customer to market DSM and renewables. But why would an aggregator who hopes to stay in business offer such a mix when some of the benefits -such as clean air or mercury-free lakes- flow to society as a whole rather than any individual customer? Why too would an aggregator offer free-of-charge benefits to society when the extra value is unrecognized in the price paid by his customer? Even if the resulting price of a non-fossil fuel package were just one mil per kWh higher in cost than a fossil-fuel alternative, trusting large power customers to select even slightly higher cost power is a dangerous strategy for protecting the state's environment. For example, an industry such as wind energy, which appears capable of providing power over thirty years at 3.0-3.5&CENT/kWh, with negligible external environmental costs, could easily be driven out by the "customer choice" exercised by big industrials, who can find marginally cheaper gas-fired power for the short term. Clearly, loss of public participation and full-cost resource selection through IRP is an abandonment of the public's preferences and interests, in favor of private interests of big buyers and sellers who literally 'make' the market through buying power or market share. It is unfortunate that Minnesota competitors in global markets are focused on near-term costs, when key competitors such as Japan and European Union consistently plan for the long term. <P>
While the ME3 Coalition and IWLA anticipated the clear self-interest of NSP and large consumers, the comments of the Department of Public Service were especially troubling. While the Department seeks to position itself as an honest broker of the policy issues inherent in this debate, it has unfortunately adopted much of the rhetoric of radical deregulation and a commitment to retail wheeling, a stance to our knowledge unmatched by any state energy agency or regulatory commission in the nation.<P>
As the state agency charged with protecting the public's interest in energy, the Department avers that planning and competition are not mutually exclusive. The ME3 Coalition and IWLA agree in principle. However, we are surprised at the extension of this precept to a conclusion which is not sufficiently supported by Department analysis. The Department contends that while any remaining vertically-integrated utilities' plans for new generation should be subject to regulatory review (the Department makes no specific mention of IRP), for all other generators, "long term cost minimization will be market-driven"(DPS at 7). <P>
The Department correctly argues that efficient markets must recognize external environmental costs, but offers no conviction that this sine qua non of a true market can be reasonably implemented as part of restructuring reform. Their first proposal is to employ the allowance-trading scheme now in place to control sulfur dioxide emissions, and extend such a system to other emissions. After three years, the only successful component of the EPA's Acid Rain Program is the nationwide cap on emissions. Allowance trading has failed to materialize as most utilities have shown little interest in trading the marketable permits. Similarly, the Department contends that demand-side management and renewable-energy investments can be left to the market, except for customers of a "host" utility for whom regulators will set DSM investment levels. The ME3 Coalition and the IWLA seriously question NSP's argument that, "(e)nergy efficiency and renewables that are truly cost-effective should be able to compete with other options"(Emphasis added, NSP at 26). DPS's and NSP's facile belief in the power of a competitive market to do good ignores the fact that market failures have always prevented cost-effective DSM and renewables from coming to the market on their own. A competitive market for retail power does not remove these market failures; it exacerbates the failures by taking away regulatory authority to correct them. It is a troubling contradiction that the Department of Public Service fails to recognize market barriers to DSM and renewables in this docket, and yet remain committed to a "societal test" of cost-effectiveness in its review of CIP dockets. Neither does DPS reconcile contradictory views that electricity generators will "bear the full social costs of their actions" with the recommendation to move to full retail competition. DPS does not say how full-cost accounting and the societal test of cost-effectiveness can avoid being undermined in a pure retail market, other than to suggest that "(w)e will need to develop new ways"(DPS at 11).<P>
A market-driven system, for example, will not reverse decades of Federal subsidies to coal, natural gas and nuclear power that keep prices artificially low. A recent study by the Alliance to Save Energy calculated these subsidies to be $36 billion in 1989 alone. Competition, by itself, does not change the split incentives for renters and landlords to invest in energy efficiency, or overcome the high discount rates most consumers apply to energy-efficiency investments. And yet, society's interest is in seeing that energy-efficiency and renewable-energy investments do not disappear simply because competition is introduced in electricity markets. Society continues to prefer clean air to dirty air, lower costs of production to higher costs, and the technical capability to make the transition away from finite fuel resources. But nowhere do the supporters of radical restructuring make plausible arguments for the continuation of the benefits we all enjoy from IRP, DSM and renewables in their restructuring proposals.<P>
While the ME3 Coalition and the IWLA are skeptical of many of the Department's positions, we applaud their suggestion for fundamental changes in the pricing of energy. This is a laudable goal historically supported by the ME3 Coalition and IWLA. We have supported various policy instruments which enable a full-cost accounting of electricity resource options. We welcome the Department's views that internalization of now-externalized costs improve the efficiency of the market. Full internalization of social and environmental costs would be a major first step to correcting the most serious environmental damages of a fully deregulated market.<P>

<H3>4. Complete Reforms for Competition in Wholesale Market Before Consideration of Retail Competition </H3>
<B><BR>
</B>The various supporters of radical restructuring want to push the state toward competition at the retail level without evaluating whether we have even begun to reap the benefits of emerging competition at the wholesale level. As the Department correctly notes, efforts to capture the benefits of wholesale competition, such as competitive bidding for new generation, should be regarded as "work in progress"(DPS at 2). In contrast, National Steel argues that "the wholesale market is nearly as active as it can get, and retail competition through direct bilateral contracts is required to introduce any significant level of competition into the electric industry"(National Steel at 6). This assertion flies in the face of the preponderant weight of evidence. The activity on the wholesale market, and the diversity of entities using the market is rapidly increasing. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC') Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) on open access to the transmission grid is still in the early comment phase. This NOPR is designed to facilitate new wholesale transactions and competition. It is premature to say that the benefits of wholesale competition have been maximized before open access allows the complete and robust competition of multiple wholesale generators. In Minnesota, only NSP has a bidding system in place to access the emerging competitiveness of wholesale power markets.<P>
The Large Power Intervenors note that ". . . wholesale generation markets cannot be truly competitive until all investment and operational risk associated with generation is internalized to the owners of those facilities"(LPI at 8) The ME3 Coalition and IWLA find it curious that retail competition is considered by LPI to be an improvement, given that fewer of the external costs of electricity production will be internalized. Wholesale generation markets should first be made more efficient by internalizing environmental and social costs (including risk) before attempting to fix the much larger problems raised by retail competition. The existing regulatory apparatus, industry structure, and means of distributing benefits can partially internalize social costs and benefits through wholesale competition. The same cannot be said for retail competition.<P>
In addition, the ME3 Coalition and IWLA strongly caution the Commission that the public interest issues we have raised relative to retail competition are not close to being resolved. Yet National Steel points out that if Minnesota is the first state on the block to have retail wheeling, "many electricity intensive industries that depend on low cost power and that have been demanding direct access may consider expansion into Minnesota because of retail electric competition"(National Steel at 4). National's enthusiasm for new industrial development in Minnesota notwithstanding, the state may first want to consider whether enacting retail competition for the purpose of attracting energy-intensive "smokestack industries" is in the state's best interest. Consider that the future growth of the world's economy and the creation of high-paying jobs will be from clean industries, including high-technology, communications, and other high-value-added and information-based industries.<P>
The ME3 Coalition and IWLA believe that competition at the wholesale level has yet to deliver its potential benefits to Minnesota electric consumers. With significant excess capacity remaining in the region it seems likely that it will take years, even with open access transmission, for the remaining low cost power to find its way to consumers. A headlong rush to retail competition will only serve to allow large power customers to push their way to the head of the line for this cheap power. Even National Steel has to admit that, "large industrial customers stand to benefit the most from retail competition"(National Steel at 5). Retail competition is unlikely to fairly distribute costs and benefits of electricity production between customer classes.<P>

<H3>5.  Retaining Needed Regulatory Capacity to Meet Agreed-upon Policy Goals</H3>
</B><BR>
Given the public interest implications of greater competition in the electric industry, the ME3 Coalition and IWLA have argued that the Commission must retain its regulatory capacity to assure that the public's interests are truly protected. Proponents of radical restructuring argue instead for stripping the Commission of most of its real authority. Minnesota Energy Consumers typifies this position. It suggests that the Commission itself propose legislation this year to repeal statutes related to exclusive service territories, Certificate of Need for construction of new power plants, energy efficiency mandates (i.e. CIP), and renewable generation preferences. (MEC at 5). At the federal level, NSP asks the Commission to support repeal of PURPA (NSP at 15), the very statute that brought competition to wholesale electric markets, and that offers any opportunity to dispersed and renewable generators for finding a market niche. The only thing left within the Commission's jurisdiction would be rate setting at the local distribution level. Other commentators propose the elimination of the Commission's integrated resource planning authority, and the transfer of responsibility for "social programs"(e.g., CIP, cold weather shut-off protection, etc.). to a governmental agency to be named later. In other words, radical restructuring proponents want the Commission stripped of any meaningful ability to protect the public interest.<P>
The ME3 Coalition and IWLA have detailed elsewhere in our initial and reply comments the potential effect on system planning and the environment caused by the elimination of the Commission's IRP process. We have not discussed other difficulties, already experienced in other deregulated industries, that await Minnesota electric consumers. Without state-level IRP and ratemaking authority, the Commission will find it difficult to regulate the activities of existing and yet-to-be-formed multi-state holding companies. While NSP worries only about recovery of stranded costs and disparities in treatment of environmental costs from state to state, the Commission should be worried about how it will enforce a rational approach to capacity planning with a multi-state holding company like NSP's proposed Primergy. Other deregulated industries have also encountered severe problems in maintaining adequate customer service. There is a real danger that all-out efforts to be the lowest cost provider forces companies to sacrifice service maintenance operations first, particularly for those customers without market choice. It is unclear how the Commission's current authority to adjust service quality complaints will be effected by a move to retail competition.<P>

<H3>6.  Social and Environmental Costs of Electricity:  Characterization of Costs as Social Programs</H3>
<BR>
A number of commentators, including NSP, National Steel, and the Minnesota Energy Consumers, recommended eliminating "social programs" or "social goals" in the restructuring of electricity regulation. Included in the characterization of "social programs" were renewable-energy development and energy-efficiency investments, low-income affordability goals, and economic development issues. These commentators disingenuously argue that these goals will be met by the market, or more cynically, that government should take on these responsibilities. The above commentators would lead the Commission to believe that traditional regulation seeks merely to impose a variety of social costs upon private parties, i.e.. utilities and large customers and that retail competition is a means to properly readjust the cost structure. <P>
The environmental and social costs associated with public interest goals are not, however, eliminated in a retail competition scenario. The costs are shifted to someone else. In our view, the interest in retail competition is not cost-efficiency, but cost-avoidance. To say that the price of energy should not reflect real but unallocated environmental costs makes no more sense than saying that the price of steel should not reflect environmental protection, or that the price of lumber should not reflect sustainable forestry management. To say that the price of energy should not reflect costs such as lifeline rates for low-income users makes no more sense than saying the price of automobiles should not reflect the costs borne by the auto industry to minimize bad debt. <P>
By characterizing real costs as "social programs", the commentators trivialize important policy goals for the electric industry such as universal access, ensuring fuel and resource diversity, minimizing environmental risks which are potentially catastrophic and/or irreversible, and minimizing bad debt, collections, and reconnection fees. Calling these long-held policy goals "social programs" is an attempt to further externalize real costs from energy prices. Ensuring that our power mix includes efficiency and renewables, and proactively addressing social consequences of affordability through lifeline rates and shutoff moratoriums, recognizes that the real price of energy extends beyond the cost of capital and fuel and labor. <P>
Several parties point to a two-tiered energy supply market as a major concern under a partially-deregulated system. Minnegasco, for instance, hypothesizes that "in a more competitive environment, supply services for both electricity and natural gas will likely be provided by entities who are not subject to current state regulation,"(Minnegasco at 6). According to NSP, unregulated entities will enjoy a major competitive advantage in that they will be free of the cost burdens of "environmental, conservation, and social program(s)"(NSP at 13). Consequently, "(t)he Commission should examine the effect of . . .social programs . . . on the ability of electric utilities to compete with unregulated entities"(Minnesota Energy Consumers at 20). In our view, these recommendations constitute a prelude to total deregulation. Considered alongside MEC's urging the Commission to abandon its most substantive powers and NSP's suggested repeal of major PURPA provisions, the thrust of these proposals is nothing less than the wholesale abandonment of the public interest in the pricing and selling of electricity. Far from being a rationale for retail competition, the presence of a two-tiered energy supply system is an argument against moving to a retail competition environment, since the full costs of energy cannot reasonably be internalized under such a regime. <P>
Parties that characterize environmental and fuel diversity goals as "social programs" also assert that "(e)nvironmental impacts . . . have already been addressed in Minnesota's and the Federal government's environmental regulation laws." Minnesota Energy Consumers (at 18) fails to recognize the inability of the market to adequately address uncertainty. Environmental regulation addresses those risks we understand and have determined to be too high. Environmental regulation does not, however, address the extraordinary uncertainty associated with potentially catastrophic events. The typical response to uncertainty about catastrophic events such as global warming in an unregulated market is, "we don't know what the potential consequence are, but neither do our competitors, so we will ignore it." Only after the catastrophic event are the costs of such a strategy paid. Sustained orderly development of renewable energy capacity is, at a minimum, an effort to mitigate that uncertainty, an uncertainty which poses costs which cannot be effectively transferred to the market. <P>
Many of the parties calling for radical restructuring offer very little guidance on how broader public policy goals, such as the consideration of environmental costs, will be achieved in the absence currently available policy mechanisms. The Department of Public Service for instance, provides a self-contradictory argument on ensuring the continued incorporation of the full costs of energy in resource selection and rate setting. While supporting the existing public policy goals of environmental protection, shutoff protection, universal service, and affordability, DPS recommends moving toward a retail competition environment where existing mechanisms to achieve these goals will be entirely eliminated. At best, DPS makes a cavalier attempt to reconcile these contradictory views, never explaining how providers of generation service will "bear the full social costs of their actions"(DPS at 11) in a competitive retail environment. "We will need to develop new ways . . ." states DPS. Never does DPS adequately enunciate these potential new ways or grapple with the economic and/or policy implications of such mechanisms that require generators to "bear the full costs of their actions." It is especially ironic that DPS recommendations for retail competition likely will sweep away the policy instruments now used to address such social priorities, however inadequately.<P>
Finally, the suggestion made by several parties that "social programs" be shifted to government and funded through general revenues is disingenuous at best. Industrial and utility parties often accuse environmental interests of having the not-in-my-backyard syndrome (NIMBY). In advocating for government to cover social costs associated with energy, these commentators have fallen onto their own NIMBY refrain. "Yes, we need environmental and affordability protections," they say, "but not on my dime!" Self-interest in an unregulated environment will lead parties to try to escape paying legitimate costs associated with their energy consumption. In this era of massive downsizing of governmental programs, where protection of the environment and low-income citizens have been especially targeted for cuts, suggesting that these costs should be covered via new government programs and taxes is fundamentally an admission that the objectives should be eliminated.<P>
The Large Power Intervenors stated that "the risks associated with generation can never be fully allocated to shareholders as long as captive customers remain a ready repository for risk and cost shifting"(LPI at 8). The ME3 Coalition and IWLA suggest a corollary to this axiom: The risks associated with generation can never be properly allocated to the beneficiaries of that generation as long as those large power consumers can successfully shift those risks and costs to the government, regardless of the government's readiness to assume them.<P>

<H3>7.  A Full and Fair Consideration of the Issues:  Getting the Process Right.</H3>
<P>
The ME3 Coalition and the IWLA again renew their request that the Commission request the Environmental Quality Board to conduct a full environmental impact statement (EIS) on the very important environmental and resource conservation questions which are so obviously raised by the radical restructuring proposals of many parties commenting in this docket. Only a systematic review of the environmental impacts of the policy decisions to be made can fully inform the decision-makers. It is our reading of the EIS statute that a full EIS would be required for any serious evaluation of the environmental issues raised by the radical proposals advanced in this docket. An environmental impact statement, for example, has recently be completed in Wisconsin to evaluate the impacts of potential utility restructuring on Wisconsin's environment.<P>
Additionally, a contested-case hearing would be a useful forum to resolve the factual issues in dispute.<P>
Lastly, if any additional stakeholder forums are established for substantive policy discussions on these important matters, we would respectfully request an adequate representation of multiple public interest perspectives, as well as utilities other than IOUs. In the prior effort in this regard , the Chairman's Rountable which met intermittently from 1992-1994, only state agencies, investor-owned utilities and a sole representative of diverse public interest views were represented.<P>

<CENTER><H2>Chapter 1 <BR>The Traditional Rationale for Regulation</H2></CENTER>
Over the past few years, competition at the wholesale level of the electric
industry has been increasing throughout the country, due primarily to
technological advances and to changes in&nbsp;federal laws and regulations.
Both nationally and in Minnesota, state legislators and regulators are feeling
pressure from large industrial electricity customers and non-utility
electricity generators to restructure the electric industry to allow
competition at the retail level.<p>
<p>
This information brief series provides information for analyzing and assessing
the need for restructuring the electric industry in Minnesota.  This brief is
the first in the series.  The others are: <BR><BR>

<H2><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="structure">The Structure of the Minnesota Electric Industry</A></H2><p>
<p>
<p>
Traditionally, the electric industry provides three
functions--generation, transmission, and distribution.<p>
<p>
<b><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="generation">Generation</A></b> refers to the actual creation of electricity, which can be
generated using a number of methods and fuels, i.e. nuclear, coal, hydro, wind.
In Minnesota, generation is&nbsp;conducted by a number of entities, including
investor-owned utilities (IOUs), rural electric&nbsp;cooperatives (Co-ops), and
municipal electric utilities (Munis).  Large scale wholesale generators owned
by the federal government (such as the Western Area Power Administration) that
produce power for sale at subsidized rates for resale are another source of
electricity.  Wholesale generators known as non-utility generators (NUGs) or
independent power producers (IPPs) have also become important players in the
generation of electricity in Minnesota, and elsewhere.  Finally, some entities,
mostly large industrial companies, have developed the capacity to generate some
portion of their own electricity needs.<p>
<p>
<b><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="transmission">Transmission</A></b> refers to the delivery of electricity over perhaps long
distances at high voltage from a generation facility through a transmission
network usually to one or more distribution substations, where the electricity
is "stepped down" (the voltage is reduced) for distribution to residential,
commercial and industrial customers.  Transmission systems owned by individual
utilities are interconnected to form a transmission grid, which allows for
greater system reliability.  Both generation and transmission are generally
considered wholesale functions, but the costs for these functions are bundled
into the rates charged to retail customers, along with the costs of
distribution.<p>
<p>
<b><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Distribution">Distribution</A></b> involves the retail sale of electricity directly to
consumers.  In Minnesota, distribution is carried out by the electric
utilities--the IOUs, the Co-ops, and the Munis, within exclusive service
territories assigned to each utility by the Minnesota Public Utility Commission
(MPUC).<p>
<p>
In addition to these traditional functions, electric utilities provide
aggregation services.  Aggregation refers to the development and management of
a power portfolio which combines power from a variety of sources in order to
ensure the economic and reliable availability of power for the customers of the
aggregator.<p>
<p>
<H3><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="utilities">The Utilities</A></H3><p>
<p>
The five IOUs in Minnesota are "vertically integrated" utilities in that the
IOUs generate, transmit, and distribute their own electricity (in addition to
purchasing power from, and selling power to, others). The 47 Co-ops generate a
small amount of the power they distribute, but mostly purchase their power from
the seven generation and transmission cooperatives (G&amp;Ts) serving
Minnesota.  The 126 Munis in the state also generate a small amount of the
power they distribute to their customers, but, for the most part, purchase the
bulk of that power at wholesale from IOUs, G&amp;Ts or elsewhere.  IOUs account
for over 70 percent of retail electricity sales in Minnesota, with Co-ops and
Munis roughly splitting the remaining percentage of sales.<p>
<p>
IOUs are subject to rate regulation by the MPUC, whereas Munis and Co-ops are
not.  The municipal government oversees Muni rates.  Co-ops are held
accountable by their members for the rates they charge, but may elect to be
rate regulated by the MPUC.  Only one Co-op is currently rate regulated by the
MPUC.<p>
<p>
<H3><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="regulators">The Regulators</A></H3><p>
<p>
Utilities are regulated at various levels of government and by various
entities.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), in general,
regulates the rates, terms and conditions of the wholesale electricity sales,
as well as the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce.  State PUCs,
as well as municipalities and Co-op boards, are responsible for regulating
retail sales of electricity.  As noted above, Munis are regulated by local
municipal governments, and Co-ops are overseen by boards comprised of their
members.  The MPUC and the Minnesota Department of Public Service (MDPS)
comprehensively regulate the  activities of IOUs, as well as certain aspects of
Co-op and Muni operations.<p>
<p>
In Minnesota, two administrative agencies have responsibilities with regard to
the regulation of public utilities: the MPUC and the MDPS.  In addition, the
Office of the Minnesota Attorney General (OAG) also has responsibilities in
this area.<p>
<p>
The MPUC consists of five commissioners, appointed for six year terms by the
governor with the advice and consent of the state senate.  The commission's
duties are both "quasi-judicial" and "legislative."  The commission's
"quasi-judicial" functions are<p>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>the promulgation of all orders and directives of particular applicability
governing the conduct of the regulated persons or businesses, together with
procedures inherently judicial.  (Minn. Stat. [[section]] 216A.02, subd. 4)</BLOCKQUOTE><p>
<p>
Thus, the MPUC is an adjudicative or judicial body, and makes decisions with
regard to particular utilities in particular situations. <p>
<p>
In addition to the MPUC's quasi-judicial function, chapter 216A defines the
MPUC's legislative function as<p>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>the establishment and promulgation of all rules, orders, and directives of
general or particular applicability, governing the conduct of the regulated
persons or businesses, together with such investigative procedures as are
incident thereto and all other valid acts and procedures which are historically
or functionally legislative in character.  (Minn. Stat.
[[section]]&nbsp;216A.02, subd. 2)</BLOCKQUOTE><p>
<p>
Accordingly, the commission may establish rules, regulations and guidelines
that govern all regulated utilities.<p>
<p>
The MDPS is headed by a commissioner appointed by the governor for a term not
longer than the governor's term of office.  The role of the department is an
"administrative function."  As defined in Chapter 216A, the administrative
function means<p>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>all duties and procedures concerning the execution and enforcement of the laws,
rules, orders, directives, duties, and obligations imposed for the control and
government of the persons or businesses regulated, together with investigative
activities incident thereto and procedures inherently administrative or
executive in character.  (Minn. Stat. [[section]] 216A.02, subd. 3)</BLOCKQUOTE><p>
<p>
The department, then, is charged with executing and enforcing the obligations
imposed, either by the legislature or the MPUC, on utilities.  The MDPS also
intervenes in MPUC proceedings, advocating for the general public interest.<p>
<p>
The OAG provides both the MPUC and the MDPS with legal counsel and represents
those agencies in the discharge of their respective duties.  In addition, a
division of the OAG, the Residential and Small Business Utility Division (RUD)
intervenes in MPUC proceedings, advocating for the interests of residential and
small business utility customers.<p>
<p>
Other state and local agencies have regulatory responsibilities over utilities
as well.  For example, the Minnesota Environmental Quality Board oversees the
siting of large power plants and power lines, and the Minnesota Pollution
Control Agency regulates the air emissions from power plants.<p>
<p>
<p>
<!-- Horizontal Line Tag --><HR>
<p>
<H2><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="compact">The Regulatory Compact</A></H2><p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Within their service territories, the utilities essentially have a
monopoly on the provision of electricity.  No electricity may be sold to
customers within a utility's territory other than by that utility, except in
certain limited circumstances.  Minn. Stat. [[section]] 216B.40.<p>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In exchange for this monopoly, the utility assumes the obligation to serve each
customer within that service territory and to provide quality service at just
and reasonable rates.  Some consider this to be a "regulatory compact."  The
underlying rationale for this compact has both a legal and an economic
component.</BLOCKQUOTE><p>
<p>
<H3><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="legal">Legal Authority for the Regulation of Public Utilities</A></H3><p>
<p>
There is a long history in this country of subjecting private businesses to
public control.  Initially, the U.S. Supreme Court attempted to define a list
of businesses "affected with the&nbsp;public interest," thus subject to
regulation.  As spelled out by the U.S. Supreme Court in&nbsp;1877:<p>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When, therefore, one devotes his property to a use in which the public has an
interest, he, in effect, grants to the public an interest in that use, and must
submit to be controlled by the public for common good, to the extent of the
interest he has thus created.  <i>Munn v. Illinois</i>, 94 U.S. 113, 126
(1877).</BLOCKQUOTE><p>
<p>
Thus, the Court in <i>Munn</i> recognized a legislative policy which has been
implemented at both the state and federal levels--that certain goods are so
vital to the well-being of citizens that&nbsp;there must be some government
intervention to ensure their safe, adequate and nondiscriminatory delivery.<p>
<p>
However, in 1934, the Court abandoned the tedious task of delineating
businesses "affected with the public interest," in favor of a more general and
practical test.  In that year, the U.S. Supreme Court held that regulation of
any business is constitutionally acceptable, if the regulation is based on laws
that bear a reasonable relation to a proper legislative purpose, is&nbsp;not
arbitrary or discriminatory, and does not violate the requirements of due
process.  Nebbia v. New York, 291 U.S. 502 (1934).<p>
<p>
Thus, a review of the legal history of regulation reveals only that the
government, under the&nbsp;Nebbia test, has the authority to regulate
businesses.  Such a review does not provide a&nbsp;guide as to which businesses
government should regulate.  Economic theory provides one such guide.<p>
<p>
<H3><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="econ">Economic Rationale for the Regulatory Compact</A></H3><p>
<p>
The provision of electricity services has traditionally been considered to
exhibit the characteristics of a "natural monopoly."  In theory, a natural
monopoly exists in a market if&nbsp;one service provider in the market can
serve customers more efficiently than many competing service providers.  A
common explanation for electricity provision as a natural monopoly is that
allowing competitors to string duplicative transmission and distribution wires
and construct excess generation capacity would increase electric rates for
customers.  Minn. Stat. [[section]] 216B.01.<p>
<p>
Generally, the characteristics of a natural monopoly may include<a
href="restruct1_fn.html#fn0">[1]</a><p>
<p>
<!-- List Tag --><UL>
<LI>	a high upfront capital investment in technology<p>
<LI>	limited storability of the service or good provided<p>
<LI>	limited transportability, requiring operations in the vicinity of the end users (generally requiring a transmission network) and<p>
<LI>	cost advantages of large and integrated systems due to a better utilization of existing capacity (economies of coordination and density), or resulting from economies of scale and scope.<p>
</UL>
<p>
Economies of scale result when the per unit cost of production decreases as
more units are produced, thus providing a cost advantage to suppliers who can
produce more.  Economies of scope refer to technologies which allow a single
firm to jointly produce multiple services less expensively than multiple firms
producing those services separately.<p>
<p>
In markets exhibiting the characteristics of a natural monopoly, government
intervention in&nbsp;the form of regulation over a single firm is considered
necessary to provide the market discipline that competition cannot provide.
Thus, regulation is meant to mimic, to a large extent, the effect of
competition on the firm's behavior.  In the absence of regulation, the monopoly
firm will be able to exert market power and price its output high above its
costs. In addition, the firm may not utilize its resources in the most
efficient manner, and may  experience limited incentives to improve its
productivity through innovation.  Another rationale for regulation is that if
the monopoly is not protected through regulation, other firms may attempt to
enter the market, resulting in wasteful duplication of facilities.<p>
<p>
Traditionally, the electric industry has been considered to be a natural
monopoly. However, some in the electric industry argue that the generation
sector of the industry no longer exhibits the characteristics of a natural
monopoly.  In the past, generation plants exhibited one of the fundamental
characteristics of a natural monopoly, economies of scale, in that larger power
plants generated electricity at a lower cost than smaller plants.  However,
due&nbsp;to recent new technologies, this may no longer be uniformly true.
Smaller and more efficient generation facilities are being built to provide
power at the same or lower cost as the mammoth plants of twenty years ago.  In
addition, non-utility generation suppliers, spurred by both federal and state
laws, now compete to a limited extent with utilities to supply electricity. <p>
<p>
This is currently a widely discussed, but not universally accepted, argument.
Those who dispute this argument suggest those who push for deregulation must
demonstrate that the nature of the market has changed.<p>
<p>
It is generally maintained that distribution and transmission are still natural
monopolies, and that this fact is a barrier to full competition.  However, some
believe that this barrier can be mitigated by allowing competitors open access
to the transmission and distribution networks. As the underlying economic
rationale for regulation is perceived to be eroding, the calls for deregulation
and increased competition increase.<p>

<H2><P ALIGN=CENTER>Chapter 2 <BR> The Regulatory Context for<br>
Competition in the Electric Industry</P></H2><p>
<p>
Over the past few years, competition at the wholesale level of the electric
industry has been increasing throughout the country, due primarily to
technological advances and to changes in&nbsp;federal laws and regulations.
Both nationally and in Minnesota, state legislators and regulators are feeling
pressure from large industrial electricity customers and non-utility
electricity generators to restructure the electric industry to allow
competition at the retail level.<p>
<p>
This information brief series provides information for analyzing and assessing
the need for restructuring the electric industry in Minnesota.  This brief is
the second in the series.  The others are:  <p>

<p>
<!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Competition refers"><H3><B>Competition refers both to a process and a market structure.</B></H3></A><p>
<p>
Competition as process involves rivalry among firms for customers.  Usually,
this rivalry involves providing better service or a better price.  Competition
as a market structure requires that there be a number of comparable suppliers
in the market, as well as a number of comparable customers. <p>
<p>
By "comparable," economists mean that several suppliers of generally equal size
and market&nbsp;share participate in the market to serve several customers of
equivalent demand characteristics. Otherwise, either a dominant supplier or a
dominant customer can exert market power over the market, meaning the dominant
actor could raise prices without experiencing a decrease in revenues.  As a
result, the benefits of competition could not be realized.  These benefits
include<p>
<p>
<!-- List Tag --><UL TYPE=circle>
<LI> lower prices (or more technically correct, output prices approximating the marginal aggregate costs of inputs)<p>
<p>
<LI> a more efficient allocation of resources<p>
<p>
<LI>	increased innovation<p>
<p>
<LI> a better quality product or service<p>
</UL>
	<p>
It is important to recognize the distinction between the two uses of the term
"competition."  A market in which ten suppliers compete, but which has a
dominant supplier with 95 percent of the market, is not a competitive market,
even though the multitude of suppliers contend with one another for customers.
Likewise, a market with two or three comparable suppliers, each with equal
market shares, is generally not considered to be a competitive market.<p>
<p>
<!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Increased competition "><H3><B>Increased competition in the electric industry could occur at either the
wholesale or retail level of the market, or both.</B></H3></A><p>
<p>
<b><H3>The Wholesale Level</H3></b><p>
<p>
Some competition at the wholesale level exists under the current
regulatory structure.  Utilities may purchase power from wholesale electricity
generators, who may or may not be other utilities, for distribution to retail
customers.  Competition at this level will be further enhanced by open access
to transmission facilities owned by entities who are not parties to the
transaction. As access is increased, wholesale competition will become more
intense.  Some within the industry suggest that opportunities for competition
at this level could be encouraged without unnecessarily disrupting the current
regulatory and industry structure, thereby allowing the benefits of competition
to be realized with minimal disturbance to the status quo.<p>
<p>
<b><H3>The Retail Level</H3></b><p>
<p>
For competition to occur at the retail level, customers must be allowed
the option to choose their electricity supplier, instead of having to purchase
electricity from the utility which has&nbsp;been granted the exclusive service
territory in which the customer is located.  "Retail wheeling" or "direct
access" requires a fundamental shift in the way legislators, regulators,
providers and customers view the electric industry.  Fundamental concepts of
the electric industry in Minnesota, as elsewhere, such as the provision of
universal service and the maintenance of exclusive service territories, may
have to be re-assessed in such an environment.  As a result, changes in
Minnesota's legal and regulatory regime are necessary to implement retail
competition. Proponents of retail competition argue that its benefits cannot be
fully realized unless full retail competition is available.<p>
<p>
Currently, comprehensive competition at the retail level of the market does not
exist in Minnesota or elsewhere.   However, over 35 states are exploring costs
and benefits of retail competition in the electricity market.  Two state
legislatures--New Hampshire and Michigan--have ordered pilot programs to allow
limited retail wheeling.  Michigan, however, will not begin its retail wheeling
experiment until after the year 2000.  Other states, including Connecticut,
Illinois, Maine, New Mexico and New Hampshire, have created task forces to look
into the issue.  The Rhode Island Legislature passed two bills that  would have
allowed limited retail wheeling to occur but the governor vetoed the bills.<p>
<p>
In addition, several state PUCs have opened dockets into restructuring the
electric utility industry.  The Connecticut PUC has issued a draft decision,
finding that "industry restructuring" should precede the authorization of
retail competition.  In California, the PUC&nbsp;has issued two proposals for
comment, one which would encourage competition in the wholesale market, and one
that would allow retail wheeling.  Although the California PUC has issued both
proposals for comment, the commission voted three to one in favor of the
wholesale competition proposal.  The Wisconsin PUC will announce its
preliminary decision regarding restructuring in mid-December, and has brokered
an agreement with the key parties in that state not to seek any legislative
action with regard to restructuring in the 1996 legislative session.<p>

<!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Federal Regulatory"><H3><B>The Federal Regulatory Context for Competition</B></H3></A><p>
<p>
Since 1978, both the federal and Minnesota governments have taken steps to
encourage wholesale competition in the electric industry, both responding to
and creating forces for change in the industry.  This section summarizes
federal measures of the regulatory context for competition.<p>
<p>
<!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Public Utilities"><B>Public Utilities Regulatory Precedures Act of 1978</B></A><P>
<P>
Prior to the passage of the Public Utility Regulatory Procedures Act of 1978
(PURPA), the U.S. Supreme Court held that the Federal Power Act did not
authorize the Federal Power Commission, the administrative precursor to the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), to order wholesale wheeling, i.e.
access to transmit one's power through the transmission facilities of another
for sale to a third party at wholesale.  <i>Otter Tail Power Co.&nbsp;v. United
States</i>, 410 U.S. 366, 375-76 (1973). <p>
<p>
In 1978, Congress passed PURPA, which, among other things, attempted to address
competition in the wholesale electricity market by adding a new section,
section 211, to the&nbsp;Federal Power Act, and by stimulating the
establishment of a certain class of non-utility generators called "qualified
facilities" (QFs).  An upsurge in the number of other non-utility generators,
known as independent power producers (IPPs), closely followed the proliferation
of QFs in the wholesale market.<p>
<p>
<b>Section 211</b><p>
<p>
Section 211 purportedly gave FERC limited authority to order wholesale
wheeling. However, the FERC later determined that this authority was too
limited to have any effect; only one order was ever issued under this
section.<p>
<p>
<b>Qualifying Facilities</b><p>
<p>
On the other hand, the establishment of QFs had a substantial effect on
wholesale competition.  To qualify for this regulatory status, a non-utility
generator had to either be a cogeneration facility, or a small power producer
using specified energy sources such as biomass, geothermal, solar or wind.<p>
<p>
Once a facility acquired QF status, PURPA provided the QF with a guaranteed
market for its power by requiring the utility in whose territory the QF was
located to purchase the power produced by the QF at no more than the utility's
"avoided cost," i.e., the incremental cost to the utility to purchase or
produce the same amount of electricity.  QFs are also exempt from FERC rate
regulation; the rates and terms of QF contracts with their host utility are
approved by the state regulatory commission.<p>
<p>
In addition to the guaranteed market for their power, QFs were also exempted
from the restrictions of the Public Utility Holding Corporation Act of 1935
(PUHCA). PUHCA requires a holding company (defined as a company that "directly
or indirectly owns, controls, or holds with a power to vote, ten percent or
more of the outstanding voting securities of a public utility) to limit its
holdings to only those entities that are<p>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>consistent with the operation of an integrated public utility system and
reasonably incidental, or economically necessary or appropriate, to the
operation of an integrated public utility system.  15 United States Code 79K.<p></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Additionally, entities that are subject to PUHCA must register with the
Securities and&nbsp;Exchange Commission and submit to that commission's
oversight in a number of&nbsp;areas.<p>
<p>
<b>Independent Power Producers</b><p>
<p>
In addition to QFs, other non-utility generators, IPPs (as well as
wholesale power producers affiliated with a utility--APPs or affiliated power
producers), have managed to prosper in the years following the enactment of
PURPA.  Many entities found the size and type of energy requirements for QF
status too restrictive, and decided to forego the guaranteed market of QFs to
test the wholesale market for non-QF power.<p>
<p>
In the 1970s and early 1980s, electric utilities, anticipating a growth in
demand for electricity, built large generation facilities (many of them
nuclear).  They turned out to be unneeded.  Many of these capital investments
were determined by state PUCs to&nbsp;be imprudent investments which then had
to be written off (borne by utility shareholders rather than passed through to
customers).  Large-scale write-offs endangered the solvency of many utilities
and made utility managers industry-wide leery of making such capital
investments in the future.<p>
<p>
As a result of these write-offs, electric utilities that once saw IPPs as
unwanted interlopers now saw them as an opportunity to share the risk of
increasing generationcapacity.  Instead of building expensive facilities,
subject to imprudence determinations by state regulators, the electric
utilities could purchase power from&nbsp;IPPs.  And, unlike QFs, the electric
utility could purchase this power at negotiated rates. <p>
<p>
<!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Obstacles"><H3><B>Obstacles to Expansion of Competition</B></H3></A><p>
<p>
The growth in the number of QFs, IPPs and APPs, as well as the establishment of
competitive bidding for generation contracts, helped to erode the effective
monopoly the electric utilities possessed with regard to generation, and
provided additional impetus for competition throughout the industry. <p>
<p>
However, a number of obstacles remained in the way of further expanded
competition at the&nbsp;wholesale level.  One of these obstacles was PUHCA.
Although QF status garnered an exemption from the requirements of PUHCA, other
IPPs expended scarce resources to form intricate organizational structures to
avoid PUHCA's regulatory burden.  These structures are sometimes referred to as
"PUHCA pretzels," with their confusing institutional arrangements created to
avoid triggering the statute.  In addition to using up scarce resources, PUHCA
pretzels also made it more difficult for project proposals to receive
financing.  Lenders did not look with favor on the "fragmented ownership and
separation of ownership from operation control" characteristic of these
organizational structures.<a href="restruct2_fn.html#fn0">[1]</a><p>
<p>
Another obstacle to increased wholesale competition was the lack of
transmission access that IPPs faced when attempting to market their power
outside of the service area of their local utility.  As noted above, although
PURPA professed to give FERC the authority to order such access, this authority
was too restricted to be useful.<p>
<p>
<H3><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Act of 1992">Energy Policy Act of 1992</A></H3><p>
<p>
In 1992, Congress passed the Energy Policy Act (EPAct).  EPAct addressed the
two obstacles referred to above by exempting PUHCA requirements for certain
wholesale generators, and by amending section 211.<p>
<p>
<b>Exempt Wholesale Generators</b><p>
<p>
EPAct exempted another class (other than QFs) of IPPs from PUHCA.
Termed "exempt wholesale generators" (EWGs), an IPP that is engaged exclusively
in the business of owning or operating a facility used for the generation of
electric energy exclusively for sale at wholesale is exempt from the
requirements of PUHCA and the QF PURPA limitations.  15 U.S.C. 79z-5a.  Since
an EWG is not an electric utility company as defined by PUHCA, no part of that
statute applies to EWGs.  EWGs are, however, public utilities for the purposes
of the Federal Power Act, and are therefore subject to "regulation of rates and
charges for sales of electricity or leased capacity, tariff requirements, and
information reporting."<a href="restruct2_fn.html#fn0">[2]</a><p>
<p>
<b>Amended Section 211</b><p>
<p>
EPAct also amended section 211 to allow FERC substantially more
authority to order wholesale transmission access.  Section 211, as amended by
EPAct, authorizes any entity generating electric energy for sale at wholesale
to petition FERC to order a "transmitting utility" to provide wheeling
services.  A transmitting utility is defined as<p>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>any electric utility, qualifying cogeneration facility, qualifying small power
production facility, or Federal power marketing agency which owns or operates
electric transmission facilities which are used for the sale of electric energy
at wholesale.  16&nbsp;U.S.C. 796(23).<p></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
FERC is authorized to order such services, including the siting and
construction ("enlargement") of transmission capacity necessary to provide the
services requested by the petitioner.<p>
<p>
Under EPAct, FERC is only authorized to order transmission access for those
who&nbsp;petition the commission.  EPAct does not authorize FERC to order
general transmission access.  In addition, FERC is expressly prohibited from
requiring "the transmission of electric energy directly to an ultimate
consumer," i.e., retail wheeling.  16 U.S.C.  824k(h).<p>
<p>
<B><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="FERC"><H3><B>FERC Actions That Promote Competition</B></H3></A></B>
<p>
FERC has taken a number of actions to encourage competition in the wholesale
market.  These actions include:<p>
<p>
<!-- List Tag --><UL TYPE=circle>
<LI> authorizing of market-based rates<p>
<p>
<LI> issuing section 211 wheeling orders<p>
<p>
<LI> 	ordering open access transmission tariffs<p>
<p>
<LI> issuing the Open Access NOPR or "MegaNOPR"<p>
</UL>
<p>
<b>Market-Based Rates</b><p>
<p>
Market-based rates are those set by willing buyers of power.  This
method of setting rates may be used instead of the more traditional method, by
regulators pursuant to administrative proceedings with rates based on the costs
of producing the power.  Market-based rates, unlike cost-based rates, allow the
seller of power to retain the difference between the seller's cost of producing
the power and the price the buyer is willing to pay.  Market-based rates foster
the development of competitive bulk markets by allowing electricity generators
to respond quickly to market opportunities.<p>
<p>
FERC approves the use of market-based rates on a case-by-case basis.  FERC has
authorized market-based rates <b>only</b> where the commission determines<p>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>that the seller - electric utilities as well as non-utility generators - either
lacked power to influence price in the relevant market or had mitigated that
power in some fashion.<a href="restruct2_fn.html#fn0">[3]</a><p></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Thus, FERC's primary concern when considering each application for market-based
rates has been the power generator's ability to limit access to transmission
facilities, and thus, exert market power over that aspect of the power market.
The ownership or control of transmission facilities, according to FERC, is "the
most likely route to market power in today's electric utility industry . . ."
<i>Citizens Power &amp; Light Corporation</i>, 48 FERC [[paragraph]] 61,210 at
61,777 (1989).   Thus, initially, FERC favored authorizing market-based rates
only for IPPs.  FERC later extended the use of such rates to utilities,
provided the utility adequately mitigated any market power enjoyed by the
utility.<p>
<p>
<b>Section 211 Wheeling Orders</b><p>
<p>
As noted previously, EPAct authorized FERC to issue section 211 orders,
upon application, to&nbsp;require a transmitting utility to allow the use of
the utility's transmission facilities by a competitor.  FERC has utilized this
option as one tool to encourage competition in the bulk power market.  However,
the effectiveness of such orders to encourage competition in the wholesale
power market is reduced because section 211 orders are only applicable between
the utility and the competitor applying for access, and the process for
approving such an application takes time. <p>
<p>
Thus, FERC has found that section 211 orders alone are not adequate to
sufficiently open up the bulk power market to competition.  FERC has determined
that "open access transmission  tariffs" (see below) are preferable, in that
such tariffs have general applicability and result in more efficient and
immediate access than section 211 orders.  Therefore, FERC began to impose the
filing of such tariffs as a condition for the authorization of the use of
market-based rates, or for approval of a merger, consolidation or purchase of
public utilities, when FERC determined that open access to transmission
facilities was necessary to mitigate market&nbsp;power.<p>
<p>
<b>Open Access Transmission Tariffs</b><p>
<p>
Once open access transmission tariffs have been filed with FERC, others
may use the transmission facilities controlled by the power supplier to
transmit their power at the rates listed in the filed tariff.  This opens those
facilities to competitors and eases the transmission barrier power generators
face.<p>
<p>
In the past, open access transmission tariffs have allowed only what is known
as "point to point" service,  which involves "designated points of entry into
and exit from the transmitting utility's system, with a designated amount of
transfer capability at each point."  <i>El Paso Electric Company v.
Southwestern Public Service Company</i>, 68 FERC [[paragraph]] 61,182 at
61,926&nbsp;n.&nbsp;9&nbsp;(1994).<p>
<p>
However, in 1994, FERC held that point to point service was unduly
discriminatory and&nbsp;anticompetitive.  <i>American Electric Power Service
Corporation</i>, 67 FERC [[paragraph]] 61,317. Following that decision, FERC
now requires such open access transmission tariffs to adhere to&nbsp;what FERC
terms a "comparability standard."  This standard states that<p>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[A]n open access tariff that is not unduly discriminatory or anticompetitive
should offer third&nbsp;parties access on the same or comparable basis, and
under the same or comparable terms and conditions, as the transmission
provider's uses of the system.  AEP, 67 FERC [[paragraph]]&nbsp;61,317 at
61,490.<p></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Thus, currently, when FERC sees an opportunity to mitigate market power (thus,
encourage competition), FERC now requires the utility holding market power to
file an open access transmission tariff that allows competitors comparable use
of the utility's transmission facilities as the utility itself experiences.
Often, the comparability standard requires "network service" instead of point
to point service.  Network service is more similar to the access that the
controller or the owner of the transmission facilities enjoys, thus does more
to mitigate market power and encourage competition than does point to point
service.<p>
<p>
<b>The Open Access NOPR or "MegaNOPR"</b><p>
<p>
On March 29, 1995, FERC issued a controversial Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking entitled<p>
<p>
Promoting Wholesale Competition Through Open Access Non-discriminatory
Transmission Services by Public Utilities (Docket No. RM95-8-000) and Recovery
of Stranded Costs by Public Utilities and Transmitting Utilities (Docket No.
RM94-7-001), FERC Statutes and Regulations [[paragraph]] 32,514.<p>
<p>
Called the Mega-NOPR by some, this notice of proposed rulemaking indicated
FERC's intent to require all electric utilities to file non-discriminatory open
access transmission tariffs with the&nbsp;commission.  The Mega-NOPR outlined
FERC's proposal as well as the commission's authority to undertake this
rulemaking.<p>
<p>
Essentially, FERC proposes to require all electric utilities to file
non-discriminatory open access transmission tariffs which provide for both
point to point and network services.  FERC&nbsp;argues that it has the
authority to require such open access as a result of its charge under sections
205 and 206 of the Federal Power Act "to ensure that, with respect to any
transmission in interstate commerce or any sale of electric energy for resale
in interstate commerce by a public utility, no person is subject to any undue
prejudice or disadvantage." <i>Mega-NOPR</i> at 33,053.  FERC explains that<p>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Unless all public utilities are required to provide non-discriminatory open
access transmission, the ability to achieve full wholesale power competition,
and resulting consumer benefits, will&nbsp;be jeopardized.  If utilities are
allowed to discriminate in favor of their own generation resources at the
expense of providing access to others' lower cost generation resources by not
providing open access on fair terms, the transmission grid will be a patchwork
of open access transmission systems, systems with bilaterally negotiated
arrangements, and systems with transmission ordered under section 211.  Under
such a patchwork of transmission systems, sellers will not have access to
transmission on an equal basis, and some sellers will benefit at&nbsp;the
expense of others.  The ultimate loser will be the consumer.  <i>Mega-NOPR</i>
at 33,071.<p></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
The commission's authority to order industry-wide open access is the subject of
significant dispute and is certain to be the topic of much litigation, if FERC
decides to continue with this&nbsp;rulemaking. <p>
Additionally, public utilities will also be required to "functionally unbundle"
their power and&nbsp;services under this rulemaking.  Traditionally, the cost,
when power is purchased, includes the cost of generating, transmitting, and
distributing the power, as well as the cost of any ancillary services.  These
costs and services are functionally bundled, i.e. the purchaser pays one price
for the suite of services.  To functionally unbundle these costs and services,
the utility has to establish separate prices for generation, transmission,
distribution, and ancillary costs, so that a purchaser can shop around and pay
one entity for generating the power, another to transmit the power.
This&nbsp;is not "corporate unbundling" when utilities would have to establish
separate generation, transmission, and distribution entities, or sell off
assets associated with these functions.  FERC is expressly not requiring
corporate unbundling.  Unbundling is an important issue for state regulators
because it could remove a large amount of rate-setting authority from state
regulatory commissions and give this authority to FERC.<p>

<p>
Regulators and the legislature in Minnesota have consistently recognized the
benefits of competition in certain aspects of the electric utility industry and
have taken several steps in&nbsp;recent years to introduce competitive aspects
into the Minnesota regulatory structure.  These include:<p>
<p>
 <!-- List Tag --><UL TYPE=square>

</UL>
<p>
<B> <!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Non-Utility Generation">Non-Utility Generation</A></B><p>
<p>
In 1980, the legislature passed a bill implementing several aspects of PURPA
into the state regime.  Minn. Stat. [[section]] 216B.164.  As stated in that
law, <p>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This section shall at all times be construed in accordance with its intent to
give the maximum possible encouragement to cogeneration and small power</BLOCKQUOTE>
production consistent with protection of the ratepayers and the public.<p>
<p>
The statute details the process by which rates for interconnection and wheeling
of power are&nbsp;set by the MPUC.  In 1981, the legislature provided
additional encouragement to the construction of cogeneration facilities.  Minn.
Stat. [[section]] 216B.166.  These statutes embody early attempts by the state
to encourage, as PURPA did, certain non-utility generators to compete with the
state's utilities.<p>
<p>
<B> <!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Competitive Rates">Competitive Rates</A></B><p>
<p>
In 1990, the legislature enacted legislation allowing certain utilities in
certain cases to lower their rates for large industrial customers.  Minn. Stat.
[[section]] 216B.162.  The statute, passed in order to allow utilities to
respond to potential competition (and thus keep large customers from leaving
the utility's service grid), provides that <p>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>within its own assigned service territory, the utility, at its discretion and
using its best&nbsp;judgment at the time, may offer a competitive rate to a
customer subject to effective&nbsp;competition.<p></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Effective competition is defined as "a market situation in which an electric
utility serves a customer that . . .  has the ability to obtain its energy
requirements from an energy supplier" that is not rate regulated by the
commission. <p>
<p>
The commission is required to approve a competitive rate schedule when the
provision of service to a customer or a class of customers is subject to
effective competition, and the schedule applies only to customers requiring
electric service with a connected load of at least 2,000 kilowatts.   The
commission may approve a competitive rate schedule that applies to customers
requiring electric service with a connected load less than 2,000 kilowatts.
The legislature reaffirmed the effectiveness of this statute in the 1995
session, removing a provision that would have automatically repealed the
statute.<p>
<p>
<B><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Competitive Bidding">Competitive Bidding</A></B><p>
<p>
In 1993, the legislature authorized the MPUC to allow competitive bidding for
generation resources identified as needed by a utility's integrated resource
plan under Minn. Stat. <p>
[[section]] 216B.2422.  Each utility is required to develop a resource plan,
which is:<p>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>a set of resource options that a utility could use to meet the service needs of
its customers over a forecast period, including an explanation of the supply
and demand circumstances under which, and the extent to which, each resource
option would be used to meet those service needs.<p></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Subdivision 5 of this section allows a utility to "select resources to meet its
projected energy&nbsp;demand through a bidding process approved or established
by the commission."  The MPUC has ordered Northern States Power Company to
utilize competitive bidding for all new&nbsp;generation acquisitions.  As
discussed more fully in part three of this series, some proponents of wholesale
competition suggest that expanding the use of competitive bidding, together
with certain other measures, will enable the state to extract the full benefits
of wholesale competition.<p>

Currently, both the MPUC and the Minnesota Department of Public Service (MDPS)
are looking into the issues of competition in the electric industry, including
potential models for&nbsp;restructuring the industry.  In March 1995, the MPUC
instituted an investigatory docket entitled "In the Matter of an Investigation
into Structural and Regulatory Issues in the Electric Industry."  Docket
E-999/CI-95-135.  The commission is currently receiving comments from
interested parties.  The commission states that it hopes to achieve three main
goals through this investigation:<p>
<p>
<!-- List Tag --><OL>
<LI> to examine MPUC policies regarding electric utility regulation<p>
<p>
<LI>	to provide an opportunity for all stakeholders to discuss possible industry changes<p>
<p>
<LI> to inform the commission's position on these restructuring issues<p>
</OL>
<p>
On June 30, 1995, the department issued a "critical issues paper" entitled
"Competition in the&nbsp;Electric Industry: Policies to Serve the Public
Interest."  In this paper, the MDPS stated its position that "introducing
competition in the electric industry is pertinent and desirable."  The
department plans to hold workshops and meetings over the next 18 months, with
the&nbsp;goal&nbsp;of this process being "legislation that has general
consensus from most, if not all, stakeholders . . . "  The department sees this
as an informal process that will complement the&nbsp;MPUC's formal
investigation.<p>

A Discussion of Issues and Options</P></H2>
<p>
Over the past few years, competition at the wholesale level of the electric
industry has been increasing throughout the country, due primarily to
technological advances and to changes in&nbsp;federal laws and regulations.
Both nationally and in Minnesota, state legislators and regulators are feeling
pressure from large industrial electricity customers and non-utility
electricity generators to restructure the electric industry to allow
competition at the retail level.<p>
<p>
This information brief series provides information for analyzing and assessing
the need for restructuring the electric industry in Minnesota.  This brief is

<p>
<p>
Any consideration of whether and how to restructure or deregulate the
electric industry raises several issues.  This section discusses a few of those
issues.<p>
<p>
<B><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Market Structure">Market Structure</A></B><p>
<p>
Part two of this series explained how, in order for competitive forces to
effectively provide beneficial competition, the electricity market (or any
deregulated segment) must have a competitive market structure.  The market must
be able to support many comparable sellers competing to serve many comparable
buyers.  If a dominant seller or a dominant buyer emerges in the market and is
able to exert power over the market, the benefits of competition will be
reduced or perhaps negated.  Policymakers should ask what the expected
characteristics of a deregulated electric market will be.  For example:<p>
<p>
 <!-- List Tag --><UL TYPE=circle>
<LI>will the market have few or several suppliers?  <p>
<LI> what will their respective market shares be?  <p>
<LI> will a single buyer or class of buyers be able to dominate the market?  <p>
<LI> what regulatory or legal protections will exist to constrain the activities of market participants to allow a competitive marketplace to flourish?<p>
</UL>
<p>
If the structure of any deregulated portion of the electricity market cannot
support a competitive marketplace, then utility regulation may be able to
provide the "benefits of competition" in this market better than competition
itself.<p>
<p>
<B><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Stranded Costs">Stranded Costs</A></B><p>
<p>
Stranded costs, also known as stranded investments or transition costs, refer
to investments in assets and obligations rendered uneconomic in a competitive
market.  These costs may financially burden utilities and hamper their ability
to compete.  The utility will have to either write these investments off as a
loss or pass the costs on to former or current ratepayers in order to compete.
One such cost is investments in generation plants utilities have made in order
to serve the customers in their service territory, but which will not be needed
in a more competitive environment.  An ongoing and heated discussion concerns<p>
<p>
<!-- List Tag --><UL TYPE=circle>
<LI> the magnitude of these costs <p>
<LI> who should bear these costs if the industry is restructured.<p>
</UL>
<p>
Some argue that these costs in Minnesota should be relatively small, compared
with other states, and that costs should be even smaller if the utilities have
prudently planned for a transition.  Others argue that these costs will be
greater than expected if policymakers allow full retail competition over a
short time period.<p>
<p>
Who should bear these costs?  Some stress that the regulatory compact did not
guarantee utilities a profit, only the opportunity to make a profit.  The
utility and its shareholders were, or should have been, cognizant of the risk
of their investment.  As a result, they should bear the brunt of that risk.
Others, like the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), argue that these
investments were made in order to serve customers, with the expected
continuation of the current regulatory system.  Therefore, utilities should be
allowed to recover any prudently made investments stranded in the transition to
a restructured industry.<p>
<p>
<B><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Obligation to Serve">Obligation to Serve - Provider of Last Resort</A></B><p>
<p>
Currently, utilities are required by statute to serve all customers in their
service territory at just and reasonable rates.  In a deregulated industry,
suppliers will naturally prefer to serve consistently high volume customers in
order to maximize profits.  It is unclear who would choose to serve low volume
customers, such as residential or low-income customers, in a competitive
environment.  Electric service is as necessary to these customers as to any.
It will be important to determine whether and how to develop a structure that
will ensure service to all customer classes.<p>
<p>
Some economists are concerned that segmenting customer classes and serving them
separately could increase overall system costs.  The cost advantages for a
natural monopolist due to economies of scale, scope and coordination may be
minimized or negated.  Serving customer classes A and B together, as they have
traditionally been, may result in lower overall system costs compared to
serving A and B separately.<p>
<p>
<B><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Long-Range Planning">Long-Range Planning</A></B><p>
<p>
The present regulatory regime obligates utilities to plan for energy demand
with time horizons of 15 years or more.  In a more competitive environment,
some analysts suggest that utility planning horizons may shrink to a few years
due to increased emphasis on a quick return from capital investments.   Others
believe the problem will not be as great as some anticipate.  However,
understanding the public policy effects from a lack of long-range planning in
the electric industry will be another key issue.<p>
<p>
<B><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Stranded Benefits">Stranded Benefits - Public Purpose Programs</A></B><p>
<p>
In addition to stranded costs as a result of the transition to a restructured
industry, many expect there to be stranded benefits as well.  Stranded benefits
refer to public purpose programs that may be a burden to suppliers in a
competitive market.  Such programs include low-income discounts, demand-side
management and conservation, integrated resource and long-range planning,
economic development and research and development of new technologies.  Some
suppliers would prefer that these programs be provided and managed by a
government agency, rather than by utilities.  Policymakers will have to
determine whether and how to continue such programs in a competitive
environment.<p>
<p>
<B><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Unbundling">Unbundling - Corporate or Functional</A></B><p>
<p>
In order to protect customers from the exercise of residual market power,
policymakers may&nbsp;have to decide whether to require utilities to divest
themselves of their generation, transmission and/or distribution assets, or
whether the functional unbundling that may be required by FERC will suffice.
Unbundling is an important issue for state regulators because it may result in
state regulatory commissions losing a large amount of rate-setting authority to
FERC.<p>
<p>

<p>
The Minnesota Legislature has various options for restructuring the
electric industry.  This section lists some advantages and disadvantages of
five general alternatives.<p>
<p>
<!-- List Tag --><OL>
<LI> <!-- Anchor Link Tag --><A HREF="#Do Nothing">Do Nothing</A><p>

<LI> <!-- Anchor Link Tag --><A HREF="#Direct Access">Authorize Direct Access</A> (Retail Wheeling)<p>
</OL>
<p>
<B><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Do Nothing">Do Nothing</A></B><p>
<p>
In this case, doing nothing doesn't mean nothing gets done.  The FERC will be
finalizing and implementing its Open Access Transmission rulemaking (see
MegaNOPR discussion in Part 2).  This rulemaking is expected to have an
enormous impact on the wholesale power market.  In Minnesota, the Minnesota
Department of Public Service (MDPS) will continue its&nbsp;workshop discussions
on restructuring, and the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) will
continue its investigation into restructuring.  Both agencies expect to present
their ideas and recommendations to the legislature.<p>
<p>
In addition, the Mid-Continent Area Power Pool (MAPP), the power pool to which
the utilities of Minnesota, some other midwestern states, and a couple of
Canadian provinces belong, will continue a process to create a Regional
Transmission Group (RTG).  RTGs are a new creature in the utility industry.
They are expected to provide regional transmission system planning, pricing and
integration for its members.  Ideally, all participants in the midwest
wholesale power market, those needing transmission capacity, as well as those
who own or control such capacity, will be members of MAPP's RTG.  This will
increase access to transmission, thus increasing wholesale competition.<p>
<p>
Given this level of activity, the legislature may find it useful to monitor the
progress of these entities and await clearer policy options.  In addition,
other states with higher electricity rates and more dissatisfied customers are
moving ahead on restructuring.  Their mistakes and successes could be
instructive.<p>

This option would involve encouraging wholesale competition in the region,
either directly or by instructing the MPUC to initiate an investigation into
the benefits of expanding the&nbsp;use of competitive bidding, implementing
information technologies such as electronic bulletin boards, and utilizing
real-time cost and transaction information.  The use of such information and
technologies would facilitate the development of the wholesale power market by
minimizing transaction costs.  <p>

This option, which the California PUC favors, would create an organized
statewide generation pool, as well as a kind of "stock exchange" for
electricity.  All generation facilities of the pool's members would be placed
under the control of an independent system operator (ISO) that would match bids
to provide electricity with bids to purchase.  The ISO would manage the
dispatch of generation plants, putting the least-cost plants into service first
in order to minimize overall system costs.  Purchasers of electricity would
face an averaged system cost for the period, which would reflect the efforts of
the ISO to minimize costs.  All (or most) power generators in the state would
have to be members of the pool to maximize the economic and reliability
benefits.<p>

This alternative would allow at least some customers to choose their
electricity vendor, instead of requiring them to purchase power from the
utility in whose area the customer is located.  The native utility would
continue to serve those customers who do not choose to exercise this option.
Customers who choose to leave the current utility system would be allowed to
shop around for power that meets their needs in terms of price and reliability.
The option for customer choice could be phased in over time for different
classes of customers to minimize the disruption to the electricity system, or
allow for all customer classes at one time.<p>

Performance-Based Regulation<p></H3>
<p>
Over the past few years, competition at the wholesale level of the electric
industry has been increasing throughout the country, due primarily to
technological advances and to changes in&nbsp;federal laws and regulations.
Both nationally and in Minnesota, state legislators and regulators are feeling
pressure from large industrial electricity customers and non-utility
electricity generators to restructure the electric industry to allow
competition at the retail level.<p>

the need for restructuring the electric industry in Minnesota.  This brief is

  <p>
  <p>
  Many participants in the restructuring debate are calling for
replacing the use of traditional cost-based regulation with "performance-based
regulation<a href="restruct4_fn.html#fn0">[1]</a>" (PBR), either as a primary
restructuring proposal or as a tool to ease the transition to a more
competitive industry.  These participants argue that although regulation is
meant to mimic the disciplining effect of competition, it does not provide the
incentives for a utility to operate at maximum efficiency the way that
competition would.  PBR refers to regulatory efforts to restructure regulation
to provide more incentives to utilities for efficient operation.  <p>
<p>
The aim of cost-based regulation, also known as cost of service regulation or
rate of return regulation (ROR), is to ensure that utilities offer their
services at prices that are based on the cost of the services, rather than on
the value that customers place on those services.  In a monopoly market, absent
regulation, the utility would price its services at whatever the market would
bear, in order to serve the utility's private interest - maximizing profits.
Allowing this practice to go unregulated would result in unreasonably high
prices for electricity.  This would price many customers out of the market, a
violation of the universal service goal that policymakers have set for this
industry, as well as increase the cost of goods and services for which
electricity is an input.  <p>
<p>
In Minnesota, as elsewhere in the U.S., the rates for electricity have
traditionally been calculated using ROR regulation.  The goal of ROR regulation
is to balance "the public need for adequate, efficient, and reasonable service"
against "the need of the public utility for revenue sufficient to enable it to
meet the cost of furnishing the service . . ."  Minn. Stat.
[[section]]&nbsp;216B.16, subd. 6.<p>
<p>
In ROR regulation, a regulatory commission, such as the MPUC, undertakes an
administrative proceeding, known as a rate case.  It has three principal
steps.<p>
<p>
<!-- List Tag --><OL>
<LI> determine the revenue requirement, i.e. the cost of providing utility service<p>
<LI> allocate the requirement among customer classes<p>
<LI> translate the allocated revenue requirement into rates.<p>
</OL>
<p>
<B><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="From Revenue">From Revenue</A> Requirement to Rates</B><p>
<p>
The revenue requirement consists of the utility's expenses (based on a
test-year period) plus the cost of the capital invested and committed to
utility operations.  Minn. Stat. [[section]]&nbsp;216B.16, subd. 6.  The
utility's expenses include <p>
<!-- List Tag --><UL TYPE=circle>
<LI> operating expenses, such as wages and salaries, and maintenance costs<p>
<LI> annual depreciation on capital investments, such as generation facilities<p>
<LI> taxes, such as income and property taxes<p>
</UL>
<p>
In a rate case, these expenses are reviewed by the MPUC and may be "disallowed"
or not&nbsp;recognized as legitimate expenses for the provision of service.  If
the expenses are disallowed, they may not be passed on to customers in rates,
and must either be eliminated from the company's operations or be borne by the
utility's shareholders.<p>
<p>
The next step in estimating the revenue requirement is the determination of the
rate base.  The rate base is the capital upon which the utility is allowed to
receive a rate of return.  In calculating the rate base, the MPUC<p>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>shall give due consideration to evidence of the cost of the property when first
devoted to public use, to prudent acquisition cost to the public less
appropriate depreciation on each, to construction work in progress, to offsets
in the nature of capital provided by sources other than the investors, and to
other expenses of a capital nature.  Minn. Stat. [[section]] 216B.16,
subd.&nbsp;6.<p></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Thus, the rate base is a measure of the capital that a utility has committed to
the provision of its services, the vast majority of which is termed "plant in
service."  Plant in service refers to facilities "used and useful" for
rendering electricity service to the public.<p>
<p>
Upon determining the rate base, the MPUC must then calculate the allowable rate
of return on that capital, or as the concept is often stated, the opportunity
cost of the capital committed to utility service.  The opportunity cost of the
capital is measured by the opportunities lost by&nbsp;not investing those funds
in another activity.  Thus, the shareholders of a utility should receive a rate
of return that is equivalent to investments in similar risk categories.  <p>
<p>
Multiplying the allowed rate of return by the rate base results in the required
amount of return on that capital.  This amount added to the utility's expenses
is the total revenue requirement of the utility.  The revenue requirement is
then allocated among the various customer classes (e.g., residential,
commercial and industrial).  A rate is then designed for each customer class
which will allow the utility the opportunity to recover its revenue
requirement.<p>
<p>
<B><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Perceived Disadvantages">Perceived Disadvantages</A> of ROR Regulation</B><p>
<p>
Proponents of PBR argue that ROR regulation allows the utility and its
shareholders to pass on all of the utility's costs and risks to its ratepayers.
Because the utility has thus minimized the risks that it faces, the utility has
little or no incentive to increase its operating efficiency, or to minimize
expenses.  ROR regulation "fails to penalize efficient producers or reward
efficient ones."<a href="restruct4_fn.html#fn1">[2]</a>  Inefficiently
operating electric utilities cause a drag on the economy, resulting in a
decrease in social welfare and increased costs to ratepayers.  <p>
<p>
However, many people counter this argument by stating that ROR regulation
provides more incentives for efficient operation than its detractors
acknowledge.  For example, the authority of the MPUC to disallow utility
expenses provides an incentive to the utility to be efficient and prudent.  In
addition, the fact that a utility may be involved in a rate case to set its
rates only once every few years creates a "regulatory lag."  Because utility
rates are based on a past estimate of its expenses, the utility has an
incentive to minimize expenses between rate cases, thereby recouping the
difference between its estimated revenue requirements and its actual expenses.
Utilities successful at reducing costs between rate cases may even earn a
return higher than the rate of return set by the MPUC.<p>
<p>
Another perceived disadvantage of ROR regulation is that, because of the fact
that the utility knows its own expenses much better than regulators (a
condition known by economists as "information asymmetry"), the utility may be
able to inflate its estimates of its expenses, or to pad the rate base, thereby
increasing its revenue requirement.  In addition, ROR regulation is criticized
as being overly inflexible, as well as expensive, in that a rate case may
result in significant administrative costs.<p>

  <p>
  Performance-Based Regulation is meant to address the above perceived
disadvantages of ROR regulation.  PBR, also known as incentive regulation,
refers to a variety of regulatory approaches that attempt to provide or enhance
incentives for utilities to achieve desired goals, such as operational
efficiency or conservation targets, by inserting a system of rewards and
penalties into the regulatory structure.  <p>
<p>
Advocates of PBR claim that it reduces or avoids the potential problems of ROR
regulation outlined above, and induces utilities to achieve efficiency gains
that leave both customers and&nbsp;shareholders better off.  Others suggest
that PBR has many potential pitfalls, such as <p>
<p>
<!-- List Tag --><UL TYPE=circle>
<LI> the selection of inappropriate performance benchmarks<p>
<LI> the temptation to incorporate too many, or contradictory, societal or regulatory goals, into the PBR plan or<p>
<LI> exacerbating the "information asymmetry" between utilities and regulators.<p>
</UL>
<p>
<B><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Types of PBR Plans">Types of PBR Plans</A></B><p>
<p>
Types of PBR include flexible regulation, targeted incentive plans, external
performance indexing, price and revenue "caps," among others.<p>
<p>
<b>Flexible Regulation</b><p>
<p>
Flexible regulation refers to regulatory attempts to increase the
flexibility of ROR regulation.  Examples of this type of regulation include<p>
<p>
<!-- List Tag --><UL TYPE=circle>
<LI> allowing utilities to charge rates within an acceptable range<p>
<LI> allowing utilities to unilaterally flex rates downward<p>
<LI> authorize utilities to negotiate rates with specific customer classes, subject to regulatory approval<p>
</UL>
<p>
<b>Targeted Incentive Plans</b><p>
<p>
Targeted incentive plans seek to improve the effectiveness of ROR
regulation by providing performance incentives for specific, well-defined areas
of utility activity.  Sample activities of a targeted incentive plan might
include<p>
<p>
<!-- List Tag --><UL TYPE=circle>
<LI> efficient fuel purchases<p>
<LI> increased capacity or investment in infrastructure<p>
<LI> demand-side management or conservation<p>
</UL>
<p>
<b>External Performance Indexing</b><p>
<p>
An external performance indexing plan uses an external benchmark to
measure a utility's performance.  One possible benchmark can be the performance
of other similarly situated utilities.  Examples include<p>
<p>
<!-- List Tag --><UL TYPE=circle>
<LI> pricing production inputs<p>
<LI> ranking electricity rates<p>
<LI> ranking average customer bills<p>
<LI> measuring quality of service<p>
</UL>
<p>
<b>Price and Revenue Caps</b><p>
<p>
Price caps set an upper limit on the prices of a utility but do not
directly control the profits of the utility.  Revenue caps guarantee a utility
a certain income, but decouple that income from the amount of sales the utility
makes.  Revenue caps are suggested as a way to maximize conservation and
demand-side management goals.<p>
<p>
Both price and revenue caps can be used with external performance indexing to
measure a utility's performance.  Thus, both price and revenue caps can include
specific consideration of quality of service measures or environmental
factors.<p>
<p>
<B><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Basic Components">Basic Components to a PBR Plan</A></B><a href="restruct4_fn.html#fn2">[3]</a><p>
<p>
There are three basic components to a PBR plan.<p>
<p>
<!-- List Tag --><OL>
<LI> an adequate, but not inflated, baseline revenue requirement<p>
<LI> a package of incentives to encourage the utility to operate below this baseline revenue requirement<p>
<LI> a "quality control mechanism to ensure that the utility does not pursue cost savings at the expense of system reliability, safety, customer satisfaction, and other measures of quality."<a href="restruct4_fn.html#fn3">[4]</a><p>
</OL>
<p>
The PBR plan should allow for the baseline revenue requirement to be adjusted
over time for inflation.  In addition, the baseline should be offset by
advances in productivity from new technology and new techniques.  <p>
<p>
A provision to allow customers to share in the savings produced by the plan may
be built into the plan, but the ratio of the sharing between the utility and
its customers should be such that the utility's incentive to maximize these
savings is not impaired. <p>
<p>
The ability of PBR to address the perceived disadvantages of ROR regulation is
currently the subject of intense debate among utilities, regulators and
analysts.  Some argue that PBR can be used as a transition tool, to provide
incentives that will better mimic competitive forces.  Others, however, suggest
that to do PBR correctly, regulators must be provided with more, not less,
information then they currently have access to.  In addition, administrative
oversight, at least for the short term, may need to increase rather than
decrease.  Utilities under PBR would still control the information upon which
their incentives are based, and would still be motivated to maximize profits.
Given these fundamentals, a utility will have reason <p>
<p>
 <!-- List Tag --><UL TYPE=circle>
<LI>to fashion a PBR plan that incorporates too easily achieved benchmarks<p>
<LI> to provide regulators only with information that serves the interest of the
<LI>utility<p>
</UL>
<p>
Policymakers considering a plan to incorporate PBR into the regulatory
structure of the electric industry should determine whether or not the PBR
proposal adequately addresses those concerns.<p>

conditions, as the controller's or owner's uses of the system. <p>
  <p>
 <b>Competition</b> refers to both a process of rivalry among suppliers for
customers, and a stable market structure in which a number of comparable
suppliers compete to provide goods&nbsp;and services to a number of comparable
customers.  These are not the same; that is, rivalry will not necessarily lead
to a stable competitive market structure. <p>

instead of being based on the costs incurred by the power generator in
producing the power. <p>
  <p>
 <b>Munis or Municipal Electric Utilities</b> are owned and operated by
municipalities and overseen by municipal governments.  These entities are not
rate regulated by the MPUC, but are subject to regulation with regard to
Certificates of Need for power plants, the assignment of service territories,
energy conservation spending and formal service complaints. <p>
  <p>
 <b>MDPS</b> is the Minnesota Department of Public&nbsp;Service. <p>
  <p>
 <b>MPUC</b> is the Minnesota Public Utility Commission. <p>
  <p>
 <b><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="N">Natural Monopoly</A></b> refers to a market  condition where one service
provider can serve&nbsp;customers more efficiently than several or many
competing service providers.   <p>
  <p>
 <b>Network Service</b> is a type of transmission access that permits a
competitor to fully integrate load and resources on an instantaneous basis in a
manner similar to the&nbsp;transmission owner's integration of its
own&nbsp;load and resources. <p>
  <p>
 <b><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="O">Obligation to Serve</A></b> refers to the obligation public utilities have
under statute to serve all customers within their exclusive service
territories. <p>
  <p>
 <b>Open Access Transmission Tariffs</b> are rate tariffs which, once filed
with FERC, allow competitors to use the transmission facilities controlled by
the filing utility to transmit their power at the rates listed in the filed
tariff. Such tariffs can either allow point to point service or network service
or both. <p>
  <p>
 <b><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="P">PBR or Performance-Based Regulation</A></b> refers to a host of regulatory

designated points of entry into and exit from the transmitting utility's
system, with a designated amount of transfer capability at each point. <p>
  <p>
 <b>PoolCo</b> is a mandatory electricity pool that would act as a
marketplace to match energy supplies with energy demand. <p>
  <p>
 <b>PUHCA</b> is the Public Utility Holding Corporation Act of 1935. <p>
  <p>
 <b>PURPA</b> is the Public Utility Regulatory Procedures Act of
1978. <p>
  <p>
 <b><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="Q">QFs or Qualified Facilities</A></b> are a class of independent power
producers that meet certain size and type of generation requirements imposed by
PURPA.  PURPA then confers certain benefits, namely the requirement that
utilities purchase their capacity and energy at the utility's avoided
cost. <p>
  <p>
 <b><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="R">Rate Base</A></b> refers to the total amount of capital a utility has
committed to providing utility service. <p>
  <p>
 <b>Rate Case</b> is an administrative proceeding to determine the
appropriate rates that a utility should charge. <p>

return that investors in the utility should receive on their investment. <p>
  <p>
 <b>RTG or Regional Transmission Group</b> is a&nbsp;new creature in the
utility industry, and is&nbsp;expected to provide regional transmission system
planning and integration for its members. <p>
  <p>
 <b>Regulatory Compact</b> refers to the regulated rates and exclusive
service territories created by statute for electric utilities.  It is an
implied agreement between society and a utility wherein the utility accepts the
obligation to serve each customer within that service territory and to provide
quality service at just and reasonable rates in exchange for a monopoly and an
opportunity to recover its expenses and the cost of capital committed to
utility service. <p>
  <p>
 <b>Retail Competition</b> refers to competition in&nbsp;the retail sector
of the electric industry, generally with reference to the generation function.
It is the ability to transmit one's power through the transmission facilities
of another for sale to a third party at retail, or as defined by EPAct, "the
transmission of electric energy directly to an ultimate consumer." Also called
<b>Direct Access</b> and <b>Retail Wheeling</b>. <p>
  <p>
 <b>Retail Wheeling</b> - See <b>Retail Competition</b>. <p>
  <p>
 <b>ROR Regulation or Rate of Return Regulation</b> refers to regulation
that forces utilities to offer their services at prices that are based on the
cost of the services, rather than on the value that customers place on those
services.  Also called <b>Cost of Service or Cost-Based Regulation.</b> <p>
 <b></b> <p>
 <b><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="S">Section 211</A></b> is the section added by PURPA and amended by EPAct that
authorizes FERC to order wholesale wheeling. <p>
  <p>
 <b>Stranded Benefits</b> refer to the benefits associated with the current
regulatory structure that may be lost in moving to a more competitive
structure.  Such benefits include energy efficiency mandates, low-income rate
programs, and environmental standards. <p>
  <p>
 <b>Stranded Costs</b> refer to investments in assets that may be lost or
stranded as a consequence of moving to a new regulatory structure.
These&nbsp;costs refer to uneconomic assets and obligations that will
financially burden utilities in a competitive market. One such cost is
investments in generation plants utilities may have made in order to fulfill
their obligation to&nbsp;serve, but which will not be needed in a more
competitive environment.  Also called <b>Transition Costs</b>. <p>
  <p>
 <b><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="T">Transition Costs</A></b> - See <b>Stranded Costs</b>. <p>
  <p>
 <b>Transmission</b> lines carry the electricity over&nbsp;long distances at
high voltage from the generation plant to the distribution substation, where
the electricity is "stepped down" (the&nbsp;voltage is reduced) for
distribution to residential, commercial and industrial customers.  The
transmission grid currently consists of a number of individual, utility-owned
transmission systems which are interconnected to facilitate system reliability
and transfer of power from one utility to another. <p>
  <p>
 <b>Transmitting Utility</b> means (for the purposes of a section 211 order)
any electric utility, qualifying cogeneration facility, qualifying small power
production facility, or federal power marketing agency which owns or operates
electric transmission facilities, used for the sale of electric energy at
wholesale.  <p>
  <p>
 <b><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="V">Virtual Direct Access</A></b> refers to a system based on instantaneous
metering and monitoring by the retail consumer of the price of the consumer's
electricity.  By monitoring the fluctuations in price, the consumer can modify
energy consumption to minimize energy cost, and thereby achieve the benefits of
actual direct access. <p>
  <p>
 <b><!-- Anchor Point Tag --><A NAME="W">Western Area Power Administration</A></b> is a large scale wholesale
generator owned by the federal government which produces power for sale at
subsidized rates for resale. <p>
  <p>
 <b>Wholesale Competition</b> refers to competition in the wholesale sector
of the electric industry, generally with reference to the generation
function. <p>
  <p>
 <b>Wholesale Wheeling</b> means the ability to transmit one's power through
the transmission facilities of another for sale to a third party at

<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>
<p>
In 1991, to spur the development of a wind-energy industry in Minnesota the
state legislature exempted wind-energy equipment from property taxes.<a
href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn0">[1]</a>   In 1994 the Minnesota legislature
enacted a wind mandate,  ordering Northern States Power Company (NSP) to build
or purchase a minimum of 425 megawatts (MW) of wind electricity by 2002.  That
law created a guaranteed market for about $400 million in wind-related
investment.<p>
<p>
The new wind mandate undermines the original justification for the wind-energy
property tax exemption.   Both the wind industry and local government officials
agree that wind-energy facilities should now pay property taxes.  But no
agreement exists regarding the method and level of taxation.  This paper
addresses that issue, explores various tax-strategy options and offers guidance
for state policymakers.<p>
<p>
A fair tax policy for wind energy must balance four interests:  the ratepayer
interest in paying the lowest possible price for electricity;  the wind
industry interest in maximizing profits and accelerating wind-energy
development; the interest of the community in which the wind facilities will
locate in maximizing local tax revenues; and the interest of Minnesota in
maximizing wind-energy development inside the state.<p>
<p>
Wind energy can be a boon to Minnesota's remote rural counties.  The two
counties with the highest wind speeds, Lincoln and Pipestone, will be the
earliest beneficiaries of this kind of development.  All five counties in that
corner of Minnesota boast wind speeds sufficient to promote significant wind
developments.  As wind-energy technologies advance and electricity can be
competitively generated at lower wind speeds, more than a dozen other counties
will become prime development sites.<p>
<p>
Some county may benefit economically by becoming home to a major wind-turbine
assembly or manufacturing plant.  For most counties the greatest economic
benefit will come in the form of wind developers' lease payments to landowners
and tax payments to local governments.  <p>
<p>
A 425-MW wind "farm" will benefit the 150 or so landowners who lease parts of
their land to wind developers.<a href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn1">[2]</a>
Landowners could collectively receive from a few hundred thousand dollars a
year to as much as $3.5 million a year when 425 MW of wind power becomes
operational, depending on the type of contract they negotiate.<a
href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn2">[3]</a>   <p>
<p>
Current Minnesota electric utility property tax policy channels virtually all
of the revenues generated from taxing power plants to the benefit of the host
community.<a href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn3">[4]</a>   The current state utility
property tax rate is 4.6 percent.<a href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn4">[5]</a>  At
that tax rate, a 200 MW wind facility would generate an additional tax capacity
for Lincoln County of $6.7 million(see Table 1).  That would constitute about
two-thirds of the total tax capacity of the County after the wind facility was
in place.  The annual benefit to the County residents would be $3.23 million.
This benefit could be taken either as improved services by county governments
or reduced taxes on businesses and households or some combination of both.  At
425 MW the annual tax benefits to the County residents would rise to almost $4
million.<a href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn5">[6]</a>    <p>
<p>
Thus property taxes from wind-energy facilities likely would offer larger
financial benefits than lease payments to landowners and the property tax
benefits would be shared by a larger number of local residents.  <p>
<p>
This report begins by describing the way local property taxes are determined in
Minnesota and how that affects wind-energy taxation.  The second section
examines the impact on local communities and on wind development of various
tax-strategy options.  The third section analyzes the impact that wind-energy
taxes would have on the competitiveness of wind energy versus conventional
electric generation technologies and on the competitiveness of Minnesota based
wind-electric facilities compared to those in neighboring states.<p>
<p>
The final section of this report offers our conclusions and contains specific
guidance for Minnesota policymakers.  Readers looking for a synthesis of the
data contained in this paper can move directly to Section IV.    <p>
<p>
In designing a fair wind-energy tax policy it may be useful to work backwards.
The first step is to determine what level of taxation would provide a
significant and enduring financial benefit to the host community while not
hindering the rapid expansion of wind-energy facilities.  This report concludes
that a wind energy tax of .25-.30 cents per kWh would not hinder the
development of the wind industry in Minnesota and would provide substantial
benefits to the rural communities that host these wind farms.  Such a tax also
would be in the range of existing utility taxes on power plants. <p>
<p>
The second step is to design a specific method of taxation that achieves this
level of tax.  There are three general taxing strategies.  One varies the
existing utility class tax rate on wind-energy equipment and structures.  We
examine the impact on the community and on wind-energy developers of lowering
the utility tax rate to 1 percent. A second tax strategy maintains the existing
4.6 percent utility class tax rate and varies the proportion of the wind-energy
facility subject to the tax.  We examine the impact of taxing only the
foundation of the wind tower in the early years and then taxing only the
foundation and the tower while excluding the other wind-energy equipment.  A
third tax strategy imposes a flat payment or royalty on every kWh generated.
We examine the impacts of a .30 cent per kWh flat payment.<p>
<p>
The first two options, varying the tax rate and varying the parts of the
wind-energy facility to be taxed, are variations on the existing utility tax
system and therefore will be more familiar to policymakers.  However, these
types of utility taxes may suffer from drawbacks that would not occur in a flat
tax/royalty arrangement.   Section IV explores the pros and cons of these three
tax strategies.<p>
<p>
The estimates used in this report are based on actual data from Lincoln County.
We caution the reader that these represent only rough estimates and urge others
to refine the numbers and explore still other tax strategies.<p>

<H3>SECTION I:  HOW LOCAL PROPERTY TAXES ARE DETERMINED IN MINNESOTA</H3>

To design a fair tax on windpower we must first understand how taxes are
determined.  In the case of windpower, the present property tax system is
structured in a way that results in a variation of the tax per kWh depending on
the size of the wind-energy development.   <p>
<p>
How much each property owner pays is based on four factors:<p>
<p>
<!-- List Tag --><UL>
<LI>the level of local government spending<p>
<LI>the market value of local property<p>
<LI>the class tax rate for that type of property<p>
<LI>the local tax rate or tax multiplier<a href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn6">[7]</a> for that area<p>
</UL>
<p>
The first step in determining the amount of tax an individual property owner
will pay is for each local taxing district-- county government, township,
school district, watershed district--to develop its level of spending(i.e., its
budget).  The Lincoln County government budget constitutes about half of the
total budget of all taxing districts within the County.<a
href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn6">[8]</a> <p>
<p>
Having established how much the county's taxing districts will spend, the next
step is to determine the taxing district's "tax capacity".   This is the
revenue-generating capacity based on existing tax rates.  It is calculated by
multiplying the market value of all taxable property--utility, industrial,
railroad, commercial, residential, agricultural--by that property's class tax
rate.<a href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn7">[9]</a><p>
<p>
Thus, for example, Lincoln County has estimated the market value of its
residential property to be $46 million.<a href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn8">[10]</a>
Multiplied by a typical state class tax rate for residential property<a
href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn9">[11]</a>, this results in a total residential tax
capacity of nearly $715,000.  If the next 100-MW phase of wind development were
taxed at the current utility rate of 4.6 percent, it would add a tax capacity
of $3.3 million, or 4.5 times the residential tax capacity.<a
href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn10">[12]</a><p>
<p>
If the budgets of the taxing districts require greater tax revenues, the
districts, in effect, will raise the tax rates.  If the budgets are lower than
the overall tax revenue generated by existing tax rates, they would, in effect,
lower tax rates.  But because class tax rates are set at the state level, the
taxing districts use a tax multiplier that has the same result.  The tax
multiplier is determined by comparing the locality's proposed spending  by the
total tax revenue the area would generate if existing properties were taxed at
their class tax rate.  If the budget is higher than the tax capacity then
properties will be taxed at a rate higher than the class tax rate.   The tax
multiplier will be greater than unity (or more than 100 percent).<p>
<p>
In 1993 Lincoln County's average local tax rate or tax multiplier was 137
percent.<a href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn11">[13]</a>   Average county-wide tax
rates in Minnesota vary from a low of 82.7 percent in Sherburne County to a
high of 170.2 percent in Mille Lacs County.  The statewide average is 128.7
percent.<a href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn12">[14]</a><p>
<p>
Property taxes are determined by multiplying the value of a property by that
property's class tax rate and then by the sum of the local tax rates or tax
multipliers.  Thus if a commercial property is valued at $100,000 and the class
tax rate for commercial property is 4.6 percent the tax capacity of that
property would be $4600.  If the taxing districts' overall local tax rate or
tax multiplier is 137 percent, the actual property taxes due would be 1.37 x
$4600 or $6302.<p>
<p>
The relationship between public spending, tax capacity, and the local tax rate
or tax multiplier has important implications for wind power.  New taxable
development increases a county's tax capacity.  That increased capacity can be
used to increase spending without increasing taxes.  Or it can be used to
reduce taxes on existing businesses and homeowners.  <p>
<p>
Different kinds of development affect government budgets differently.
Residential development increases the amount of taxable property but also tends
to increase the demand for services such as fire and police and schools.  The
amount of revenue the county can generate without raising tax rates goes up but
the budget also goes up.  In some cases increases in spending may outrun the
increase in tax capacity and taxes on existing properties could rise.<p>
<p>
Power-plant development, on the other hand substantially increases the amount
of taxable property without significantly increasing the demand for services.
Thus a new utility plant allows the government the attractive option of either
decreasing taxes or improving services or some combination of the two.<a
href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn13">[15]</a> <p>
<p>
Table 1 shows the estimated impacts on Lincoln County of wind farms of 100, 200
and 425 MW.<a href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn14">[16]</a> As we can see, a 100-MW
wind farm taxed at the utility class tax rate of 4.6 percent would create about
$3.36 million in additional tax capacity.  That can be compared to the current
County-wide<a href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn15">[17]</a> tax capacity of $3.64
million. In other words, a 100-MW wind farm would virtually double the tax
capacity of the County.  If the County budget did not increase, taxes on
existing businesses, farms and households could be cut in half.<p>
<p>
In most of our calculations we provide estimates based on both a zero and a
10-percent increase in the County-wide budget.  The increase in expenses
directly attributable to wind development would probably be quite small.<a
href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn16">[18]</a>  In other words, wind-energy
development, as with conventional power plant development, generates a large
net benefit to the County.<p>
<p>
The adjusted tax data in Table 1 represent the tax benefits generated by
wind-energy at various levels of wind-energy development.  Thus, assuming no
budget increase, at 100 MW a wind farm taxed at 4.6 percent generates $2.39
million in taxes.  The budget of all governments in Lincoln County combined is
$4.98 million.  Thus the existing businesses, farms and households in that
County would see their overall tax payments drop from $4.98 million to $1.59
million.  At 200 MW of development, the wind farm generates $3.23 million in
taxes, reducing the payments by existing local taxpayers by more than 65
percent.  On the other hand the tax per kWh of wind electricity would be a very
high 1.2 cents.<p>
<p>
If the County were to increase its budget by 20 percent, the reduction in taxes
would be 38 percent.  If it were to increase its budget by 50 percent, the
reduction in taxes would be 22 percent.<p>
<p>
	As the amount of wind electricity generated within a County increases, the
contribution of the wind facilities to the County's overall tax capacity
increases.  A 425-MW wind facility, taxed at 4.6 percent, would constitute some
80 percent of the County's entire tax capacity.  Assuming a 10-percent budget
increase, there would be a 78 percent reduction in taxes paid by property
owners. The tax per kWh would fall to .49 cents.<a

<H3>SECTION II:  STRATEGIES FOR TAXING WIND ELECTRIC SYSTEMS</H3>

Here we discuss five tax-strategy options for wind electric systems.
These constitute the major tax strategies that are currently being used in
Minnesota or elsewhere, or which have been proposed by interested parties.<p>
<b></b><p>
<H3>A.  Tax Wind Electricity at Existing Utility Rates</H3>
<p>
Traditional electrical generating facilities pay taxes on equipment as well as
buildings and land.  Local county assessors put value on the land and
buildings.  The Department of Revenue sets the value on the equipment, referred
to as "attached machinery".<a href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn18">[20]</a>  The
current utility class tax rate is 4.6 percent. <p>
<p>
Table 2 provides the data needed to analyze the impact of this tax strategy.
As we can see, the impact depends on the size of the wind facilities, the level
of government spending, and the level of depreciation taken.  Depreciation can
be an important issue.  The faster a power plant owner can depreciate or reduce
the market value of the power plant for tax purposes, the lower is the tax
benefit to the county.  <p>
<p>
Under the existing system, the Minnesota Department of Revenue allows utility
property to be depreciated according to a schedule developed by the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).  For most power plants this results in a
depreciation for property-tax purposes of 3 percent per year.  After the first
20 percent depreciation is taken, Minnesota allows a utility to further
depreciate the plant by one half of any additional depreciation.  For example,
in year one depreciation would be 3 percent.  In year two it would be 6 percent
and in year three 9 percent and so forth.  In year seven the depreciation would
be over 20 percent.  From that time on,  the plant would be depreciated by a
rate of one half of 3 percent per year or one half of the actual depreciation
that occurs.  Therefore in year 10 the power plant would ordinarily be
considered depreciated by 30 percent or ten times 3 percent.  But for property
tax valuation purposes, the depreciation allowed would be 20 percent plus one
half of the additional depreciation of 10 percent for a total of 25 percent. A
25 percent depreciation means that the power plant would be taxed based on 75
percent of its original value.<p>
<p>
The state does not have a separate depreciation schedule for valuing wind
equipment.  Insufficient data on the resale value of wind equipment currently
exists to develop such a schedule.  It seems reasonable to expect that wind
equipment would depreciate in value more rapidly than conventional power
plants, if only because new, higher-efficiency wind turbines will enter the
market, driving down the value of existing wind equipment.  It may be
instructive to note that Alameda County, California, home to more than 700 MW
of wind capacity, among them some of the nation's first large wind turbines,
taxes wind energy on a depreciation schedule that by year 10 values the wind
equipment at only 5 percent of its original value.<a
href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn19">[21]</a> <p>
<p>
Table 2 shows the impact of applying the 4.6 percent utility tax under various
scenarios.<a href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn20">[22]</a> Reading from the table, in
year one wind equipment would depreciate by 3 percent in value, using the
conventional power-plant depreciation as the guide.  A 100-MW wind farm in the
first year would reduce the Lincoln County local tax rate or tax multiplier
from 137 percent to 79 percent a 46 percent reduction, assuming a 10 percent
increase in the budget.  The tax per kWh generated would be 1.25 cents.  <p>
<p>
The table also reveals the impact of the continuing depreciation of utility
equipment.  In the tenth year, assuming the current 25-percent depreciation
rate for utility equipment, and assuming a 10-percent increase in the
County-wide budget, the local tax rate or tax multiplier would rise from the
79.5 percent in the first year to 89.1 percent, or 12 percent.  While overall
taxes go up, the tax per kWh goes down, dropping to 1.08 cents.<p>
<p>
<p>

<!-- Graphic Tag --><IMG WIDTH=991 HEIGHT=576 ALT="Table 2" SRC="tab2.GIF">
<p>
A great deal of information is contained in Table 2.  Here we highlight a few
items. <p>
<p>
The amount of wind capacity is a critical element in determining the tax per
kWh.  Assuming a 25-percent depreciation rate and a 10-percent increase in the
County-wide budget, the tax per kWh for a 100-MW wind facility is 1.08 cents.
For a 200 MW facility it drops to .77 cents and for a 425 MW facility it drops
to .46 cents.<p>
<p>
Depreciation matters less than the size of the wind-electric facility.  For
example, if depreciation were to rise from 3 percent to 25 percent for a 100-MW
facility the tax per kWh would fall from 1.25 to 1.08 cents.  But if the wind
facility were to expand to 425 MW, the tax per kWh drops from 1.25 to .49 cents
per kWh under the 3-percent depreciation schedule and from 1.08 to .46 cents
under the 25-percent depreciation schedule.<p>
<p>
County-wide spending matters.  If County-wide budget increases from 10 percent
to 50 percent, the tax per kWh for a 100 MW wind facility using a 3-percent
depreciation rate would rise from 1.25 cents to 1.70 cents.  Using a 25-percent
depreciation rate it would rise from 1.08 to 1.47 cents per kWh.   However, the
impact on the tax per kWh of a rise in County spending diminishes as the scale
of the wind facility expands.  For a 425-MW facility, an increase in the County
budget from 10 percent to 50 percent using a 3-percent depreciation rate raises
the tax per kWh from .49 to .67 cents.  With a 25-percent depreciation, it
rises from .46 to .63 cents per kWh.  <p>
<p>
For purposes of comparing options we assume a zero-percent and 10-percent
increase in the County-wide budget and a 3-percent depreciation.  For a 100-MW
wind facility, assuming an increase in County-wide budgets of 10 percent or
$500,000 there would be an additional reduction in residential taxes of
$410,000.  The tax per kWh is 1.25 cents.  For a 200-MW facility the numbers
would be $590,000 and .85 cents, respectively.  For a 425-MW facility they are
$755,000 and .49 cents, respectively. <p>

<H3>SECTION II:  STRATEGIES FOR TAXING WIND ELECTRIC SYSTEMS</H3>


<H3>B.  Establish a New 1 Percent Class Tax Rate for Renewable Electricity</H3>

By  exempting wind equipment from assessment, the state has already created a
two-tiered utility class tax rate.  Some wind developers have proposed a
renewable electric property tax class rate of 1 percent.  This is the rate
currently used in Alameda County, although the reason for this had little to do
with wind power.  Proposition 13, established by a statewide referendum in the
late 1970's, limited property tax rates to this level.<a
href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn21">[23]</a><p>
<p>
Table 3 shows the impact on Lincoln County taxes of a 1-percent utility class
tax rate with a 3-percent depreciation on the equipment.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Table 3:  Impacts on Lincoln County of a Tax Based on a 1-Percent Class Tax Rate for Wind Power</b><p>
<!-- Graphic Tag --><IMG WIDTH=487 HEIGHT=684 ALT="Table 3" SRC="tab3.GIF"><P>


At 100 MW of wind development, the reduction in the local tax rate or
tax multiplier, assuming a 10-percent increase in County-wide government
expenditures and a 3-percent depreciation, would be 11.5 percent.  The tax per
kWh generated would be .44 cents.  At 200 MW these numbers change to 29.4
percent, $222,000 savings and .38 cents per kWh, respectively.  At 425 MW
development, the local tax rate or tax multiplier drops by 55.6 percent and the
tax per kWh falls to .29 cents.<p>

<H3>SECTION II:  STRATEGIES FOR TAXING WIND ELECTRIC SYSTEMS</H3>


<H3>C.  Establish A Phased-in Tax</H3>
<p>
Wind-generation systems are about as expensive as conventional power systems,
but because wind is intermittent, they generate less electricity on an annual
basis.  A utility tax is based on the market value of the equipment.  Its
impact is spread out over the amount of electricity that equipment generates.
Therefore wind turbines will pay a higher tax per kWh.   To offset this penalty
it might be possible to phase in the tax on windpower.  Wind developers
depreciate their equipment rapidly for income tax purposes.  After five years
they expect to begin to generate a reliable revenue stream.  A phased-in tax
could be matched to the expected profitability of the wind developments.<p>
<p>
Iowa has adopted this kind of tax policy for wind energy.<a
href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn22">[24]</a>  In Iowa, wind-power equipment is valued
at an increasing rate of 5 percent per year, reaching the maximum 30 percent in
the seventh year.  In other words, in Iowa when wind equipment is fully valued
in the seventh year, it is 70 percent depreciated whereas under the current
utility tax rate in Minnesota, wind equipment in the tenth year will be
depreciated by about 25 percent, which is equivalent to being valued at 75
percent of the original cost. <p>
<p>
Table 4 shows the impact on Lincoln County of adopting the Iowa
increasing-valuation tax strategy.  We have used the Minnesota utility class
tax rate of 4.6 percent for comparison purposes.<p>
<p>
<b>Table 4:  Impacts on Lincoln County Taxes and Cost per kWh of a Wind-Energy
Tax Based on Iowa's Valuation Schedule</b><p>
<!-- Graphic Tag --><IMG WIDTH=800 HEIGHT=373 ALT="Table 4" SRC="tab4.GIF">
<p>
As Table 4 reveals, this type of taxation actually increases the taxes paid by
local businesses, farmers and households in the early years, if the County
budget increases even modestly.  Even in the seventh year, when the property is
assessed at its highest value, the reduction in the County's taxes is:  14
percent, 29 percent and 50 percent at 100 MW, 200 MW and 425 MW respectively.
When fully phased in, the tax per kWh is 0.57 cents, 0.46 cents and 0.34 cents
at 100 MW, 200 MW, and 425 MW, respectively.<p>

<H3>SECTION II:  STRATEGIES FOR TAXING WIND ELECTRIC SYSTEMS</H3>


<H3>D.  Establish a Phased-In Tax on Wind Facility Foundation and Turbine</H3>
 <p>
In 1994 the state legislature exempted LS Power's proposed 232-MW natural
gas-fired cogeneration plant at Cottage Grove, MN, from attached machinery
taxes.<a href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn23">[25]</a>  LS Power must pay taxes on the
land and the buildings but not on the machinery.<a
href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn24">[26]</a><p>
<p>
If wind power facilities were treated in a similar manner, only the concrete
pad at the base of the turbine and possibly the tower would be taxed.  Table 5
shows the impact of a tax on the foundation in years 1 through 5 and a tax on
the foundation and turbine in year 6 and beyond.   <p>
<p>
In Table 5 we also, for the first time, break out the tax savings by each
taxing district of the County. We show the tax benefits to all residents in
Lincoln County and to the residents of Lake Benton township and school
district.  Slightly less than half of the tax benefits(55.60 percent of the
122.55 percent local tax rate or tax multiplier) would accrue to the school
district.  About the same amount would accrue to the the residents of the
entire county.  Data at the bottom of the table reveal that a 100 MW wind farm
in its early years, assuming the county-wide budgets remain the same, would
generate about $322,000 in additional taxes in the early years and $727,000 in
taxes in years 6 and beyond.<p>
<p>
Table 6 shows the varying impact on Lake Benton residents and those living
outside the Lake Benton township and Lake Benton school district taxing areas.
Assuming that government budgets remain the same, in the first few years in
which just the wind facility's foundation is taxed, a wind farm of 100 MW would
reduce taxes for Lake Benton residents by about 22 percent while only reducing
the taxes of those living outside of Lake Benton by about 4 percent.  In year 6
and later, when the foundation and the tower are taxed, the reduction in taxes
for residents of Lake Benton's township and school district would be 41 percent
while for those living outside that area it would be only 10 percent.<p>
<p>

Tower</b>

<p>
<b>Table 6:  Distribution of Wind Energy Tax Benefits Within Lincoln County
</b>
<!-- Graphic Tag --><IMG WIDTH=851 HEIGHT=243 ALT="Table 6" SRC="tab6.GIF">
<p>
A summary of the most relevant data in Table 5 is presented in Table 7.  In
this table we have not broken out the distribution of tax benefits within the
County.  Instead we show the aggregate benefit on a County-wide basis. In years
one through five, a 100 MW wind farm would pay .16 cent per kWh in taxes.  It
would generate about $322,000 annually in tax benefits and, assuming no
increase in County-wide budgets, would reduce taxes on existing properties by 7
percent.  In years 6 and beyond the tax on a 100 MW wind farm would generate
about $728,000 in tax benefits annually.  Assuming no increase in government
budgets, this would lower existing taxes by 15 percent.  The tax per kWh would
rise to .35 cents.<p>

<p>
<b>Table 7:  Summary of Impacts of Phased-in Tax on Foundation and Towers</b><p>

<!-- Graphic Tag --><IMG WIDTH=851 HEIGHT=329 ALT="Table 7" SRC="tab7.GIF">
<p>
In the early years the tax per kWh for a 200 MW wind farm would be .13 cent and
the reduction in countywide taxes would be 11 percent.  In years 6 and beyond
the tax per kWh would rise to .27 and the reduction in countywide taxes would
be 22 percent.<p>

<H3>SECTION II:  STRATEGIES FOR TAXING WIND ELECTRIC SYSTEMS</H3>


<H3>E. Establish a Flat Payment per kWh</H3>
A precedent exists for the state to impose a flat royalty payment on
wind-energy.  Minnesota imposes a $2.054 per ton tax on taconite mined in 1992,
1993, and 1994.<a href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn25">[27]</a>  That tax was enacted
to create an investment fund that would enable the Iron Range to diversify its
economic base away from a heavy dependence on a declining taconite industry.  A
similar tax on production could be applied to the electricity generated from
wind turbines.  Indeed, there is a certain symmetry to this suggestion.   The
highest wind-speed areas of Minnesota are in the opposite corner of the state
from the Iron Range and these rural communities are among the poorest in the
state. <p>
<p>
A royalty tax could be based on actual electric generation. Such a tax would be
easy to administer but might leave the County in a somewhat uncertain fiscal
situation because the revenue stream in any given year depends entirely on the
performance of the wind equipment.  A more attractive approach might be to
establish a "normalized" tax.  This tax would be based on an anticipated
quantity of electricity generated.  The amount of electricity taxable would be
based on the operating efficiencies of the average wind turbine.  <p>
<p>
For example, the present generation of wind turbines expect to achieve a
25-percent capacity factor.  That means that 25 percent of the time the power
plant will operate at its nameplate capacity.  Thus a 1 kW machine would
generate 1 times 8760 hours in a year times .25 or 2190 kWh per year.<a
href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn26">[28]</a>   The royalty payment would be payable
on 2190 kWh per year.  A developer who designs and operates a machine that
extracts more electricity from the wind than this amount would not pay a tax on
the additional electricity.  Or another way of looking at this is that the same
tax payment would be spread out over more kWhs and thus the tax per kWh would
be lower.<p>
<p>
A flat tax rate per kWh differs from other kinds of taxes because it would not
affect the tax capacity of the county.  The revenue from this type of tax could
go into a county's general fund or it could be dedicated to a specific purpose
(e.g., for local economic development or to expand renewable electricity).
Table 8 shows the impact of a .3 cent per kWh flat payment. <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Table 8:  Impacts on Lincoln County of a Flat Payment of .3 Cent per
kWh</b><p>

<!-- Graphic Tag --><IMG WIDTH=469 HEIGHT=393 ALT="Table 8" SRC="tab8.GIF">
<p>
As Table 8 shows, a 100 MW wind farm would generate $624,000 in tax benefits
annually.  A 200 MW and 425 MW wind farm would generate two times and 4.25
times as much tax benefit. Indeed, since this is a flat tax, one can predict
the revenue generated by multiplying the number of megawatts by $6242.<p>
<p>
Assuming the government budgets remain the same, a 100 MW wind farm would
reduce existing taxes by 12 percent, a 200 MW wind farm by 25 percent and a 425
MW wind farm by 53 percent.<p>

<H3>SECTION III:  TOWARD A FAIR TAX SYSTEM FOR WIND ENERGY</H3>
   
<p>
As was stated in the beginning of this report, a fair tax policy for wind
energy should balance four interests:  the desire by ratepayers to pay the
lowest possible price for electricity; the desire by wind developers to
maximize their financial returns and accelerate wind electric development; the
desire by county residents to maximize their financial benefit from local
wind-electric development and; the desire by Minnesota to accelerate
wind-energy development inside the state.<p>
<p>
We address these issues in turn.<p>
<p>
Ratepayers desire the lowest possible price for electricity.  Customers now pay
a slight premium for using wind power.<a href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn27">[29]</a>
According to NSP the impact on electric rates of a 100-MW wind farm where the
wind electricity is purchased at 4.5 cents per kWh is about $0.00027 per kWh.
An average residential customer would pay about $2.00 more a year or less than
one half of one percent more for electricity.  The wind industry anticipates
that by the end of the decade or before, wind energy will be competitive with
most if not all forms of conventional power.<p>
<p>
Assuming that a tax on wind-electricity per kWh is no higher than the existing
utility tax on conventional power,  a wind-energy tax would not raise the price
of electricity any higher than it would have been without the wind-energy.   <p>
<p>
Wind developers want to accelerate wind-electric development and Minnesota
officials want to ensure that that development occurs within the state. It
should be noted that any tax rate on wind-power equipment would apply statewide
but the renewable-electric mandate applies only to power purchased or produced
by NSP.  Outside of NSP's territory, wind developers still will compete with
conventional power producers.<p>
<p>
In addition, the wind mandate may not require that all 425 MW be generated
inside Minnesota.  Depending on one's interpretation of the existing laws, 200
MW might be generated in South Dakota or other nearby windy states for sale to
NSP.<a href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn28">[30]</a>  <p>
<p>
Thus among the issues to be addressed are whether a tax imposed on Minnesota
wind power plants would discourage wind developers from selling to markets
other than NSP or whether a tax imposed on wind energy would encourage
developers to establish wind farms in other states and transmit the electricity
back to Minnesota. <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>A.  Competing With Fossil-Fueled Power Plants  </b><p>
<b></b><p>
Would a tax on wind power hinder wind-electric sales to utilities other than
NSP?   The answer to this question depends on those utilities' planned future
power purchases, whether these purchases will be for baseload, intermediate or
peaking power, what the cost of that power will be, what the cost of wind power
will be at that time, and what the value of wind electricity is with respect to
baseload, intermediate and peaking power. <p>
<p>
To provide detailed answers to these questions is outside of the scope of this
report.  It may be useful, however, to note the differing impacts of a utility
tax on wind turbines and conventional power plants.  Table 9 provides the range
of taxes per kWh for conventional power plants, based on a 10-percent increase
in the budget and Lincoln County data.  <p>
<p>
As we can see from Table 9, the tax per kWh for conventional power plants
depends on their capital cost per kilowatt, whether they are used as a baseload
or intermediate load plant, and how big the plant is.  Depreciation doesn't
significantly affect the conclusions.  The tax in cents per kWh ranges from a
high of 1.0 cent for a natural gas power plant that operates 30 percent of the
time to a low of .16 cent for a natural gas plant that operates 70 percent of
the time.<a href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn29">[31]</a>  Coal gasification plants
will tend to be built in the 300-500-MW range while natural gas power plants
will tend to be built in the 50-200-MW range.  Thus the 200 MW figures from the
table may represent the most realistic estimates of the impact of the existing
4.6 percent utility tax on future fossil fueled power plants.  These are in the
.27-.63 cent per kWh range.  <p>
<p>
 Since state policy is to encourage wind-energy development,  Minnesota would
not want to tax wind energy at a higher rate per kWh than fossil fueled power
plants.  This would put wind energy at a competitive disadvantage with
conventional power plants.   On the other hand, given the wind-energy mandate,
it is unclear whether wind-energy should be taxed at a significantly lower rate
than conventional power.  A tax in the range of .2-.3 cent per kWh appears
reasonable.<p>

<b>Table 9:  Cost per kWh of 4.6-Percent Tax on Fossil-Fueled Power Plants
</b><p>
<!-- Graphic Tag --><IMG WIDTH=841 HEIGHT=202 ALT="Table 9" SRC="tab9.GIF">
<p>
Because of the mandate for wind-electricity wind-energy developers will for the
next few years be competing against one another and not against conventional
power plants.  Therefore one can argue that a tax on wind-energy can and will
be passed along to the electricity customer just as are existing taxes on
utility power plants.  Thus wind-energy developers' profits should not suffer.
<p>
<p>
However, wind development may be burdened by high energy taxes in another more
indirect manner.  Wind-energy development will probably occur under independent
ownership.  Therefore bids will have to include the cost of taxes.  Wind
developers point out that if taxes are high, the bid prices may be much higher
and the general public may get the impression that wind energy is more
expensive than it actually is.  That misleading impression could undermine
support for wind-electricity.  <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>B.  Competing With Iowa and South Dakota</b><p>
<b></b><p>
Both Iowa and South Dakota tax electricity at a lower rate than does Minnesota.
South Dakota uses a unit-value approach similar to that used by the Minnesota
Department of Revenue to determine utility property values.  In South Dakota
the average tax rate is 2.6 percent for nonagricultural property, about 75
percent of Minnesota's effective rate of 3.45 percent, after 25 percent
depreciation.<a href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn30">[32]</a> <p>
<p>
Iowa, another windy state, offers special provisions for wind energy equipment.
Beginning in 1994, wind equipment in the first year is valued at zero.  For the
second through the sixth years, the wind equipment is assessed at a rate that
increases by five percent a year.  Beyond six years, the property will be
valued at 30 percent.<a href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn31">[33]</a>  In Iowa's Buena
Vista County, an area with high wind potential, the average tax rate is 2.35
percent.<a href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn32">[34]</a>  Thus the resulting effective
utility rate for wind power would be zero in the first year rising in the
seventh year to a maximum .7 percent.  This is about 20 percent of Minnesota's
effective rate of 3.45 percent.<p>
<p>
Whether the lower tax rates in Iowa and South Dakota would lead wind developers
to set up in those states rather than Minnesota may depend on the cost of
transmitting their electricity back to NSP.  The Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) recently established a transmission service charge in the
Mid-Continental Area Power Pool (MAPP) region.  The rates will be phased in
over time.  The rates vary significantly and are based on a complex formula.
The lowest tariff in the MAPP region is between Wisconsin Public Power and
Minnesota Power at $0.26 per kilowatt per month.  The highest tariff is between
Minnkota Power in North Dakota and Muscatine Electric in Iowa at $1.348 per
kilowatt per month.  These transmission tariffs very roughly translate into a
cost of transmitting electricity of .03 cent per kWh and .19 cent per kWh,
respectively.<a href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn33">[35]</a> <p>
<p>
These figures assume that wind electricity can be transmitted over existing
transmission lines.  If new or upgraded transmission lines are required, the
costs would be much higher.<a href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn34">[36]</a> <p>
<p>
Table 10 compares the tax per kWh for wind energy, based on the Iowa and South
Dakota and Minnesota rates.  In all three cases, Lincoln County's actual budget
and tax-capacity data are used.<a href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn35">[37]</a>   As
we can see from the table, in the worst-case scenario in the early years when
Iowa is not taxing wind power and Minnesota is taxing at 4.6 percent with a
minimum of depreciation, the difference in the tax per kWh between Iowa and
Minnesota is over 1.2 cents.  This would be greater than the cost of
transmission, assuming that existing transmission lines had sufficient
capacity.   The difference between South Dakota's and Minnesota's taxes is much
smaller, about .35 cents per kWh.  At 200 MW the fraction of a cent difference
in taxes per kWh in South Dakota is offset by the transmission costs and even
in Iowa, once the full 30 percent valuation is taken, it appears that
transmission costs could largely offset the difference in taxes.  More
analytical work needs to be done in this area to refine these very rough
numbers.   <p>
<p>
<b>Table 10: Comparison of Minnesota, South Dakota, and Iowa Tax Rates on Wind-
Power Development in Lincoln County </b><p>

<!-- Graphic Tag --><IMG WIDTH=432 HEIGHT=339 ALT="Table 10" SRC="tab10.GIF">
<p>
Table 10 shows that Iowa taxes wind-energy at .21-.32 cent per kWh.  South
Dakota taxes wind-energy at .35-.74 cent per kWh.  It appears that a tax of .3
cent per kWh or even higher on wind-energy in Minnesota would not encourage
developers to generate electricity outside of Minnesota and transmit it back to
this state.<p>

<H3>SECTION IV:  CONCLUSIONS</H3>
   
What is a fair tax policy for wind energy?  A fair tax must provide
significant and enduring financial benefits to the rural host community while
not hindering the rapid growth of wind-energy development in Minnesota.  <p>
<p>
Table 11 provides an overview of the impacts on wind-energy developers and the
local community of the five tax strategies discussed in this report.<a
href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn36">[38]</a>    For more detailed information on
these strategies, the reader can refer back to Section III.  <p>
<p>
There are three general broad strategies for taxing wind-energy.  One varies
the utility class tax rate from the current 4.6 percent.  Another varies the
value of the wind-energy facility.  The third imposes a flat tax or royalty per
unit of electricity generated.<p>
<p>
As we can see, using a 4.6 percent tax rate based on the current method of
valuing utility property would generates very substantial financial benefits to
the local community while imposing a very high tax on wind-energy facilities.
The community receives $2.0-2.3 million in tax benefits even at the 100 MW
level but the tax per kWh is .98-1.13 cent.  <p>
<p>
A 1 percent tax rate generates a smaller financial benefit to the local
community but also imposes a smaller cost per kWh to the wind-energy developer.
 For a 100 MW wind farm the local community would receive $645,000-$811,000.
Its taxes could be reduced by 13-16 percent, assuming no increase in
county-wide budgets.  The tax per kWh would be 0.31-0.39 cent at the 100 MW
level, falling to 0.28-0.37 cent per kWh at the 200 MW level.  <p>
<p>
A phased-in tax on wind-energy which uses the existing 4.6 percent utility
class tax rate but taxes only the foundation in years 1 through 5 and then the
foundation plus the tower in year 6 and afterwards generates a modest financial
benefit to the community and a varying cost per kWh to the wind-energy
developer.  At the 100 MW scale, the revenue for the first few years would be
about $330,000.  When the foundation plus the tower are taxed, the revenue to
the local community rises to about $730,000.  Assuming no county-wide budget
increase, taxes could be reduced by 7-15 percent at the 100 MW level, rising to
11-22 percent at the 200 MW level.  The tax per kWh in the first five years
would be 0.16 cent and afterward would be 0.35 cent.  <p>
<p>
As Table 11 shows, by varying the tax rate or varying the valuation of the
wind-energy facility, the tax per kWh and the income generated for the
community varies.  The tax per kWh under the phased in foundation and then
foundation and tower tax strategy would see the tax per kWh fluctuate from
.10-.35 over the years.  <p>
<p>
A flat payment per kWh would eliminate this fluctuation.  Wind-energy
developers would know what their tax per kWh would be.  A flat tax of .3 cent
per kWh would generate about $620,000 the first year of a 100 MW wind farm and
would allow existing taxes to be reduced by 12 percent.  A 200 MW would
generate $1.25 million and allow taxes to be reduced, assuming no increase in
county-wide budgets, by 25 percent.  <p>
<p>
Comparing the flat tax and the phased-in foundation and tower tax strategy, we
see that at the 100 MW level the former generates significantly more money for
the county in the early years when only the foundation is taxed and generates
slightly less financial benefits for the county after the foundation and the
tower are taxed.<a href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn37">[39]</a>  As the wind farm
size grows to 200 MW the flat payment generates significantly more revenue than
taxing only the foundation and and slightly more revenue than taxing the
foundation and the tower.  At 425 MW the flat payment method generates 1.5-3.0
times more revenue for the county.<a href="windtaxes_fn.html#fn38">[40]</a>  <p>

</HEAD><body><b>NOTES</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<a name="fn0">[1]</a>  Minnesota Statutes [[section]]272.02, subdivision 1,
section 21 exempts from property tax wind energy conversion systems installed
after January 1, 1991.  Minnesota Statutes [[section]]500.30, subd. 5 reads:
"Any depreciation caused by any solar or wind easement which is imposed upon
designated property, but not any appreciation caused by any easement which
benefits designated property, shall be included in the net tax capacity of the
property for property tax purposes."<p>
<a name="fn1">[2]</a>
 According to NSP, there are 31 active homesteads in the proposed site in
Lincoln County for the next 100 MW wind farm in that county and 33 active
homesteads in the proposed 100 MW site in Pipestone County.  <p>
<a name="fn2">[3]</a>  Many landowners in the Buffalo Ridge area have signed
contracts which effectively sell their wind rights in perpetuity.  In this case
the payment to the farmer is made in a lump sum up front.  NSP is expected to
pay a one-time lump-sum of $5,150,000 for wind easements for the 100-MW
facility.  In the Matter of Application of Northern States Power Company for a
Certificate of Need for Approximately 100 Megawatts of Wind Generation,
<i>Proposed 100 MW Wind Energy Generation Facility</i>, Docket No.
E-002/CN-94-795, September 23, 1994, page 17.   This sum is for access in
perpetuity so the annual benefit to the landowner could be quite low.  Also,
since landowners have given away perpetual access to 3-5 percent of their land,
the market value of that land declines.  A buyer would not have access to that
land nor would he or she receive revenue from the wind-electricity generated by
machines on that land.  The higher figure of $3.5 million is based on a payment
equivalent to 8 percent of the gross operating revenues (over 25 years).  This
is based on contracts negotiated in California. <p>
<a name="fn3">[4]</a>   This report does not address the issue of whether that
policy might be changed.  Utility tax policies vary by state.  In neighboring
Wisconsin, for example, utility tax revenue goes to the state and is
redistributed back to communities.  Communities which host power plants receive
a larger share of the revenue.  <p>
<a name="fn4">[5]</a>  The first $100,000 of utility property is taxed at 3
percent.  <p>
<a name="fn5">[6]</a>  For comparative purposes, NSP's Prairie Island nuclear
facility, with a capacity of 1060 MW, generates over $22,000,000 in property
taxes within Goodhue County.  The plant and its attached machinery constitute
approximately two-thirds of the tax capacity of the city of Red Wing.
Conversation with Brad Johnson, Goodhue County Assessor, December 5, 1994.
<sup>7</sup> Government officials call this the local tax rate in contrast to
the class or state tax rate.  We coined the term "tax multiplier" to
distinguish it from the class tax rate. <p>
<a name="fn6">[8]</a>  Conversation with Bob Anderson, Lincoln county Assessor,
December 13, 1994.  <p>
<a name="fn7">[9]</a>
  Market value is set by the county, except for certain utility and railroad
properties, which are set by the Department of Revenue.  The class tax rate is
fixed by the state.  Currently, there are dozens of property types that have
designated class tax rates.<p>
<a name="fn8">[10]</a>  This report focuses on the impact of wind development
in Lincoln County, the rural area most immediately affected by wind electric
development. Lincoln County had a 1990 population of 6,890, per capita income
of $9,616 and a land area of 537 square miles.  <p>
<a name="fn9">[11]</a> There are actually several class tax rates for different
types and values of residential property. <p>
<a name="fn10">[12]</a> The actual utility tax rate is 3 percent on the first
$100,000 of equipment and 4.6 percent on the value of the equipment in excess
of $100,000.  In our calculations and tables we  apply the 4.6 percent to the
entire value of the utility equipment.<p>
<a name="fn11">[13]</a>
  Conversation with Dean Sagmoe, Lincoln county Auditor, 10/19/94.  Tax rates
actually vary depending on the individual taxing district.  Thus they could be
over 100 percent in one school district and less than 100 percent in another.<p>
<a name="fn12">[14]</a>
  Minnesota Department of Revenue.<p>
<a name="fn13">[15]</a>  This report is based on Minnesota's philosophy of
utility taxing.  Minnesota's utility taxes are designed to reward local
communities willing to host the power plants.  Other states have different
policies.  For example, Wisconsin imposes a gross revenue tax on utilities that
goes into the general fund.   A portion of that money is allocated back to
those cities and counties which host power plants.  In Minnesota all the
utility customers pay slightly higher rates and this money is channeled to a
few taxpayers in the community surrounding the power plant.<p>
<a name="fn14">[16]</a>  This table does not take into account utility
equipment depreciation.  This is discussed in detail under the alternative tax
policies section of the report.<p>
<a name="fn15">[17]</a> This is the tax capacity of all taxing districts.  The
county government's share of this is 45-50 percent of the total.<p>
<a name="fn16">[18]</a>  Lincoln County has added one additional staff person
at the Recorders office to handle the increased flow of paper connected with
land acquisition activities.  Altamont Pass in Alameda county, California is
home to about 41 percent (700 MW) of California's wind-power capacity
(<i>WindStats Newsletter</i>, Winter 1994, Vol. 7, No. 1, p. 4).  Alameda
County officials say there has been a modest increase in road or administrative
expenses related to that development.  <p>
<a name="fn17">[19]</a>  There is at least one other aspect in this debate to
consider.  That is the issue of how the value of windy land will change in the
future.  The Lincoln County assessors office has stated that they will rely
solely on historical data in determining property values.  They will not
speculate as to the increase or decrease in the value of land that has or will
likely be a location for a wind tower.  It will take several years before any
adjustments are made to property values depending on how many real-estate
transactions occur.  Presentation by Bob Anderson, Lincoln County Assessor,
Environmental Quality Board's Power Plant Siting Advisory Task Force on Wind
Power in Minnesota.  November 18, 1994.<p>
<a name="fn18">[20]</a>
  Conversation with Al Whipple, Minnesota Deptartment of Revenue.  Actually
there is one further step in estimating tax capacity.  Since NSP supplies
electricity to other states as well as Minnesota, only 85 percent of the value
of the utility property is allocated to Minnesota.  <p>
<a name="fn19">[21]</a>  Conversation with Al Turner, Supervising
Auditor/Appraiser, Alameda County assessors office.  December 6, 1994.<p>
<a name="fn20">[22]</a>
 It should be noted that in our tabular calculations we have been using the
1994  average Lincoln County-wide tax multiplier of 137 percent.  Lincoln
County's budget temporarily increased recently to comply with the American
Disability Act.  It is expected that the budget will decrease next year and the
tax-rate multiplier will drop from 137 percent to 109 percent.   <p>
<a name="fn21">[23]</a>  Conversation with Al Turner, Alameda County assessors
office.<p>
<a name="fn22">[24]</a> Actually, Iowa values all commercial and industrial
property in similar fashion, that is, at a flat 30 percent of market-value
rate. Conversation with Ted VanGrootheest, Buena Vista County Assessor, Storm
Lake, IA. December 15, 1994.<p>
<a name="fn23">[25]</a>
  Minnesota Statutes Chapter 272.02, subd. 1 (28).  <p>
<a name="fn24">[26]</a>  The law was written so as to apply only to LS Power's
project.  One reason was to encourage highly efficient gas-fired power plants.
But another reason was that LS Power was competing against Wisconsin-based
power plants.  LS Power argued that those power producers could offer a lower
price because of the way the Wisconsin utility-tax system works.  Furthermore,
it argued that if a Wisconsin-based project were accepted, Minnesota counties
would not be able to increase their tax capacity at all.<p>
<a name="fn25">[27]</a>
  Laws of Minnesota for 1994. Chapter 587. Art. 6.  Sec. 3.<p>
<a name="fn26">[28]</a> To be more accurate, one would also take into account
the availability factor of the wind turbine.  That is the percent of the year
the wind turbine is available for operation(i.e. is not down for maintenance or
other reasons).  The industry expects that current generation wind turbines
will achieve 95 percent availability factors.  Thus we would multiply the 2190
kWhs per year by .95 for an expected electrical generation of a l kW wind
turbine of 2080.<p>
<a name="fn27">[29]</a> This does not take into account the pollution costs of
conventional power.  These are real costs not reflected in utility rates.  Such
costs have been quantified in a number of states.  Depending on the estimates
used,  when environmental impacts are considered, the cost of wind power  may
already be competitive with conventional power . <p>
<a name="fn28">[30]</a> Minnesota Statutes [[section]]216B.2423, subd. 1 (1994)
states that NSP must "construct and operate, purchase, or contract to construct
and operate: (1) 225 megawatts of electric energy installed capacity generated
by wind energy conversion systems within the state by December 31, 1998; and
(2) an additional 200 megawatts of installed capacity so generated by December
31, 2002."  The words "so generated" can be interpreted as meaning that the
additional 200 MW of wind power must also be located within the state.  It
could also mean simply that it must be windpower and the words "so generated"
do not refer to a specific geographic location.<p>
<a name="fn29">[31]</a> The Prairie Island nuclear plants in Goodhue County are
taxed at an effective rate of about .22 cents per kWh in part because they
represent such a large percentage of the county's tax base, and in part because
they have been depreciated by about 40 percent since their opening in 1973 and
1974.<p>
<a name="fn30">[32]</a>  South Dakota has two property tax rates, one for
agriculture and the other for nonagricultural property.  Conversation with Brad
Blinsmon, South Dakota Department of Revenue. December 13, 1994.  To calculate
the effective rate in Minnesota we used a 25-percent depreciation allowance
multiplied by the class tax rate of 4.6 percent to get an effective tax rate of
3.45 percent.<p>
<a name="fn31">[33]</a>  Iowa House File 664, 1993.<p>
<a name="fn32">[34]</a>  Conversation with Ted VanGrootheest, Buena Vista
County Assessor, December 15, 1994.<p>
<a name="fn33">[35]</a> This assumes a 25-percent capacity factor for wind
power.  This is a rough approximation because the contracts independent power
producers will sign may be very complex. <p>
<a name="fn34">[36]</a> In the Buffalo Ridge area, NSP estimates the cost of
upgrading transmission lines at $100 per kW.<p>
<a name="fn35">[37]</a> The actual cost per kWh would be based on the budgets
and tax capacity of the South Dakota and Iowa counties in which the wind farms
were set up.  These rural areas would probably have similar characteristics to
Lincoln County.<p>
<a name="fn36">[38]</a>  This table, as with all of those used in this report,
is based on Lincoln County data and assumes a current local tax rate or tax
multiplier of 137 percent and a County-wide 10-percent budget increase during
and after wind-power development.  Table 5 used a 122.5 percent local tax rate
because that is the tax rate used in Lake Benton.  That table analyzed not only
the overall impact of wind-energy development on countwide taxes but the impact
on sub-county taxing districts.  Table 11 is used to compare all tax strategies
on a consistent basis.<p>
<a name="fn37">[39]</a> Our calculations do not take into account the impact on
state school fund allocations.   If a county were to dramatically increase its
tax capacity then it is likely that it would be given a reduced allocation of
school tax equalization funds.    In Lake Benton, where the school district
represents a very significant proportion of the overall taxing districts, this
re-allocation could reduce the net financial benefit of wind farm development
under almost all of the scenarios presented here.  It is unclear whether school
funds would be affected by revenues generated from a flat payment. <p>
<a name="fn38">[40]</a>  The legislature would have to clarify how flat payment
revenues would be allocated.  Many possibilities exist.  For example, in the
1970s the legislature enacted a statute that distributed taxes on transmission
lines half to the general revenue fund of the county and 40 percent to the
general school fund of the county. Minnesota Statutes 1994.  Chap. 273.42.
This kind of distribution formula would change the present situation where a
single school district reaps the vast majority of the benefits from power plants.

As directed by the Minnesota legislature, the Minnesota Energy Code is very
stringent, and buildings which meet the code are very energy-efficient.<a
href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn0">[1]</a> In 1998 the code will be more strict. There
is a growing concern that the standards and requirements of the code may be
outstripping the abilities of designers, builders and mechanical contractors to
meet them, and code officials to enforce them. This paper describes the history
and the derivation of the Minnesota Energy Code, and the building science and
energy-saving logic behind them. It will be evident to the reader that the new
codes will require the combined effort of all stakeholders to achieve
compliance and enforcement of the code. The final section offers policy
recommendations for properly implementing the changes in the energy code and
gaining the maximum benefit of the excellent codes that have been adopted.<p>

<b>
<a name="RTFToC1">I.
A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE MINNESOTA ENERGY CODE
</a></b><p>
<b></b><p>
Energy codes in Minnesota have a twenty year history. Prior to 1975,
Minnesota's climate dictated that there be some attention paid to energy in new
Minnesota buildings, but there were no building code provisions governing
energy consumption. In 1975, the State legislature required that an energy code
be developed, primarily as a response to the energy crisis of 1973. In its
authorization to Commissioner of the Department of Administration, the
legislature cited a "compelling need for energy conservation."<a
href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn1">[2]</a> The parameters for the energy code were
established, ordering the Commissioner to "adopt rules governing building
design and construction standards regarding heat loss control, illumination and
climate control."<a href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn2">[3]</a><p>
<p>
The legislature has frequently given guidance to Minnesota codes officials. In
some cases, the directives have been broad policy statements to assist the
overall direction of code-making. In other cases, the legislature has adopted
specific standards or requirements by statute. In the area of broad guiding
policy, the code officials must reconcile the following three directives from
the legislature:<p>
<p>

<UL>
<LI>"To the maximum extent practicable, the rules providing for the energy
portions of the building code shall be based on and conform to model codes
generally accepted throughout the U.S."<a href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn3">[4]</a><p>
<p>
<LI>The Minnesota Energy Code "must be designed to equal or exceed the most
energy-conserving codes adopted by any other state."<a
href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn4">[5]</a><p>
 <p>
	<LI> "The rules shall be economically feasible in that the resultant savings in
energy procurement shall exceed the cost of the energy conserving requirements
amortized over the life of the building."<a
href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn5">[6]</a><p></UL>


<B>The Early Years</B><p>
<u></u><p>
<u></u>Minnesota's first energy code was effective January 30, 1976, within ten
days of the inauguration of President Jimmy Carter, the last U.S. President for
whom energy conservation was a priority issue. During the early years, the code
was very simple and residential energy standards could generally be met with
six inches of attic insulation, an insulated two-by-four wall and storm
windows. <p>
<p>
<B>
<a name="RTFToC2">The
Middle Years:  Working from the Model Energy Code
</a></B><p>
<u></u><p>
In a second phase of development from 1982 to 1992, the focus was on
integrating Minnesota's needs and the Model Energy Code of the Conference of
American Building Officials (CABO). In 1982, the State legislature moved some
of the authority for the Energy Code from the Department of Administration to
the Minnesota Energy Agency, now the Minnesota Department of Public Service
(MDPS). While MDPS authors the code and provides technical support, the
Building Codes Division is accountable for enforcement, training and and the
mechanical portion of the building code. <p>
<p>
In 1983 the State adopted the Model Energy Code, 1982 edition. Two years later
the code was upgraded to be consistent with the Department of Housing and Urban
Development's (HUD) minimum property standards for residential construction.
This required that wall construction generally shift from 2x4 to 2x6 to
accommodate six-inch fiberglass batts. Attic insulation levels were doubled
from the prior period and foundation walls were insulated as well. <p>
<p>
<B>
<a name="RTFToC3">Beyond
the Model Energy Code
</a></B><p>
<u></u><p>
<u></u>The legislature in 1991 enacted statutes that set high goals for the
energy code for both commercial and residential buildings, including the
provision that the Minnesota Energy Code be as rigorous as any state's. In
commercial buildings, this required higher-efficiency building envelopes,
lighting and heating-ventilating-and-air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. The
American Society of Heating Refrigeration and Air-conditioning Engineers
(ASHRAE) had recently completed work on a rigorous standard for the energy
performance of commercial buildings, Standard 90.1-1989. This was specified in
Minnesota statute as Minnesota's new commercial energy code.<a
href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn6">[7]</a> The federal government followed Minnesota's
lead in the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct), and required all states to move
their commercial building codes to compliance with ASHRAE  Standard
90.1-1989.<a href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn7">[8]</a><p>
<p>
By September 1992, the Energy Code was amended for commercial buildings to meet
the statutory requirements mandating Standard 90.1-1989 as performance
minimums. In some aspects, Minnesota codes exceeded the ASHRAE standard.<p>
In commercial lighting, the Minnesota legislature went a step further,
requiring that our minimum standards be equivalent to those required in new
Federal buildings.<a href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn8">[9]</a> To our knowledge, no
other state has adopted these very aggressive lighting standards as their
minimum commercial codes. In 1993-94, the Department of Public Service was
supported with a grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to
assist in the implementation of these rigorous requirements. <p>
<p>
Major changes in 1994 address residential airtightness and air quality issues,
and will be fully explored below. In 1994, a new rule was adopted requiring
that for January 1998, Minnesota's minimum residential energy code will be
equivalent to the best 1% of homes now constructed in Canada -- all Minnesota
new homes then will be built to the Canadian Home Builders Association's (CHBA)
R-2000 standard.<p>
<p>

<a name="RTFToC4">II.
MINNESOTA'S ENERGY CODE: HOW ENERGY-EFFICIENT IS IT?
</a></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>Minnesota's energy code lags behind the best codes in the world, but is
excellent when compared to other states. Builders in Sweden, for example, built
houses in 1984 to an energy code (ELAK1984) that is stricter than the 1998
Minnesota code. However, Minnesota code-makers have met their statutory charge
to create an energy code as stringent as that of any state, according to a 1995
report of the Alliance to Save Energy (ASE). In its <u>Report Card on State
Residential Energy Building Codes</u>, ASE rated Minnesota A+, along with five
other states.<a href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn9">[10]</a> <p>

<a name="RTFToC6">Minnesota's
Energy Code Compared to Model Energy Code
</a></B><p>
<u></u><p>
<u></u>In 1992 the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) required that each State report to
the Secretary of the U.S Department of Energy (DOE), comparing its State energy
codes for residences with the Council of American Building Officials (CABO)
1993 Model Energy Code. For commercial buildings, the states must certify that
their standards do meet or exceed the Model Energy Code. On October 18, 1994,
in a letter to Christine Ervin, the Assistant Secretary for Conservation and
Renewables at DOE, DPS Commissioner Kris Sanda certified that the Minnesota
Energy Code for residences equals or exceeds the Model Energy Code. For
commercial buildings, Minnesota's standards are more stringent than either the
Model Energy Code, 1993 edition or the Standard 90.1 1989.<p>
<p>
A comparison of the Minnesota Energy Code to the Model Energy Code verifies
that Minnesota standards far exceed the model. Of 36 residential measures
identified for comparison, 25 of the requirements, or 70% were more stringent
in Minnesota. In 9 cases, or 25% of the measures, the codes were equal. In 2
cases, or 5%, the Minnesota code was less stringent. The exceptions were in
foundation wall insulation requirement for northern Minnesota, and pipe
insulation. State code officials felt that insulation of foundations to R-15 in
the northern half of the state was impractical, because it virtually
necessitates an interior application of insulation, and installation of
foundation wall insulation to the outside of foundation may be more effective.
For commercial buildings, 46% of 35 measures (16) were more stringent in
Minnesota than in the Model Energy Code and the remaining 19 were equally as
stringent.<a href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn10">[11]</a> <p>
<B>
<a name="RTFToC7">Minnesota's
Commercial Lighting Codes
</a></B><p>
<u></u><p>
<u></u>The most far-reaching variation between the Minnesota Energy Code for
new commercial buildings and the minimum Federal requirement for all States is
in lighting.<a href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn11">[12]</a> By State statute,
Minnesota has adopted as its code the technical lighting requirements for new
Federal buildings for 1993. These are considerably more stringent than the
lighting requirements of Standard 90.1-1989.<p>
<p>
The requirements are listed as "unit power allowances" -- essentially wattage
budgets for lighting for 125+ different commercial purposes. The power budgets
specify the maximum number of watts that can be used for lighting commercial
space for a specific function. As an example, storage and warehousing in active
use can consume 0.3 watts per square foot, unless the materials stored are fine
rather than bulky. For finer storage, 0.9 watts per square foot is allowable.
<p>
<p>
These rules were in draft form at the time the legislature required their
adoption as code. This forced Minnesota and DOE engineers and analysts to
closely examine the proposed Federal standard, and verify its suitability as a
minimum code. Of 125+ standards, a few were regarded by state lighting experts
as too aggressive. Based on current technology, certain functions in buildings
would not be provided adequate lighting quantity or quality. In particular,
there was concern about standards for classrooms and fast food restaurants.
Based on input from lighting design professionals, standards for classrooms
were corrected in the Minnesota Energy Code, and it is anticipated that DOE
soon will publish revised numbers for the other few standards that are
considered too aggressive.<p>
<p>
The code offers a prescriptive method for compliance, "intended for use with
buildings having simple lighting requirements and where the minimum amount of
calculation and effort to achieve compliance is of primary concern." <a
href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn12">[13]</a>A more complex performance standard allows
wattage credits for using advanced controls. Such controls include occupancy
sensors, daylight sensors, programmable timing controls or lumen maintenance
controls. For example, daylight sensing controls must be capable of dimming
light fixtures to 50% output, and they must control any light fixture for which
a power credit is taken, and that sheds half of its light in a room that
receives daylight.<p>
<p>
A simple summary of Minnesota's energy code for commercial lighting is that it
represents state-of-the-art energy performance in lighting, and is considerably
more complex than prior standards. Full compliance demands enforcement, as well
as high-level training for designers, contractors and enforcement officials.<p>
<p>
In 1993-1994, the Minnesota Department of Public Service used a Federal grant
from the Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to develop, demonstrate and
evaluate the implementation of lighting standards in Minnesota buildings by
providing training. The University of Minnesota provided the training, relying
on the expertise of the Department of Design, Housing and Apparel; the Regional
Daylighting Center; and the Minnesota Building Research Center. The targets of
the training were lighting designers, electrical contractors and building
officials. <p>
<p>
A November 1994 report on the training was submitted to the USEPA by the
Department of Public Service.<a href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn13">[14]</a>  Among
its major findings, the Department concluded that compliance with the lighting
standard would reduce the lighting power requirements for new and remodeled
building by more than 20%. However, the Department also concluded that full
compliance will not occur unless the code is enforced. This finding was based
on surveys of opinions of designers and contractors, and actual practice in
1993. In the first year of the code, it was acknowledged that "there is
substantial compliance even if enforcement is weak."<a
href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn14">[15]</a> About half of new commercial buildings
met the requirements for power budgets, and about a third met the requirements
for lighting controls. The analysis of implementation effectiveness was
conducted by the Minneapolis-based Center for Energy and Environment. A key
recommendation was that electrical inspectors be charged with enforcing the
lighting provisions of the energy code.<p>

To prepare builders for the increasingly-efficient codes of 1998, the current
code allows for two classes of residences to be built -- Category 1 and
Category 2. Both are code-compliant, but Category 1 is more airtight, and
requires mechanical ventilation to be used. It anticipates the expected
minimums for 1998. The following sections will address the technical aspects of
the residential codes and these two levels of performance. The discussion will
focus on four critical performance issues: insulation performance,
airtightness, mechanical ventilation and combustion safety.<p>
<u></u><p>
<B>
<a name="RTFToC10">Effectiveness
of Thermal Insulation
</a></B><p>
<u></u><b></b><p>
<b></b>The Minnesota Energy Code seeks to assure that insulation will perform
in buildings as it is designed. In doing this, Minnesota has made a significant
contribution to the body of codes and standards over the past few years.
Minnesota DPS Senior Engineer Bruce Nelson became increasingly aware that the
performance of insulation materials in laboratory tests was not necessarily
equivalent to their performance in buildings. Minnesota code requires that "all
thermal insulation must achieve stated performance at 75deg.F...and no
less...at winter design conditions." <a href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn15">[16]</a>
In addition, "building assemblies are required to maintain the thermal
performance of required insulation and the integrity of building materials
against cold weather water vapor condensation and intrusion of unconditioned
air."<a href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn16">[17]</a><p>
<p>
The most frequently-sited and controversial example is wind-washing. For
example, if a brisk wind moves through ventilation openings in the roof
overhang, and blows directly through insulation, a deterioration of performance
will result. To combat this, code requires a wind-wash barrier at three
locations: at the attic edge, at overhangs such as bay windows or cantilevered
floors, and at the exterior joints in the building envelope which may allow
wind to blow into a wall cavity. <p>
<p>
Secondly, the performance of some types of insulation is reduced at lower
temperatures, compared to laboratory measurements --namely fiberglass and
mineral fiber loose-fill insulation. Minnesota's performance requirements
effectively eliminates low density insulations in the field, or requires that
it be installed at extra thickness.<p>
<p>
Thirdly, fire stops are required in walls to block air movement:  this prevents
heat-robbing "convective loops" of air flow within the wall cavity. As cold air
falls on the outer surface and warm air rises on the inner surface behind the
wall finish, heat is transferred around the insulation and lost to the
outdoors. <p>
<p>
In addition, air leakage barriers prohibit moisture-laden air from entering the
insulated portions of the building envelope and deteriorating the performance
of the insulation. <p>
<B>
<a name="RTFToC11">Verification
of Insulation Levels
</a></B><p>
<u></u><p>
In addition to requirements that insulation must perform <u>in situ</u> as it
does in the laboratory, the code includes a consumer protection feature which
requires installers to verify insulation levels and quantities with physical
proof. This is generally well-supported by insulation contractors according to
the DPS, since it keeps competition honest. To do this, they must either:  1)
install "insulation thickness markers" at ten foot spacing around attic or 2)
affix a unique portion of each bag to an "attic card." For all residential
buildings, the attic card must be affixed to framing near the attic hatch and
must include the following information:<p>

Airtightness Standards for Residences
</a></B><p>
<u></u><p>
In fifteen years of research into the energy performance of new homes, a focal
issue has always been control over the air leakage of buildings. The challenge
has been to reduce uncontrolled air infiltration and exfiltration as far as
technically feasible, within reason. Because air leakage is driven by wind and
the indoor/outdoor temperature differential, leakage for fresh air cannot be
reliably planned into a house design. <p>
<p>
Neither random nor planned leaks can be trusted to always meet the requirements
of the house and its occupants for fresh air. If leakage is sufficient to
provide adequate ventilation on mild windless days, excessive energy loss and
excessive ventilation will occur during much of the winter. Conversely, a house
with air leakage that provides suitable ventilation on a severe winter day will
have dangerously low levels of ventilation on a calm fall or spring day, unless
the windows are open. Pollutants may build up and result in occupant health
problems. Buildings can suffer rapid deterioration due to excessive humidity
and moisture. <p>
<p>
These analyses are well-documented by building science researchers in many
technical studies and publications, including many by Minnesota's leading
building scientist, Dr. David Grimsrud of the Minnesota Building Research
Center. The large body of work on the subject will not be reviewed here.<p>
	
<B><a name="RTFToC14">A.
Prescriptive Method of Airtightness</B>
</a><p>
<p>
The Minnesota Energy Code has aggressively restricted the allowable air
infiltration into residential buildings.<p>
<p>
The builder following the 1994 code amendments has three options to comply with
the code requirements for airtightness. Many builders strongly prefer
prescriptive standards to performance standards, so they can follow a check-off
list for airtightness. Within that check-off list, the builder can do those
minimum features required of all homes, i.e., Category 2. The minimum
airtightness requirement is that "a barrier against air leakage must be
installed to prevent the leakage of moisture-laden air from the conditioned
space into the building envelope."<a href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn17">[18]</a> This
is often the same polyethylene sheeting used as a vapor retarder. In addition,
items (b), (d) and (g) from the following Table of Requirements must be
present.<p>

<p>
In its Statement of Need and Reasonableness, the Department supported its
decision to established a two-tier residential code. The driving rationale was
the acknowledgment that many builders would inevitably continue to rely on air
leakage and operable windows to provide fresh air. "The Department proposes
that residential buildings, where infiltration and natural ventilation are
relied on to provide necessary year-round ventilation <u>must be constructed in
accordance with only certain provisions</u> of this subpart. Construction of
all other buildings must be in accordance with all items of the subpart"
<i>(emphasis added)</i>.<a
href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn18">[19]</a>The code itself is explicit:  if any
measure "(h),(i),(j),(k),(l) is also installed in a residential building, then
a residential mechanical ventilation system must be installed."<a
href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn18">[20]</a><p>
<p>
To build to a higher standard, the builder may do any of the items h-l from the
Table of  Requirements. If the home is to be a Category 1 home, all the items
on the Table of Requirements must be completed. The items required in order for
the building to qualify as a Category 1 building include air sealing strategies
at the following locations:  (h) electrical boxes and fan housings, (i) rim
joists which form exterior perimeter of floor assemblies (j) the top plates of
interior partition walls (l) the joints between rim joists and exterior walls
as well as the joints between rim joists and foundations. The balance of the
Table of Requirements is for protection of building components against
migration of water vapor [requirement (a)] and for the assurance of the
effectiveness of thermal insulation as described above. <p>

<B><a name="RTFToC16">B.
Performance Alternative for Air Leakage Requirements
</a></B><p>
<p>
Although many builders strongly prefer a prescriptive approach to code
compliance, the code allows for achieving high levels of airtightness through
any alternative means. If this option is selected, the builder must be able to
demonstrate with a blower door that when the house is depressurized to 50
Pascals, the air leakage of the building is no more than 0.24 cubic feet per
minute per square foot of conditioned space. Conditioned space typically
includes the basement, since it is maintained at an indoor temperature. For
example, a two story, 1800 square foot home with a full basement (2700 sq. ft.
conditioned) would be allowed 648 cubic feet of air leakage per minute, while
depressurized with a blower door. For the average weather condition, this is
roughly equivalent to 35 cubic feet per minute for normal house operation. This
is very tight construction. Comparable attention must be given to airtightness
details to meet the performance criterion as to meet the prescriptive
requirements.<p>

<u></u><p>
The efficiency of most appliances for residences cannot be established by State
code. When national appliance standards advanced during the mid-1980's,
manufacturers and efficiency advocates agreed on a higher national standard in
exchange for the prohibition of individual State standards. The preemption does
not cover all components of residential construction, but does apply to
furnaces, water heaters, refrigerators and many other major appliances. Most of
these are not included in the building energy code anyway.<p>
<p>
The mechanical issues which arise in the 1994 code amendments relate to health
and safety issues which result from progress in construction quality. These
issues will come to full fruition in the 1998 code. For example, the decision
to establish two categories of code compliance in the 1994 amendments was
primarily driven by the builders and the building scientists in Minnesota
agreeing that increased airtightness without attention to mechanical
ventilation was a prescription for increasing problems with air quality,
excessive humidity and building deterioration due to moisture. <p>
<p>
In a memorandum that significantly consolidated the views of stakeholders,
building scientist Gary Nelson of the Energy Conservatory wrote to the
Department of Public Service September 12, 1992:<p>
<p>
My main motivation for writing this memo is to strongly encourage you to
postpone the effective date of the requirements to seal ceilings and rim
joists. I am convinced that adopting these rules without dramatically improving
the quality of residential ventilation systems will substantially reduce the
quality of air in new Minnesota houses....It now seems quite obvious that in a
large percentage of today's new homes, natural ventilation does not provide
enough outside air to satisfy on an annual average, the minimum requirements of
our ventilation code.<a href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn19">[21]</a><p>
<p>
The views of building scientists were joined by the Builders Association of
Minnesota (BAM). In a January 8, 1993 letter to the Department, BAM offered its
strategic plan for addressing these issues. BAM acknowledged that natural
infiltration does not meet the then-existing code requirements for ventilation.
BAM also called for delaying code requirements for air-sealing of rim joists
and the intersection of partition wall with ceilings. To its 3,000 members, BAM
urged voluntary use of sealed-combustion or induced-draft furnaces,
water-heaters and appliances by 1993, and urged members to begin installing
residential mechanical ventilation systems as well. Lastly, BAM urged the State
agencies to "actively take steps to adopt Combustion Standards and Ventilation
Standards."<a href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn20">[22]</a> The Association followed up
at the 1993 legislature helping to enact legislation requiring the two affected
departments to cooperate in these matters. In the ensuing months, the
Department incorporated into its proposed code amendments the views of the
builders and the building scientists on airtightness. The Department created a
Category 2 for homes that would not be as airtight as originally proposed, and
would be required to operate windows in the winter for adequate fresh air. This
became the official acknowledgment of what the builders and the scientists had
long been arguing:  many new houses were already in trouble with indoor air
quality. <p>
<p>
It is unlikely that the Category 2 house will be free from these problems, but
it was felt by code officials, builders, and building scientists that the
mechanical ventilation market was not mature enough to mandate that all houses
are mechanically provided fresh air. According to the new code, category 2
houses are buildings "where infiltration and passive ventilation are relied on
to provide necessary year-round ventilation." It is explicit that all houses
must comply with national ventilation requirements for all buildings (ASHRAE
Standard 62-1989). The natural leakiness of buildings cannot be relied upon to
achieve this. From the Minnesota Energy Code:<p>
						<u>				</u><p>
7670.0450 VENTILATION<p>
						<u>				</u><p>
Ventilation systems must be designed to conform with ASHRAE Standard 62-1989.
EXCEPTION: Infiltration does not satisfy the requirement for ventilation in
residential construction.<a href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn21">[23]</a>	<p>
<p>
Therefore, in any category 1 home or any home which includes any of the
Requirements (h) through (l), a residential mechanical ventilation system must
be installed. It must be "capable of introducing and distributing outdoor air
to all habitable rooms and removes indoor air at a rate not less than .35 air
changes per hour, or 15 cubic feet per minute per bedroom plus an additional 15
cubic feet per minute, whichever is greater."<a
href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn22">[24]</a> A very small percentage of new homes
currently comply with this provision, and for the near future, the great
majority of homes will be code-approved only with the representation by
builders that windows are being manually operated in the winter. It has been
suggested only half-jokingly that for buyers of new homes to be aware of this,
windows should be so labeled.<p>
<p>
The Builders Association has responded to this dilemma proactively. It has
convened a Residential Ventilation Standards Task Force to develop an Interim
Standard for Residential Construction. This Task Force is composed of many of
the State's most knowledgeable and capable experts from industry, government
and academia. A draft Voluntary Residential Mechanical Ventilation Standard has
been issued by the Task Force which is "intended to provide guidance and
specifications for the design and installation of residential mechanical
ventilation systems."<a href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn23">[25]</a> Once adopted and
used on a voluntary basis for 1995, 1996 and 1997, this standard will provide a
basis for proper design and installation of mechanical ventilation in all new
houses as it becomes mandatory after January 1, 1998. <p>
<p>
<B>
<a name="RTFToC19">Combustion
Safety: Furnace And Water heater Backdrafting
</a></B><p>
<u></u><p>
<u></u>In his September 12, 1992 memo to the Department, Gary Nelson expressed
the other major health and safety concerns of the builders:<p>
<p>
In addition, the new airtightness standards combined with current Minnesota
building practice with regards to combustion air, will greatly increase the
prevalence of pressure-induced spillage of combustion products including carbon
monoxide, into new houses.<p>
<p>
The concerns about combustion safety raised in the Nelson letter have are not
adequately address by current practice. A far-reaching solution to the problem
is contained in the 1998 version of the code, when no combustion appliances
capable of backdrafting will be allowed. These "sealed-combustion" or
"induced-draft" features are increasingly available and price competitive on
furnaces. The incremental cost is partially offset by a significant utility
rebate offered by some of Minnesota's gas utilities. In Wisconsin, the furnace
market has been substantially transformed, so that guaranteed-safe,
high-performance furnaces are the norm. This transformation is credited to
contractor marketing and utility rebates.<p>
<p>
One provision in the 1994 amendments that is designed to help reduce the
backdrafting problem is a clarification of a requirement for duct-sealing in
the Uniform Mechanical Code.<a href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn24">[26]</a>  "Return
air ducts conducting air into a furnace through the same space as the furnace
must be continuously airtight."<a href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn25">[27]</a> If
followed by practitioners, this provision would prevent negative pressures near
the furnace caused by the furnace blower itself from backdrafting the
combustion gases into the home.<p>
<p>
Local research is underway to follow up on the significant technical and
scientific issues surrounding safety of furnaces and water heater combustion.
The Minnesota Building Research Center (MnBRC), with funding from the Gas
Research Institute is evaluating the problem.<a
href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn26">[28]</a> Much anecdotal and observational data
already exist in Minnesota about combustion spillage. Energy auditors and
trouble-shooters for builders frequently identify homes where the furnace
cannot vent its gases up the chimney while the fan of the kitchen range hood is
operating. In the first phase, the project will develop a protocol for
assessment of the problem. In phase 2 in 1995, the protocol may be applied to a
significant group of Minnesota homes. The MnBRC project involves several local
entities with technical and field expertise, including Sustainable Resources
Center, who will supply field personnel to the work group to test the protocol,
and apply it to a larger group of homes if phase 2 proceeds.<p>

that are designed to equal or exceed the most energy-conserving codes adopted
by any other state. The standards of the R-2000 program do equal or exceed the
most stringent energy conserving codes adopted by any other state. The adoption
of the R-2000 standard is reasonable because thousands of homes in Canada and
many homes in the United States have been constructed to these standards.<a

The R-2000 program was initiated as a pilot project in 1982. The main program
started in the spring of 1986 under the joint administration of Energy Mines
and Resources Canada and the Canadian Home Builders Association. This is a
critical aspect of the program -- it has the stamp of approval and is a
creature of the Canadian builders themselves. It now receives administrative
and technical support from the Canadian government through Natural Resources
Canada.<a href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn29">[31]</a> Researcher Rob Dumont of the
Building Sciences Division of the Saskatchewan Research Council has followed
R-2000 from its beginning as a pilot in the early eighties. Dumont highlighted
some of the issues Minnesota will face when this Canadian demonstration program
becomes Minnesota's basic construction method in 1998.<a
href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn30">[32]</a><p>
<p>
The R-2000 program was developed following Saskatchewan Research Council's
widely-publicized new construction project in 1980, where building scientists
constructed a very-low-energy home in Saskatoon's 11,000 degree-day climate. <p>
The remarkable home spawned interest among selected builders throughout Canada
wishing to bring low-energy homes to market and the R-2000 program was born. <p>
<p>
Starting with incentives of $7,500 to first-time R-2000 builders, and a small
number of demonstration homes, the program was well-received by Canadian
builders and consumers.  Over time, builder incentives were reduced to $500,
and then discontinued. The program is a voluntary one, not a code or a
requirement. Builders use it as a value-added option for home-buyers, giving
the home-buyers confidence that an energy-efficient upgraded home will meet a
uniformly high standard.<a href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn31">[33]</a> Thousands of
homes have been certified by the Canadian Home Builders Association as R-2000.
<p>
<p>
In some provinces, such as New Brunswick where inexpensive natural gas is
unavailable, fully twenty percent of the new homes built receive the R-2000
certification, proving that the methods can be transferred to a large market
and a large pool of builders. Across Canada, approximately 1% of the new homes
are R-2000, so market penetration is still modest. <p>
<p>

R-2000 Costs and Benefits
</a><p></B>
<p>
It is required by Minnesota law that the code "shall be economically feasible
in that the resultant savings in energy procurement shall exceed the cost of
the energy conserving requirements amortized over the life of the building."<p>
<p>
A 1989 study by the Canadian government which monitored the energy performance
of selected R-2000 homes found that energy for space heating averaged 62% of
the energy use of homes built to the minimum requirements of the Canadian
building code. On average the homes used 4% less space heating energy than the
program target. For total energy use, the R-2000 home used 77% of a home built
to the existing energy code of Canada.<a href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn32">[34]</a>
A few Canadian banks have formally recognized that lower operating costs leave
owners with more money to pay their mortgage loan. This reduced risk of default
led the Bank of Montreal to cut the interest rate on R-2000 homes by a quarter
point.<p>
<p>
The average incremental cost of an R-2000 home is approximately 2%-2.5%,
according to a 1989 study.  This was cost-effective, unless one assumes very
low natural gas costs (e.g., $2.00 MCF). The program was found to be most
cost-effective in Manitoba with gas prices comparable to Minnesota, but much
less cost-effective in Alberta where natural gas prices were 50% lower.<a
href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn33">[35]</a> <p>
<p>
Lower energy costs can offset the amortized incremental cost, resulting in a
positive cash flow immediately. Some builders are particularly adept at meeting
the higher levels of performance with less investment. For example, Bigelow
Homes of Chicago is not an R-2000 builder, but builds homes comparable to the
R-2000 home. Bigelow's homes are so efficient that they need no furnace. Most
are heated with a high-efficiency water heater that serves a dual purpose.
Heating bills are guaranteed for three years as a marketing strategy, and are
often less than half of comparable new homes in the area. The cost of conserved
energy in a Bigelow Home is 10-20cents/therm compared to the cost of gas which
averaged 40cents/therm during the study period, according to Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory.<a href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn34">[36]</a> Some R-2000 builders report
that the very stringent airtightness standards have become inexpensive and
routine to meet, with the maturing of technical know-how and methods. Brian
Usher of Branta Homes in Vernon, British Columbia reports to Rob Dumont that
his incremental cost for achieving R-2000 airtightness is now under $100. A
Winnipeg consulting firm UNIES, Inc. has compiled what it thinks are the best
methods for achieving airtightness of various interstices of houses, and has
published drawings under the name Easy Air Tightness.<a
href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn35">[37]</a> <p>
<p>
	
<B><a name="RTFToC23">C.
R-2000 Technical Requirements
</a><p></B>
<p>
It should be understood that the R-2000 airtightness standard is very
stringent. At 50 Pascals pressure difference using a blower door, the volume of
house air can exchange only 1.5 times per hour. Such homes are atypical in
Minnesota in 1994. For category 1 houses in the 1994 code, one option for
meeting the airtightness provision is to be able to demonstrate airtightness
levels of 0.24 cfm per square foot (about 1.8 air changes). So for all
Minnesota new houses beginning in 1998, construction will be about 15% tighter
than the value adopted for Category 1 homes in the current Minnesota code. To
be certified as R-2000 in Canada today, airtightness must be measured with a
blower door by a R-2000 certified individual. <p>
<p>
By far, the biggest cost increment for the R-2000 home is the mandatory
residential ventilation system. All homes must have a mechanical ventilation
system installed by an R-2000 certified installer, and all homes must have the
actual delivered fresh air flows to the living space measured and certified. To
achieve the energy consumption targets, almost all ventilation systems use heat
exchangers to recover energy from heated or cooled house air before the air is
exhausted. Because mechanical ventilation is required, R-2000 homes experience
very few problems with air quality and moisture.<p>
<p>
Neither do R-2000 homes face the health and safety risks of combustion
appliances failing to properly draft:  all furnaces and water heaters are
induced-draft or sealed-combustion appliances which are incapable of spilling
combustion gases into homes. Neither are open-hearth fireplaces allowed, but
only fireplaces which are atmospherically isolated from the living space. A
window to look in at the fire is fine, but the air to burn the fire must come
directly from outdoors, not the house. <p>
<p>
According to Dumont, the electrical energy demanded by the mechanical
ventilation system poses a significant opportunity for further technical
improvement. Due to the design of fans and heat exchangers, the power needed to
move the air is often about 125 watts -- comparable to having 10 standard
compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulbs on all the time. Considerable research
and development could improve the forward curved stamped-steel rotors often
used in fans, and could optimize core design, air flows and electricity
consumption. Much of the performance efficiency of ventilation systems is
related to the installation of ductwork in houses. To improve the performance
of installed ventilation systems, the Canadian Heating Refrigeration and
Air-conditioning Institute (HRAI) has offered certification courses for
installers of residential ventilation systems for several years. A certified
installer must be utilized to install the mechanical ventilation equipment in
R-2000 homes. <p>
<p>
Training heating contractors now to install ventilation systems is essential if
the market is to be ready to supply the expected 1998 demand. In 1990, the
certification course for energy-recovery ventilation systems was locally
offered. A mailing of 11,000 pieces to all heating and ventilating contractors
in a multi-state area surrounding Minnesota brought two responses. Presumably,
the view of contractors was that there was not a sufficient market to warrant
having the skill or the certification.<p>
<p>
Outside of some larger municipalities, heating and ventilating installers do
not require licensing in Minnesota. Statewide heating contractor licensing
following the model of statewide builder licensing may be desirable. Including
ventilation system skills in the knowledge necessary for a license may be one
way to significantly build Minnesota's capacity to correctly install
residential ventilation systems.<p>
<p>
Another key feature of the R-2000 home program is the computer simulation of
energy performance for the homes. The government supports and regularly updates
low-cost energy-use software HOT2000 for the PC and the Macintosh. The builder
applying for R-2000 certification must present a computerized energy use
analysis of the space heating and water heating of the proposed home and meet a
strict performance standard. This standard varies by climate, but for example,
in Saskatchewan's climate of 11,000 degree days Fahrenheit (colder than
International Falls), the design must use no more than 60 kWh/square meter of
floor area. With high performance windows and high efficiency heating
equipment, this could be achieved with the standard 2x6 wall construction which
is currently typical in houses complying with the Minnesota Energy Code. It is
more frequent for Canadian R-2000 builders to use an extra inch of thermal
insulation sheathing to reduce the heat loss through the wood framing
members.<p>
<p>
The R-2000 technical requirements pose new questions for Minnesota code
officials:<p><UL>
<LI> Airtighness must be verified by a certified blower door tester. Who will
test?<p>
<LI> How will these testers be certified, and who will be the certifying
authority?<p>
<LI> Ventilation systems must be installed by certified installers, but who will
certify?<p>
<LI> Who will run the HOT2000 computer simulations of energy use for each house?<p>
<LI> Will the State supply the needed technical support for the software? <p></UL>

POLICY ISSUES RAISED BY THE MINNESOTA ENERGY CODE
</a></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><B>Enforcement of the Minnesota Energy Code </B><p>
<u></u><p>
The DPS concedes in its current Quadrennial Report on Energy, <i>Transition to
the Twenty-First Century </i>that the energy code is not being adequately
enforced. "The full energy-saving benefit of the code changes are not being
realized because in many cases they are not being implemented."<a
href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn36">[38]</a>Deficiencies exist related to geographic
availability of enforcement, state-level technical support, local staffing and
resources for enforcement, training for enforcement officials, training for
builders as well as architects, designers and specialty contractors.<p>
<p>
	
<B><a name="RTFToC26">A.
Geographic Availability of Enforcement</B>
</a><p>
<p>
Seventeen Minnesota counties have so far adopted the code, including Steele and
Winona counties in 1994. In the other 70 counties, most towns over a population
of 2500 do some code enforcement, although it is not uniform. Still, many local
municipalities have no capacity whatsoever for plan review, building
inspections or code enforcement. Non metropolitan counties have the authority
to decide by referendum that the building code is not applicable within their
jurisdiction.<a href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn37">[39]</a> In the future, failure to
adopt the building code may cause property insurance rates to rise
dramatically. The secondary insurance markets are evaluating their risks in
every U.S. community, in the wake of building code problems that came to light
in the wake of Hurricane Andrew. Universal enforcement of the building code is
a difficult political issue that has not been addressed by the legislature in
many years. Builders who work to comply with the code are frequently strong
advocates for geographically-uniform enforcement, for competitiveness reasons.
More than 80% of new construction occurs in areas where the code is adopted. <p>
<p>
<b>Recommendation: The Minnesota legislature should assure that the energy code
is enforced throughout Minnesota.</b><p>
<b>	</b><p>
<b></b>	
<B><a name="RTFToC27">B.
State Support for the Minnesota Energy Code</B>
</a><p>
<p>
For all its accomplishments on energy codes, the Department of Public Service
has only one person (at .5 FTE) whose job is to research, upgrade and
administer the promulgation of codes amendments for both residential and
commercial buildings, and to provide education to builders, architects and
building officials. The Energy Information Center of DPS is available to answer
incoming questions about the code. The Building Codes and Standards Division
has no staff dedicated to energy.<p>
<p>
By contrast, in Washington State, where there is a very strong program to
support the implementation of energy codes, there are eight State-level
technical staff working solely on residential energy codes and four staff
working on commercial codes. Granted, this support has been well-funded by the
Federal Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), and may be gearing down due to
shifting priorities.  In partnership with BPA, Washington has been paying local
code jurisdictions to offer energy education to codes officials and builders.
In addition, software is being provided to local officials to run energy
consumption analyses with builders to assess the energy performance of
different combinations of measures.<p>
<p>
<b>Recommendation: Minnesota must provide significant additional statewide
technical support, either through contracts or staffing, to assure the proper
dissemination and implementation of the Minnesota Energy Code. This will
require additional financial resources.</b><p>
<b></b><p>
	
<B><a name="RTFToC28">C.
Local Resources for Code Enforcement
</a><p></B>
<p>
As the code increases in complexity, existing code enforcement will require
additional staffing in some capacities. For example, in the area of commercial
lighting, the Department made this finding in its November 1994 report to the
EPA. <p>
<p>
The resources needed for enforcement do not currently exist within code
enforcement departments. To perform a plan review and site visits to enforce
the lighting standard for a 50,000 square foot building would require a
knowledgeable inspector about 15 hours. Enforcement authorities do not have
excess staff time for this activity. Authorities will need to add a surcharge,
or rely on other sources of additional funds to pay for new staff or contract
enforcement. One city has recommended a permit fee of one percent of the
valuation of the lighting package to pay for enforcement of the lighting code.
<p>
<p>
In addition, the Final Report on the lighting standards implementation project
raised the issue of inspections. Lighting code compliance for commercial
buildings is generally achieved by plan review. It was determined that a site
inspection should include inspection of electrical components by an inspector
with a master electrician's license, so Minnesota statute should include the
lighting aspects of energy code within the enforcement responsibility of
electrical inspectors. <p>
<p>
Another example is in the area of residential airtightness and ventilation
system performance. Codes officials should have ready access to blower doors
and to airflow measurement devices. How airtightness provisions should be
verified in Minnesota after 1998 is yet to be determined. However, local codes
officials should begin to gain the capabilities and the hardware to help
builders understand the priority of the airtightness and the ventilation
provisions. This will increase the number of builders able to construct
Category 1 homes, and ease the transition to 1998 when they are mandatory.<p>
<p>
<b>Recommendation: Additional financial, staff and equipment resources should
be made available to local jurisdictions to enable enforcement of the code, and
to allow inspectors more time to assist builder education. Electrical
inspectors should be given the authority to inspect for lighting code
compliance. Surcharge fees of $3 million are annually raised, but Building
Codes and Standards Division costs are only $1.9 million. Any funds not needed
for training requirements should be returned to local jurisdictions to support
their increased costs of enforcement.</b> <b></b><p>
<b></b><p>

Training for Enforcement Officials
</a><p></B>
<p>
In its June 29, 1993 Statement of Need and Reasonableness (SONAR) for the code
amendments adopted June 1994, the Department acknowledges that code officials
have difficulty understanding the energy code. "Building officials who enforce
the code have expressed to the department that the present energy code is very
confusing."<a href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn38">[40]</a> Discussion with individual
inspectors indicate that building codes officials know parts of the code, and
enforce the parts with which they are familiar, or parts which seem most
important. To partially address this confusion, the 1994 publication of the
Minnesota Energy Codes Rules Package assembles all the information in one
document.  <p>
<p>
A common complaint of inspectors is the insufficiency of training on the energy
code. When asked for an opinion about whose job it is to train inspectors on
the code, an official from a fast-growing metro suburb presumed it was the
Department of Public Service, the same agency who authors the energy code. <p>
<p>
The Department has statutory authority to do builder training, drawing from a
late 1970's amendment to their authorization statute, but statutes are silent
on whether the Department may or should conduct energy training for codes
officials. The responsibility for code enforcement and by extension energy code
training may more squarely fall on the Building Codes and Standards Division of
the Department of Administration (BCSD). However, since BCSD has no authority
to write or promulgate energy codes, it devotes no full time staff to energy.
<p>
<p>
Pilot efforts to provide training to codes officials have been undertaken, such
as the USEPA-funded demonstration program under which the University of
Minnesota conducted lighting code training. Enforcement officials were a target
audience along with designers and lighting contractors. In addition, the
Department of Public Service has contracted with code inspectors David Drenth
and Ed Pierre of Bloom-ington to conduct some energy code training, and former
DOA codes official Duane Grace has independently offered training. In Ely, some
training is occurring as well. <p>
<p>
There is not, however, a well-developed, universally-available curriculum for
all officials, on the residential code or the commercial code. The high-caliber
training developed for lighting code implementation could continue to be
offered to codes officials if resources are available, but the pilot grant from
the EPA has expired.<p>
<p>
<b>Recommendation: </b> <b>All officials involved in the enforcement of the
Minnesota Energy Code should receive regular, on-going training. The Building
Codes and Standards Division (BCSD) of the Department of Administration is lead
agency, but does not have the required technical capacity in energy. The
Builders Association of Minnesota, the University of Minnesota and the
Department of Public Service should be given authority over technical content.
Costs can be minimized by combining code official training with builder
training as described in the following recommendation.</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>

Builder Training for Energy Code Compliance
</a><p></B>
<p>
Following legislation passed in recent years, the Department of Commerce
licenses builders statewide. Prior to testing for a building contractor's
license, the State provides builders some classroom training, which does not
include sufficient information on the Minnesota Energy Code. According to
Department of Commerce printed materials, about 5% of the contractors test will
cover "associated trades" -- including energy codes, plumbing, electrical and
heating, ventilating and air conditioning. The recommended reading list for the
contractor exam does not include the Minnesota Energy Code.<p>
<p>
In Minnesota, a major effort was undertaken in by the Builders Association of
Minnesota (BAM) and the University of Minnesota Building Research Center, in
cooperation with many private firms and educational organizations to develop a
program of advanced trainers for builders. It was developed in the first half
of 1993 and proposed as an Alternative Conservation Improvement Program to the
Commissioner of Public Service on July 28, 1993. Entitled "Effective
Implementation and Delivery of Energy-Efficient Technologies and Practices,"
the project was driven by the strategic plan of the Builders' Association of
Minnesota, and not by the newly emerging code amendments.<a
href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn39">[41]</a> <p>
In fact, the amendments adopted to the code in June 1994 were very much
influenced by the BAM strategic plan, which did not wish to continue to
increase building airtightness without simultaneously addressing the health and
safety issues of combustion appliances and necessary mechanical ventilation.
This is evidenced by the June 1993 DPS Statement of Need and Reasonableness for
the 1994 code amendments. "The BAM has adopted a Strategic Plan calling for all
residential construction to be airtight with mechanical ventilation." <p>
<p>
The proposed BAM training plan focused on understanding buildings as systems,
learning to recognize the complex interactions between building shell
components, mechanical components and occupants. This methodology was
recognized by all as superior to a mere step-by-step guidance to code
compliance, a method which would not have left a foundation for new design
problems, new technology and innovations which are continually presenting
themselves to builders.<p>
<p>
The plan combined many resources from institutions with the BAM as the lead
agency. BAM and its partners approached the state's regulated utilities for
financial support for its four-year plan to train the builders on the energy,
airtightness, thermal performance as well as the indoor air quality, combustion
safety and mechanical ventilation issues inherent in new construction.
Minnegasco and NSP, however, intended to develop their own version of support
for high-efficiency new construction, more focused at a pilot project level
with rebates for higher performing components or practices. Minnesota Power
already had such a rebate program. So BAM took its proposal to the Department
of Public Service, who holds final authority over utility conservation budgets
within the unfortunately restrictive caps imposed by the 1991 legislature.<p>
<p>
<p>
In its comments on the plan, the Sustainable Resources Center (SRC) urged the
Commissioner to accept the project, arguing that the project would be
"transformational" for the industry. "This project," the comments continued,
"does not promise small incremental changes that save energy one by one, but
instead envisions a quantum move forward for the whole industry." Comparing the
potential in Minnesota to the Swedish housing quality revolution in the 1980's,
SRC saw that a project initiated and controlled by the builders had the
potential for that kind of transformational impact. It was further argued that
the project will "create sufficient builder skills and consumer awareness that
market pressure will make it impossible to market homes that are not highly
efficient."<a href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn40">[42]</a> Half a dozen other groups
commented in support of the plan. It represented a significant start, yet it
was modestly budgeted at $2,373,000 over four years, and was flawed by a lack
of financial support from the State and from builders themselves. In addition,
it would have been strengthened if it had more heavily drawn on existing
materials of the Canadian Home Builders Association, developed in support of
the R-2000 program.<p>
In urging the Commissioner to decline approval of the BAM project, the metro
utilities also compliment the BAM on a "positive effort" and expressed
encouragement for "their desire to educate their builders." The basis for NSP
and Minnegasco opposition to the BAM proposal was that it constituted "utility
ratepayer support for professional training and duplication of available
resources."<a href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn41">[43]</a> The Commissioner declined
the project and instead encouraged the builders to work with the utility in
developing the small pilot for direct energy savings.<p>
<p>
NSP and Minnegasco continued to develop a joint program for promoting
high-efficiency new construction. The NSP/Minnegasco Energy Advantage Home
program is by many accounts a good start-up, receiving a national award for
innovation in late 1994. The scale of the project is small. Fewer than one
percent of housing starts can be served. In their submission of the program to
the Public Service Commissioner, the utilities acknowledge an unusually heavy
attraction of free riders, builders who are already building energy-efficient
homes. But the program is expected to help those builders reach a higher level
of performance.<p>
<p>
The scale of the approved program was such that it was never designed to be a
substitution for the BAM proposal -- it was never intended to be a
transformational effort to change the way houses are built in Minnesota. The
building industry itself has the willingness to bring along the needed
transformation, but must have resources to help. It is proposed that a
$1,000,000 annual training budget is needed from 1995 until 1999, to position
the industry for the coming change. This should suffice to meet the training
needs of both codes officials and builders.<p>
 <p>
To get a perspective on the potential cost-effectiveness of this approach,
recall the example of Washington State. The power planning agency estimated
that new codes deferred 215 megawatts of power plant construction. Power plants
typically have a capital cost of a million dollars per megawatt, or $215
million for power plants that need not be built. While acknowledging that many
more homes are heated with electricity in the Pacific Northwest than in
Minnesota, this example gives an order of magnitude estimate of the high energy
savings potential of effectively- administered high-level energy codes.<p>
<p>
<b>Recommendation:  The State of Minnesota Building Codes and Standards
Division</b> <b>and Department  Public Service, the University of Minnesota and
the Builders Association of Minnesota should form a partnership for builder
training. BAM should be the lead organization and fees assessed to their own
membership should help support the training up to $150,000 per year. This
program should be supported by a legislative appropriation of $500,000 per year
for the next five years supported by existing revenue from the surcharge on
building permits. To support this effort, a Conservation Improvement Program
for $350,000 should be developed involving all regulated utilities, assuring
that utility funding supports energy-efficient construction within the utility
service territory. Unregulated utilities should be solicited for
participation.</b><p>
<b></b><p>
	
<B><a name="RTFToC31">F.
Training for Commercial Code Compliance and Enforcement
</a><p></B>
<p>
In 1993 the Northwest Conservation Act Coalition reported on an ambitious new
commercial code for the State of Washington. When announcing the adoption of
the code, the State's Building Code Council also announced a companion
training, education and enforcement support package to assure effective
implementation. Utilities agreed to fund costs of training and enforcement
until 1997. For the Northwest Power Planning Council that oversees resource
planning for the Bonneville Power Administration, it was a deal to cheap to
pass up. The new code was equivalent to buying those 215 average megawatts of
electricity over 20 years at a real levelized cost of only 15 mills per
kilowatt-hour, less than half the cost of their next cheapest option to buy new
power.<p>
<p>
Minnesota can also buy inexpensive energy-efficiency instead of large amounts
of new supply, but only if new commercial codes are fully implemented. For
lighting alone, one year of compliance with 1993 standards in new and remodeled
buildings in Minnesota would save 32,500 MWh of electricity (costing $1,950,000
and generating 35,000 tons of carbon dioxide), according to the November 1994
DPS report to the US EPA.<a href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn42">[44]</a> The
recommendations here for the State are drawn in part from the Department of
Public Service's recommendations in its report to the US EPA on Commercial
Lighting Standards Implementation.<p>
<p>
<b>Recommendations:  The State of Minnesota and the University of Minnesota
should expand on its pilot effort to deliver training to implement the lighting
code by forming an on-going partnership for commercial energy code training.
The University's  Minnesota Building Research Center should be the lead
organization. The expansion should include enforcement personnel, lighting
designers, commercial architects, utilities and manufacturers representatives.
Where possible, training should be targeted for separate audiences. This
program should be supported by a legislative appropriation of $250,000 per year
for the next five years. To supplement the State appropriation, the DPS should
solicit and approve a Conservation Improvement Program for $150,000 per year
involving all regulated utilities pro-rated to utilities based on new
commercial meter connections. Unregulated utilities should be solicited for
participation.</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	
<B><a name="RTFToC32">G.
Performance Verification Before Connection To Utility
</a><p></B>
<p>
An additional enforcement tool available to the State is to require
verification of code compliance for energy before allowing a utility to connect
a new building. Perhaps this would be most justifiable for electrically-heated
buildings, but there are disadvantages of this method. It would put a
significant hardship on builders or developers to prove code compliance before
hook-up. Costs of bringing buildings into compliance after final-finish would
be considerably higher than in-process.<p>

should help support the training up to $150,000 per year. This program should
be supported by a legislative appropriation of $500,000 per year for the next
five years supported by existing building permit revenues which now flow into
the General Fund. To support this effort, a Conservation Improvement Program
for $350,000 should be developed involving all regulated utilities, assuring
that utility funding supports energy-efficient construction within the utility
service territory. Unregulated utilities should be solicited for
participation.<p>
<p>
<b>6.</b> The State of Minnesota and the University of Minnesota should expand
on its pilot effort to deliver training to implement the lighting code by
forming an on-going partnership for commercial energy code training. The
University's Minnesota Building Research Center should be the lead
organization. The expansion should include enforcement personnel, lighting
designers, commercial architects, utilities and manufacturers representatives.
Where possible, training should be targeted for separate audiences. This
program should be supported by a legislative appropriation of $250,000 per year
for the next five years. To supplement the State appropriation, the DPS should
solicit and approve a Conservation Improvement Program for $150,000 per year
involving all regulated utilities pro-rated to utilities based on new
commercial meter connections. Unregulated utilities should be solicited for
participation.<a href="ecoderpt_fn.html#fn43">[ ]</a><p>

Acknowledgments<p>
<p>
This project was completed under a grant by the McKnight Foundation, with the
support and encouragement of Dan Ray. This paper was printed and distributed
with the assistance of Minnesotans For An Energy-Efficient Economy, Janet
Lussenhop, Executive Director.<p>
<p>
Special thanks for advice and assistance on this project goes to Bruce Nelson,
Senior Engineer for the Minnesota Department of Public Service, one of
Minnesota's most focused and dedicated public servants. Special acknowledgment
for leadership in this field is extended to Joan Archer, Executive Director of
the Builders Association of Minnesota. <p>
<p>
Thank you to Sheryl Carter and Stewart Selman of the Center for Energy and
Environment who are working on similar issues for the Statewide Increasing
Energy Efficiency and Reducing CO2 Project, and who were very generous
discussing emerging views and findings; and to the other CEE staff whose
recommendations for the US EPA's Commercial Lighting Standards Implementation
Project are incorporated in my recommendations. Additionally, Gary Nelson of
the Energy Conservatory helped remind me why Minnesota could well get stuck,
and Rob Dumont of the Saskatchewan Research Council reminded me why we don't
have to. Steve Nadel of the American Council for An Energy-Efficient Economy
has provided thoughtful input into Minnesota policy-level discussions of energy
codes. David Grimsrud and Pat Huelman of the Minnesota Building Research Center
deserve enormous credit for keeping the ball moving forward on efficient,
healthy buildings, and have provided me useful advice on numerous occasions. I
recognize that Rick Korinek continues to shed light on my work from his post at
United Power Association; at DPS his expertise kept me from wandering in the
dark more than once. I appreciate that Peter Herzog of Herzog and Wheeler
talked me out of policy recommendations that wouldn't work. I am also grateful
to unnamed building inspectors who confided why the system doesn't work now. <p>
<p>
Credit for the original idea in 1990 that Minnesota's energy code should
logically be state-of the-art, goes to my friend and originator of many ideas,
David Morris. Finally, thanks to my directors and colleagues at SRC for their
continued commitment to policy-level work.<p>

<p>
<p>
<p>
The following report is submitted as called for by Laws of Minnesota, 1991, Chapter 235, Article 7, Section 1 which states:<p>
<p>
The commissioner of public service shall conduct a study of the potential
market within the state for photovoltaic devices. The study shall focus on
applications where photovoltaics, with and without energy storage, cost less than conventional means of supplying energy and power for those applications. The commissioner shall submit the report to the appropriate committees of the legislature by January 15, 1992.<p>
<p>
<b>Summary of findings</b><p>
<p>
The Minnesota Department of Public Service identified
cost-effective uses of photovoltaics (PV), based on recent experiences in the photovoltaic industry in Minnesota and across the nation. It then identified the potential market for applications in Minnesota state government. In total, nine major types of applications in the Departments of Natural Resources, Transportation, and Public Safety were investigated.  Numerous specific potential installations were identified which, if implemented, would require an investment of $4.4 million. Since the study considered only cost-effective
applications, it is expected that this investment would prove less costly in
these applications than using conventional means to supply the electric
power.<p>
<p>
To realize the potential savings from these PV applications, however, program
managers and other decision makers in state government need to be thoroughly
knowledgeable about photovoltaics, and procedures and incentives need to be in
place that encourage adopting new technology. Currently this is not the case.<p>
<p>
<B>Focus of the study</B><p>
<p>
The Minnesota Department of Public Service searched for PV market
assessments across the United States, hoping that the Minnesota study could be
based on previous analysis. Although considerable experience has been gained in
the use of photovoltaics in many types of applications across the country, no
assessment of the broad market within a particular geographic area, such as a
state, has been conducted. Confined market sectors have been evaluated, such as
the utility sector<!-- Anchor Link Tag --><A HREF="#foot1">[l]</A> or the potential export market<!-- Anchor Link Tag --><A HREF="#foot1">[2]</A>. Evaluation have also
been made of the worldwide terrestrial (non-space) market for photovoltaics<!-- Anchor Link Tag --><A HREF="#foot1">[3]</A>
and for the entire United States<!-- Anchor Link Tag --><A HREF="#foot1">[4]</A>. These studies were either too narrow or
too general to apply to Minnesota, but their information on actual
installations was useful for our study.<p>
<p>
Cost-effective photovoltaic installations, described later in this report, more
often are in applications not connected to utility electric lines and having
low power requirements. Travel and tourism, rail transportation, and
agricultural industries are just some of the sectors of Minnesota's economy
with such applications; but the limited time and resources available for this
project have made it necessary to focus on just one sector. Because the best
documentation of opportunities for cost-effective photovoltaic applications is
in the governmental sector, this study examines state government applications
and their potential for cost-effective PV applications.<p>
<p>
<b>Background on Photovoltaics</b><p>
<p>
A photovoltaic cell is a semi-conductor device that converts
sunlight into direct current electricity. Cells can be combined to produce the
power (voltage and current) required for an application. The solar generated
electricity is frequently stored in batteries for use during non-solar periods.
If alternating current is required, an invertor is used to generate an
alternating current from the direct current produced by the photovoltaic
cells.<p>
<p>
The photovoltaic effect has been known for 150 years, but it wasn't until 1954
that scientists at Bell Laboratories created the first crystalline silicon
photovoltaic cell. Shortly thereafter, in 1958, the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA) selected a photovoltaic system as the electric
power source for the Vanguard space satellite. That was the first
cost-effective application of photovoltaics -- the PV system was the cheapest
means of providing electrical power for the application (even though the cost
was several hundred dollars per watt of power).<!-- Anchor Link Tag --><A HREF="#foot1">[6]</A><p>
<p>
The number of cost-effective applications has increased rapidly. By 1975, NASA
was using nearly a million PV cells per year. Costs continued to decline
through the decade of the 1980s, enabling photovoltaic systems to penetrate the
non-space market. Products such as watches and calculators began to have
photovoltaic systems. Then PV systems expanded into remote power applications,
such as mountain top communication system repeater systems. In the mid-1980s,
PV systems became the power source of choice for residences not connected to
the utility grid and for low power remote or mobile power loads. In all cases,
the PV systems were cost effective --the cheapest source of power for the
application.<p>
<p>
By 1990, the cost of a PV cell had dropped from the early $100-per-watt to just
$3.75 per watt of power.<!-- Anchor Link Tag --><A HREF="#foot1">[7]</A> The worldwide photovoltaic industry is expected to
rise to nearly $800 million in revenue for 1991.<!-- Anchor Link Tag --><A HREF="#foot1">[8]</A> PV systems have become cost
effective in even more applications -- the current rule of thumb is that if the
power requirement is less than 500 watts and it requires more than one power
pole extension to the utility grid, a photovoltaic system may be the preferred
cost-effective power supply option.<!-- Anchor Link Tag --><A HREF="#foot1">[9]</A><p>
<p>
<b>Cost-effective applications for PV systems</b><p>
<p>
Photovoltaic systems are most often cost effective today because
they avoid more expensive processes; they may not produce cheaper electricity.
This is why the search for cost-effective uses focuses on applications that
have no conventional electric power. Even at today's greatly reduced prices for
photovoltaic cells, the absolute energy costs -- the cost of the system
amortized over an estimated 20 year lifetime per unit of energy delivered --
may still be relatively high. The current statewide average retail residential
cost of electricity in Minnesota is just under 7cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh),
while the amortized cost of photovoltaic electricity may be over
25cents/kWh.<!-- Anchor Link Tag --><A HREF="#foot1">[10]</A> In some areas of Minnesota, however, electricity costs over
14cents/kWh and rates are projected to increase.  Conventional and photovoltaic
electricity costs are close enough that some utilities are currently evaluating
the use of photovoltaic systems in specialized applications.<!-- Anchor Link Tag --><A HREF="#foot1">[11]</A><p>
<p>
Photovoltaic systems are typically cost effective for one of two major
reasons:<p>
<p>
First, the initial cost (purchase and installation) of a photovoltaic
system may be substantially cheaper than-that of another option for new power
supplies. Some actual examples include:<p>
<p>
<UL>
<LI> A PV lighting system in Minnesota was cheaper than the $2,500 estimated cost
of running an underground electric line to a new boat ramp.<p>
<p>
<LI> A $1,500 PV system cost less than digging through a sidewalk to provide power
for a bus kiosk from an underground power line.<p>
<p>
<LI> A resort owner found it feasible to use a PV system to provide lights on a
dock not served by a utility power line.<p>
<p>
<LI> A billboard rental firm was able to add nighttime lighting with a PV system,
thereby increasing its advertising revenue.<p>
</UL><p>
Second, a photovoltaic system's operating and maintenance costs may be
low enough compared to an existing electric system to provide quick payback of
the initial PV purchase and installation cost. For example:<p>
<p>
<UL>
<LI> A PV system avoided the personnel time and fuel required to transport fresh
batteries to a remote water quality monitoring site every month.<p>
<p>
<LI> PV system avoided the loss of data from a weather monitoring station.<p>
<p>
<LI> A PV system avoided the cost and environmental risk of transporting diesel
fuel to a remote site.<p>
<p>
<LI> A PV system avoided the need to service a remote diesel generator each 250
hours of operation.<p>
</UL><p>
Although the exact financial costs of such problems are difficult to determine,
the agencies installing the PV systems are pleased with their decisions.<p>
<p>
Other favorable attributes of photovoltaics.  Besides cost
effectiveness, PV systems have other advantages that should be noted.<p>
<p>
<UL>
<LI>	They use sunlight, not a depletable fuel.<p>
<p>
<LI> They generate electricity with little impact on the environment.<p>
<p>
<LI>	They have no moving parts to wear out.<p>
<p>
<LI> They make no noise.<p>
<p>
<LI> 	They are modular, meaning that the power source can be expanded to match
changing loads.<p>
<p>
<LI> 	They are reliable and durable.<p>
</UL><p>
<b>Market identification</b><p>
<p>
<b></b>In analyzing potential markets, this study used the following
assumptions:<p>
<p>
<UL>
<LI> The photovoltaic application must be cost effective -- that is, photovoltaics
must be cheaper than any other option.  The procedures for estimating the costs
of photovoltaic systems and their payback periods are described in
<i>Photovoltaic Systems for Government Agencies, </i>published in 1989 by the
Sandia National Laboratories, U. S. Department of Energy. A copy of this
publication is included with this report.<p>
<p>
<LI> The purchaser has all the information and consumer confidence necessary to
make an informed decision and be comfortable with the new technology.<p>
<p>
<LI> The purchaser is making an objective rational decision: For instance, the
purchase is not being made to increase the image of the purchaser, nor is it
being avoided because of personal investments in the oil and gas industry.<p>
<p>
<LI> Equipment is available on the market today  -- no new breakthroughs
intechnology are needed -- and it is instantly available to fulfill an
immediate demand.<p>
<p>
<LI> Applications that can be shown to be cost effective but are not yet widely
used have not been included in the evaluation.<p>
<p>
<LI> Equipment is purchased at today's prices.<p>
<p>
<LI> Equipment will be purchased over a three-year period; after that, some of the
other assumptions will have changed.<p>
</UL><p>
Based on experience in the photovoltaic industry, cost-effective applications
could be found in three major sectors of our economy: governmental operations,
the tourism industry, and agriculture. These applications are listed below:<p>
<p>
<I>Government</I><BR>
Lighting, for public lake access, trails, and rest rooms;<BR>
Communications, including telecommunication repeating stations and emergency
call boxes; <BR>
Vehicle battery charging for snow removal equipment, earth moving equipment,
and emergency vehicles; <BR>
Monitoring, including water level monitors, water quality monitors, and remote
weather stations; <BR>
Warning signals, including weather warning sirens, traffic advance warning
arrow boards, and navigational lights; and <BR>
Off-grid facilities such as state park residences, remote equipment storage
buildings, and fire towers.<BR>
<p>
<I>Travel and Tourism</I><BR>
Residences, such as dispersed cabins and hunting facilities;<BR>

<p>
<I>Agriculture</I><BR>

Stock tank aerators; and <BR>
Water pumps.<p>
<p>
<b>Potential PV applications in Minnesota state government</b><p>
<p>
Research was conducted on nine different classes of
installations.  Contact was made primarily with program managers in state
agencies, including the Minnesota Departments of Natural Resources (Trails and
Waterways, Parks and Recreation, Waters), Public Safety (State Patrol),
Transportation (Electronic Communications, Rights of Way, Traffic Engineering,
Maintenance Equipment Section), National Guard, and the Pollution Control
Agency. Other contacts included:<p>
<p>
Colorado Mountain College, Glenwood Springs, CO<BR>
Electric Power Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA<BR>
Florida Solar Energy Center, Cape Canaveral, FL<BR>
Florida Solar Energy Industries Association, Homestead, FL <BR>
Infinite Energy, Denver, CO<BR>
National Appropriate Technology Assistance Center, Butte, MT <BR>
National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO <BR>
Photocomm, Scottsdale, AZ<BR>
Public Citizen, Washington, DC<BR>
Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM<BR>
Solar Energy Analysis Laboratory, Fort Collins, CO<BR>
Strategies Unlimited, Mountain View, CA<BR>
<P>
Data on system components and costs are based on previous installations in
Minnesota, experiences from other states, and price quotations from Minnesota
businesses. Assumptions on the possible numbers of applications have been
derived from discussions with agency personnel and based on government and
industry experiences in other locations.<p>
<p>
Following is a summary of the research conducted and estimates of the number
and value of potential photovoltaic installations.<p>
<p>
<B>LIGHTING</B><p>
<p>
All of the PV lighting applications identified below would provide lighting
where conventional electric power is currently not available.<p>
<p>
<b>Public lake access</b><p>
<p>
There are 66 state parks in Minnesota, with 58 having fishing access to
lakes or rivers; the state maintains 1,200 public accesses to rivers or lakes.
According to the Department of Natural Resources, most of the public accesses
are in remote locations and need lighting.  Although a thorough evaluation has
not been done, DNR information suggests that perhaps 25 percent of the public
accesses may be appropriate for PV lighting. These installations could be
supplied by packaged systems each with a 200 watt PV panel, controller, and
battery storage costing $2,200 each. The 300 systems would cost a total of
approximately $660,000.<p>
<p>
<b>Trails</b><p>
<p>
The state maintains hiking, horse riding, biking, skiing, and snowmobile
trails. Presumably, cross country skiing could benefit from night lighting.
Installing underground electric power lines over such long distances is clearly
prohibitive. However, modular photovoltaic systems may allow the more heavily
used portions of the trails to be lighted throughout the evening ski period.
Assuming that 10 percent of the-existing 1,230 km of trails could use lighting,
and that the 30 watt systems would be placed each 50 meters, some 2,500 units
would be required. The units cost $400 each, making a total investment of $1
million.<p>
<p>
<b>State park facilities</b><p>
<p>
Minnesota owns and operates approximately 1,000 structures in the 66
state parks. The buildings include rest room facilities, equipment buildings,
meeting facilities, picnic shelters, etc. Lighting is used for security and
safety, as well as to increase the use of the facility, if electric power is
available. According to estimates by DNR, as many as 30 percent of these
buildings, currently without power, could benefit from nighttime lighting.
Photovoltaic system costs would range from $500 to $6,000, depending on the
lighting requirements. At an average of $2,000, lighting for the 300 buildings
needing power would cost $600,000.<p>
<p>
<b>Traffic warning arrow boards</b><p>
<p>
Mobile arrow boards are frequently used for traffic control around road
construction sites. Eight solar powered boards are currently being used by a
private Minnesota firm which leases them to road construction crews, including
crews in the Minnesota Department of Transportation. MNDOT owns about 300
diesel powered warning boards, which have a ten year projected life, and must
replace 10 percent of them each year. Over three years, 90 units could be
replaced with $5,900-solar-powered systems, for a total expenditure of
$530,000.<p>
<p>
<B>COMMUNICATIONS</B><p>
<p>
<b>Telecommunication repeating stations</b><p>
<p>
The Department of Natural Resources maintains 200 telecommunication
sites for the Department of Natural Resources, the Department of
Transportation, and the State Patrol. The vast majority of the existing systems
are connected to the utility grid; the rest are powered by diesel generators.
As the generators wear out, they can be replaced by photovoltaic systems. One
site could be repowered with photovoltaics over the next three years. In
addition, two new sites could be installed near their optimum location powered
by photovoltaics. A typical system requires about 1,400 watts of power and
costs about $24,000. Therefore, $70,000 would be required for the three
systems.<p>
<p>
<b>Emergency call boxes</b><p>
<p>
Solar powered emergency call boxes use cellular phones to Connect the caller
with emergency set/ices. Consequently, the systems can be placed virtually
anywhere served by cellular phone network. Typically, call boxes are placed
about every 500 meters along highways to aide motorists. The systems are
equipped with adequate solar power and storage to withstand many days of no
sun. There are about 400 km of interstate highways in the Twin Cities area
alone, requiring some 800 call boxes. Figuring an additional 25 percent as many
systems would be required, serving the Duluth, St. Cloud, and Rochester calling
areas would require about 200 more boxes, i.e., 1,000 systems in all. At $1,200
each, the total cost would be $1.2 million.<p>
<p>
<B>MONITORING</B><p>
<p>
<b>Water level monitoring</b><p>
<p>
The U.S. Geological Service uses photovoltaic systems extensively to
monitor water levels on navigable waters in the United States, including sites
in Minnesota. Data are collected at the site and relayed to a central office
via telecommunication.<p>
<p>
The Department of Natural Resources maintains approximately 500 surface water
level monitoring stations of its own across the state; however, levels are
monitored weekly by volunteers who visit the sites and read the level on linear
scales. More frequent data are rarely required, since water levels change
slowly in Minnesota.  Automating the recording stations would require major
changes in the procedures for monitoring water levels and a major capitol
investment, well beyond the cost of the PV systems; therefore, no water level
monitoring sites are included in this evaluation.<p>
<p>
<B>VEHICLE BATTERY CHARGING</B><p>
<p>
<b>Seasonal use vehicles</b><p>
<p>
The state maintains approximately 750 dedicated seasonal use vehicles
such as snow plows, snow blowers, road repair vehicles, and mowers. All are
subjected to low battery power and early battery failure from resting for long
periods with no use. Because some of these vehicles must be immediately
operable at all times, they are housed indoors. This more expensive indoor
storage may not be necessary if the battery charge levels could be maintained
by a solar battery charger. Moreover, the vehicles currently stored outdoors
(about 300) would benefit from a solar battery charger. At about $85 each,
these vehicles could be provided with chargers for approximately $25,000.<p>
<p>
<b>Military vehicles</b><p>
<p>
Minnesota has approximately 90 National Guard units across the state.
Each unit has from 6 to 60 vehicles under its jurisdiction. These vehicles are
typically used once per month, though the period of non-use is longer in some
cases. In addition, Camp Ripley has a pool of about 500 vehicles allocated for
two-week periods for training at the camp, though many of these remain idle,
depending on the type of exercises taking place. If 60 percent of the vehicles
in the individual units and 10 percent of the vehicles at Camp Ripley remain
idle for at least two weeks at a time, 1,130 vehicles could benefit from a
solar battery charger. Fitting the vehicles would cost $340,000.<p>

<p>
<p>
<b>Conclusions</b><p>
<p>
This study has investigated possible photovoltaic applications in
state government. It has identified $4.4 million worth of cost-effective
installations. Additional cost-effective installations may be: county, city,
and local governments have many similar types of operations that could
potentially be served by PV systems; other market sectors have many potential
cost-effective applications (utilities, agriculture, advertising,
tourism/travel, private home/lake home owners). A more comprehensive
investigation of these sectors would be expected to reveal additional
cost-effective PV applications in state government as well as other potential
market sectors.<p>
<p>
Such a study could also explore the feasibility of possible governmental
actions to make better use of PV's potential. Certainly at the top of the list
would be education. The cost analysis provided in the study could be used to
educate managers about cost-effective applications.  The current
Energy/Environmental Planning initiative may be a useful mechanism for
implementing such a program.  The study also could explore possible alternative
mechanisms for PV applications.<p>

<!-- Font Tag --><B><FONT SIZE=5>Primergy:  Why the PUC?  Why Now?</FONT></B><BR>
by Diane Jensen, Clean Water Action<P>
In the next 120 days the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) will decide whether to approve a merger of NSP and Wisconsin Energy Corporation into a new $6 billion corporation called Primergy.  Two questions come to mind.  Why should the PUC be making that decision?  Why does that decision need to be made now?   <P>
Electricity is a big business, bigger than airlines or telephones.  Electricity is a necessity of modern life.  The PUC sets rates and oversees the operation of energy utilities.  But the job of deciding whether to allow one of the state's most important companies to merge, become even more powerful, and remove itself from state regulatory control should be the legislature's.  <P>
As of late November, two of the five PUC Commissioners removed themselves from the final decision because of ex parte communications with NSP.  Another Commissioner's seat will soon be vacant.  We could well end up with only two or three people making a decision that affects the lives of every Minnesotan.  Hardly an ideal situation.  The PUC has said it will make the decision by March 1997.  The legislature convenes in late January.  By that time legislators will have available all the substantive information the PUC has.   Isn't the legislature, with its elected representatives and open hearing process, a better venue for this type of decision?  <P>
The second question regarding the proposed merger has to do with timing.  The PUC has opened a restructuring docket whose goal is to study issues involved in redesigning the electric utility system to make it more competitive.  The merger would move us in the opposite direction by effectively reducing the number of competitors.   <P>
By allowing the merger we may be restricting future options.  For example, the PUC may well approve a merger that allows Primergy to own both transmission and distribution lines as well as power plants.  Yet a major component of the restructuring efforts around the country is the separation of the ownership of transmission and power generation.   What if Minnesota later on decides to adopt this strategy?  Would we demand that Primergy sell off its transmission capacity just after it has spent months integrating the transmission capacities of two giant utilities?  Some experts think we might not even have the legal authority any longer to unilaterally require this. <P>
In short, the merger decision may pre-empt restructuring decisions.   Which brings us back to the second question,  why now?   The PUC has launched an industry restructuring docket and has set up a handful of working groups.  There is no rush toward merger.  To our knowledge no one has argued that NSP or WEC would suffer losses if the merger decision were made in 1998 or even 1999 instead of 1997.  <P>
Legal experts tell us that in merger proceedings, the utilities have the burden of proving that it is in the public interest.  But in most states the opposite has occurred.  It is the opponents who have shouldered the burden of proof.   If NSP had the burden of proof theirs would be a difficult case to make.   Merger partners promise operational savings of $2 billion over 10 years.  This translates into about $7.00 per customer per month, if all savings are passed through to customers.  Regulatory staff in both Minnesota and Wisconsin believe the actual savings would be closer to $100 million a year, and the Minnesota Dept. of Public Service estimates they could be as low as $79 million a year. The Wisconsin Citizens Utility Board calculates that the merger actually increases costs.  <P>
<IMG WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=177 ALT="Coal Plant Graphic" SRC="coalplant.jpg">
The merger partners have a combined annual revenue of $4.2 billion.  NSP is proposing to share savings with ratepayers through a 1.5 percent rate reduction and a four-year rate freeze.   Their plan represents a reduction of $0.75 per month for the average consumer, about one-tenth of the total savings claimed by NSP and WEC.<P>
Two thirds of the savings will come from reducing the utilities' labor force, which may mean longer turnaround times for customer service or repairing outages.  <P>
That's the upside.  The downside is a loss of regulatory control to the federal government and the limiting of options available for consideration in the restructuring debate.   ME3 experts have argued that Primergy would increase the generation of electricity from low-cost Twin Cities' coal-fired power plants for sale to new markets thereby increasing pollution.<P>
We end where we began.  Why now?  Why the PUC?<P>
<HR>
<H3>Primergy:  Regulatory Misstep - Part II</H3>
The proposed marriage of Wisconsin Energy Corporation and Northern States Power has run into trouble, again.  First it was the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Wisconsin Public Service Commission concerns that Primergy would have too much market power and too little independent oversight over the operation of their transmission system.  More recently, alleged ex parte communications between utility executives and regulators have turned the merger into a sticky affair in both Wisconsin and Minnesota.<P>
<H4>Minnesota</H4>
Let's begin with the Minnesota situation.  The PUC with the help 
of the Office of Attorney General (OAG) investigated possible ex parte communications between PUC Commissioners Joel Jacobs and Marshall Johnson and NSP lobbyist Merle Anderson.  The two PUC commissioners have recused themselves from voting on the merger even though other PUC commissioners subsequently ruled that the conversations were not serious enough to constitute illegal communication.  Commissioner Storm and the OAG agreed with ME3 that the law was violated. In their October 28th order  the PUC concludes,  " the commission finds tangential, glancing references not addressing the merits of the FERC staff report -- incidental, casual talk of fleeting duration and slight interest to the conversers and ultimately of insubstantial relevance to the merits and outcome NSP's proposed merger application."  ME3, and our coalition partners, Izaak Walton League and the Environmental Law & Policy Center filed a petition asking the PUC to reconsider its decision that NSP's communications with PUC members did not break the law.<P>
The merger case in Minnesota is moving forward with only 3 commissioners for the moment.  A future problem exists when Commissioner Dee Knaak's term expires at the end of December which will leave the PUC with only two members unless Governor Carlson makes a timely appointment.  Public hearings have been completed and the contested case hearing began November 20, 1996.  Three administrative law judges are hearing separate aspects of the merger case including; competitive issues, rate issues, and economic savings.  Separate hearings or testimony on the environmental effects of the merger was ruled outside the scope of the proceeding by the PUC.  It is unlikely that the Minnesota PUC will issue a final ruling on the merger before March 1997.<P>
<H4>Wisconsin</H4>
Ex parte communication and the resignation of one of three Wisconsin Public Service Commission (PSC) members has slowed the merger in our neighboring state.  In Early September, Scott Neitzel, one of the PSC's strongest voices increase competition stepped down to take a job in the private sector, and immediately, loudly condemned the merger.  Governor Tommy Thompson quickly replaced Neitzel with Joe Mettner, former legal assistant to the Governor.  Critics of the appointment note Mettner's lack of experience on utility matters and have suggested that the PSC wait on considering the merger until after his Senate confirmation.<P>
A news report in the November 8, 1996, Capital Times,  reported that PSC commissioner Dan Eastman engaged in private meetings with top executives at  Wisconsin Energy Corporation, since the filing of the merger proposal.  Eastman has denied any wrongdoing and PSC legal counsel has suggested that no illegal communications took place since the meetings were held prior to the official pre-hearing date of July 24, 1996.  Formal hearings opened last month in Wisconsin with PSC staff analysts stating that merger is likely to generate only one-half of the $2 billion in savings that NSP and WEC project over the next 10 years.  Unlike Minnesota regulators, Wisconsin decision makers are allowing testimony on the environmental impacts of the merger. The PSC is also preparing an Environmental Assessment of the merger, pursuant to an Environmental Coalition motion.<P>

<TABLE CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=1 BORDER=2>
<TR><TD><H3>ME3 Position on Retail Wheeling - Adopted October 15, 1996</H3>
We oppose radical restructuring of the electricity industry as proposed by advocates of "retail wheeling".  Instead, we seek environmental improvement and economic development through energy efficiency and renewable energy. <P>
Retail wheeling would increase pollution, reduce reliability, shift costs to small consumers, and eliminate energy efficiency and renewable energy progress.  Retail wheeling masquerades as "customer choice", but customer choice is meaningless in an industry controlled by monopolies and oligopolies.  Winners will be lawyers, lobbyists and middlepersons, and the losers will be most customers and the environment.  Instead of retail wheeling, our proposals improve wholesale competition while increasing opportunities for renewables. <P>
Minnesota has made great progress towards a sustainable energy future.  We need to keep moving forward, instead of returning to a past that ignored energy efficiency and renewable power.  Minnesota needs to "cap" pollution emissions as it "capped" nuclear waste in 1994.  Now is the time to move to the technologies of the future. <P>

<B><FONT SIZE=5>PUC Externalities Ruling:  Climate Change Real But Barely Matters</FONT></B><BR>
by Michael Noble<P>
The five-year process to determine the environmental costs associated with electric power reached the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) for a final decision on September 16th.  By the end, controversy had subsided over the estimated costs of damages due to acid rain, smog, particulates, and ground-level ozone.  Reasonable estimates of environmental damages were assigned to each of the so-called criteria pollutants.  The issue of global warming took center stage.<P>
Final oral arguments by intervenors focused on the future costs of local climate change.  Those hoping for a decisiveness were left confused by the final decision, which as of press time, had not been issued by the PUC in a written order.  In their deliberations the PUC seem to leave open a possibility of assigning $0 to each pollutant.  They also did not indicate how the values would be applied.  The table below shows the range of externality values established by the PUC.<P>

The great climate change discussion resulted in a perplexing outcome--that global climate change is indeed real, but that its estimated costs in present value is very low.  Environmental intervenors sought a damage value for carbon dioxide of $25 per ton, which is within the mainstream of serious economic research into the subject, but is higher than the $15 per ton value adopted by the Wisconsin Public Service Commission.  The PUC adopted a range of $0.30 to $3.10 per ton. <P>
The environmental advocates were unsuccessful in getting the most recent findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) admitted into the record.  This was important because IPCC 1995 confirms that global warming is real, and their damage costs are a few times higher than the estimates recommended by the law judge who reviewed the expert testimony in the case.  The PUC ruled that IPCC 1995 should not be included, since it was issued after the record closed.<P>
To establish the range for carbon dioxide, the PUC concluded that the damage would likely be 1 percent of world economic output within about 35 years (as opposed to "a few percent" predicted by the IPCC ).  These staggering costs were then minimized by use of a discount rate of 3-5% per year.  In other words, trillions of dollars of damages worldwide -- and, by extension, a commensurate amount to Minnesota forests, fisheries, agriculture, wetlands, and human health -- become inconsequential if they are reduced 3-5% per year from the year 2030 back to the present.  <P>
The IPCC suggested that when calculating the costs of climate change, the choice of social discount rates is "a matter of policy preference", another way to say that this a "values" question more than an economics one.  IPCC cites social discount rates of 3-6 percent for long-term, risk-free public investments, but suggests using a 0.5 -3.0 percent discount method may be more appropriate for climate change.  As an example, IPCC says that a $1000 damage in 100 years would be valued in the present at $7.60 using a 5% discount rate, (the high end of the range chosen by the PUC), and would be valued at $370 using a discount rate of 1 percent at the low end of the range of methods preferred by economists concerned about fairness between generations.<P>
Perhaps the climate change debate needs its own Ross Perot, someone who can speak directly to the American people about the debt we are leaving to our children. Unlike the deficit problem which was attacked in a bipartisan way, the damages of climate change cannot be reversed in any timeframe of human significance. Once the climate is altered, our children, and their children and grandchildren will be unable to reverse the effects.  Perhaps the public will soon begin to grapple with this issue that goes to a question of human destiny. <P>

<H3>Search for Alternative Nuclear Storage Site Ends</H3>
The Environmental Quality Board held a special meeting on October 2, 1996 to address Northern States Power Company's (NSP's) application for the nation's first away-from-reactor spent nuclear fuel storage installation.  The EQB denied NSP's application for site approval but approved an order that gives the utility permission to add 4 more dry cask storage containers at the current spent fuel storage facility outside the plant.  This gives the utility permission to use up to 9 casks at the Prairie Island spent fuel storage installation.  The utility has filled five dry casks which are sitting on the concrete pad outside the plant and has the sixth cask on-site.  <p>
<IMG  ALT="Dry Cask Storage" SRC="drycasks.jpg"><BR>
Dry Cask Storage at Virginia Power<P>

The EQB decision was not a big surprise since they had voiced their desire to stop the alternative siting process during last year's legislative session.  The Prairie Island Community has filed to overturn the EQB decision in Minnesota's Court of Appeals. The community contends that the EQB violated state law by not approving an alternative site.  They contend that the 1994 Prairie Island law mandates that a site be established and, since NSP failed to find one, the EQB should have denied the utility any additional dry cask storage capacity.  The community is also asking the Court to prevent NSP from filling the sixth cask until final rulings on the appeal are settled. <p>
In early August, NSP initiated a parallel approval process with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for an alternative site.  Since the site requires State certification and approval, which has now been denied, the EQB requested that NSP ask the NRC suspend or terminate its review of the application.  NSP agreed and on November 13th, 1996, asked the NRC to suspend any actions on the application at least until the appeals court decision is released.  Seven parties have been given intervener status in the NRC process including:  EQB, Department of Public Service, Prairie Island Community, City of Red Wing, City of Lake City, Florence Township, and the combined Prairie Island Coalition/ Citizens United for Responsible Energy.<p>
NSP estimates that the siting process will cost about $9 million.  The figure includes NSP's reimbursement of about $140,000 spent by the EQB.  It does not include costs incurred by other parties.<P>

<H3>Competitive Building Initiative Launched in Twin Cities</H3>
ME3 coalition member Center for Energy and Environment (CEE) is the lead organization for a five-year project that will reduce energy consumption by 25 percent, lower maintenance costs, and improve comfort levels in commercial and multi-family buildings in the Twin Cities.  Five years of administrative and monitoring expenses totaling $700,000 for the Competitive Building Initiative (CBI) is supported through a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy's Rebuild America program.  CEE will coordinate the project that includes ten public and private business partners.<P>
CEE will work with building owners in Minneapolis and St. Paul to (1) identify buildings with energy savings potential; (2) analyze building energy systems; and (3) provide an unbiased source of information for processes, products and services to reduce energy consumption by 25 percent.  After initial audits have been completed, building owners will work with CEE to find ways to finance the identified improvements.  A variety of funding sources including performance contracting, low-interest utility financing, commercial lending, and public school bonding authority will be tapped to support the $5 million in energy-efficiency investments projected for the project.  <P>
CEE expects that 200-300 buildings will be initially screened with 20-30 being selected for full audits and retrofits.  Commercial properties will likely comprise about 80-90 percent of the buildings covered under the project.  The CBI project will emphasize follow-up monitoring, tracking the effectiveness of improvements to help illustrate the cost-effectiveness of energy efficiency.  CEE's project leader Richard Szydlowski predicts that the CBI program will provide a solid foundation for building owners to asses the economic benefits of energy efficiency and will lead to further investments in remaining building stock.<P>

<H3>Federal Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Funding Preserved</H3>
In response to intense efforts by energy advocates and bipartisan leadership of the 100+ member House Renewable Energy Caucus, Congress rejected proposals to slash the Department of Energy's energy efficiency and renewable energy programs by up to 20 percent.  Instead Congress approved a $839.8 million budget for the two program areas (a 1.4 percent increase).  Both houses also dropped provisions that would have extended the moratorium on any new lighting or appliance efficiency standards.  Over the years efficiency standards have helped advance technologies that have saved consumers billions of dollars in energy costs. <P>

<H3>NSP Solicits Suppliers for 50 MW of Biomass Power</H3>
Northern States Power Company (NSP) has asked the Public Utilities Commission for permission to forgo a competitive bidding process for acquiring the next 50 MW of mandated closed-loop biomass power.  The utility wants to begin simultaneous negotiations with the remaining bidders from the Biomass Phase I bidding process, St. Paul District Energy, and any other potential bidder. NSP selected the 75 MW proposal by the Minnesota Valley Alfalfa Producers in July 1996 as part of Biomass Phase I.  <P>
NSP argues that the selection should take place quickly than allowed for in an extended bid process in order for potential projects to take advantage of renewable energy production credits and/or any grants through the Department of Energy's Biomass for Rural Development program.  <P>
NSP proposes that interested bidders must submit a letter of intent to NSP on or before December 15, 1996.  The utility expects that the simultaneous negotiation process would take 60 to 90 days.<P>

<H3>NSP Issues Phase III RFP for Next 100 MW of Wind</H3>
Northern States Power Company is seeking for a supplier(s) for up to 100 MW of additional wind energy capacity in Southwestern Minnesota.  The request for proposal (RFP) represents the latest increment of a minimum 425 MW of wind energy that NSP must acquire in accordance with the 1994 Prairie Island legislation.  In an apparent attempt at spreading the 100-MW project among different suppliers, NSP is requiring that all bids over 25 MW must also include bids for 25-MW increments.  <P>
Final bids for the project are due on January 20, 1997 with power plant operation scheduled for June 1999.<p>

<A NAME="v"><H2>V. MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION</H2>
<H3>Good Reason for Energy Independence!</H3>
Have you noticed that a gallon of gasoline is about 25% more expensive than it was 6-12 months ago? The prices of fuel, natural gas, propane and fuel oil have all been on the rise.  For Minnesota consumers it means that we are spending up to 25 percent more for imported fuels.  In the case of gasoline, Minnesotans will send about $200 million out of the state.
 When will the increases in energy prices be sufficient to generate the interest of policymakers and regulators in nurturing our homegrown energy industries?<P>

<H2>I. SPECIAL FEATURE:  ELECTRIC UTILITY RESTRUCTURING
</H2>
<H3>Electric Utility Restructuring: Does it Make "Cents" for Minnesotans?</H3>
<I>By David Morris, Institute for Local Self-Reliance</I><P>
In New Hampshire 16,000 business and residential customers are shopping for their electricity supplier just as they shop around for their long distance phone company.  For many observers, this is the future face of electri-city.  At the moment, some 30 states are considering the most dramatic restructuring of the electric system since the 1930s.<P>
What is behind this unprecedented development and what does it mean for Minnesota?<P>
Let's back up a minute.  For 60 years electric utilities lived within a very stable environment.  Demand doubled every ten years, like clockwork.  Electric rates declined.  Profits were guaranteed.  Utilities never missed a dividend payment. <P>
And then came the 1970s.<P>
Fuel prices rose.  Electric prices increased.  Electric demand increased very slowly.  The future became unpredictable.
In 1978, to spur more efficient power plants, the federal government abolished the monopoly that utilities held over power generation.  That law created a new industryÐindependent power producers.  By 1992 over half of all new power capacity added each year came from independent power producers.<P>
In the late 1980s, natural gas prices plummeted.  The electric industry was faced with a remarkable situation.  Whereas in 1980 a new power plant generated electricity at a much higher price than an existing power plant, in 1995 a new power plant generated electricity at a much lower price than many existing power plants.  <P>
The electricity wars began.  Independent power producers wanted the opportunity to compete directly against utilities by selling electricity directly to their customers rather than having to sell the electricity to the utilities themselves.  Large industrial customers around the country were already demanding and obtaining lower rates by threatening to move out of town or to install their own power plants.  Many utilities had set up subsidiaries during the 1980s to build power plants in other utilities' jurisdictions and were interested in expanding those sales.  And finally, customers in high-priced electricity regions like California and New York and Chicago and New England were angry and demanded lower prices.<P>
In 1992 the federal government enacted the Energy Policy Act, which permitted independent power producers to sell power into utility markets at the wholesale level.  Many states began to develop rules that will take the next step and allow producers to sell power at the retail level.  <P>
Minnesota's regulatory commission has initiated a formal investigation of restructuring.  The Legislative Electric Energy Task Force has recently received a consultant's report on the possible effects of restructuring and will use it as the basis for discussions for policy initiatives next session.  The outcome of the debate will affect every Minnesotan.<P>
Over the coming months ME3, through the newsletter, the Web pages, and in a series of reports, will address the issue of electricity restructuring.  Here are some key issues.<P>
<B><CENTER>Cost and Price of Electricity</CENTER></B><P>
Will restructuring lower prices?  Free market devotees accept this as an article of faith.  Yet the issue is complicated.  The price of power is already declining, in part because of lower fuel prices, in part because of lower power-plant capital costs, and in part because power plants are smaller and can come on-line more quickly.  Few would argue that new power plants will become cheaper to build because of deregulation.  <P>
For a low-cost electricity state like Minnesota it is questionable whether prices will decline much if at all.  For high-cost electricity regions prices may well decline eventually, but here we confront another key issue, the question of stranded costs.  <P>
<B><CENTER>Stranded Costs</CENTER></B><P>
Let's say a utility has a power plant that is generating electricity at 10 cents per kWh and it can now buy electricity at 5 cents per kWh.  It can close down the first power plant and buy electricity from the second one, but the utility will still have to pay off the costs of the first power plant.  Who will pay those costs?  Some argue that the utilities made the decision to build the plants and their shareholders must now assume the loss.  Utilities respond that the regulatory commissions, acting on behalf of the people of a state, had given them permission to build these plants and therefore their customers should pick up the tab.  If the customers were to pick up 100 percent of the tab, there may be few price reductions from restructuring, at least in the short run.  <P>
This issue of stranded costs is complicated by two further factors.  Some utilities have estimated stranded costs that are higher than their total utility system investment, which enrages regulators and citizen activists.  A second factor is that other utilities will have low-cost plants that will become more valuable by suddenly being able to send low-cost electricity into higher priced markets.  In this case a utility will incur a net benefit under restructuring.  There-fore any deregulation must be able to define and balance stranded costs carefully against stranded benefits.<P>
An excellent and timely new paper by Martha Hewett and Sheldon Strom of the Center for Energy and Environment, "Stranded Costs:  A 'Bigger Rip-off than the S&Ls'", is available from ME3.  The piece explores in great depth the issue of stranded costs (This report is available on the Sustainable MN web site at:  <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="http://www.me3.org/projects/dereg/">http://www.me3.org/projects/dereg</A>).<P>
<CENTER><B>Resource Planning, Conservation, and Renewables</B></CENTER><P>
Environmentalists in the late 1970s were the first to argue that the regulatory system encouraged poor investment decisions.  Utilities received a guaranteed return on their investment in power plants and therefore tended to build expensive and sometimes unnecessary power plants.  In the 1980s and 1990s environmentalists made great strides in convincing regulatory commissions to take a more sophisticated approach.  Regulatory commissions began to deny construction permits for power plants they believed were unnecessary (Wisconsin did this for NSP's proposed Tyrone nuclear power complex, to the everlasting gratitude of Minnesotans and Wisconsinites alike).  Regulatory commissions began to require utilities to invest in conservation whenever it was cheaper than new power.  Regulatory commissions began to quantify the environmental cost of power plants and required utilities to take these costs into consideration when deciding what type of power plant to build or purchase electricity from.  And finally, legislatures and regulatory commissions heeded their citizens and began to require utilities to diversify and develop renewable electric technologies as an environmental, economic development, and energy-security strategy.<P>
By the early 1990s states like Minnesota had developed an integrated resource planning process that, although needing serious refinement, was far better than what existed in the past.  A restructured and deregulated system would, and already is, encouraging utilities to jettison conservation and renewables and environmental programs.  Parties are struggling with the role of planning if new source choices are purely price driven.<P>
<B><CENTER>Structure of a New Electric System</CENTER></B><P>
What would a restructured electric system look like?  Would the transmission lines be under separate ownership from the generation system?  Who, if anyone, would be responsible for guaranteeing electricity to the final customer?  Although proponents argue that the electric system is like the telephone system, it is not.  If a utility in Illinois sells you electricity, the electrons don't actually travel from Illinois to you.  They come from the nearest power plant to you that has available electricity.  The best analogy would be to think of a restructured electricity system like a large lake.  Independent pumpers would pump water into the lake and individual customers would take water out of the lake.  Right now the incredibly complicated electric system is managed by utilities and regional power pools.  Who will manage the even more complicated system of the future? <P>
The electric restructuring debate is in high gear in the high-cost electricity regions of the country.  Minnesota is a low-cost electric state which has made great strides in managing its electricity system in recent years.  Does Minnesota need to rush into deregulation?  Some, like the consultants who submitted the recent report to the Legislative Electric Energy Task Force, argue that restructuring is inevitable and no state can maintain the old system after other states restructure.  Others believe Minnesota can be its own boss, that we control our own destiny.  What do you think?<P>

<H3>Minnesota's Utility Restructuring:  Timeline
</H3>
The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) formally initiated an Investigation into Structural and Regulatory Issues in the Electric Utility Industry (Docket No. E-999/CI-95-135) in 1995 and issued a guiding set of principles and action steps in May 1996.<P>  
The working group's subcommittees are currently working on a variety of issues including; wholesale competition, flexible rates, public participation, and service quality.  Reports on each of these topics are expected to be issued incrementally between September and November.  Discussions of the issues related to retail electric competition will likely begin in September. The PUC views the working group and associated tasks as a way to promote a dialogue between interested parties and narrow the issues before the expected onslaught of legislative proposals during the 1997 legislative session.<P>

<H2>II.  REGULATORY UPDATE</H2>
<H3>Nuclear Waste:  Coming to a Backyard Near You?</H3>
In June 1996, the Minnesota Dept. of Public Service (DPS) issued a Report of Investigation and Recommendations Regarding Payments by Ratepayers of NSP to the Nuclear Waste Fund to the Public Utilities Commission (PUC Docket No.  E002/DI-95-1137).  DPS Commissioner Kris Sanda, a longtime critic of how the federal government is handling the creation of a national nuclear waste repository, wants to divert any
further payments by NSP to the federal Nuclear Waste Fund (NWF) into a state-based dedicated fund to finance a solution to NSP's disposal problems.  By 2003, NSP ratepayers will have contributed about $250 million into the NWF.  Iowa is also considering a similar plan for their contributions to the NWF.<P>


Some believe that Commissioner Sanda's proposal is simply a tactic to put pressure on the federal government.  Others believe that she wants to use the diverted funds to finance a permanent waste site in Minnesota.  Comments on the DPS report were submitted on July 31 and reply comments will be accepted until August 21, 1996.<P>


Meanwhile, the Minnesota Environmental Quality Board (EQB) issued a report titled Staff Report to the EQB on the Siting of a Dry Cask Storage Facility in Goodhue County.  The 1994 Prairie Island legislation required NSP to find an alternative storage site within Goodhue County for Prairie Island's spent fuel.  The alternative siting process has proved to be very controversial throughout Goodhue County.  One township threatened to secede from the county.  A site advisory task force concluded, "that neither the [two] sites proposed by NSP nor any of the 16 properties proposed as alternates sites by concerned citizens was feasible and prudent and should be subject to further consideration by the EQB".  The EQB staff report identifies 4 options for consideration: <P>

<UL> 
<LI>Move ahead with the
	current siting process focusing only on sites in Goodhue County
<LI>Formally suspend the siting process and wait for the legislature to deal with the issue next session
<LI>Formally terminate the siting process
<LI>Broaden the scope of the site search to areas outside of Goodhue County</UL><p>
Comments on the EQB report are due by August 23, 1996.  This proceeding is a unique opportunity for Minnesotans to engage the very hard questions related to the storage of nuclear waste.  In the 1980s, the federal government was considering Minnesota as a possible home for a national nuclear waste repository.  Nevada, which has no nuclear reactors of its own, was chosen instead.  Now it appears that a permanent waste repository in Nevada may never be built. Is it time to begin talking about a permanent storage facility in Minnesota, this time to take responsibility for our own nuclear wastes?<P>

<H3>Primergy Stumbles</H3><P>
The massive utility merger proposed to combine Northern States Power Company (NSP) and Wisconsin Energy Corporation (WEC) into the energy giant, Primergy, has felt the reins of regulation tighten recently.  <P>
The merger has been slowed in Wisconsin and at the Federal level.  Wisconsin regulators and staff at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) are reported to be critical of the merger.  Primary concern is that Primergy will have unfair market power in the Midwest.  The merger partners have proposed a plan that would involve an independent system operator (ISO), an independent entity responsible for making electric power deals between Primergy and other power marketers and consumers.  According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel,  FERC staff believe the ISO will not be independent enough and FERC may require WEC to sell some of its generating or transmission capacity.<P>
The Wisconsin commission has announced that they will be preparing an environmental assessment of the merger in response to a motion by environmental intervenors, including ME3.<P>
The proposed merger received swift approval from shareholders and the go-ahead from regulators in North Dakota and Michigan, two of four state regulatory commissions that must approve the marriage.  In Minnesota, NSP and DPS are urging the PUC and the administrative law judge to fast track the merger for a decision before the end of the year.<P>
ME3 is concerned that the merger, as it is currently proposed, represents a serious threat to competition in the region.  In addition, the merger will allow NSP to have better access to higher priced electricity markets like those in Chicago.  This will probably result in the increased use of idled coal-fired capacity in Minnesota according to ME3's Kevin Bengtson.  He has prepared an analysis of the likelihood of increased pollution in the metropolitan area resulting from the merger (see Information Resources).<P>

<H2>III.  RENEWABLES AND CONSERVATION UPDATE</H2>
<H3>NAE Proposes 11.25 MW Minnesota Wind Farm</H3><P>
Minnesota wind developers, Northern Alternative Energy (NAE) and Micon Wind Turbines (US) Inc., have applied for permission to build a 11.25 MW wind project in southwestern Minnesota.  The project would use 15 Micon turbines on land acquired by NAE and Northern States Power (NSP).  Hutchinson Manufacturing, Inc.  of Hutchinson, MN, will manufacture some components and will be the site for final assembly of Micon's 750-kW turbines. <P>
The relatively small size of the project (<12 MW) allows NAE to avoid costly regulatory hurdles involved in the Certificate of Need process and eliminates any need of a competitive bidding process.  NAE has been involved in ongoing negotiations with Northern States Power Company and expects to sell the utility about 30 million-kWhs per year.  The 30-year power-purchase agreement is similar to the last wind power contract given to Zond Systems, Inc.; reportedly around 3.5 cents per kWh.  The NAE project would also qualify for the 1.6 cents per kWh federal renewable energy production credit.  If approved, site preparations will begin by the end of September.  Ideally, turbine installation could start as early as January and be fully on-line by February 1997.  <P>
NAE president, Greg Jaunich notes that NAE will be pursuing more of these "small, cluster-like" developments in southwestern Minnesota.  He has been pleased with the negotiating process with NSP and is happy that the utility is interested in looking at smaller-scale installations.  The project will count towards NSP's mandate to acquire 425-MW of wind energy by 2003.<P>
The Environmental Quality Board (EQB) has issued a Draft Site Permit and is looking for comments from interested persons by September 4, 1996.<P>

<H3>NSP Awards Biomass Bid to 75-MW Alfalfa Project</H3>
On July 12, Northern States Power Company (NSP) selected the Minnesota Valley Alfalfa Producers (MnVAP), located in Granite Falls, MN, to supply 75-MW of "farm-grown, closed-loop biomass" electricity by December 31, 2000.<P>


This 75-MW Minnesota Agri-Power Project will fulfill part of the legislative mandate requiring NSP to have 125-MW of  biomass generation in place by the end of 2002.  MnVAP plans to eventually use advanced gasification technology to generate fuel gas from alfalfa stems (a byproduct of a planned animal-feed production facility).  NSP notes that, once the power plant is operating, it will be the first dedicated crop-fuel plant of its size in the world.<P>


In related news, MnVAP announced on July 10 that it had received a $4.1 million grant from the Dept. of Energy for the design phase of the project.  Most will go toward power-plant design.  One-fourth of the award will go towards alfalfa research and product development at the University of Minnesota, the Minnesota Department of Agriculture, and the Agricultural Utilization Research Institute (AURI).  MnVAP is seeking up to $40 million from DOE during the construction phase of the project.<P>


NSP chose MnVAP following a simultaneous negotiation process with three finalists ordered by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission.  The PUC must still approve NSP's selection and the two parties must negotiate a power purchase agreement.<P>

<H3>Kenetech Settles Wind Easement Dispute With NSP</H3>
NSP announced on June 28th that it had successfully negotiated the transfer of wind easements owned by Kenetech Windpower Inc. (KWI).  NSP and KWI had been involved in a protracted court battle over the wind easements, a dispute that delayed NSP's contract award to Zond Systems for the next 100 MW of wind development in Minnesota.  Kenetech has dropped all legal and regulatory disputes against NSP.  Landowners in the area are reported to be pleased with the settlement and are anxious to have turbines begin operating above their land.<P>


The turn of events was not unexpected.  On May 29, 1996, KWI of San Francisco, CA, filed a petition under chapter 11 for bankruptcy protection.  Problems with turbines, lack of demand, and plummeting stock values are blamed for the company's demise.  KWI was in no position to sustain any legal battles.<P>


Zond's 143-turbine project will now be able to proceed as originally planned on land acquired by NSP and approved by the Environmental Quality Board.  Due to the delay caused by the lawsuits, Zond will likely bring the plant on-line by 1998.<P>



<H3>Elk River to Become a Sustainable City Energy Showcase</H3>
The city of Elk River, MN, has been selected to become a Sustainable City Energy Showcase by the Minnesota Environmental Initiative's Energy Alley program.  The five-year project will by administered by Energy Alley staff, city officials, and energy efficiency and renewable energy business partners; each contributing personnel and financial resources to cover the estimated $200,000 annual administrative costs.<P>


The first phase of the program will be an energy use inventory of the city.  The inventory should be completed in six months.  Depending on the results of the inventory, up to $10 million could be invested in improvements according to Energy Alley spokesperson Joel Burns.  Improvements will generate up to 25% energy savings for the city.<BR>

<H3>DPS Seeks Comments on Minnesota Energy Policy Report</H3> 
The Minnesota Department of Public Service (DPS) has recently issued a Draft version of the 1996 Energy Policy and Conservation Report, a quadrennial report to the Minnesota Legislature on the Department's policy goals and strategies.  The DPS is looking for input on the Draft report and will seek public comments early this fall.  Deadline for written comments is September 20, 1996.<BR>

<H3>Green Pricing:  A Solution to Advance Renewable Energy?</H3>
Green pricing is the term used when electric utilities invite their customers to pay higher prices in return for the utility buying more power from renewable resources.  Green pricing comes in various forms.  Sometimes the customer pays a premium that covers only a portion of the total cost of the renewable energy system.  This is the case, for example, with the photovoltaic (PV) program at the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) that involves installing residential rooftop systems.  A similar program is being implemented in Minnesota that will, by the end of the summer, involve 17 customers of Northern States Power.  Participants in NSP's Solar Advantage PV program will pay an additional $50 per month for 2-kW rooftop systems, about a third of the actual cost of the PV installation.  Participants can buy the system for $1 after 10 years.  Ratepayers cover the other two thirds of the cost.<P>


Sometimes green pricing programs cover the full cost of renewable electricity.  At Public Service Company of Colorado, ratepayers can contribute to a renewable energy fund that is used to finance small PV projects around the state.  In Colorado, 14,000 ratepayers contributed about $160,000.  A couple of hundred customers of Traverse City Light and Power, a Michigan municipal utility, are paying 20 percent more for electricity from the utility's 600-kW wind turbine which began producing electricity in May.<P>


Green pricing programs are controversial.  Some argue that since they are invariably very small, they distract attention from large-scale renewable energy projects that can really accelerate technological change.  Others argue that green pricing efforts are a grassroots effort that can let a thousand technological flowers bloom in many parts of the country.<P>


Some environmentalists worry that utilities may soon be introducing green pricing programs that aren't even green.  Wisconsin Electric Power Company (WEPCO) was recently given approval to offer customers the option of paying a premium "green rate" for renewable power.  The power will be generated from existing Canadian and Minnesota hydro resources and from a waste-wood-fueled power plant owned by Minnesota Power that has been idled in recent years.  As Renew Wisconsin and Wisconsin Environmental Decade ask of Wisconsin's regulatory commission, does waste wood and large- scale hydroelectricity from out of state really constitute "green"
sustainable power?  Don't consumers deserve assurance that they are indeed getting the ÒgreenÓ power that they paid for?<P>

<B>Coal Plants in the Neighborhood:  Stopping Increased Air Pollution from the NSP Merger</B><BR>

This July 1996 report by ME3's Kevin P. Bengtson argues that, if it is approved, the proposed merger of NSP and Wisconsin Energy Corporation will inevitably result in increased pollution from coal plants in the Twin Cities metropolitan area.  In addition, the report suggests simple mitigation strategies that could be ordered by the PUC or the state legislature as a condition for merger approval.<BR>

<H3>The More Things Change...</H3> 

At the beginning of this century, in order to encourage customers to buy more electricity,  utilities gave away light bulbs and electric appliances.   In the 1980s environmentalists taught regulators and utilities that energy efficiency made more sense and that if utilities were going to give anything away, it should be insulation and very high efficiency light bulbs.  In 1996 Centerior Energy's Cleveland Electric subsidiary has returned to the days of yesteryear by instituting a frequent kilowatt hour program, a  bonus programÐlike a frequent flyer programÐto give customers an incentive to consume more electricity.  Points are awarded for each kWh consumed, with bonus points awarded for actions such as purchasing a portable electric heater (3,000 bonus points) and replacing a gas hot water heater with an electric on (10,000 bonus points).  The more electric appliances the consumer buys, the more points they earn.  Earn enough points and you can get an electric sauna!  Go Cleveland.

Global Climate Change and Minnesota </H2><BLOCKQUOTE>"We must also protect our global environment, working...to reduce the greenhouse gases that challenge our health even as they change our climate." <BR><B>President Bill Clinton, February 4, 1997</B></BLOCKQUOTE><P><H3>Global Climate Change Puts Minnesota at Ground Zero</H3> Some Minnesotans might think global warming would be a boon to Minnesota because of our cold climate.  However, recent evidence shows that Minnesota's environment may be more seriously and adversely affected by modest changes in the climate than other parts of the country.  For some leading scientists, Minnesota is ground zero with respect to global climate change.  This was one of the major themes of last December's Twin Cities Conference on Global Climate Change.  <P>Professor Stephen Schneider, Stanford University and internationally recognized expert on climate said that, "Minnesota is at the ecological cross hairs of climate change."  As one of 2500 scientist on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), he concludes that Minnesota is particularly vulnerable to changes in climate because of our geographical position at the intersection of Canada's boreal forests, the great plains and eastern Minnesota's hardwood forests.<P>While the climate is expected to warm gradually, changes in it can be abrupt.  Keynote speaker John Firor emphasized that any system as non-linear and chaotic as the climate can produce sudden changes in nature when experiencing gradually increasing stress.<P>About a month after the conference, the MN Pollution Control Agency (PCA) released a legislative update on their Global Climate Change Initiative.  The PCA used physical  models to predict how wetlands, forest, fisheries, and peatlands will respond to climate change.  The news is not good.  Among the findings:  the boreal forest typical of the Boundary Waters will retreat into Canada, cold water fish such as pike and trout will decline, prairie pothole wetlands in the western half of Minnesota will decline, and some species will become extinct in the state as habitats change.  The PCA will be monitoring national and international developments to prepare for the most appropriate and cost-effective actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.<P>Contact:  Peter Ciborowski, PCA, 612-297-5822<H2>II. Legislative Update </H2><!-- Font Tag --><B><FONT SIZE=5>T</FONT></B>he Minnesota Legislature has convened and will continue until late May.  Below are descriptions of some of the major energy-related initiatives already introduced or likely during the 1997 session.  ME3 will be tracking these and other initiatives on the web via the <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="http://www.me3.org/leg/legwatch97.html">1997 Legislative Watch</A> <P><H4>Economic Efficiency and Pollution Reduction Act (EEPRA) of 1997</H4>This bill contains provisions for a $1.5 billion tax shift at the state level.  Similar to legislation introduced in 1996, a $50 carbon tax on fossil fuels would be imposed, raising $1.5 billion.  The tax increase would be offset by $1.5 billion decrease in other taxes.  For the residential sector the tax reductions would represent about $370 per household.  The business sector would receive a 22-percent reduction in the employer portion of payments to FICA (social security and medicare).<P>The proposal contains partial and conditional tax exemptions for energy-intensive industries.<P><H4>Minnesota Electric Deregulation</H4>Governor Carlson and legislative leaders of both parties have stated that no legislative initiatives to deregulate the electric industry will be considered in 1997.  Legislators will spend this session studying the issue in detail.  The Public Utilities Commission's Competition Working Groups and the Legislative Electric Energy Task Force will provide reports to the Legislature.<P><B>Note:</B>  On the federal level, several major industry-restructuring bills have been introduced that could have profound impacts on Minnesota.  The federal efforts could leave many details up to state policymakers, but may interfere with efforts to ensure the prominent role of renewable energy and energy conservation in a deregulated market.<P><H4>Alternative Siting of Nuclear Waste</H4>Bills have been introduced in both the Senate and House (S.F.  48, H.F. 153) that would eliminate a law requiring NSP to build an alternative storage site for nuclear waste being stored at Prairie Island.  The bill gives NSP permission to fill five more casks as part of the utility fulfilling a requirement to try and find an alternative storage site in Goodhue County.  By satisfying mandates for renewable energy, NSP may fill up to 17 casks on Prairie Island.  <P><H4>Public Utility Mergers</H4>Legislation has been proposed (S.F. 83, H.F. 295) that provides criteria that must be satisfied before any public utility merger is approved by the Public Utilities Commission (PUC).  Among the requirements are the merger must:  1) provide net benefits to all classes of ratepayers; 2) foster increased competition; 3) maintain or improve environmental protection, renewable energy, energy conservation, and integrated resource planning.  The bill also contains a provision putting the "burden of proof" on the utilities that are merging for demonstrating that these requirements have been satisfied.  If passed, the bill would apply to pending and future merger proposals.<P><H4>Taxation of Utility Property</H4>Property tax reform is one of the top legislative issues for 1997.  Included in the discussions may be the taxes on utilities' personal property, although many legislators prefer to leave this issue until deregulation is concerned.  The debate will center on the issues of fairness and competition.  Investor-owned utilities, unlike other businesses in the state, are assessed property taxes on both real and personal property.  <P><H4>Wind Energy Property Taxation</H4>A bill has been introduced (S.F. 181) that requires any utility that purchases wind electricity installed from June 1, 1991 to  December 31, 2002 to pay the property taxes assessed on the facilities.  The utility can recover the property taxes through rates.The bill modifies the property tax rates on wind energy.  Smaller-scale wind projects (< 2 MW) would remain tax-exempt.  Wind farms larger than 12 MW would be taxed at a much higher rate than under the current law.<P><H4>Livable Communities Legislation</H4>A bill has been introduced  (H.F. 217) that would address the issue of urban sprawl by limiting growth in metropolitan areas.  The legislation would require that full social, environmental and other external costs be paid up-front before increased development could take place in certain areas.<P><H4>Gas Tax Increase for Transit</H4>Many bills have been introduced that would raise the state tax on gasoline.  Most bills include a provision to amend the Minnesota Constitution to allow revenue from the tax increase to be used for mass transit.  Currently, the Minnesota Constitution directs any gas tax revenues to be used exclusively for building and maintaining roads.<P><H2>III. Regulatory Update </H2><H3>Protecting Efficiency and Renewables in a Deregulated  Electricity Market</H3>Over the last 20 years Minnesota and many other states have included in their utility regulatory processes provisions for energy efficiency and renewable energies.  These provisions slightly increase the short-term price of electricity although many experts argue that in the long term they are beneficial to the state economy because they avoid the need for new power plants, shift electricity generation to in-state renewable resources and reduce the costs from pollutants generated from electric power.  <P>Now a number of states are allowing electric customers to buy retail electricity from any power marketer.  In this deregulated environment the short-term price becomes paramount.  If in-state utilities or power producers are required to pay for the costs of energy efficiency or renewable energy then the price of their electricity may become uncompetitive in an increasingly national electric marketplace.  Already, as competition looms, utilities are slashing energy efficiency programs.  The $64,000 question is how to protect and sustain investments in improving energy efficiency and renewable energy in a deregulated system.<P>Fortunately, in most of the discussions of deregulation going on at the Federal level and in at least 40 states, this issue is on the table.  The  Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) and the System Benefits Charge (SBC) are two strategies for achieving environmental and social goals while still moving toward deregulation.  This article explains both concepts.  <P><B>Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS)</B><BR>The RPS is simple.  In order to be permitted to sell power directly to end-consumers a power marketer must have a certain percentage of renewable energy in its mix.  To allow for some flexibility, a company without renewable capacity is allowed to purchase renewable energy credits from a generator with excess renewable capacity. <P>Sustainable energy activists involved in the deregulation debate at the Federal level have supported a national "portfolio standard".  Currently support is behind proposals that include minimum requirements that renewables (other than hydropower) make up at least 2.5 percent of all generation by 2000, 5 percent by 2005, and 10 percent by 2010.  In Minnesota, up to 950-MW of renewables is required by the Prairie Island legislation of 1994.  This would give Minnesota a head start in satisfying the minimum federal requirements.<P>Nationwide, the standards outlined above would increase renewable capacity dramatically since renewables (non-hydro) currently only make up about two percent of the total.  However, Minnesotans should be concerned about the adoption of a federal standard.  If left to federal government the portfolio standard may stall efforts to move renewables forward even further in Minnesota.  The Federal standard can provide a framework for states to work in but it also brings in the spectre of preemption.  Any examination of federal policy should address the question: Could Minnesota's commitment to a more robust renewable economy be undermined?<P><B>System Benefits Charge</B><BR>The SBC is a fee, either a percentage charge or a fixed rate per kWh, on electricity use.  All providers would have to pay the charge.  Sometimes this is called a "wire charge".  The money would be used to support key public policies such as energy-efficiency improvements, low-income energy services, and/or renewable-energy projects.  <P>SBCs generate controversy.  One controversy is over who controls the money and how it is spent.  Some energy activists want money from a SBC to be diverted into an independently-administered account out of the reach of utilities.  Often referring to the excessive administrative costs of many utility-sponsored conservation programs, activists want the money in the hands of people who are truly committed to aggressive energy conservation efforts.  Others feel that another level of public oversight is not the answer and power marketers should control the money with verifiable savings goals.<P>The SBCs that have been recommended, at best, will provide funding at current utility investment levels.  The difference is that the SBCs are often temporary by design.  They become "transition" fees until stranded costs can be paid off and the market can work on its own.  <P>Another problem develops because instead of the charge being embedded in a utility rate structure, the fee is a line item on the electric bill and will be viewed as a tax.  This leaves it more vulnerable for possible repeal.<P>A final concern is that a fixed charge per kWh will decrease in value over time if it is not adjusted for inflation.  A charge based on percentage rate would drop in real terms if electricity rates drop.<P><H3>Administrative Meltdown For Primergy</H3><B>Wisconsin -</B> On January 21, a Dane County judge put an abrupt halt to any action on the Primergy merger proposal being considered by the Wisconsin Public Service Commission (PSC) by issuing an injunction.  By court order the PSC must now complete an investigation of alleged improper conversations between PSC Commissioner Dan Eastman and Wisconsin Energy Corp. (WEC) executives.  A sworn statement presented to the court by former PSC commissioner Scott Neitzel alleges that Eastman was eager to approve the merger and told Governor Thompson's Chief of Staff that he wanted to "profit" from the decision. <P><B>Minnesota -</B> Similar setbacks have continued in Minnesota.  Concluding an openly hostile meeting on January 21, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) reversed a prior decision that had prevented two commissioners from voting on the Primergy merger because of ex parte communications with NSP officials.  As a justification for the reversal, the Commission members cited their belief that that a motion requesting reconsideration was filed late.  The PUC's attorneys repeatedly advised that the timeliness of the motion should not be the basis for reversal.  Commissioner Don Storm strongly dissented from the majority action.<P>NSP and WEC are seeking approval to merge into Primergy and become the nation's 10th largest utility.<P>The issue of ex parte communications has proved to be unsolvable for the Commission. Originally the PUC found that, although the conversations took place, they were not "substantive".  On the motion of departing Commissioner Dee Knaak, the PUC did a 180 degree turn and decided that laws were indeed broken and two of five commissioners would be recused from ruling on the merger.  The recent ruling brings the PUC full circle.<P>After Commissioner Dee Knaak resigned, the PUC was left with only two people to rule on the $6 billion merger.  Governor Carlson replaced Knaak with the head of the Office of Environmental Assistance, Ed Garvey.  <P><B>More News -</B> Rulings by two Administrative Law Judges on the Primergy merger case in Minnesota have been issued.  Judge Klein ruled that the Independent System Operator being negotiated and other factors would protect the public interest and be enough to negate any concerns of Primergy having too much market control. <P>Judge Giles looked at economic savings issues.  He notes, "...the determination of the cost savings due to the merger requires considerable exercise of judgment."  He goes on to agree that savings proposed by NSP are valid even though the MN's Department of Public Service concluded that savings from the merger would be about half of what NSP has proposed.<P>Primergy on the Web: <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="http://www.me3.org/issues/merger/">http://www.me3.org/issues/merger</A><H3>Federal Electric Restructuring Bills Introduced</H3>The deregulation debate is raging on Capitol Hill this year with bills introduced or expected from Senator Dale Bumpers (D-Ark), Representative Dan Schaefer (R-Colo.), Senator Frank Murkowski (R- Alaska), and a proposal  from the U.S. Department of Energy. <P>Early versions of the DOE-sponsored bill would let states decide whether to allow customers to pick their power supplier or require utilities to compete for power on the wholesale market.  DOE may also recommend a  national fund for state energy conservation.<P>Senator Bumpers bill was introduced on January 30, and will require full retail competition by the year 2003.  His bill includes provisions for a "wire service charge" that will be used to pay for utilities' stranded costs.<P>Schaefer's bill, introduced February 10, is similar to the Bumpers proposal in that it mandates deregulation but the deadline for full competition is the year 2000.<P>Stay on top of the latest deregulation developments on the web at <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="http://www.me3.org/projects/dereg/">http://www.me3.org/projects/dereg</A><H2>IV. Renewables/Energy Conservation Update </H2><H3>Windustry Workshop An Outstanding Success</H3>About 4 dozen people attended the four-day "Windustry" workshop hosted by the Minneapolis-based Sustainable Resources Center (SRC), a partner along with ME3, Clean Water Fund, and Minnesota Project in the Sustainable Energy for Economic Development (SEED) project.  Local and internationally-recognized wind energy experts provided participants with the information they need to become local wind resource people and enable them to help make wind energy a reality in their communities.<P>SRC developed the training session to fill a "knowledge gap" that was hindering increased wind development.  Lisa Daniels of SRC noted, "farmers and landowners in Minnesota's windy areas want wind power but have a lot of questions.  The workshop and the Windustry curriculum will train people to become a wind energy resource for their communities."  She added that the participants can now go home and begin to make their local wind projects work.  The final version of the Windustry program will be available later this spring.  <P>Contact:  <!-- MailTo Tag --><A HREF="MAILTO:srclisad@mtn.org">Lisa Daniels</A>, SRC, 612-872-3280, srclisad@mtn.org<H3>MN Coops Announce Green Pricing Program</H3>Wholesale power marketer Cooperative Power Association (CPA), and one of its customers, Dakota Electric Association want to offer their customers the option to buy renewable energy beginning April 1997.   Dakota Electric filed a petition with the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) which must approve  the rate structure for the program.  Dakota Electric is the only cooperatively-owned utility in Minnesota whose board voted to be regulated by the PUC.<P>CPA's participating cooperatives would charge their customers more for "green power".  Initial estimates by CPA, show that customers will pay an additional 2 - 3 cents per kWh.  Dakota Electric's residential customers currently pay 7.15 cents per kWh and commercial customers pay about 4.85 cents.  The renewable energy option will be available to residential, commercial or industrial customers.  Participants will be able to subscribe to 100 kWh blocks of green energy up to their average monthly usage for at least 12 months of service.<P>CPA supplies wholesale power to 17 electric distribution cooperatives in west central and southern Minnesota.  In addition to Dakota Electric, seven other cooperatives have expressed interest in providing their customers with the renewable energy option.<P>CPA is currently evaluating bids to deliver between 1 and 3 MW of renewable-fueled electric capacity.  The actual amount of renewable power will ultimately depend on how many people sign on to the program.  And the increased cost per kWh to participants will depend on the outcome of the competitive bidding process.<P>Contact:  Tim Seck, CPA, 612-949-8264<P><H3>FERC Rules on Iowa Renewable Energy Mandate</H3>On January 29, 1997, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued an order (Docket No. EL95-51-000) concluding that an Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) directive ordering renewables to be purchased from qualifying facilities (QFs) at a certain price is preempted by Federal law.  The FERC ruling stems from a complaint filed by Midwest Power (now MidAmerican Energy Company).  FERC notes that Iowa's state law requiring utilities to purchase a certain amount of alternative energy is "consistent with federal law".  Midwest Power argued that it was required to purchase up to 30.4 MW of renewable energy capacity and pay 6 cents per kWh for electricity when their avoided cost was only 1.5 cents per kWh.  Iowa requires utilities statewide to acquire about 105 MW of renewables.  Minnesota's renewable energy mandates do not contain language on pricing and have never been challenged. <P>The FERC ruling was confusing at best.  On one hand it said that a state has authority over its energy mix.   That is, it can mandate renewable energy.  On the other it said that the state's authority over pricing is superseded by the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) of 1978.  PURPA was enacted to help spur the development of high-efficiency and renewable energy projects by independent power producers.  If read literally, the FERC ruling allows states to mandate renewables, but not if these cost more than the utilities would otherwise pay for traditional power.  The American Wind Energy Association's, Randy Swisher,  notes that the FERC ruling on pricing has effectively gutted PURPA .  However he adds, "FERC's preemption was relatively narrow and reaffirmed the authority of states to shape their own resource portfolios."<P>What happens next is unclear.  Some analysts argue that FERC has no legal authority to overturn the law and only a state or federal judge could do so.  The FERC ruling only covered independent power producers qualifying under PURPA but in Iowa a number of producers are not so-called QFs so they are exempt from the ruling.  Regardless, the decision sent a shockwave through renewable energy firms that have already signed long-term power-purchase agreements at the 6 cent rate.  Others chose to disregard the price-fixing arrangement and negotiated power purchase agreements that were less than the 6 cent per kWh rate set by the IUB.<P><H3>Enron Adds Minnesota Wind Energy To Portfolio</H3>Enron Corporation, one of the largest energy firms in the world, has added another company to its list of assets.  On January 3, U.S. wind developer Zond Corporation, developer of the next 100-MW wind project for Northern States Power Co., was purchased by the Houston-based energy services giant.  Zond became part of a new business unit, Enron Renewable Energy Corporation.  Zond completed its first wind power facility in 1981 and since then has installed and operates over 2,400 wind turbines comprising 260 megawatts (MWs).  Zond's 100-MW Minnesota-based project should be operating by next year. <P>The purchase clearly indicates Enron's intent to ensure that among its $15 billion portfolio is a dominant group of renewable energy companies.  Enron is betting that, in a world of increased competition, it makes sense to be able to offer "green power" to consumers.  In addition to its purchase of Zond, Enron also is a partner with Amoco in Amoco/Enron Solar, the largest U.S.-owned producer of solar photovoltaic cells and the second largest worldwide.  <P>Contact:  Carol Hensley, Enron, 713-853-6498, <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="http://www.enron.com/">http://www.enron.com</A> <P> <H3>Money Available for Energy Assistance in Minnesota</H3>This season's cold temperatures and high fuel costs will make it difficult for tens of thousands of Minnesota households to keep up with utility bills.  Over the last two years the U.S. Congress has slashed programs that help working poor families and the elderly heat their homes.  Pam Marshall, director of the low-income advocacy Energy CENTS Coalition, says that we are "fortunate that the state has released $9 million to make up for the 31% cut in federal energy assistance."   The federal contribution for low-income energy assistance dropped from $56 million in 1994/95 to $38.7 in 1996/97. <p>The Federal government has also released emergency funds for energy assistance that will bring Minnesota's working families an additional $13.7 million.<P>The criteria for getting assistance have changed recently, so even people who were denied assistance in the past should try again.  <p>Contact:  MN Energy Assistance Program, 1-800-657-3805<P><H3>Minnesota Wind-Project Contracts Nearing Completion</H3>Minnesota wind-energy entrepreneur Greg Jaunich, President of Northern Alternative Energy (NAE) has been busy this winter negotiating several wind power projects in southwestern Minnesota.  At press time, contracts for two projects totalling 22.65 MW were being finalized.  The power from the projects will be sold to Northern States Power (NSP).  If built, the projects will help satisfy NSP's requirement to contract for up to 825 MW of wind power by the year 2003. <P>NAE plans to develop the projects for NSP at a total cost of about $25 million.  The first is a 11.25 MW facility employing 15 of Micon's turbines with 48-meter rotor diameters.   Some components will be manufactured in the state and final assembly of the turbines will take place in Hutchinson, Minnesota.  The second will be a 11.4 MW project using 19 of Tacke Windpower's 43-meter turbines.  Expected annual output from the projects are 30 million kWhs and 38 million kWhs, respectively.<P>Both of the NAE projects will be installed on land near the site where Zond Systems will build their 100-MW project later this year.  NAE has secured about 40 percent of the land needed for the project and  NSP would provide the remainder.  Construction could begin as soon as June 1997 and be on-line by late this year.  Greg Jaunich said that the new projects would be a "big step" for NAE.  The company currently operates about a dozen turbines and could add as many as 50 turbines by 1998. <P>By next year, the area around Lake Benton, MN, will be home to wind farms using four different turbines.  ME3's Executive Director, Michael Noble, notes, "NSP has made a smart strategic decision by negotiating smaller projects with many different vendors.  This will allow the utility as well as the state to gain an enormous amount of knowledge about the operating performance of different wind energy technologies in Minnesota."<P><H3>Minnesota's Ethanol Industry Scrutinized</H3>Last year the Minnesota legislature ordered the Office of the Legislative Auditor to do a cost-benefit analysis of Minnesota's burgeoning ethanol industry.  Issued February 6, 1997, the Ethanol Program report (97-04) examines how a state can cost-effectively create a strong, locally-owned renewable energy industry.<P>The report found that, "Construction and operation of ethanol plants are a boon to the communities in which they are located, and there are significant benefits to the state as a whole."  The farmer cooperative ownership model of most Minnesota ethanol plants was found to be beneficial.  Last year when corn prices skyrocketed, many privately-owned ethanol plants around the country shut down while most of Minnesota cooperatives continued operating.   <P>The report was comprehensive but had drawbacks, according to Institute for Local Self-Reliance's (ILSR) David Morris. The report overestimated the cost of ethanol to gasoline customers.  And it understated the environmental benefits of ethanol by ignoring the reduction in benzene and other toxic components of gasoline that it displaces.  <P>Minnesota provides a 20 cents per gallon incentive to ethanol plants up to 15 million gallons a year.  This cap encourages smaller, more numerous plants.  By next year Minnesota will produce more than 120 million gallons of ethanol from 11 ethanol plants, 8 of which are owned by 7500 farm families.  In October 1997, the annual market for ethanol in the state will rise to 200 million gallons because of a state law requiring oxygenated fuel to be used year round throughout the state. <P>Contact: Ethanol and Biofuels page on the web at <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="http://www.me3.org/issues/ethanol/">http://www.me3.org/issues/ethanol</A><P><H2>V.

<H2>NSP Shareholders Approve Merger with Wisconsin Utility</H2>


    Northern States Power Co. shareholders overwhelmingly 
approved the utility's
proposed merger with Wisconsin Electric Corp. at NSP's annual 
meeting Wednesday, although a few expressed concerns that the 
merger would turn out to be bad for them.<P>
    The two companies have proposed a "merger of equals," with 
shareholders of
each firm holding 50 percent interest in a $ 6 billion utility 
holding company
that would be based in Minneapolis.<P>
    The utilities have said they expect $ 2 billion in annual 
savings from
consolidation efficiencies; Howard said Wednesday that much of 
the savings would
come from a staff reduction of about 10 percent, or about 1,200 
employees,
across the two companies.<P>    
    At the NSP meeting, about 96 percent of the votes were in 
favor of the
merger, about on par with the 97.2 percent of Wisconsin Energy 
shareholders who
approved the deal at their own meeting in Milwaukee Wednesday.<P>
    The merger still must be approved by a contingent of federal 
and state
regulators, who are expected to decide by the second or third 
quarter of 1996,
said NSP Chief Executive Jim Howard; that means the merger could 
become reality
about a year from now, he said.<P>

    A resolution
recommending that NSP stop producing radioactive waste was 
defeated, winning about 5.5 percent
of the vote. A second resolution calling for support of 
regulatory reform that
would tie NSP earnings to its success in promoting energy 
efficiency was
defeated by about the same margin.

<HR>
<H3><b>Part 3: Solar Energy and Biological Energy</b></H3>
	 Solar energy comes in four forms:  direct sunlight, wind, rain, and plant
matter.  Plant matter has two important advantages over the other kinds of
solar energy.  <p>

	First, it comes with its own built in storage system.  This means biomass
energy can provide baseload electricity.  Therefore biomass is a perfect
complement to intermittent energy sources like wind.  And since wind turbines
will for the most part be sitting in the middle of farmland the link between
the two becomes even more intimate.<p>

Biomass developers confront a major obstacle not encountered by developers
looking to harness wind or direct sunlight.  The latter need only to harness
renewable resources available in any case.  Biomass developers, on the other
hand, must not only learn how to harness the biomass in an economical fashion
but must convince farmers to raise large quantities of these resources, often
years in advance of the time the resource will be converted into energy.  This
presents a classic chicken and egg dilemma.  Farmers will not plant energy
crops unless guaranteed a market while power plant builders cannot attract
sufficient financing unless they have a guaranteed supply of raw materials.<p>

This is not a problem for starch to ethanol plants since the plant
matter--corn, wheat, potatoes, etc.--is being grown anyway.  Nor is it a
problem if waste wood is used to fuel power plants.  But it does represent a
major obstacle to the introduction of cellulose to ethanol plants or for
biomass electricity that relies on crops or trees dedicated for energy uses.<p>

	Biomass has a second advantage over direct sunlight and wind.  It contains
physical matter that can be converted into gaseous, liquid or solid forms to
meet the various needs of final customers.  That can also create a disadvantage
for biofuels. If wind is harnessed, it will be to generate electricity.  On the
other hand, biomass can be used for many purposes and many compete with one
another.<p>

Cellulosic materials can be converted into liquid fuels like ethanol or
methanol or into gaseous fuels or into solid fuels.  Or they can be converted
into high priced chemicals or construction materials or paper.  Indeed, in the
final analysis the principal competitor to biofuels may not be wind or fossil
fuels but biochemicals and bioproducts.<p>

One hundred years ago the vast majority of the industrial materials we
consumed--dyes, inks, paints, medicines, clothing, synthetic fibers, plastics,
industrial chemicals--were derived from plant matter.  Just as fossil fuels
supplanted biofuels they also displaced biochemicals.<p>

In the last ten years the carbohydrate economy has made a comeback.  Advances
in biological processing have lowered the cost of making high quality
industrial products from plant matter while environmental regulations have
raised the cost of extracting, using and disposing of petroleum derived
products.<p>

A decade ago virtually the only plant-based products on the market were
adhesives and lubricating oils and a handful of intermediate chemicals. Today
plant matter based products compete in almost every major product category.  In
1980, for example, the vast majority of glycerol based compounds were made from
petroleum.  Today 85 percent are made from plant matter.  In 1980 most
industrial grade ethanol was made from petroleum.  Today most is made from
grains, even though this type of ethanol does not qualify for a tax credit.
Biopaints have captured about 3 percent of the paint market.  Vegetable oil
based inks have 8 percent of the printing ink market.  About 5 percent of
commodity plastics contain some plant matter based compounds.<a
href="bspch2fn.html#fn6">[6]</a>  ILSR estimates that over the next
five years the increase in biochemicals may surpass the increase in liquid
biofuels.<p>

In the future we may see millions of tons of starch diverted to the production
of plastics and away from lower cost ethanol.   One Seattle based company has
worked with ADM to convert sorbitol into polyols via a bioreactor process.
International Polyol Chemicals Inc.(IPCI) points out that ethanol's market
price is about 15 cents per pound while ethylene glycol, the least expensive
polyol, is 21 cents per pound, and propylene glycol costs more than 40 cents
per pound.<p>

Many proponents of biofuels point to the 350 million tons of agricultural and
forestry wastes available at the national level for further processing.<a
href="bspch2fn.html#fn7">[7]</a>  But a growing number of companies
are converting these wastes into construction materials or paper or chemicals.
Weyerhaeuser in Oregon may soon convert seed straw into boxboard.  Phenix
Composites in Minnesota is converting waste paper into a granite like board
that competes with very high priced hardwoods.  Agriboard in Iowa is producing
a particle board substitute from wheat straw.  In the Pacific Northwest
companies like Potlatch are raising tens of thousands of acres in fast growing
trees to be used for pulp.<p>

These companies may be able to pay a higher price for the raw or waste plant
matter than those seeking to convert it into fuels.  For example,  a Minnesota
forest products firm might pay a higher price for fast growing trees used for
making oriented strand board than another Minnesota company could to convert
these into competitive electricity.<p>

In the future we may find that plant matter goes not into a single product
facility but into biorefineries which, like petroleum refineries, take a single
feedstock and convert it into a variety of final products.  Corn based wet
mills do this now, producing corn meal, corn oil, carbon dioxide, starch, corn
syrup and ethanol from the basic feedstock.  Several companies now use a
pyrolysis process to break down wood wastes into carbon black, number six fuel
oil, and intermediate chemicals.<p>

<H3>Part 4:  The Economics of Biomass Electrification</H3>
Let me concentrate most of the remainder of this paper on biomass
electrification.<p>

The latest figures from EPRI show that conventional wood fired stoker boilers
are not competitive with fossil fueled power plants.  But new technologies like
Whole Tree Energy may reduce the cost of wood fired electricity to where it is
competitive with a new coal plant although higher than a natural gas combined
cycle plant.<p>

<p>
<p>
The widespread use of biological energy can occur in various ways.<p>

<H4>-Co-Firing</H4>
Co-firing of biomass with coal is not a new practice.<a href="bspch2fn.html#fn11">[11]</a>   Several dozen  utilities use 5-20 percent or
more biomass mixed with coal in at least one of their power plants.   The
potential market for biomass through co-firing is enormous.<p>

Wisconsin has 22 coal fired power plants with a combined capacity of 7,133 MW.
The Bayport NSP pant and the Blount Street plant of Madison Gas and Electric
Company are co fired, the first with wood and the second with densified
municipal solid wastes.   If biomass substituted for only 5 percent of the coal
used in Wisconsin's power plants,  it would create the equivalent of a 350 MW
baseload plant and would require more than 1 million tons of biomass a year.
If the ratio of biomass to coal rose to 20 percent, more than 4 million tons of
biomass would be needed.  About 4.5 million tons of wood residues are available
annually in Wisconsin.<a href="bspch2fn.html#fn12">[12]</a><p>

Co-firing can be done with wood waste, fast growing trees, or new energy crops.
 Northern States Power will be building a 50 MWe biomass fueled power plant by
1998, probably fueled by alfalfa.  Displacing 10 percent of its coal from its
Sherco complex would create the equivalent of about a 200 MWe biomass plant.<p>

A major study of co-firing is taking place at the Tennessee Valley
Authority(TVA).<a href="bspch2fn.html#fn13">[13]</a>  TVA owns and
operates 59 coal fired steam generators at 11 plant sites.  A preliminary
resource assessment found that 1-2 million oven dry tons of mill residues were
available and 12-25 million tons of logging residuals.    Biomass in the TVA
region could supply a baseload capacity of almost 3,000 MWe if this waste
biomass were fully recovered.   TVA's analysis also found that fast growing
trees, assuming a 3.5 dry tons per acre average yield, could produce about 75
million dry tons, sufficient to displace all of TVA's coal fired capacity.<p>

A case study analysis by TVA found that sufficient low cost biomass(less than
$1 per MMBtu) is available in unused mill residue to displace at least 15
percent of the coal.<p>

Co-firing may offer a major opportunity for expanding the use of biomass for
electricity generation.  But the use of biomass often requires investment in
plant modifications and also may require a higher cost overhead in order to
monitor the quality of the biomass.  Thus utilities may be interested in
co-firing only if large quantities of biomass can be purchased for a price
significantly less than the cost of coal($1.10-$1.40 per MMBtus).  Some waste
wood is available at this price but energy crops and fast growing trees would
probably be slightly more expensive than coal.  If Conservation Reserve Program
acreage were used, or if an environmental credit were given because of reduced
emissions, biomass would become more directly competitive with coal.<p>

<H4>-Whole Tree Energy(WTE)</H4>
Currently the cost of biomass electrification from wood fired stokers is 7-9
cents per kWh,  too high to compete in any scenario.  Energy Performance
Systems(EPS) of Minnesota has developed a patented technology that promises to
reduce these costs.   Harvesting costs are cut by $4-6 per ton by eliminating
the need for a skidder and chipper.  The very small furnace reduces capital
costs.  The system design achieves a heat rate of about 10,000 Btus per kWh
compared to 14,000 Btus for recent wood stokers.  Most wood fired plants
operate at low pressures and low temperatures and have a cycle efficiency of
15-25 percent.  EPS projects a 33 percent efficiency for its first plant, a 42
percent efficiency rate for its second plant and an ultimate efficiency
approaching 50 percent.<p>

EPS projects a cost of electricity from a 100 MWe plant of 5 cent per kWh.
This assumes the fuel is grown on CRP land.  EPS reportedly has offered to sign
a long term contract with performance guarantees with one utility at that
price.  EPS predicts that the price of electricity from future plants of
similar size would be 4.3 cents per kWh.<p>

<H4>-Energy Crops</H4>
Several agricultural energy crops are being seriously investigated.  In the
late 1980s Minnesota researched the feasibility of using sweet sorghum, with
its high sugar and fiber content, as an energy crop.  At least one company is
presently contracting with farmers for sweet sorghum for a combined biomass
electricity and ethanol plant.   Northern States Power is testing alfalfa as an
energy crop.  Iowa's Agricultural Extension Service is examining switch grass.
Each crop has its advantages and disadvantages.   Given the Minnesota law, an
alfalfa fueled plant will probably be the first to come on line.<p>

A preliminary calculation by the University of Minnesota found that if farmers
receive a $60 per ton price they would benefit from inserting alfalfa into a
corn-soybean rotation.<a href="bspch2fn.html#fn14">[14]</a>  The
annual return per acre was higher for the farmer than the conventional
soybean/corn rotation "with or without government program payments".<a
href="bspch2fn.html#fn15">[15]</a><p>

The vast majority of the revenues for the alfalfa processing facility would
come from stripping off the leaf protein and selling it as a mid grade bypass
protein.  Assuming a $125 per ton price for the protein, the stems, which
represent 50 percent by weight of the plant, might be sold for $20 per ton.
That would put the cost of the alfalfa fuel at about $2 per MMbtus.
Preliminary calculations from Iowa indicate a fuel cost from switchgrass of
about $2.50 per MMbtus.<p>

Both Iowa and Minnesota are looking to introduce their agricultural energy
crops at first by co-firing them with coal, then by gasifying them and
co-firing the gas with coal and finally, by gasifying the plant matter and
using it to run an advanced combustion turbine.<p>
<p>
Biomass gasifiers are relatively common and can be burned in conventional
boilers.  But the gas contains contaminants:  particulates, alkali gases, tars.
These must be removed before the gas can be used in an advanced gas turbine.
The cleanup of this gas constitutes the major obstacle to using biomass gas in
high efficiency gas turbines.<p>

Several biomass gasified turbine plants are about to become operational. A
pressurized gasifier fueled by wood chips will come on line this year in
Sweden.  It will generate 6 MW of electricity and 20 MW of heat for a district
heating system.  A 25-30 MWe Brazilian gasification plant will become
operational in 1995.  A third type of gasifier that uses as its feedstock
bagasse from sugar cane will begin operating in Hawaii next year.<p>

These three gasification power plants will provide the first concrete economic
information about biomass gasification.  A Shell Oil evaluation of the
Brazilian plant estimates a capital cost of $1300 per kW and a feedstock cost
from eucalyptus wood chips of $2.50 per MMBtus giving a total cost of 5.0-6.0
cents per kWh.  The most optimistic estimate predicts a price as low as 4.0
cents per kWh.<a href="bspch2fn.html#fn16">[16]</a><p>

<H4>-Fuel Cells</H4>
Fuel cells, which convert chemical energy directly into electricity, bypassing
the combustion stage, are entering the market for both stationary and mobile
applications.  These fuel cells currently run on natural gas or methanol or
directly on hydrogen but they could run on biogas, bioethanol or biomethanol.<p>

The Energy Research Corporation(ERC) of Connecticut is  evaluating for the
National Rural Electric Cooperative Association the use of low proof ethanol
for fuel cells.  Ethanol for ERC's fuel cells can be used in concentrations of
15-30 percent rather than 100 percent.  This could lower the production cost of
ethanol by as much as 30 percent.  Even with this 30 percent reduction, ethanol
is still more expensive than natural gas but if the ethanol tax credit were
available the price would be more competitive.<p>

It is also possible to gasify biomass or convert that gas into methanol and use
either the gas or the methanol in a fuel cell.  Currently one company, H Power
Corporation of New Jersey is powering a bus with fuel cells that make their own
hydrogen from methanol.  A General Motors study found that these buses would be
competitive with conventional buses if produced in significant quantities.
These fuel cells could use ethanol as well as methanol, although methanol is
cheaper and easier to use.<p>

Another company, M-C Power is also developing fuel cells that will run on
natural gas.  The company forecasts higher cost natural gas in the future and
views ethanol as a potential backup fuel that would allow the developer to
lower the rate he or she pays for natural gas by purchasing it under an
interruptible rate. M-C Power estimates this would reduce the price of the
natural gas by 30-70 cents per MMBtus.  This in turn could make ethanol a more
cost effective fuel for the 5-10 percent of the year it might be needed.<a
href="bspch2fn.html#fn17">[17]</a><p>

Most observers envision a hydrogen economy based on water.  But biomass
contains a great deal of hydrogen.<a href="bspch2fn.html#fn18">[18]</a>  Tests at Battelle's Columbus Laboratories have
found that 600,000 tons of dry biomass per year could generate sufficient
hydrogen to fuel 150,000 passenger cars.   This comes to about 3/4 of an acre
per car.  A 100 percent ethanol fueled car would require corn from about 2
acres and cellulose from about 1 acre.<p>

Battelle concluded that hydrogen would cost $6.20-$8.90 per MMBtus,  based on a
biomass feedstock cost of $2.10-$4.20 per MMBtus.   Assuming electricity at 4
cents per kWh, hydrogen from the electrolysis of water would cost about $20 per
MMbtus.<a href="bspch2fn.html#fn19">[19]</a><p>

<HR>
<H3>Policy Questions</H3>
The biological energy potential for agricultural or forestry states like
Wisconsin and Minnesota is very large.  Both Minnesota and Wisconsin have the
potential of completely displacing petroleum based transportation fuels with
biofuels.  Minnesota could do this by converting all of its existing corn
starch to ethanol.   Wisconsin can do this by converting a little over half of
its wood residues to ethanol.  Several dozen vehicles running on 85 percent
ethanol are already being used in Wisconsin and Iowa.  Buses powered by ethanol
are being used in Iowa and Illinois.  The midwestern states are organizing an
"ethanol highway", that is, a network of E85 ethanol refueling stations that
will allow the traveler to drive from the Canadian border to southern Kansas on
almost pure ethanol.<p>

Neither Wisconsin nor Minnesota has the potential for displacing a majority of
its electricity from biomass.  But in Minnesota, biomass electricity combined
with wind energy offers the possibility of renewable electricity becoming the
primary form of power generation.<p>

As we move into the biological energy era a number of important issues must be
addressed.<p>

<H4>-Tailoring Renewable Energy Incentives</H4>

Should we subsidize one form of bioenergy over another?  Ethanol receives a
federal tax credit of 54 cents per gallon and receives additional tax credits
in states like  Minnesota.  Nationally the average incentive for a gallon of
ethanol has been dropping over the past 15 years, from a high of $3.50 in 1980
to about 60 cents on average in 1991.<p>

The federal ethanol tax credit is almost as large as the wholesale price of
gasoline.  When combined with Minnesota's 40 cent state tax credit it is 50
percent greater than the price of gasoline.  Diesel fuels derived from
vegetable oils do not yet receive a federal tax credit.  The 1.5 cent per kWh
tax credit for biomass electricity is meaningful only if the recipient pays
sufficient economic taxes to use it.  And as noted above, the credit as
currently structured cannot be easily used.  In any case, the 1.5 cent credit
represents only half the cost of existing electricity and as low as a third of
the cost of new power plants. <p>
<!-- Graphic Tag -->
<IMG  SRC="bspch2f1.GIF"><p>
A good case can be made for extending the renewable energy tax credit to
vegetable oil derived diesel and to amend the Energy Policy Act to make the
biomass tax credit more readily available,  To pay for this, the ethanol credit
might be reduced.  Initially the ethanol credit needed to eliminate the cost
differential between ethanol and gasoline.  Today ethanol competes, not with
gasoline but with higher priced gasoline additives like MTBE.  Moreover, given
the mandates for ethanol in Minnesota and, soon on the national level, it seems
reasonable to reduce or restructure the ethanol tax incentives.<p>

<H4>-Fostering Local Economic Development</H4>

As we develop incentives to foster a biological energy economy we might
consider how to tailor those incentives to meet a variety of objectives.   For
example,  biological energy is more labor intensive than fossil fuel or uranium
derived energy.  Biorefineries are smaller than petroleum refineries and
biomass electric plants are much smaller than nuclear or coal fired power
plants.  Finally,  the fuel for biological energy plants can be locally
purchased.  The end result of these three factors is that biorefineries can be
an important element in a rural development strategy.<p>

Do we want to tailor incentives that maximize local economic development?
Almost 10 years ago Minnesota converted half of its state tax incentives for
ethanol into producer credits available only to in-state producers.  The
so-called "pump credits" were used to create a market for ethanol no matter
where it was produced. The producer credits are targeted to nurturing a
homegrown manufacturing capacity.<p>

On the other hand, Wisconsin's Public Service Commission introduced a .75 cents
per kWh incentive for renewable electricity plants payable to Wisconsin utility
shareholders so long as the electricity is consumed inside the state no matter
where the electricity is produced.    The first such credits were applied to
wind electricity generated in Minnesota.  Do we want to fashion incentives that
encourage in-state producers?<p>

Do we want to fashion incentives that encourage small scale and dispersed
production?  The Minnesota producer credit for ethanol, for example, has a
ceiling per producer.  The federal tax credit for ethanol does not.<p>

Do we want to favor certain organizational forms?  Cooperatives are ubiquitous
in the agricultural sector.  More than 4 million farmers belong to over 4,500
cooperatives with annual sales of $80 billion.  Biomass energy production lends
itself well to ownership by producer cooperatives.  Such cooperatives return a
significant share of the profits generated back to the local economy.  In
Minnesota more than 75 percent of the ethanol produced comes from a 2000 corn
farmer cooperative and three of the next four plants coming on line will
probably be cooperatives.  The University of Minnesota is actively
investigating the possibility of structuring an alfalfa cooperative which would
own the processing equipment, although not the power plant.<p>

<H4>-Protecting Wildlife and Soil</H4>

Dramatically expanding the use of biological energy raises important
environmental issues.  In the last few years we have gained increasing
sophistication about the relationship of farming techniques to soil erosion and
groundwater pollution.  We need to make certain that as we move toward a
biological economy we do not mine the soil, pollute the groundwater or destroy
native wildlife habitats.<p>

The Audubon Society, EPRI and other organizations have been engaged in a
several year roundtable discussion concerning how to design future energy
farms.  Their final report will be available soon.  Today fast growing trees on
CRP land must be planted in a way that does not exceed soil erosion tolerance
levels.  Minnesota biologists will soon release a preliminary analysis of the
impact of fast growing trees on small mammals and birds in and around Prairie
lands.  Those investigating the widespread use of alfalfa are examining how
harvesting can be done to minimize the disturbance to nests.<p>

No one can predict the future.  But together we can invent the future.  In the
last 15 years we've radically altered the rules regarding energy generation and
use.  In the next 15 years we will introduce new rules and create technologies
and new fuels consistent with these new rules.  Biological energy can and
should play an important role in this future, especially in agricultural
states.  How fast we move toward a biological economy and what the structure of
that economy looks like, depends on the decisions we make today.<p>

<HR>
<I>Biological Energy: Opportunities and Obstacles was originally delivered as a speech to the Biomass Energy Infrastructure Workshop in Madison, WI, on June 7, 1994.</I><P>

The speech is in five parts.  Please follow link at bottom of each page to get to the next section.
<HR>
<H3>Part 1:  Introduction and Background</H3>
Biological energy's time has come again.   I say again because 130 years ago
plant matter was our primary fuel.  Just before the Civil War wood generated 70
percent of the nation's total energy.  Ethanol was one of our leading chemicals
and lighting fuels.   But coal displaced wood and oil replaced ethanol and by
the late 1970s biological energy had virtually disappeared except a relatively
modest quantity of wood consumed in fireplaces and industrial boilers.  
<p>
We've come a long way since then.  In retrospect we can identify the specific
year the breakthrough occurred:  1978.  <p>

<H4>1978:  The Breakthrough Year</H4>
<p>
In 1978 five separate energy laws were enacted by Congress.  One of these, the
Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act(PURPA) required utilities to purchase
power so long as the independent power plant was fueled by renewable energy or
used cogeneration.  A second law provided substantial tax incentives for fuel
ethanol.<p>

PURPA drastically changed the structure of the electric utility industry.
Before 1978 there were virtually no independent power producers.  By 1993 about
60 percent of all new capacity brought on-line was owned by independent
developers, not utility companies.  PURPA made it possible for the forest
products industry to harness its vast supply of waste wood for electric
generation.  The amount of wood fired electricity soared from 200 MWe in 1978
to some 5,000 MWe today.  Today biomass accounts for about 3 percent of the
nation's electricity.    	<p>
The incentives for fuel ethanol made that fuel competitive with gasoline.  Yet
it is important to note that even with these incentives, ethanol had to
overcome many obstacles before it was widely used.   Gas stations owned by oil
companies, for the most part, refused to handle a non-petroleum derived
product.   Car companies in the early 1980s told their customers they would
void their warranties if they used ethanol.  Car mechanics were skeptical.  <p>

Ethanol producers overcame these obstacles and production rose from 20 million
gallons in 1978 to over 1 billion gallons by 1993.  Fuel ethanol has captured a
little over 1 percent of the transportation fuel market.   And ethanol's
biological brethren, vegetable oil based diesel is poised to enter the
commercial market.<p>

Having painted this somewhat rosy picture of recent history, it is important to
identify some less optimistic trends for biological energy.  The development of
renewable electricity has been accelerated by the high prices paid by utilities
on long term contracts in the early 1980s.  These prices were predicated on a
rapid growth in electricity in future years and the increased cost of new power
plants.  But the decline in oil and coal prices, the rise of low cost high
efficiency natural gas fired power plants and a surplus in conventional power
capacity because of an economic recession resulted in a stabilization and then
decline in electricity prices.   <p>

Wind developers are more prepared to deal with the lower price of electricity
since their basic technology has rapidly matured in the last decade.  The cost
of generating electricity from wind has dropped by some 80 percent since 1980,
according to the American Wind Energy Association.  Biological energy has not
done nearly as well.<p>

In 1986 1839 MWe of wood fueled generators went into operation, more than 60
percent of the 3054 MWe of power introduced from 1980 to 1985.  In 1989 614 MWe
went into operation.  In 1990 that number dropped to 250-300 MWe and may have
been below 200 MWe in 1993.<a href="bspch2fn.html#fn1">[1]</a>  In
New England a number of utilities are buying back the high priced contracts
they signed with owners of wood fired power plants back in the mid 1980s in
order to prematurely close these plants.<p>
  
Ethanol production is still expanding, thanks to the 1990 Clean Air Act, which
requires that gasoline contain oxygen during the winter months in certain urban
areas.  But the tax incentives for ethanol were originally expected to be
temporary, as gasoline prices were expected to be over $1.50 a gallon by now.
Ethanol production costs did decline, from about $1.80 to $1.10-$1.20 per
gallon.   But ethanol faces a sunset of its federal tax benefits in the year
2000.  And today it competes with a new generation of low cost non-petroleum
fuels that are more environmentally benign and lower cost than ethanol, like
natural gas,  electricity, propane or methanol.  The only major market where
ethanol might be able to compete straight up as a fuel is in air
transportation.  The first aircraft engines that run on ethanol are just now
being certified. <p>

Fuel ethanol has come under a savage attack by a powerful combination of oil
companies and environmentalists.  Environmentalists are concerned that ethanol
is not really a renewable fuel because certain agricultural practices appear to
mine the soil rather than husband it.  Others worry that if we feed our cars
with plant matter we may end up diverting scarce arable land from the more
important objective of providing food and feed to a growing population.  Still
others worry that ethanol in the gas tank can cause air quality problems.   Oil
companies argue against ethanol's direct tax incentives and find powerful
allies in federal and state highway departments who need more money to maintain
their extensive and aging road networks.   This powerful coalition is trying to
ban the use of ethanol in major urban areas beginning in 1995.<p>

Today we are at an energy crossroads.  There is no question we will continue to
expand our use of alternative forms of energy.  But it is not clear how or
whether this will translate into a major expansion in the use of biological
forms of energy.<p>

<HR>
<H3>Part 2: Changing the Rules</H3><p>
<p>
In 1978 we began to significantly change the rules governing our generation and
use of energy.  In the mid 1990s that process is continuing and accelerating.
Let me describe four examples of these new kinds of rules.<p>
<p>
<H4>-The 30 Percent Renewable Standard</H4>
Last December EPA proposed a renewable oxygenate rule which should become final
this month.  The rule would require that 30 percent of all oxygenates the Clean
Air Act requires to be added to gasoline sold in ozone non attainment areas
must be derived from renewable resources.  In practical terms this is an
ethanol mandate but its importance goes far beyond ethanol.  For this is the
first time the federal government has enacted a renewable energy standard.
<p>
The renewable oxygenate standard might be viewed as an environmental bookend to
President Clinton's Executive Order issued late last year that required 30
percent of all printing and writing paper purchased by the federal government
to contain 30 percent recycled content.  The recycled content standard speaks
to our need to conserve resources. The renewable oxygenate standard speaks to
our need to switch from non-renewable to renewable resources.<p>

The renewable oxygenate standard could be broadened into a more widely applied
renewable energy standard.  For example, federal law requires public and then
private vehicle fleets to use clean fuels.  The President, by Executive Order,
has shortened the phase-in period for federal fleet conversion.  Why not have
the federal fleet set an example by requiring that at least 30 percent of all
additional fleet vehicles purchased by the federal government be capable of
running on renewable fuels?  Not only ethanol but electric vehicles when the
electricity used by them is generated from renewable resources would qualify
under such a standard.<p>

The federal government also could require that 30 percent of all new
electricity purchased or generated by federal agencies be renewable fueled.  At
the state level, that is what Minnesota did last month.   The legislature
required Northern States Power to build or purchase 550 MW of renewable
electricity by 2002.  One hundred twenty five megawatts of that must be biomass
fueled.  That translates into 30 percent of all new electricity generated by
NSP and more than 20 percent of all new electricity consumed by Minnesota.<p>

A few years ago the Minnesota legislature also required that by 1997 all
gasoline sold throughout the state must contain oxygen year round.  Although
there is no quota for renewable energy in this law, the long distance from MTBE
production facilities and the quantity of homegrown ethanol available means
that realistically we might expect that in three years ethanol will account for
7.5-9 percent of all fuels consumed by Minnesota's automobiles and light
trucks.<p>

<H4>-The 1.5 cent per kWh Tax Credit</H4>
The Energy Policy Act of 1992 provided a 1.5 cent per kWh tax credit for
renewable electricity, including biomass grown specifically as an electric
fuel.  That tax incentive may make wind and biomass competitive with coal and
nearly competitive with natural gas.<p>

The Minnesota legislature this session created an additional tax credit that
specifically links biofuels and bioelectricity.  A 1.5 cent per kWh tax credit
was enacted for biomass fueled cogeneration that supplies steam and electricity
to an ethanol facility.<p>

The federal renewable electric tax credit has several shortcomings.  While in
theory it applies to both public and privately operated power plants, in
practice it does not. Tax credit for private companies can be taken off their
taxes while the tax credit for tax exempt entities like municipal or
cooperative utilities must come in the form of direct payments from Congress.
To date Congress has provided no money for this purpose.  The impact on the
national budget is the same, but Congress finds it much easier to subsidize by
reducing revenue rather than by increasing expenditures.   The result is that
cooperatives and municipal utilities or municipalities in general are not
benefiting from this incentive.  This significantly dampens public sector
enthusiasm for becoming more directly involved in renewable electricity
generation.<p>

The lack of Congressional appropriations burdens both wind and biomass
electrification.  The other shortcoming of the federal renewable electric tax
credit burdens only biomass.  The incentive applies only to "closed loop"
biomass, that is, to plant matter grown specifically for energy production.
Waste wood and existing trees do not qualify.  It is reasonable that the
government doesn't want to subsidize increased forest cutting or to create a
situation which will drive up the cost of lumber.  But some plant matter takes
5-10 years before it can be economically harvested.  The federal credit is
available only to power plants that come on-line by mid 1999.  Therefore plant
matter that will take more than 4 years to come to maturity will be ineligible
for this ten year tax benefit.<p>

The tax credit could still boost the prospects of energy crops like switchgrass
or alfalfa. These could conceivably be cultivated and harvested in substantial
quantities by 1999.  But another provision may hamper the rapid expansion of
this market.  The credit will apply only to plants where biomass is the primary
fuel, that is, where more than 50 percent of the fuel mix in terms of Btu
content is derived from plant matter.<a href="bspch2fn.html#fn2">[2]</a>   This means the tax credit is not available for
co-firing 5-20 percent biomass with coal. Co-firing may represent the largest
and most economical short term entry point for large scale biomass
electrification.<p>

<H4>-European Developments</H4>

The rules are changing not only in this country, but in Europe as well.
Several years ago Europe allowed farmers to take 15 percent of their land out
of food production and use it for raising non-food crops while receiving
financial benefits.   The program is somewhat similar to our Conservation
Reserve Program, but a wider variety of crops are covered:  rapeseed,  hemp and
kenaf.  The European Parliament is about to give countries the authority to
reduce or eliminate fuel taxes on ethanol and biodiesel.  France and Italy have
already done this.  We can expect a very dramatic expansion in the use of
biomass fuels, both liquid and solid as well as other industrial products made
from plant matter, in Europe in the coming months and years.<p>

<H4>-The Conservation Reserve Program</H4>
The Conservation Reserve Program(CRP) is set to expire next year.  It is
unclear what form, if any, it will take in the new farm bill.  The U.S.
Department of Agriculture has for several years been promoting the use of fast
growing trees on this land.   Currently farmers can get a 5 year extension if
they plant their acres in fast growing trees.  In some southern states trees
account for more than 90 percent of the CRP acreage planted.   Southern farmers
already have an established market for southern pine.  In Minnesota trees
account for only 2-3 percent of CRP acreage.  Minnesota farmers have no
established markets for hybrid poplars.   CRP payments can reduce the cost of
biomass by more than $1 per MMBtus, making biomass competitive or nearly
competitive with coal.<p>

<H4>-Internalizing Environmental Costs</H4>
States are moving toward a full cost accounting system by taking into account
the environmental costs of fuels.   Eight state regulatory commissions,
including those in Wisconsin and Minnesota, have quantified the environmental
costs of electric generation and require utilities to take these costs into
account when they decide which resources to acquire.<p>

A cost estimates of environmental damage vary widely.   By far the largest cost
element is carbon dioxide emissions.  The Wisconsin Public Service Commission's
estimates presented below fall in the mid-range of environmental cost
estimates.  If biomass is credited for the carbon dioxide absorbed as it grows,
utilities would be able to pay about 1.5 cents per kWh more for biomass
electrification than coal fired electricity.  Biomass would have a half penny
per kWh advantage over high efficiency gas turbines and a one cent advantage
over conventional gas fired combustion turbines.  Of course, environmental
adders also make wind and other forms of solar energy more competitive.<p>

In essence, the OPEC system can literally pay for itself by capturing electricity at lower costs, storing it, and providing it for your use during on-peak, high-cost hours.<P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>How OPEC Works</H3>The heart of the OPEC system is a control relay station that functions in conjunction with your current circuit breaker panel.When your next power failure occurs the control relay station will automatically disconnect from your utility company's grid system and switch to the OPEC's energy reserve.  The system is re-energized after utility power is restored.<P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>OPEC System Economics</H3>The cost of your system will vary from $1,595 to $3,685 depending on the load (electrical devices) that you wish to control.<P>The system can be expanded as your needs change, and each OPEC system includes a full two year parts and labor guarantee.<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Why OPEC is Necessary</H3>Due to population growth, an ever-increasing demand for electricity and reliability problems associated with existing delivery systems, power failures are becoming more and more disruptive.<P>Power failures are a serious concern in the winter months, but they can also cause major problems during the rest of the year.  For example, if the power fails in the spring during the flooding season, or during a major rain storm, and the sump pump cannot function to get the water out of th basement, most insurance companies will not cover the damages.A major utility is planning to utilize the OPEC System to protect senior citizens from the lethal effects of the loss of grid power during the extreme heat of summer.  OPEC can provide cooling fans which could prevent heat exhaustion. <P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>What's the Answer</H3>Until recent technological advances, the answer for emergency back-up electricity has been cumbersome generators powered by fuel.  Generators are expensive to operate, only work if you are there to hook it up and start it, and typically run for only a few hours.  Now there's an alternative.<P>At prices starting under $1600, Enercheck Systems or Energy Reclamation Corporation can now equip your home, small business, or barn with an electrical storage system called an Off Peak Emergency Circuit (OPEC).  Because an OPEC stores up to 72 hours of power, you'll never again be left in the dark.<P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Here's How the OPEC Works</H3>The heart of the OPEC component system is a control relay station that functions in conjunction with your circuit breaker panel.  When your next power failure occurs, the control relay station will automatically disconnect from your utility company's grid system (power lines) and tap into an energy reserve stored at your location.  This reserve will power what you consider to be your daily essential.  For some, heat and light will suffice.  For others, more electricity will be required.  No matter what the season, or what your needs are, the OPEC system will provide you with the emergency power you demand - while other are scrambling for generators or heading for the emergency shelters.<P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>An OPEC System Can Pay for Itself</H3>By combining emerging technologies, this state-of-the-art system can be programmed to purchase power from your utility company at off peak rates, slashing your electrical bills by 50% or more per month.  In essence, an OPEC can literally pay for itself by capturing electricity at lower costs, storing it, and providing it for your use during high-demand hours.<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>An OPEC is Your Link to Energy Self-Sufficiency</H3>Because of the OPEC's ability to interface with existing utility suppliers and capture power at off-peak rates, you can now take a bite out of your ever-increasing electrical costs.  In addition, the OPEC has been thoughtfully designed to convert and store power from solar, wind, and other electrical generating systems.  <P>Should you ever desire to become self-sufficient and sustainable, and say goodbye to your current provider we have the expertise and competitively priced products to get you there.  Considering the waste and pollution generated by nuclear and coal power plants, steps toward self-sufficiency will be a great way for you to save money and honor the Earth.<P>Contact us for further information at the following address:<P><CENTER><B>Enercheck Systems Inc</B> <BR>191 West 5th Street <BR>Cottonwood, MN  56229 <BR>(507) 423-5547<BR>E-mail:  <!-- MailTo Tag --><A HREF="MAILTO:djuhl@polaristel.net">Dan Juhl</A>,  (djuhl@polaristel.net)</CENTER><P><CENTER><B>Energy Reclamation Corporation</B> <BR>2801 18th Avenue South <BR>Minneapolis, MN  55407<BR>(612) 722-4951 </CENTER><HR>Return to the <A HREF="http://www.me3.org/">Sustainable Minnesota Home Page</A></BODY></HTML>

<B>Background</B><BR><BR>

     The Minnesota Wood Energy Scale-up Project planning began in 
late 1993.  The purpose of the project is to track and monitor 
economic costs of planning, maintaining, and monitoring larger 
scale commercial plantings of hybrid popular.  For 15 years, only 
smaller scale research and experimental plantings of hybrid 
popular have been utilized to screen for promising high-yielding 
candidate species.  Currently, 1,850 acres of hybrid popular 
trees have been planted on Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) 
lands near Alexandria, Minnesota.  Progression of the work has 
proceeded in phases; Phase 1 (1994) planted 1,000 acres, and 
Phase 2 (1995) planted 850 acres.  To date, eighteen landowners 
have recontracted with the CRP for five-year extensions of their 
existing 10-year contracts in order to plant hybrid popular.  The 
5-year extension continues annual "rental" payments to landowners 
for five mroe years.  The extended contracts will begin to expire 
in 2001, or when the first plantings will be 7 years old.<BR><BR>  
     There are no current contracts in place for the wood these 
trees are projected to supply.  The structure of the wood 
fiber-farming industry in Minnesota has changed drastically over 
the past 5 years.  Stumpage values for fiber have risen to more 
that $30 per cord in some areas raising the possibility that 
these trees could be used for fiber rather than energy.  Several 
legislative mandates have forced the Sate of Minnesota to pursue 
a strong commitment to renewable energy.  These mandates, a 
potential need for an additional 1,700 megawatts of power by 2008 
by Northern States Power Company, and the upcoming 1995 Farm Bill 
deliberations will all play strong roles in developing markets 
for wood produced much like agricultural crops. <BR><BR> 
     There has been a tremendous of local and international 
interest in the project.  Many tours have been provided for local 
decision makers, resource managers, fiber and energy industry 
representatives, and others including a group of forestry related 
professionals from Australia.  A tour of international 
researchers coordinated with an International Energy Association 
workshop will be held September 25-26, 1995.  The Natural 
Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) has indicated support of a 
role for energy corps in the 1995 Farm Bill.  Recent local and 
national press has highlighted this project (e.g. The Wall Street 
Journal, TVA Southeastern Regional Biomass Energy Program 
Newsletter, Agri-News, The Land Magazine, Wadena Pioneer Journal, 
Alexandria Echo Press, Morris Sun, and local television 
stations).<BR><BR>  
     Contractual negotiations between the MN Department of 
Natural Resources - Division of Forestry, the Oak Ridge National 
Lab, the WesMin RC&D Council, and others are currently underway 
to secure funding for the planting of an additional 3,000 acres 
in 1996.<BR><BR>

<B>General Information</B><BR><BR>

     WesMin became an interested partner in the venture as an 
opportunity to create jobs, offer alternative income to farmers, 
improve the environment, and help reduce Minnesota's energy 
dependence.  Partners in the project requested WesMin to submit 
funding proposals, receive project funding, and serve as project 
administrator.  Many questions regarding wildlife impacts, soil 
suitability, growth characteristics, maintenance systems, and the 
environment also supported implementation of this project.  The 
WesMin Resource Conservation & Development (RC&D) Council has 
assumed responsibility for operations management and oversight, 
coordination and procurement of services, materials, and needs in 
establishing and maintaining all project acreage planted.   The 
WesMin RC&D Council receives funding from many sources and makes 
disbursements in a coordinated manner to ensure accurate audited 
payments and quality control of work.  WesMin also monitors 
results, reports on progress, conducts surveys, works out 
procedural approaches, offers coordination among several 
agencies, holds meetings, and serves as the information center 
for the project.<BR><BR>

<B>Project Objectives</B><BR><BR>

     <UL><LI>Plant 2,000 acres of Short Rotation Wood Crops (SRWC) within 
a 50 mile radius of Alexandria, MN as a scale-up demonstration, 
using National Biofuels Roundtable principles and guidelines.
     <LI>Use knowledge and experience gained to improve efficiency.
     <LI>Improve yield information by planting more acres of 
preferred hybrid poplar clones to the extend they are available 
from nurseries.  
     <LI>Expand available sites for continued monitoring of the 
infra-structure, economic, and environmental aspects of scale-up 
size plantations.  Target larger tracts in 1995.
     <LI>Continue work with nurseries to expand both clonal varieties 
and numbers of hybrid poplar cuttings produced.  
     <LI>Refine protocol for a scale-up requiring up to 10,000 acres 
per year.
     <LI>Expand public meetings to encourage increased landowner 
interest and opportunities for future expansion.
     <LI>Demonstrate viable alternatives for land in the soon to be 
expired Conservation Reserve Program.</UL><BR>
<BR>

<B>Additional Activities</B><BR>
<BR>
     The WesMin RC&D Council recently hosted a meeting to 
determine landowner/grower interest in forming a cooperative.  
The MN Extension Service, the Cooperative Development Service, 
the Agricultural Utilization and Research Institute are providing 
invaluable technical and planning assistance.  The cooperative 
would serve many purposes including;<BR>
<BR>
<OL> 
     <LI>Marketing
     <LI>Technical Transfer
     <LI>Communication
     <LI>Technical Assistance
     <LI>Technical Assistance
     <LI>Other Services</OL><BR>
<BR>
     
     The formation of a growers association is very likely.  
Project sponsors continue to work toward commercialization of 
hybrid poplar plantings.  Planning is now in progress to invite 
private industry to take an active role in the planting of hybrid 
poplar plantations to help meet their resource demands.  Several 
companies have indicated an interest to becoming partners to 
plant hybrid poplar.  A consortium of people directly involved 
with hybrid poplar commercialization and research was recently 
formed to improve communications and maintain continuity in 
Minnesota.<BR>
<BR>

     WesMin is directly involved in research efforts focused on 
herbicide trials, plastic mulch, and genetic trials.  Additional 
research activities led by the University of Minnesota and the 
Natural Resources Research Institute relate to small mammal and 
soil resource studies.<BR>

<HTML> <HEAD><TITLE>ILSR Press Release 2/5/97-Ethanol Report</TITLE></HEAD> <BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"> PRESS RELEASE<BR>Date:  February 5, 1997<P>Contact:  <!-- MailTo Tag --><A HREF="MAILTO:dmorris@ilsr.org">David Morris</A>, dmorris@ilsr.org<H3>Institute:  While Comprehensive, Errors in Legislative Auditor's Report Reduce its Value</H3>Minneapolis, MN- The director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance said that a legislative auditor's report on Minnesota's ethanol industry, while comprehensive, contains several major errors of fact which mar the report's overall value.<P>"I am pleased that the legislative auditor apparently has recognized the comprehensive and remarkably successful strategy Minnesota has used to promote a homegrown transportation industry", says Dr. David Morris, Vice President of the Minneapolis and Washington, D.C. based Institute for Local Self-Reliance.  "Unfortunately, several major errors of fact and interpretation mar the report's overall value and endow it with an unnecessarily negative tone." <P>Morris said the success of Minnesota's homegrown fuels strategy is evident.  The industry started with one small plant in 1987 and will grow by the end of 1997 to 11 plants with nearly 1400 workers are employed in jobs that pay from $9-14 per hour, with health insurance and other benefits.   Almost two thirds of the 150 million gallons of ethanol Minnesota drivers consume each year is now produced in the state.  Ethanol accounts for about 4 percent of the state's transportation fuel.  <P>"As the auditor's report recognizes, the farmer-owned nature of Minnesota's ethanol plants combined with their small scale have combined to give the industry the flexibility they need in an era of volatile corn prices.  When corn prices hit their historic highs last summer the very large corporate owned ethanol plants in Iowa shut down while Minnesota's smaller cooperatively owned plants continued to operate", says Morris.  "These are not branch plants of some large corporation.  These are locally owned businesses that are figuratively and literally rooted in their communities."<P>Morris said that, unfortunately, these important facts are overshadowed by errors in the auditor's cost-benefit analysis of the state's ethanol industry.  The auditor estimates that if all of the state's ethanol incentives showed up in the pump price, the cost would be 1.1-3.3 cents a gallon.  Morris said the lower estimate is the equivalent cost of the state's tax incentives for ethanol, which is accurate.  The higher figure is inaccurate.<P>"The higher figure assumes that even with the tax incentives, the price of ethanol is higher than the price of competing oxygenates or gasoline octane enhancers.  This is untrue.    It may be that the cost of gasoline in oxygenated areas is higher than in non-oxygenated areas but that has nothing to do with the price of ethanol.  As farmers know from long experience, the retail price can go up while the price they receive stays low," Morris said.<P>Morris said that he was disappointed and somewhat surprised that the auditor failed to compare the economic incentives provided to ethanol with those provided to gasoline.  Last summer, the Institute issued a widely reported study entitled,  "Oil Slickers: How Petroleum Benefits at the Taxpayers Expense",  that provided a detailed expert examination of gasoline subsidies. <P>In that report, Dr. Jenny Wahl, one of the nation's leading tax experts, estimated that Minnesota pay over 30 cents per gallon in subsidies for tax and other incentives provided to the petroleum industry.  The study looked at tax incentives provided to the petroleum industry, the cost of cleaning up pollution associated with gasoline and defense costs to protect access to oil reserves.<P>The study found that Minnesota motorists pay 1.45 cents per gallon more for gasoline because of tax incentives provided to the oil industry.  Minnesotans also pay 1-2 cents per gallon more to fund the cleanup of the pollution caused by underground gasoline tanks.<P>"The bottom line is that for 1.1 cents per gallon Minnesotans have created a vibrant, highly competitive and constantly innovating homegrown industry based on renewable resources.  On the other hand, Minnesotans continue to pay over 30 cents per gallon in incentives to a nonrenewable fuels industry increasingly based on imported crude oil that provides few if any long term benefits to this state," Morris said.<P>Morris was critical of the audit's environmental conclusion because it focuses almost entirely on ethanol's impact on carbon monoxide and relies entirely on a highly controversial report by one scientific body.  He said that conclusion is "counter intuitive and is contradicted by many peer reviewed studies on the subject."<P>The report by the National Research Council, which the auditor used in reaching its environmental conclusions, was also criticized by the Environmental Engineering Program at the University of California, Berkeley.  In a letter to the NRC, two professors from the Program raised questions concerning the report's findings on air quality impacts of oxygenated fuels and said there was a "systematic bias in the NRC report against studies where oxygenated gasoline was found to reduce carbon monoxide."<P>Morris said he was also disappointed that the auditor did not take into account the comparative environmental impact of ethanol versus the elements of gasoline it displaces, which he refers to as a "chemical stew."  He said that when ethanol is used in the gas tanks of cars, it displaces the most toxic parts of gasoline.    One scientific analysis found that a 10 percent ethanol blend reduces the overall toxicity of gasoline by an astounding 21 percent. <P>"Overall, it's a very comprehensive report that provides probably the most complete analysis of ethanol I have ever seen.  Unfortunately, because of errors and misinterpretations, its use is limited", Morris concluded.<P>The Institute for Local Self-Reliance is a 22 year old organization established to foster environmentally sound economic development.  Working in the energy field for more than 20 years, Dr. David Morris has written three books on energy and has served as an advisor to local, state, and federal governments in the U.S. and abroad, as well as to private businesses, on economic development policy.<P><HR>Return to the <!-- Link Tag --><A HREF="http://www.me3.org/">Sustainable Minnesota Home Page</A></BODY> </HTML>

<H2>GAO Report Says Cutting Ethanol Tax Incentives Would Increase Deficit</H2>
 
                      
    According to a new report by the General Accounting Office (GAO), the investigative arm of Congress, eliminating the ethanol tax incentive "results in a
net loss to the U.S. Treasury and lower farm income from corn."<P>

   Over a five year period from 1996 to the year 2000, the GAO said, the Treasury
could lose from $2.5 billion to more than $6.3 billion because of increased farm
support payments to corngrowers.<P>

   GAO calculated the effect on government agricultural payments in two ways --
one, assuming a 50 percent cut in ethanol production because of the proposed tax
change, and two, a much sharper 90 percent drop in ethanol.<P>

   Estimates of the effects ranged from $2.5 billion to $3.2 billion
in increased government payments to farmers if ethanol production were cut in
half.  If production suffered a 90 percent drop, government costs could soar
from $5.4 billion to as much as $6.3 billion over the 1996- 2000 period.<P>

   GAO also pointed out that farmers' incomes would suffer dramatically as a
result.  Not only would corngrowers be affected, but so would growers of wheat,
sorghum, barley and other crops.<P>

   The plan to cut ethanol's tax incentive program is being pushed by Rep. Bill
Archer (R-Tex.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.<P>

<html><head><title>Speech Biomass Electricity Economics</title></head><body><p>
<H2>The Economics of Plant Matter Derived Electricity</H2><p>
David Morris, Vice President<p>
Institute for Local Self-Reliance<p><p>

<I>Originally delivered at the conference titled, "Renewable Electricity:  Farming a Sustainable Energy Crop", in Collegeville, Minnesota, March 22, 1994.</I>
<p>
	Plant matter fueled power plants are not a new phenomenon.   But when electric
utilities gained a monopoly over electric generation in the 1920s they
forestalled any further development of small scale, biomass power plants.  In
1978 there was only about 200 MW of biomass electric generating capacity in the
U.S.  <p>
<p>
	In 1978 the Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act(PURPA) abolished the
monopoly utilities had on electric power sales and required utilities to
purchase power from, and supply electricity at non-discriminatory rates to
independent power producers.   <p>
		<p>
	PURPA, plus the rising cost of oil in the early 1980s, increased biomass
electric generating capacity to over 6,000 MW by 1992.  Almost 90 percent of
this was generated from wood.  The rest was primarily generated from municipal
garbage incinerators.  <p>
<p>
	Estimates of the number of wood fired power plants ranges from 600 to almost
1,000.  Most are small, in the 10-25 MWe range.    Only a third of these plants
offer electricity for sale.  The rest are owned and operated by the paper and
wood products industries for their own use.  <p>
<p>
	In the last eight years the rate of introduction of wood electric plants
peaked and then fell dramatically. In 1986, 1839 MWe from wood burning
generators went into operation,  more than 60 percent of the 3054 MWe of power
introduced from 1980 to 1985.  But as the price of oil declined and federal tax
incentives ended the rate of introduction of wood fired power plants dropped.
In 1989, 614 MWe of wood fueled electricity went into operation.  In 1990 that
number fell to 250-300 MWe<a href="bspch1fn.html#fn1">[1]</a> and
may have been below 200 MWe in 1993.  <p>
<p>
	The cost of electricity from wood fired power plants is 6.5 to over 9.0 cents
per kWh.  With heat rates of 14,000-18,000 Btus per kWh these plants have
efficiencies of 18-24 percent.<a href="bspch1fn.html#fn2">[2]</a>
They are competitive only inasmuch as they can receive feedstock at very low
prices.<a href="bspch1fn.html#fn3">[3]</a> <p>
<p>
	Although a considerable quantity of waste wood is still available for electric
generation, the rising cost of lumber and the increasing use of waste wood for
engineered wood products dims the prospects that this would constitute a large,
reliable long term feedstock.  Today biomass electricity focuses on new
feedstocks like fast growing trees or cellulosic crops like switchgrass or
alfalfa.   <p>
<p>
	Yet except for the use of wood as a feedstock in a mix with coal in power
plants,  the new forms of biomass electrification have not yet been
commercially tested.  That makes a discussion of their economics highly
speculative.    Unlike wind turbines, which have a 10 year track record of
reliable operation, an installed capacity of over 1500 MW in the United States
and a price, based on competitive bidding, of 5 cents per kWh or below, the new
biomass electric plants lack a track record and in some cases do not even have
significant demonstration test data.  <p>
<p>
	Biomass electrification has certain disadvantages compared to wind
electricity.    Wind electric developers could focus on improving the
conversion efficiency of their turbines.  The wind was going to blow and
although it might vary in speed and direction it would not vary in content.
Biomass electric developers, on the other hand, must convince farmers to grow
their fuel or they cannot build a power plant.  And the compositiono f biofuels
varies substantially among different crops.  Farmers will not raise a fuel crop
unless guaranteed a market.  This represents a classic chicken-and-egg dilemma.
<p>
<p>
	Biomass has one important advantage over wind.  It comes with its own built-in
storage system.  Therefore, biomass electric plants can operate as baseload
plants as well as intermediate and peaking plants.   Thus biomass based
independent power producers can earn capacity credits for generating
electricity.  And since baseload plants, either coal or nuclear, are the
dirtiest kinds of power generation because of their air pollutants or wastes,
biomass power plants might be able to gain significant pollution credits .<p>
<p>
	Table A offers an overview of the comparative economics of various biomass
electric technologies, a new coal plant with flue gas desulfurization and a
natural gas fired combined cycle turbine.  These figures should be viewed with
caution.  They are more useful as a measure of comparative costs than of actual
costs.  The greatest controversy are might be in the estimates of the cost of
advanced wood gasification combined cycle(GCC). Some have estimated a cost of
electricity at 4-6 cents per kWh.<a href="bspch1fn.html#fn4">[4]</a><p>

</TABLE>
<p>
<p>
<p>
	I would like to briefly discuss each of these technologies, beginning with
those with the nearest term prospects and clearest economics and ending with
the more speculative technologies.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>*	CO-FIRING BIOMASS WITH COAL</b><p>
<p>
	Mixing biomass with coal is not uncommon in the pulp and paper industry or the
utility industry.    Ratios of 10-20 percent biomass are often used in
co-firing.  An Electric Power Research Institute analysis concluded that the
cost of electricity from co-firing coal with 15 percent wood is about 2.8 cents
per kWh.<a href="bspch1fn.html#fn6">[6]</a>    The economics of
co-firing look very good if wood can be purchased for less than the cost of
coal.<a href="bspch1fn.html#fn7">[7]</a>  However, biomass could
cost more than coal and still be economically attractive if the power plant or
independent power producer were to gain environmental benefits.  NSP's Bayfront
power plant in northern Wisconsin reportedly has sufficiently reduced sulfur
dioxide emissions by using wood that it has qualified for a $2 per ton emission
credit under the Clean Air Act.  And ash from its wood fired boilers is
suitable for land spreading as an agricultural amendment.<a href="bspch1fn.html#fn8">[8]</a><p>
<p>
	Agricultural crops could also be co-fired with coal but since they contain
high levels of contaminants they would be used in smaller proportions.
However, Denmark has built a dedicated boiler to burn small grain straw with
coal at very high percentages and has reported a 50 percent reduction in SO2
emissions.<a href="bspch1fn.html#fn9">[9]</a> <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>*	WHOLE TREE ENERGY (WTE)</b><p>
<p>
	WTE is a patented technology developed by Energy Performance Systems of
Minnesota.  Aside from co-firing, WTE is the nearest term candidate for
generating significant biomass electricity.  <p>
<p>
	WTE reduces costs below those of conventional wood fired stoker boilers in
several areas. Harvesting costs are cut by $4-6 per ton by eliminating the need
for a skidder and chipper.  The very small furnace reduces capital costs.  The
system design achieves a heat rate of about 10,000 Btus per kWh compared to the
14,000 Btus for recent wood stokers.  Most wood fired plants operate at low
pressures and low temperatures and have a cycle efficiency of l5-25 percent.
WTE projects a 33 percent efficiency for its first plant,  a 42 percent
efficiency rate for its second plant and an ultimate efficiency approaching 50
percent, in the range of gas fired combined cycle turbines.<a href="bspch1fn.html#fn10">[10]</a>  <p>
<p>
	The developers of WTE, Energy Performance Systems estimate that the cost of
electricity from a 100 MWe plant would be about 5 cents but that subsequent
plants would generate electricity at 4.3 cents per kWh.  According to EPS,
sufficient private capital is available to build a 100 MWe electric plant at a
long term contract price of 5.0 cents per kWh.<a href="bspch1fn.html#fn11">[11]</a>  <p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>* 	GASIFICATION</b><p>
<p>
	Gasifiers are quite common throughout the world.  They are mostly small units
but several larger ones have been built recently in Finland and Sweden.<a
href="bspch1fn.html#fn12">[12]</a>    Biomass can be gasified and
the raw gas run into a boiler to generate steam that goes into a turbine.   For
many people, the real goal is to gasify biomass and run it into a high
efficiency gas turbine.  However,  biomass generated gas contains a large
amount of contaminants:  particulates, alkali gases, tars.  These must be
removed before the gas enters the turbine.  The cleanup of this gas constitutes
the major obstacle to using biomass gas in gas turbines.<p>
<p>
	There are several gasification turbine plants about to become operational.  A
pressurized gasifier will be operational in Sweden by the middle of 1994.  It
will be fueled by wood chips and will generate 6 MW of electricity and 20 MW of
heat for a district heating system.  A Brazilian gasification plant of 25-30
MWe will be operational in 1995.    A Shell Oil evaluation of the Brazilian
plant estimates a capital cost of $1300 per kW and, with a feedstock cost from
eucalyptus wood chips of $2.50 per MMBtu a total cost of 5-6 cents per kWh.<a
href="bspch1fn.html#fn13">[13]</a>  A third type of gasifier that
uses as its feedstock bagasse from sugar cane will be operational early next
year in Hawaii. <p>
<p>
	These three gasification power plants will provide the first concrete economic
information at significant scale operations.  That information should be
available by late 1995.<p>
<p>
	At least one company in Wisconsin is currently looking to repower an abandoned
coal fired power plant by gasifying switchgrass.  The coal plant lacks a grate,
a necessary and expensive item for a wood fired power plant.  Gasifying the
switchgrass would avoid the need for a grate and constitute about the same
capital investment.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>*</b>	<b>FUEL CELLS</b><p>
<p>
	Although biomass is rarely discussed with regard to fuel cells, recent
developments may make that appropriate.  Energy Research Corporation(ERC) has
developed an unusual purchasing collaborative with many municipal and
cooperative utilities to develop a small scale molten carbonate fuel cell.
Unlike conventional power plants, fuel cells do not convert water to steam to
generate electricity.   A fuel is fed into the fuel cell and the cell generates
electricity directly.  Furthest along toward commercialization among the
various fuel cell technologies is ERC's 2 MW molten carbonate uel cell, the
first of which will be operational in Santa Clara in 1995.  <p>
<p>
	For the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association ERC has evaluated the
use of low proof ethanol for their fuel cell.  Ethanol as an automotive fuel is
blended with gasoline and thus must eliminate virtually all of the water
normally contained in alcohol.    Ethanol for ERC's fuel cell can be used at
concentrations of 15-30 percent rather than 100 percent.  This can lower the
production cost of ethanol by as much as 30 percent.<a href="bspch1fn.html#fn14">[14]</a>  Even with this 30 percent reduction, ethanol is
still much more expensive than natural gas, but if the ethanol tax credit were
available the price would be much more competitive.  It could also be possible
to gasify biomass and use that as a fuel or to convert that gas into methanol,
an easier to use alcohol than ethanol as the fuel for a fuel cell.<a
href="bspch1fn.html#fn15">[15]</a> <p>
<p>
	Another company, M-C Power Corporation, is developing fuel cells projects a
higher cost for natural gas in the near future and sees ethanol being used as a
backup fuel to allow the developer to contract for interruptible natural gas.
Presently this would lead to a 30-70 cents per million Btu price reduction.
According to the company, this could allow for a cost effective operation of
the power plant on ethanol for 5-10 percent of the year.<a href="bspch1fn.html#fn16">[16]</a>  <p>
<p>
	<p>
<b>FEEDSTOCKS</b><p>
<p>
	It appears that in the next 3-5 years,  biomass electrification will come in
three forms:  wood fired power plants where very low cost waste wood is
available;  co-firing of biomass with coal;  whole tree energy plants.    In
the 5-10 year time frame biomass gasification into gas turbines will come
on-line, using a variety of feedstocks.  Whole tree energy plants will depend
on fast growing trees--probably willows or poplars in Minnesota's climate.
Co-firing or direct combustion or gasification can rely on either fast growing
trees or crops.  <p>
<p>
	The two crops examined in the Minnesota situation are switchgrass and alfalfa.
In Wisconsin and Iowa the focus appears to be on switchgrass.  Minnesota is
focusing on alfalfa. <p>
<p>
	Plans for an alfalfa powered electric plant presume an alfalfa processing
facility that strips off the high protein leaves.  This portion of the plant
will be sold as a high value feed.  Assuming a $125 per ton price for the
leaves, the remaining 60 percent of the plant that is cellulose can be used as
a fuel at a cost of about $1.60 per MMbtus, a price competitive with fast
growing trees and only slightly higher than coal.  If the price for the alfalfa
were to drop to $90 per ton, the cost of fuel would have to increase to $2.50
per MMbtus to achieve the same profit.  This is twice the price of coal and is
in the upper range of the cost of fast growing trees.<a href="bspch1fn.html#fn17">[17]</a><p>
<p>
	An alfalfa based power plant would have two revenue centers.  The revenue from
the sale of the protein meal would be significantly greater than the sale of
the electricity.  <p>
<p>
	It is projected that farmers will grow alfalfa for a fuel crop if they receive
$60 per ton.  Switchgrass requires a selling price of around $36 a ton.  But
switchgrass will not have a significant feed market, so its cost on a million
Btu basis will be in the same range as alfalfa.  Indeed, the economics of both
of these crops depends to a significant degree on the yield and the operating
expenses and these depend both on the farmer and on the evolving learning
curve.<p>
<p>
	It is quite possible that in the future we will see a combination of energy
crops, depending on the kind of soil and location.  For example, some in Iowa
are thinking of planting switchgrass on the hilly sections of land as a soil
erosion reduction crop and planting woody crops like willows or poplars near
rivers that might flood.    <p>
<p>
	Aside from the construction of a Whole Tree Energy plant, the strategy for
many is to encourage dedicated energy crops by substituting biomass for coal in
coal fired power plants.  The next step is to move to gasification and finally
to gasification into a gas turbine or conceivably, into a fuel cell.  <p>
<p>
	Many coal fired power plants are operating at low capacities or are in the
process of being shut down.  One Wisconsin developer is seeking to purchase an
abandoned coal power plant.  Capital costs could be as little as $300-500.  The
plant would initially use up to 15 percent biomass.  The biomass would then be
gasified and the raw gas sent directly into the boiler.  This particular coal
plant lacks a grate, a necessary ingredient for a biomass plant and the cost of
installing a grate is in the same range as the cost of gasifying the biomass.
A final step would be to install a high efficiency gas turbine.   <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ENVIRONMENTAL ADDERS AND REGULATORY INTERVENTION</b><p>
<p>
	The discussion to date has ignored current and possible future incentives for
biomass electrification.  These should be factored into any economic
discussion.  The Energy Policy Act of 1992 provides for a 1.5 cent per kWh tax
credit or producer payment.<a href="bspch1fn.html#fn18">[18]</a>
This production payment is available to a biomass electric plant that is in
operation by December 1999 and runs for 10 years.  It is only available for
power plants that rely on dedicated fuel crops.  Biomass electric plants that
use feedstocks like existing forest stands are ineligible. <p>
<p>
	The 1.5 cent per kWh producer payment would bring even wood fired stokers near
the 5.0 cent per kWh level, assuming they used dedicated fuel crops.  It would
bring the cost of WTE technology to as low as 4.0 cents per kWh.<p>
<p>
	Feedstock costs might also be much lower than $1.50-$2.50 per million Btus if
Conservation Reserve Program land were used.   This might not affect
agricultural crops like alfalfa that have existing markets but could affect
fast growing trees.  CRP farmers receive an annual payment plus money to offset
part of their costs of establishing fast growing trees.  About 1.8 million
acres of cropland is in CRP in Minnesota.  <p>
<p>
	Changing federal regulations might affect agricultural crops.  In the
beginning of 1994 the federal government gave kenaf growers the right to
substitute kenaf for program crops without losing federal program payments.
Thus a farmer in Texas could grow kenaf rather than cotton or corn and still
receive his or her program payment for the acreage formerly planted in cotton
or corn.  Kenaf is not a food or feed crop and therefore such an incentive
encourages a new crop that has industrial uses but does not compete with
existing crops.  A federal exemption for agricultural crops like switchgrass
that are grown specifically as an energy crop might be viewed in the same
light.<p>
<p>
	Finally,  eight state regulatory commissions, including Minnesota's have
quantified the environmental costs of power plants.  Minnesota's Public Utility
Commission issued interim rates in January 1994. A formal proceeding is
currently in process to estimate the final rates.  In almost all cases such
rates are used by regulatory commissions or utilities to decide what type of
power plant to build or what kind of electricity to buy.  <p>
<p>

</TABLE>
<p>
	Table B provides the environmental costs of various power plants based on the
Wisconsin Public Service Commission's estimates.<a href="bspch1fn.html#fn20">[20]</a>  The dual values for wood are based on whether wood
is given credit for the carbon dioxide absorbed as it grows.  If, as seems
reasonable, this is done, then biomass electrification in virtually any form
would have almost a 1.5 cent per kWh advantage over coal and almost a penny
advantage over even high efficiency natural gas.  A state or federal carbon tax
or regulations regarding carbon dioxide emissions would increase the
comparative advantage of biomass.  <p>
<p>
	Both the federal tax credit and environmental adders also make wind and other
forms of solar energy more competitive.    As noted at the beginning of this
paper,  although wind may displace some baseload capacity it is primarily an
intermediate power plant.    A biomass power plant may also be an intermediate
or even peaking power plant but it can substitute for base load plants that run
almost all of the times.  Unlike a wind farm that may generate electricity at
full power only 25-30 percent of the year, a biomass fueled power plant can
operate at 75-85 percent capacity factors. <p>
	 <p>
<p>
<b>BIOREFINERIES</b><p>
<p>
	The proposed NSP alfalfa fueled power plant offers the vision of multiple
market crops.  In that case the alfalfa is processed into a high protein feed
with the residue burned or gasified to generate electricity.    In the future
we might see high fiber sugar crops like sweet sorghum also used to make liquid
fuels like ethanol as well as electricity.  Already at least one company is
using an advanced pyrolysis process--similar to the process used to make
charcoal--to make intermediate chemicals like carbon black and phenolic acid
and number six fuel oil.   Another company is seeking financing to convert
cellulosic feedstocks like yard waste or grasses into ethanol.  The byproduct
of that process will be lignin, a potentially very valuable chemical that
currently is burned but may soon become more valuable for industrial uses.<p>
<p>
	The value of plant matter used for generating electricity is very low--$15-30
per ton.  Compare that with the value of plant matter as a food or feed--$75
for corn.  And if the plant matter were used for industrial uses it might have
a still higher value.  <p>
<p>
	The basic point is that even as environmental regulations change and new
biomass electrification technologies are introduced,  we are learning to make
even more valuable end products from plant matter.   Thus it may be that while
we will see some dedicated woody crops used solely for generating electricity,
in many other cases rural communities will be dotted with multiple product
biorefineries, producing not only electricity but liquid fuels and feed and
even chemicals.  <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b><p>
<p>
	Dedicated energy crops as well as agricultural and wood wastes can already
compete with coal in certain cases, specifically, as a low cost way to reduce
pollution by using up to 15 percent biomass mixtures with coal.  Whole tree
energy technology may be competitively priced with wind in Minnesota in 1994.
More exotic technologies like biomass gasification for high efficiency gas
turbines and biomass derived liquid and gaseous fuels used in fuel cells will
have to await the late 1990s before concrete economic information is

The  shift would raise taxes on fuels by approximately $1.5 billion and reduce taxes by an equivalent amount on property and/or payroll taxes.  Based on a preliminary analysis, shifting taxes in this way could reduce pollution and expand employment and economic growth.<P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>ME3 Comments on Minnesota Department of Public Service's 1996 Energy Policy and Conservation Report</H2>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>September 25, 1996</H3>
<HR>

Commissioner Krista Sanda<BR>
Minnesota Department of Public Service<BR>
Suite 200, 121 7th Place East<BR>
St. Paul, Minnesota   55101-2145<P>

Dear Commissioner Sanda:<P>

The following are the comments of the coalition Minnesotans for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ME3) on the energy policy goals and strategies presented in the Department's draft 1996 Energy Policy and Conservation Report.  The ME3 Coalition represents the range of policy views of all the major organizations working in Minnesota to promote sustainable energy and limit the environmental impacts of energy decisions. <p>
We greatly appreciate the availability of this and other forums for commenting on the proposed quadrennial report.   ME3 Coalition members have formulated consensus positions on sustainable energy policies, and submit the following as proposals for consideration in the Department's final report.  We would be pleased to meet with you at any time to discuss and elaborate on our policy positions. <P>

We find that the report as drafted does not address compelling issues, including social costs and climate change.  The conservation and renewable energy goals presented are far too timid and narrow in scope.  The strategies and action steps resemble suggestions for private initiatives, and not  state-level policy statements that can drive the state toward achieving a sustainable energy system.  In order to serve as a blueprint for the state's actions, the report needs to be revised to focus on propelling the energy transition that the state legislature has already set in motion.<P>

<H3>I. State Energy Goals Should Lead the Transition to a Sustainable Electric Generation System</H3>

The goals presented in the draft report will not promote the transition to a sustainable electric generation system that the legislature has initiated.  Indeed, most notable is the amount of space in the draft report devoted to unsustainable energy sources.  There is lengthy discussion of nuclear power issues, nuclear waste storage and disposal, and nuclear plant relicensingÐall issues that demonstrate the need for state policies leading to a transition to sustainable energy technologies.  <P>

The 1994 legislature established the Electric Energy Task Force (EETF) under Minnesota  statute 216C.051.  The task force's instruction was to study future electric energy sources and costs and to make recommendations for legislation for an environmentally and economically sustainable and advantageous electric energy supply.<P>

The statute provided detailed guidelines for preferred electric generation sources as follows:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The highest priority is conservation of energy and management of demand.<P>

	The following energy sources are listed in descending order of preference:<BR>
		-wind and solar;<BR>
		-biomass and low-head or refurbished hydropower; <BR>
		-decomposition gases produced by solid waste management facilities, natural gas-fired  cogeneration, and waste materials or byproducts combined with natural gas;<BR>
		-natural gas, hydropower that is not low-head or refurbished hydropower, and solid waste as a direct fuel or refuse-derived fuel; and<BR>
		-coal and nuclear power.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>

Although this statute is advisory to the work of the Electric Energy Task Force, the legislature has stated its goals: (1) to encourage the transition to a sustainable, environmentally cleaner and safer electric generation system; and (2) to generate jobs and income in the state of Minnesota so that the state becomes a net exporter rather than an importer of electric energy goods and services.<P>

Early in 1996 the EETF engaged a consulting team led by Appel Consultants, Inc. to provide information and analyses to support policy development aimed at improving the electric energy system in Minnesota.  Appel's  June 28, 1996 report to the EETF concludes with a statement that encourages pursuit of the transition while exhorting political leaders to take a strong leadership role:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Minnesota's political leaders have a big job to do in the energy policy arena.  Through strong leadership both within the state and at national and international levels, they can set the stage for Minnesota's fledgling renewables industry to grow and to capture major national and international markets.  In the process, the renewable energy industry and the energy efficiency industry can transform Minnesota's own electric energy system into a sustainable one that can ably support the prosperity and health of many future generations of Minnesotans.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>

In comparing the Appel report with the draft Department report (both reports were  issued in July 1996), ME3 is struck by the disparities in the two documents' visions and conclusions.  We consider several of the Appel findings particularly compelling, and ask the Department to incorporate into its report  goals and action steps that reflect the opportunities that Appel has uncovered.<P>

For example, the EETF consultants note that a transition to sustainable energy sources such as wind and biomass presents an opportunity to move in the direction of energy self-sufficiency.  Minnesota expenses for out-of-state energy will double by 2016 to $1.4 billion in the unsustainable scenario.  In the sustainable, self-sufficient scenario, less than $100 million will still be paid out for energy imports, primarily Canadian hydropower.  The Department should push beyond its goal number 4 Ð Promote a self-supporting, innovative industry emphasizing renewable energy and alternative energy development Ð to an eventual  goal of a sustainable, self-sufficient energy system.  The Appel report enumerated the benefits of a sustainable, self-sufficient scenario to include (1) the elimination of the environmental externalities associated with fossil and nuclear generation, and (2) the creation of new jobs and income in the state (possibly offset by job losses caused by higher energy prices).  Two major environmental externalities that will be eliminated are (1) the emission of carbon dioxide and other pollutants, and (2) the production of additional radioactive spent fuel that needs long-term safeguarding.  It is obvious that proceeding toward a sustainable energy system will reduce or eliminate the social costs of energy decisions that the Department calls attention to in its draft.<P>

The Department forecasts that production of alternative energy in Minnesota will increase by 26% from 1994 to 2020.  The proposed Department goal for renewable and alternative energy is that the State should promote an energy industry that emphasizes renewable and alternative energy development.  Therefore, it is important to consider where a 26% increase in alternative energy production will place us:  In 1994, according to the Department, less than 1% of the fuel sources of electric utilities serving Minnesota were indigenous, clean fuels (wind, low-head hydropower, solar, closed- cycle biomass).   The state's renewables promotion policies should seek to greatly improve the proportion of the generation mix that is renewable.  Over the planning horizon of the report, penetration of renewables to 20-25% of the state's fuel sources is a reasonable possibility.  A renewables portfolio standard (discussed below) is one way to achieve that goal.<P>

What is the prospect for clean energy technologies in Minnesota?  One viewpoint was expressed by the expert consulting team picked by the EETF to advise that body on energy technology for the future.  The Appel team advised that up to 20 percent of Minnesota's energy could be readily derived from wind power Ð without the need for energy storage technologies.<P>

What awaits the states or nations that lead the world in energy technologies that mitigate climate change?  The answer seems to be jobs and wealth. Considering just one such clean technology Ð wind Ð Royal Dutch Shell has estimated a $30 billion dollar annual world market in wind energy in 2030, this in a technology area where Minnesota arguably has a competitive advantage over most US states.  A recent study by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy shows that every dollar invested in clean technologies (e.g. renewables and energy efficiency) creates at least twice as many jobs as a dollar spent on dirty technologies (e.g. coal or oil).<P>

<BR>
<H3>II.  The Draft Advocates Consideration of All Social and Environmental Costs,  Yet Omits Any Discussion of Global Climate Change and Mercury Emissions</H3>

The Department calls for consideration of all social costs, including environmental costs,  in evaluating energy policy options, but fails to detail how this will be accomplished.  Chapter 3 of the report alludes to the notion that polluters should bear the costs of externalities.  Again, this concept is not discussed in depth.  We note that the virtue of  pricing energy at its true social cost was highlighted several times in the 1992  quadrennial report.  Four years later, it is time to offer specific recommendations on how to incorporate social costs in evaluating energy alternatives.  The recent order of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission in the environmental externalities case offers policy direction that should be incorporated in the final Department report.  Specifically, the final report should devote a separate chapter to the explicit social and environmental costs of energy that the state will consider in evaluating future policy options. <P>

Two vital social costs of electric generation Ð global climate change and mercury emissions Ð are mysteriously absent from the draft, yet the Department committed substantial resources to the inclusion of reasonable estimates of the cost of climate change in the recent PUC externality proceedings.  The final report must examine closely how the state can consider these costs in its energy decisions.<P>

<P>

<H4>Global Climate Change</H4><P>

The draft report entirely omits any reference to the problem of global climate change.  By this omission, the report is surely one of very few energy policy reports published this year that omits a discussion of global warming.  As the DPS and the MPCA have forcefully argued in the PUC externality proceedings, the scientific evidence clearly identifies a link between anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and global climate change. The Department is aware that electric utilities produce more than one-third of the CO2 emitted from anthropogenic sources in the United States, and that 80% of those emissions come from coal-fired power plants.  <P>

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports are the most authoritative sources available for information on climate change issues.  The IPCC consists of 2,500 experts from throughout the international scientific community.  The IPCC research and peer review process evaluates all available scientific information on factors affecting climate change.  <P>

Indeed, the IPCC's work has spurred actions by a variety of governments and entities.  Both the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, for example, have adopted CO2 reduction plans.  Many other cities, states, and countries are taking action in response to the global warming problem. Similarly, the Minnesota legislature made a political and policy judgement that we should proceed to place a value on environmental costs to the extent practicable. <P>

An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)  in March of this year concluded that there was sufficient data to support an externality value for carbon dioxide.  In so ruling, the ALJ denied that the uncertainties associated with the general circulation model predictions were sufficient to discredit the IPCC's predictions of global warming.  When it adopted the CO2 value range recommended by the ALJ, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission sent a signal to coal interests that the State of Minnesota is ready to recognize global climate change.<P>

Scientific consensus on the anthropogenic sources of climate change continues to mount. This summer the IPCC released its Second Assessment, which was widely reported as scientists having found the smoking gun in the close correspondence between the climate record and computer simulations.  The IPCC consensus was that the evidence suggested a discernible human influence on global climate change.  NASA's James Hansen was quoted in a January 1996  Newsweek cover story that he believes that humans are now pushing the earth's climate hard enough that climate change will become obvious to the man on the street in the next decade.<P>

The views of many Minnesotans were sought by the researchers from Appel Consulting,  who conversed extensively with people from across the state.  To Appel, it appeared that citizens' interest in sustainable electricity supply derives not just from concern about Minnesota's environment, but also for that of the entire planet Earth.  Thus their report to the legislature discusses climate change, with the conclusions that man-made emissions are at least partly responsible, and that  a growing public consensus is that something should be done about it.  The Appel report clarifies that climate change also points to an increasing frequency of weather anomalies.  Their economic effects may be most immediately apparent to farmers. Also observing global climate change reports are insurance companies, which must cover insured losses.  "(And) these phenomena have not gone unnoticed by the American public.  Since the late 1970s, every poll in which opinions were solicited has shown an increasing fraction of the public is concerned about environmental issues in general and about global climate change in particular. "<P>

In applying the costs of climate change to Minnesota energy policy, the state must arrive at a common sense discount rate by which to calculate the present costs of future climate change.  Huge, long-term, and irreversible damages such as those likely to be incurred by global climate change cannot reasonably be discounted to negligible costs in present value.  Instead, common sense dictates that social decisions use discount rates of from zero to 2 percent. Discount rates any larger have the effect of trivializing enormous damages, marginalizing our grandchildren, and force the policy conclusion that it is not cost-effective to avoid future damages. A low discount rate is consistent with the requirements of the Minnesota Environmental Policy Act. That statute requires all state departments and agencies to recognize that environmental problems can be global and long-term in range, and thus to lend appropriate support to initiatives designed to prevent a decline in the quality of the world environment. <P>

<BR>
<H4>Mercury </H4><P>

There is sufficient evidence that mercury poses a serious threat to wildlife, human health, and the economy of Minnesota.  There is also sufficient evidence to prove that between one-sixth and one-fourth of all anthropogenic emissions of mercury in the state of Minnesota come from coal-fired power plants.<P>

The weight of this evidence is likely to increase with completion of current research efforts targeted at estimating mercury's environmental damages in the US and in Minnesota.  At the federal level, the Clean Air Act requires the EPA to perform several studies dealing with mercury.  One of those studies is a general review of mercury sources, emission rates, control technologies, and health and environmental effects.  The second is a study focusing on toxic emissions from coal-burning power plants.  Both studies are now overdue to Congress.  At the state level, the MPCA has developed a mercury task force. The 1995 legislature authorized Minnesota-specific studies of the mercury problem.  Given the current level of pertinent research, the state should have adequate information to assign a reliable externality value to mercury emissions in the near future.  Thus the Department 's final report should specifically advocate consideration of mercury emissions costs in future energy policy evaluations, as advocated by the Administrative Law Judge.<P>

<P>

<H3>III.  The Need for Strong State Policies to Promote Sustainable Energy and Protect the Environment Under Restructuring</H3><P>

The state must provide both interim support for renewables and long-term policy to guide any market restructuring in such a way that the long-term public benefit of these technologies is recognized and fostered.  Strong incentives for renewables must be enacted as part of any electric industry restructuring plan.<P>

We believe it is imperative for the state to establish policies to protect Minnesota's environment and its emerging renewables industries.  We call departmental attention to the strong warning issued by Appel Consultants--disinterested parties Ð  regarding the impacts of restructuring:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The deregulated, truly competitive market will select generation technologies and fuels <EM>based on lowest cost</EM> , more effectively than the regulated market does now.  <EM>Renewables will not be selected unless strong measures support them.  Emissions will rise as consumer energy efficiency programs are reduced, and in response to greater consumption of low-priced, coal-based electricity.</EM> (emphasis added)<P></BLOCKQUOTE>

Some of the lowest cost electricity producers in Minnesota are old, paid-off coal plants that were grandfathered under the Clean Air Act and do not meet modern emissions standards.  Most of the old coal units have low capacity factors.  Wholesale wheeling could increase the output from these old, dirty plants.  For Minnesota, this is an environmental downside to wholesale wheeling.  The Appel report suggested an obvious remedy: the state should sunset the grandfathered exemption from new source performance standards that some power plants received as part of the Clean Air Act of 1970.<P>

Appel's caveats about restructuring extend beyond concerns for the future of the state's environment and its renewables industries.  Appel, like the Department, is wary of the emergence of market power and warns legislators in the strongest language to<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>(g)uard against establishing a process that allows the existing dominant firms (utilities) to dominate the process of designing the new system.  This would be a case of having the fox design the henhouse; it may look secure, but be riddled with hidden trap doors.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>

The Department's stated goal number two is to promote competition and customer choice.  Indeed, promoting competition is not merely a future strategy proposed by the Department; pervasive throughout the report is the assumption of imminent retail competition, together with the presumption that retail competition will be in the public's best interest.  The final report  should enumerate the precautionary steps the Department will take to ensure that increased competition does not endanger affordable and reliable electric service for all Minnesotans, or derail the state's transition to a sustainable energy system.<P>

The Department states its support for continued conservation and renewables development.  However, a statement of support in principle is no substitute for public policy.  In the absence of concrete, policy initiatives, public goods like renewable energy and energy efficiency will vanish from the energy landscape.  Policy makers in other states are working to craft  policies suited to their states' situations.  For example, California will be using a non-bypassable wires charge to fund DSM, renewables, and other programs including low income services.  New York, Rhode Island, and other New England states likewise intend to use a wires charge as a funding mechanism.  At the federal level, legislation to mandate renewables portfolio standards has been introduced in the House of Representatives (the Schaefer bill).<P>

<H3>IV.  A Renewables Portfolio Standard as the Preferred Policy Incentive for	Phasing in Renewables</H3>

The Department offers two suggestions for promoting renewable energy industries in a scenario of restructuring.  We are confused in that these prospects are not given equal policy weight, and represent contradictory policy views.<P>

<H4>Customer Choice</H4> <P>

In a reversal from its 1992 stance, the 1996 draft report now de-emphasizes mandated penetration rates and numerical goals for renewable energy.  Instead, it advocates an emphasis on direct incentives.  The Department's preferred approach for supporting renewables is its second energy goal: customer choice.  In the case of electricity choice, the Department is perhaps alluding to the idea generally known as green pricing.  Through green pricing programs, customers may choose to pay a premium rate for renewably generated electricity.  <P>

ME3's position is that green pricing cannot replace comprehensive state policy aimed at creating strong renewables markets with multiple competitors.  Important public policy ends like clean air, clean water, and solutions to climate change cannot be left to the goodwill of a few citizens volunteering by their "vote" in a marketplace.  <P>

What is the underlying demand for green power?  The few green pricing programs that are underway now reveal that fewer customers choose to pay the premiums than willingness-to-pay surveys would suggest; they have also resulted in green power generation on the order of kilowatt-hours, not megawatt-hours.  The market could prove too weak to support anything beyond a few boutique-scale projects.  Green pricing would then have the effect of preventing the development and expansion of cost-effective renewable electricity markets.  It is unlikely that the small voluntary market for green power would be large enough to drive down production costs enough to create an orderly infrastructure build-up of renewables. <P>

The concept of green pricing also has a "free rider" problem.  Every ratepayer receives the benefit of a cleaner environment, but only a few actually pay. Since green pricing is merely an option rather than a public interest policy goal, the method does not acknowledge the idea that renewable energy is important to everyone. Although individual consumers are often willing to pay for public goods when every other consumer is required to do so, they are much less willing to pay for public goods when the program is voluntary.   As an example, few citizens would argue that catalytic converters have helped improve air pollution problems.  But consider how few consumers would be willing to pay an additional fee to have a catalytic converter on their new car if those devices were not mandatory.  <P>

Green pricing is best used as a complementary overlay on a robust integrated resource planning process and other forms of utility support for renewable energy.  Green pricing alone is the equivalent of no renewables policy. If the idea is to use green pricing as a supplement to a portfolio policy, we urge the Department to examine mechanisms for strengthening any green pricing proposal.  For example, green pricing plans should include a price cap with the potential for downward movement in the price premium, in order to prevent inflated pricing on renewables.  Moreover, there would need to be a certification process to ensure that customers really get what they pay for--some state or state-sanctioned certification that the "green" power is actually clean power, and that it is actually being dispatched. <P>


<H4>Renewables Portfolio Standard</H4><P>

The Department's second suggestion for promoting renewable energy in a restructured environment is the portfolio approach.  While it is not clear whether the Department intends to pursue both a renewables portfolio standard and voluntary premium rates for renewables, ME3 prefers that state energy policy focus on the policy mechanism of promoting green generation portfolios, rather than on green pricing.  The draft report mentions only that the renewables portfolio standard "should be considered."   In its final report, the Department needs to commit to<P>

(1)  evaluate the impact on the state renewables industries of enactment of a renewables portfolio standard (including annual increases in the requisite renewables percentage);<P>

(2) evaluate the impact of enacting a non-bypassable wires charge, through which all electricity consumers in Minnesota would support renewables and conservation programs, including research and development into emerging technologies like photovoltaics and fuel cells; and <P>

(3) study combinations of these mechanisms as possible policy thrusts for promoting renewables development and research, and efficiency measures.<P>

<BR>
No matter which policy mechanism or combination is selected to promote efficiency and renewables development, state policy makers need to debate several important questions.  In a more market-oriented electricity system, consumers will need access to impartial information regarding their electricity choices.  For example:<P>

Who will provide the basic consumer education in the options that are available for electric services, and the social costs as well as the private costs of different options?<P>

How can the public be better informed of the importance of social costs and environmental externalities of energy and motivated to support positive change in the electric supply system? <P>

<BR>
<H3>V.  ME3 Supports More Aggressive Energy Efficiency Goals, and a Funding 	Mechanism Such as a Non-bypassable Charge</H3>

As with renewable energy development in Minnesota, the Department has clearly expressed its commitment to energy efficiency improvements. However, the Department's third goal, the "aggressive" efficiency target of at least 30% decrease by 2020 is terribly modest (only slightly more than 1 percent per year!), particularly given the forecast of a 56% increase in energy consumption by 2020.  The state needs to set a truly aggressive efficiency goal in order to propel the sustainable energy transition.<P>

We turn once more to the Appel report to the legislature, which addressed current trends toward utility disinvestment in DSM  and proposed a wires charge as a remedy:  <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The trend represented by Minnesota utilities' proposed plans to scale back DSM programs appears to be driven primarily by utilities' desire to minimize rates in anticipation of increased competition. <BR>
The trend toward reduced utility involvement in DSM could be reversed by imposing a non-bypassable charge on the retail sales of electricity, and using the funds for public purpose programs such as conservation, energy efficiency, and renewables.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>

The consultants further warned state policy makers that efficiency investments in other, deregulated markets have suffered as a result of restructuring:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>It is not realistic, based on deregulation experiences in the UK, Norway, Argentina, and New Zealand, to expect energy service companies (ESCOs) to achieve energy savings as great as those achieved by traditional utility DSM in the United States.  ESCOs have limited access to funding relative to funding levels associated with traditional utility DSM.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>

Here again, a wires charge for energy efficiency may be the simplest mechanism for ensuring that sufficient funding is available to achieve an aggressive level of energy savings that is in the best interest of all Minnesota energy consumers.  The Department, in its final report, should identify possible structures for strategic reinvestment of DSM dollars through a system-wide wires charge.<P>


Thank you again for this public comment opportunity.  <P>

On behalf of the Board of Directors of the ME3 Coalition,<P>

</TD></TABLE>
</CENTER>
<P>Let's say you live among the sandstone buttes in Monument Valley, where the sunburned landscape attracts photographers and rattlesnakes. Where the nearest city of any size is 100 miles away. Where the big technology news of late has been the installation of an automatic teller machine 20 miles down the road in Kayenta, Ariz.</P>
<P>Now let's say you're thinking about <a href="./process.htm">getting on the Internet.</a></P>

<P>It all sounds crazily familiar to Roland Dixon, who runs a business that takes tourists through the Four Corners park in open-air four-by-fours.

Dixon is considering signing on with ATIIN Inc. to develop and post a home page on the World Wide Web, the democratic town square of the Internet. ATIIN, an Albuquerque based company, offers a range of services, from <a href="./website.htm">Web sites</A> to <a href="./lanwan.htm">server networks</A>, primarily to Native American tribes and businesses.</P>

<P>Dixon's Navajo Land Tours already has a fax machine and a toll free phone number. 

Dixon is thinking that a Web page might advertise his tour business in a way that brochures or magazine ads can't.

If everything clicks, he will be able to send out color photos of Mitten Butte and the other wonders of Monument Valley, along with tour information, to millions of Internet users worldwide for an initial investment of several hundred dollars and then $50 a month.</P>

<P>ATIIN stands for Advanced Tribal Integrated Information Networks, the mouthful of a name that Evans Craig, Laurence Brown and Robert Mora have chosen for their fledgling company.

But the word has another meaning to the men, all members of the Navajo tribe. In Dine, the native language of the Navajo people, atiin means "road" or "pathway."</P>

<P>Their slogan: <a href="../cybertrade/">"We put natives on the Net."</A></P>

<P>It is a tall order, for the contradictions between reservation life and computer technology are spiritual as well as physical.

What are the prospects of high-tech finding a home on rural reservations where there is only a 50-50 chance a family grill have a telephone, much less a computer? And what is the relevance of machines and information in culture based on living creatures and nature? </P>

<P>Answers to those questions are the forces behind ATIIN. </P>

<P>"What we saw was a huge need for telecommunications technology," says Craig, a graduate of the Anderson schools of Management at the University of New Mexico. 

Rather than being handicapped by being left on the outside of emerging technology, tribes and individual Indian business people can use the technology to control their messages and build on their strengths, says Craig. </P>

<P>"It levels the playing field," says Brown, a former engineer at Sandia National Laboratories. "If you're on the Web, it doesn't matter if you're out there on the reservation. You can look just as professional as everyone else - even if you don't have a computer or don't even have a phone."</P>

<P>Says Craig, "Ninety percent of the people we deal with say, 'I don't know what a Web page is."</P>

<P>Clients so far include the Gathering of Nations Powwow, Santa Fe Indian Market, the <a href="../uniband/">Turtle Mountain Chippewa's</A> technology corporation, Hopi painter Dan Lomahaftewa, the Mescalero Apache and Navajo tribes, a calendar that features Navajo men and women and a <a href="../arrowfax/">directory</A> for tribal governments and businesses in Canada.</P>

<P>The partners are Craig, a 37 year old native of Shiprock with degrees in management information systems and distance education; Brown, a 33 year old from the Navajo community of Carson who has degrees in chemical engineering and material science engineering; and Mora, a 32 year old native of Ganado, Ariz., who is an electrical engineer.</P>

<P>Craig and Brown were working for Sandia and Mora was employed by Digital Equipment Corp. when the three became acquainted through the American Indian Science and Engineering Society, a professional organization for Native Americans who work in the sciences.

They started the company in June with equipment, business space and a $10,000 grant from Technologies Ventures Corp., a nonprofit organization founded by Lockheed Martin Corp., to transfer Sandia technology into the marketplace.</P>

<P>Brown is the company's president and Craig and Mora serve as vice presidents.</P>

<P>The first step for the company is opening up something they call <a href="../cybertrade/">Native CyberTrade</A>, an on-line shopping mall for Indian businesses. Traders don't have to have their own computer or know anything about the technology.</P>

<P>For a few hundred dollars, Craig, Brown and Mora will design a Web page with text and graphics as well as sound or video. ATIIN has the server, the large computer drive that stores and maintains Web sites. And it has the high-speed data phone lines used to connect servers to the Internet.</P>

<P>It also registers the Web sites by key words&#151;say "Monument Valley," "Southwestern tours," "travel" or anything else that would lead interested browsers to Dixon's page. And it keeps track of the number of "hits," or times someone clicks open the page. ATIIN's server is already seeing 80,000 hits a week.</P>

<P>Santa Fe jeweler Kenneth Johnson has found his Web site, on line since early August, to be better than a printed catalog.</P>

<P>"Every time I hand out my business card, it's like I'm handing out a catalog," says Johnson.</P>

<P>Although he has encountered some surprise on the part of customers, Johnson, who studied engineering with Evans in college before turning to silversmithing, thinks high-tech is the way to go.</P>

<P>"I'm getting 'should an Indian be involved in technology?' " says Johnson, who is Muscogee Creek and Seminole. "And these are the same people who want to know whether I take Mastercard and Visa. They want the past and the future, too."</P>

<P>On Johnson's Web site, browsers may click on any number of small silver disks to call up larger-than-life high-resolution images of Johnson's unique silver hair ties. The site includes information on ordering the items as well as information about Johnson and his work.</P>

<P>Johnson, 28, doesn't mass produce his work and isn't banking on a rush of orders from his Web page, but he hopes the technology will show his art worldwide and carry the message that he is a modern person.</P>

<P>"I think it's prestigious to have a Web site on a business card," Johnson says. "It's like, hey, I have a college education. People don't think of us that way."</P>

<P>They call it the World Wide Web for a reason. It is meant, in futuristic, virtual community speak, to bring people together intellectually no matter how far apart they may be physically.</P>

<P>Let's say you live in Perth, Australia, and you like to prowl the Internet in the evenings as you look out on the lights of the city. If you find yourself browsing under the key words "Indian" or "casinos," you might pull up the Isleta Gaming Palace's web page. you may click on a box labeled "specials" and find an up-to-date listing of monthly specials. Then, more curious, you might click on a fuzzy little box in the middle of your screen. In the darkness you will hear a jingle familiar to any New Mexican with a TV: <A HREF="../images/isleta.wav">"More games! More winners! More fun!"</A></P>

<P>Loopy connections like worldwide exposure to the Isleta Gaming song are a bizarre byproduct of the Net. Other connections have more meaning for the Native Americans who are posting through ATIIN and the worldwide community that is getting their message.</P>

<P>The Mescalero Apache tribe is developing a Web page where it can control the information that goes out about the tribe.</P>

<P>Instead of trusting the filter of television, newspapers, books or magazines to tell the story of their history, government or business ventures, the Mescaleros will be able to write their own text, take their own pictures and, if they choose, include their own sounds and video.</P>

<P>"It's all coming from them," says Brown. "They are saying, 'This is us.' "</P>

<P>Other tribes are interested in using the Internet to speak to their own people. Isleta is looking into using the technology to teach its Tiwa language to pueblo members. Elders will be able to archive the language on tape, the sounds can be incorporated into a teaching program and users will eventually be able to click on words and hear the Tiwa translation.</P>

<P>"The technology is now culturally relevant," says Craig. "We see this as going in and showing them the potential, letting them know the power of what they have."</P>

<ADDRESS>Reprinted from: The Albuquerque Tribune - Friday, Oct. 13, 1995 (FRONT PAGE)<BR></ADDRESS>

<H1>Indian trading post sets up on info highway</H1>

<H2>A Sandia Labs Engineer has started a new business that takes American Indian businesses onto the Internet.</H2>

<ADDRESS>By Lawrence Spohn, Tribune Reporter<BR></ADDRESS>

<H3>THE ELECTRONIC MALL</H3>

<P>Companies create "Homepages" - graphic representations of goods and information that can be viewed at home with a computer.  By pointing and clicking with a mouse, users can "move" around the store. For example, a shopper might click on a picture of a <A  href="http://www.atiin.com/kjohnson/johnson2.htm">bracelet</A> to find out its cost and information about the artist.</P>

<P></P>

<P><IMG src="../images/dot_clr.gif" alt="(tab)">Next time you're on the Internet, mosey on down to the electronic trading post and check out the American Indian silver jewelry or drums.</P>

<P><IMG src="../images/dot_clr.gif" alt="(tab)">An Albuquerque company, organized by American Indians out of <A  href="http://www.sandia.gov/">Sandia National Laboratories,</A> is bringing the electronic version of the Western trading post to the Internet.</P>

<P><IMG src="../images/dot_clr.gif" alt="(tab)">It's "Native CyberTrade&#174;," an electronic mall, offers some of the same goods that old-fashioned reservation trading posts sold.</P>

<P><IMG src="../images/dot_clr.gif" alt="(tab)">It also is providing national and international exposure to American Indian businesses and interests, including reservation gambling.</P>

<P><IMG src="../images/dot_clr.gif" alt="(tab)">"It's all the way from blankets to drums," said Laurence Brown, president of <A  href="http://www.atiin.com/">Advanced Tribal Integrated Information Networks</A> .</P>

<P><IMG src="../images/dot_clr.gif" alt="(tab)">Brown, a Navajo who has two Navajo partners, said that in Navajo, ATIIN means "roadway" or "pathway."  The name is symbolic of the company's effort to provide American Indians with access to the "information superhighway," he said.  The superhighway is the computer equivalent of the interstate highway system, linking millions of users around the world.</P>

<P><IMG src="../images/dot_clr.gif" alt="(tab)">The tribal network has already created several Internet "home pages" - computer screen storefronts that introduce electronic browsers to catalogs of goods, services or information.</P>

<P><IMG src="../images/dot_clr.gif" alt="(tab)">Among the company' clients: <A  href="http://www.atiin.com/kjohnson/">Kenneth Johnson</A> , a Santa Fe Indian artist who specializes in silver-coin hair ties; the Santa Fe Indian Market; and the Southwest Association for Indian Artists . And a deal is in the works with a Taos artist who makes drums.</P>

<P><IMG src="../images/dot_clr.gif" alt="(tab)">Generally, each client has a separate Homepage on the tribal network's computer server, which is connected to the Internet and potentially accessible to millions of home and business computers.  The pages list addresses and phone numbers customers can use to make a purchase or get information.</P>

<P><IMG src="../images/dot_clr.gif" alt="(tab)">When commercial transactions become more secure over the Internet through coding, Brown expects, many transactions will be made electronically.</P>

<P><IMG src="../images/dot_clr.gif" alt="(tab)">He says he will be translating the home pages into German and Japanese, (currently <A  href="http://www.atiin.com/atiin/about_spanish.html">spanish</A> ) because of the strong interest in those countries in American Indian <A  href="http://www.atiin.com/cybertrade/Arts_and_Crafts.html">arts and crafts</A> . </P>

<P><IMG src="../images/dot_clr.gif" alt="(tab)">"But we're also helping Indian companies to reach a wider market for their businesses," Brown said.</P>

<P><IMG src="../images/dot_clr.gif" alt="(tab)">Among the tribal network's corporate clients are the <A  href="http://www.atiin.com/isleta_gaming/">Isleta Gaming Palace</A> , the Mescalero Apache Tribe and the Gathering of Nations Pow-wow.</P>

<P><IMG src="../images/dot_clr.gif" alt="(tab)">The Navajo Nation is working with the network to develop a Homepage for it's growing array of business interests, and Brown says the company just got a contract with Navajo Community College.</P>

<P><IMG src="../images/dot_clr.gif" alt="(tab)">"It feels good." he said of the company's rapid success. "Some of the tribal enterprises are a long way from high-tech, but they still need to link into the Internet to boost their sales.</P>

<P><IMG src="../images/dot_clr.gif" alt="(tab)">"We handle the high-tech, from beginning to end," he said.  "They don't have to do much more than tell us what they want."</P>

<P><IMG src="../images/dot_clr.gif" alt="(tab)">Brown says the company is benefiting from his experience as a project manager at Sandia and his exposure to the broad scope of computer technology.</P>

<P><IMG src="../images/dot_clr.gif" alt="(tab)">He expects shortly to offer clients virtual-reality environments - a Sandia strength in which a computer simulates a real place. Brown says they will enrich Internet computer pages and enhance the marketing of goods and services.</P>

<P><IMG src="../images/dot_clr.gif" alt="(tab)">One good approach might be to present goods within a trading-post atmosphere, he said.  Another might be to feature them in an electronic rendition of the artisan's studio or workshop.</P>

<P><IMG src="../images/dot_clr.gif" alt="(tab)">A vital step for the tribal network was getting Technology Ventures Corp.'s help in securing a $25,000 lease agreement for a Silicon Graphics computer server.  It can create high-resolution graphics at very high speeds.</P>

<P><IMG src="../images/dot_clr.gif" alt="(tab)">The service has attracted American Indian business "from <A  href="http://www.atiin.com/mccracken/">Florida</A> and San Diego to <A  href="http://www.atiin.com/uniband/">North Dakota</A> and Canada," he said.</P>

<P><IMG src="../images/dot_clr.gif" alt="(tab)">Brown says he is also "branching out" in his own marketing effort to attract Spanish-speaking artist and businesses in New Mexico and "really any client interested in getting on the Internet."</P>

<P><IMG src="../images/dot_clr.gif" alt="(tab)">The grant from TVC was vital, as was TVC's help in giving the company legitimacy in the business world, Brown said.  The tribal network is in <A  href="../images/1tech.gif">TVC's new building</A> on University Boulevard Southeast in the University of New Mexico's research Park.</P>

<P><IMG src="../images/dot_clr.gif" alt="(tab)">The TVC grant was the fifth it has made in two years. It also has been instrumental in landing $10 Million in private funding for local technology-commercialization ventures.</P>

<address>Reprinted from: The Albuquerque Business Times - October30 - November 13, 1995 (page 3)</address>

<P>ALBUQUERQUE &#151; Native American businesses and tribes throughout the United States soon may be opening stores in a new cybermall on the Internet created by a local company.</P>

<P>Known as the Advanced Tribal Integrated Information Networks, (ATIIN), it is a New Mexico company built with the assistance of Technology Ventures Corporation (TVC) on technology developed at Sandia National Laboratories.</P>

<P>The first enterprise of its kind, ATIIN's main activity for now is creating Native CyberTrade&#151; an Internet "mall" in which the company creates and maintains Internet home pages and the server to put them on&#151; for Native American tribes and enterprises.</P>

<P>The company's acronym, "atiin", means roadway or pathway in Navajo, said a company official.</P>

<P>Isleta Gaming Palace, the Mescalero Apache tribe and the Gathering of Nations Powwow are among the company's growing client list. </P>

<P>"We're branching out now," said Laurence Brown, ATIIN president and former Sandia Labs scientist. "We are broadening our base to include service for the Spanish-speaking community and larger business community."</P>

<P>ATIIN started up "on a shoestring" in June. TVC provided incubation office space and other services, including planning. But the future really depended on "us being able to lease a $25,000 piece of equipment," Brown said. "We needed the lease because we couldn't afford to buy".</P>

<P>At one point, the equipment maker, a leader in Internet technology, wouldn't grant the lease because ATIIN was a startup with no history. </P>

<P>That's when TVC stepped in.</P>

<P>"We introduced them to people they needed to know to come up with the $25,000 for the equipment purchase, " said Bob Gibson, TVC's director of investor and venture funding recruitment.</P>

<P>TVC also awarded the company a $10,000 grant, the sixth such grant TVC has awarded in the past two years. </P>

<P>"TVC has given us legitimacy," Brown says. "People looked at what we were doing, and saw that TVC thought it was a good idea, and they saw that Sandia thought it was a good idea, too."</P>

<P>As a result, ATIIN was able to open its doors for business in June.</P>

<P>"Not only is it based on lab generated technology, which adds to the value of the laboratories' role as a research leader, it also holds great potential for aiding economic development at both regional and national levels for the Native American community," TVC President Sherman McCorkle said.</P>

<P>Albuquerque-based TVC is a non-profit organization dedicated to the successful commercialization of technology from Sandia National Laboratories and other public research facilities.</P>

<P>Brown, a Navajo from Bloomfield NM, had gained a reputation at Sandia as a successful project manager with deep roots and contacts in the Native American community. When he suggested that he could use technology to bring the benefits of the Internet to Indian businesses and communities across the country, "they gave me the green light to go ahead and do it," Brown said.</P>

<P>Brown took with him Evans Craig, a consultant working at the labs who specializes in educational technologies for Indian education, and also recruited Robert Mora, a former Digital Equipment Corp. engineer. Evans is vice president of research and development and Mora is vice president of engineering.</P>

<P>"Some of the tribal enterprises are a long way from high tech, but they still need to link into the Internet to boost their sales," Brown said.</P>

<P>Another major ATIIN project, which is waiting to be funded, is developing a multimillion dollar database that will put high resolution graphics for the Southwest American for Indian Arts on the Internet.</P>

<P>In addition, the company is providing computer consulting services. After developing a local-area network at the Isleta Gaming Palace, ATIIN is working on a six-month project to get the Palace integrated into a wide-area network.</P>

<P>"The important thing for the Native American community&#151; and our other customers&#151; to know is that they don't have to be high-tech themselves to work with us. We handle the high-tech from beginning to end. They don't have to do much more than tell us what they want," Mora said.</P>

<P>"In Navajo, 'atiin' means 'roadway' or 'pathway'," Mora said. "That's what we want to be... in the process of getting the Native Community onto the information highway.</P>

<P>"And that's what Technology Ventures has been to us - the path to a successful startup."</P>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><IMG SRC="./corporat.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></CENTER><P>ARROWFAX is a Native American company, founded in the fall of 1988 in order to enlarge and promote communication among Native Americans. ARROWFAX has already played its role in renewing ancestral trading links - it is networking at its best.</P><P>ARROWFAX published it's first Native American directory (address, phone, and fax number) in the spring of 1989. The 90's were launched with the publication of the ARROWFAX NATIONAL DIRECTORY, country wide in Canada. To date, twelve ARROWFAX directories have been produced, making even the most remote communities part of the network - our goal is to make Native America into one big neighborhood.</P><P>Three years ago, ARROWFAX entered the U.S. market with the first edition of the North American Tribal Gaming Directory. After two such publications, ARROWFAX decided to incorporate the gaming Directory into the latest and most comprehensive First Nations Tribal Directory.</P><P>ARROWFAX now looks forward to expanding to include Mexico and in the near future, Central and South America.</P><P>Currently, however, ARROWFAX is moving from the printed word to electronic media with the production of an ARROWFAX CD-ROM - and now, &quot;welcome to the Internet!&quot;</P><P>ARROWFAX has been financed entirely through the sale of directories, sale of advertising, and database sales. It operates a continent-wide network and database - the most comprehensive and up-to-date Native American database, enabling immediate access by name, address, phone/fax and E-mail to Tribes, First Nations/Indian, Inuit, and Metis - Native American governments, organizations, associations, institutions, and businesses.</P><P>Our database is constantly updated - do not hesitate to contact us with additions or corrections.

<P>Today, there are 2 million Indians - affiliated with 557 tribes -
living on 311 reservations. In addition, each tribe is considered a sovereign
nation, each with its own agenda. The logistics are mind-boggling! </P> 
<P>Before we can address Indian issues or develop any meaningful political strategy, 
we must know the answers to some very basic questions: &quot;What is the size and location of today's
Indian population and reservation land base?&quot; Russell Publications is a resource for this 
information.</P>

<P><BR>Angela DeMontigny<BR>Designer/President <BR>of SPIRIT WARE <BR><BR><BR><B>THE
SPIRIT WARE COLLECTION<BR><BR><STRONG>F</STRONG></B>or thousands of years
Native Americans have been creating beautiful artwork, <BR>inspired from a
spiritual love and reverence for nature. I have tried to capture the <BR>essence
of my own Native heritage by providing the link between the historical
historical past  <BR>and the present through the design of the clothing and
accessories presented presented in our <BR>1996 Collection.<BR><BR>Traditional
techniques such as beadwork and embroidery have been used to<BR>decorate <B><I>thoroughly
modern garments</I></B><I> </I>which are as practical as they are <BR>beautiful.
In keeping with our deep respect for Mother Earth, all of the fabrics we have<BR>chosen
are 100% natural - we have even used a new, recycled cotton fabric called <BR><B>&quot;Ecofibre&quot;</B>.
Attention to details such as using natural wood buttons (leftovers from <BR>logged
areas in British Columbia) and screen printing with environmentally safe, <BR>water-based
inks are all part of this inherent philosophy.<BR><BR>It is also important to
emphasize that <B>Spirit Ware</B> is a fully Native-owned company, <BR>based
on the Six Nations Reserve of the Grand River Territory in Ontario, Canada and
<BR>that all of the designs and symbols used in this collection are <B>&quot;authentic&quot;</B>.Every
time <BR>a <B>Spirit Ware</B> item is purchased, the proceeds go back to
Native peoples and local <BR>communities. It is only through entrepreneurial
projects such as this that self sufficiency <BR>and the protection of spiritual
and environmental integrity within Native communities will <BR>be achieved.
<B>Spirit Ware </B>is committed to this cause, especially the continued growth
of <BR>an established First Nations textile and clothing industry.<BR><BR>Much
thought and care has gone into the creation of this collection. Be inspired by
its Spirit.<BR>Nya:weh (Thank you) <BR><IMG

<H4><I>Powerful, mystical symbols are silk screened and handpainted onto
DeMontigny's home-related items, as well as her personal accessories: jewelry
rolls, makeup brush holders, and compact or overnight-sized cosmetic bags.<BR>Buckskin
belt bags and eyeglass cases also carry the Spirit Ware deer logo, indicating
the designer's respect for the animal that has assisted in the survival of North
America's First Peoples.<BR>One of the line's unique items, a small drawstring
sac called a spirit pouch, also has a spot in Native heritage. Traditionally,
these pouches carried medicines, herbs and prized objects, and were worn around
the neck to protect individuals from negative forces. Today, they may simply
provide safe keeping for small personal belongings.</I></H4>

<H1>Indian Gaming...Its Working for New Mexico</H1>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</H3>

<TD>

<P>Indian gaming is working for New Mexico. We are happy to say that Indian gaming is directly providing over 2,650 jobs to tribal and non-tribal individuals. These employees are paid $46.6 million annually, almost all of which will be spent in New Mexico. These employees will provide food, clothing, and housing for their families and will have the self-respect employment brings. Our wage and salary payments, along with our purchase of supplies, goods, services and the tourist dollars we draw into the state with our gaming operations generate, in total, 13,300 jobs and $215.5 million in employment income statewide. These figures do not include the tribal government spending for economic diversification, community projects and tribal government services. Through Indian gaming, our people are just beginning to address many infrastructure problems created by years of neglect. For the first time, our people are enjoying services that we have been economically unable to provide. Indian gaming is working for New 
Mexico, it is working for our people and for the people of the state.

<P>There is clearly a need for economic development among New Mexico's Indian pueblos and tribes. Indian gaming has proven to be a bright spot in an otherwise bleak picture. All of the tribal gaming operations are 100% tribal owned and operated. Many of the tribes have borrowed heavily, based on the existence of the compacts, to start
their own operations, and have pumped several million dollars into the New Mexico economy on construction and start-up costs. For many tribes, Indian gaming is the
first successful Tribal enterprise that provides confidence and capital to venture into other businesses. Tribal members employed by the gaming operations are gaining
experience at every level of the operations. For many tribal members, this is their first job, and the experience they gain at gaming operations prepares them to compete in
the larger job market.

<P>Our gaming operations are providing more than just jobs, though. They are providing confidence and renewed pride in our people. Our gaming operations are providing the resources to fund programs for our elders, and programs for our children. Our gaming operations are providing the capital for economic diversification projects on our land. Our gaming operations are providing the funds to fix the problems we have never been able to deal with financially. Our gaming operations are providing the resources for a renewed respect for our culture and our people.</P>
<P><B>This is a sampling of the many programs and projects undertaken by the tribal governments.</b> We hope these photographs will clarify the picture of Indian gaming in New Mexico. There is a great deal at stake here, including the lives of many people,
both tribal members and non-tribal members. This is about much more than politics. This is about people.</P>

<H2>FROM THE PRESIDENT</H2>

<P>Our first two years have been a heady mix of challenge and success, of living up to our mission and at times, exceeding it.</P>

<P>Technology Ventures has succeeded in creating a viable channel for the commercialization of government-generated technologies. In so doing, we are increasing the value of those technologies. They are making a dual contribution. In government, they support our nations defense. In the private sector, they are creating jobs and enhancing the nation's industrial competitiveness.</P>

<IMG align="left" src="./sherman.jpg"><menu><P>Although Technology Ventures has accomplished much, we recognize that the future holds fresh challenges. As government-sponsored research facilities continue to pursue a Congressional mandate to move technology to the private sector, the need for our services will grow. And, as industry demands more and better technology, the importance of technology commercialization will grow even more, as will the need for the services we provide.</P>

<P>Therefore, we will maintain and continue to expand our risk-capital resources. We will continue to nurture the best technologies, and we will continue to work for economic development. We believe that we can expand our regional success into a national model for effective and efficient technology commercialization.</P>

ALIGN="LEFT">Preservation, identity, and conversions are the key words necessary for
understanding the  article &quot;Passing the Torch&quot;. This article documents
Robert Bushyhead's attempt to save the Kituhwa dialect of the Cherokee language.
Bushyhead has incorporated the help of his daughter, linguists, and tribal
elders in his endeavor to systemize the language into various types of lessons
which are taught in classes from the elementary to the college level.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Many believe that the identity of a culture is inherent in the language. So
when a language becomes extinct, so does the identity of the people. This
identity includes the world view of a people. Bushyhead finds evidence of the
Cherokee world view in the syntax of the language.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Kituhwa dialect os one of four dialects of the Cherokee People. One of these
four dialects has already become extinct as a result of assimilation. First came
the mass forced migration of thousands of Cherokee people to Oklahoma in 1838.
Later, school officials began punishing children who spoke any language other
than English. Today, only the ;elders. like Bushyhead, are able to fluently
speak their native tongue.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Since the language is already written down, the push is to teach the young
children the spoken language. It is important to use the language in
conversation in order to understand all the nuances communicated in this
inflectional language. Video cameras record traditional practices such as
cooking, craft making, and story telling in English as well as the Kituhwa
dialect. Computers systematize the language with a dictionary and grammar text.</P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The eighty one year old Bushyhead passes the torch of language and culture
on to his daughter as well as the youth of the Cherokee Nation.</P></TD><TD

<center><H1>Technology Ventures Corporation</H1>

<H2>Creating Opportunity for Technologists and Investors</H2>
<img src="../images/barpurpl.gif"></center>
<I><P><b>Technology Ventures is an important contributor in the formation of new businesses built on leading-edge technologies developed at Department of Energy laboratories, and in the expansion of existing businesses. It also assists in obtaining funding offers for many of its client companies. Among Technology Ventures clients:</b></P></I>

<H3>Quantum Manufacturing, Inc.</H3>

<IMG align="right" src="./qmi.gif"><P>QMI recently received a commitment of $4.2 million in funding from private investors. The company's technology uses a rapid-fire, high-power pulsed ion beam to harden the surfaces of metals, ceramics, plastics and other materials. It enhances corrosion resistance and increases the lifetime of surfaces in hostile environments. This core technology has uses in the tool-and-die industry, aircraft manufacturing, automobile engines and medical implants and tools, to name a few.</P>

<H3>Boissiere Engineering &amp; Applied Robotics, Inc.</H3>

<P>BEAR's technology focuses on telerobotic excavation systems for waste water remediation applications. The technology was developed at Sandia National Laboratories' Intelligent Systems and Robotics Center and incorporates real-time graphic displays, graphic operator interfaces, computer control of on-board systems, model-based motion planning and sensor-controlled dynamic path controls.</P>

<P></P>

<IMG align="left" src="./atiin.gif"><H3>ATIIN, Inc.</H3>

<P>Native American owned, ATIIN provides Internet and World Wide Web technologies and services to the Native American community nationwide as well as to the general business community. The company also provides educational technologies and LAN/WAN development. A focal point of the company's program is Native CyberTrade, an Internet pathway for Native American related products and services. ATIIN founders developed their technologies while scientists at Sandia National Laboratories.</P>

<H3>JEC Technologies, Inc.</H3>

<P>The company has created a family of software products for the Internet. Developed by Sandia National Laboratories scientists, the main purpose of the software is to help Internet users navigate the net as they search for information. Formed in 1995, JEC estimates the market for its software could grow as high as 400 million users by the year 2000.</P>

<P></P>

<H3>Micro-Optical Devices, Inc.</H3>

<P>MOD, Inc. has received seed equity investment from private investors to develop, manufacture and market vertical cavity, surface emitting lasers. Vertical cavity lasers are compound semiconductor lasers with applications in data communications, printing, scanning, sensing and other markets. Their commercial promise has been developed through research efforts at Sandia National Laboratories and the University of New Mexico's Center for High Technology Materials.</P>

<P></P>

<H3>MuSE Technologies, Inc.</H3>

<P>Hailed as a major advance in virtual reality, MuSE's technology has attracted substantial funding from private investors. Put simply, MuSE technology provides a way to adapt the computer to the human &#151;not the other way around as current programs and systems do. MuSE is a means of traveling through any space and providing sensory tools to interact with that space&#151;very much as a human simultaneously absorbs and acts on different types of information while driving a car. With MuSE, a surgeon, for example, can "step inside" the human body, moving about for a complete view. MuSE was developed at the Department of Energy's Sandia National Laboratories .</P>

<P></P>

<IMG align="right" src="./smdi.gif"><H3>Silicon MicroDevices, Inc.</H3>

<P>SMDI recently entered a joint venture agreement with a major US manufacturer to develop and bring to market a micro-mechanical drug delivery technology. The technology developed at Sandia National Laboratories, is a micro-mechanical drug delivery system that administers a broad range of medications directly into the bloodstream by overcoming the present harrier to nearly all such drug delivery, the human skin. This product is radically different from existing transdermal drug patches currently on the market or under development, which use only chemical or electrical methods to deliver only a small number of unique drugs through the outer layers of the skin.</P>

<P>Acoma Pueblo sits on a high bluff outside Grants, New Mexico. The 
Sky City is one of the oldest continuously inhabited villages in the 
United States. Acoma is justifiably famous for its artists and pottery 
(an Acoma pot was recently given to Sadaam Hussein by New Mexico 
Congressman Bill Richardson), but pottery and tourism is not enough 
to keep the nearly 3,000 tribal members of Acoma economically viable.

</TD>

<TD WIDTH=275>

<P>The job market in nearby Grants or Gallup is not overwhelmingly 
strong, and many residents have to make the nearly one hour commute 
into Albuquerque every day to keep a good job. The Acoma Sky City 
casino is creating good jobs for members and non-members alike in the 
Grants area. The Sky City casino employs 108 people and allows tribal 
members to take a job with good pay and good benefits close to home.
This is keeping young tribal members at home instead of leaving the 
Pueblo for employment out of the area.

<H1>Acoma Pueblo - raising the standards of living</H1>

<TABLE WIDTH=600>
<TR>
<TD WIDTH=300>

<P>Acoma is using its gaming revenues to fund programs for the elderly 
and youth programs, but Acoma is also spending a great deal of its 
gaming revenues on upkeep of its outdated and extremely ineffective 
water system. The unique geography of Acoma Pueblo teamed with the 
scarcity of water in the region have caused a great deal of problems 
with the tribe's water system. The wells that pump the water are 
located some 15 miles from Acomita village and Sky City. The water is 
transported those 15 miles by an antiquated pipeline that breaks down 
so often that members never know whether they will get water or
not when they go to the faucet.

</TD>

<TD WIDTH=300>

<P>The old pipes have become inundated with iron oxide, so the water 
sometimes is murky and rusty when it is working. The tribe is 
constantly trying to fix the problem, but the system is so flawed, 
there is no way to fix it little by little. With expected cutbacks 
in the federal budget, Acoma is convinced that the only way to secure 
capital to replace their water system is through constant appeal for 
some federal funding, plus the enhancement of its gaming Operation.

<H2>FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES:</H2>

<P></P>

<H3><U>Indian Tribal Government Sovereignty</U></H3>

<P></P>

<CENTER><H4>ORIGINS</H4></CENTER>

<P></P>

<P>	At its most basic, the term sovereignty refers to the right or power to govern. At the time of European entry to America, the tribes were sovereign by nature and necessity; they conducted their own affairs and depended upon no outside source of power to legitimize their acts of government.</P>

<P></P>

<CENTER><H4>CONTEMPORARY TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY</H4></CENTER>

<P></P>

<P>	The United States Congress and the Supreme Court of the United States have upheld the principal attributes of tribal sovereignty generally as follows: (1) Indian tribes possess inherent governmental power over all internal affairs; (2) the states are precluded from interfering with the tribes in their self-government; and (3) Congress has plenary power to limit tribal sovereignty. The New Mexico Constitution expressly disclaims state jurisdiction over Indian lands.</P>

<CENTER><H4>INHERENT RIGHT TO REGULATE</H4></CENTER>

<P></P>

<P>	Based on tribal inherent right to self-government and to create laws and be governed by them, Indian tribes enacted laws to regulate gaming within their territorial jurisdictions or reservations. Several New Mexico tribes had enacted gaming laws early in the 1980's to regulate high stakes bingo operations on Indian lands.</P>

<P></P>

<P>	Indian Gaming occurs on Indian land, not State land. The right of an Indian tribal government to conduct gaming under its own regulatory framework and free from state interference is a right affirmed in 1987 by the United States Supreme Court in the case of California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, 480 U.S. 202, 209-10 (1987).</P>

<P></P>

<CENTER><H4>TRIBAL AND FEDERAL REGULATION</H4></CENTER>

<P></P>

<P>	The United States Congress, in 1988, enacted the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C. 2701 et. seq. (IGRA). Tribal government is the primary regulator of Indian gaming. The IGRA created a second (federal) and the New Mexico compacts create the third (state) layer of government regulation.</P>

<P></P>

<P>	The IGRA categorizes gaming into three classes for regulatory purposes. Class I gaming includes social games for prizes of minimal value and traditional forms of gaming. Class I gaming is within the exclusive jurisdiction of tribal government.</P>

<P></P>

<P>	Class II gaming is defined as bingo-type games and certain card games. Class II gaming regulatory authority is under the jurisdiction of tribal government and the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC). The NIGC was created by Congress under the IGRA.</P>

<P></P>

<CENTER><H4> TRIBAL AND STATE REGULATION</H4></CENTER>

<P></P>

<P>	Class III gaming is all other forms of gaming not considered Class I or Class II. The IGRA provides that tribal/state compacts will determine the regulatory scheme of Class III gaming. Senate Report No. 100-446, which accompanied the IGRA, noted: "A compact may allocate most or all of the jurisdictional responsibility to the tribe to the State or to any variation in between. The committee does not intend that the compacts be used as a subterfuge for imposing State jurisdiction on tribal lands."</P>

<P></P>

<H3><U>Tribal, IGRA, and NIGC Regulatory Requirements</U></H3>

<P></P>

<P></P>

<CENTER><H4>IGRA AND NIGC REQUIREMENTS</H4></CENTER>

<P></P>

<P>	Prior to the passage of IGRA in 1988, tribal governments enacted gaming laws in accordance with their particular tribal government requirements. With the advent of the IGRA, national standards are applied to the regulation of Indian gaming. The following apply primarily to Class II gaming; however, they have also been incorporated into Class III tribal/state gaming compacts along with a host of other regulatory provisions:</P>

<P></P>

<UL>
<LI><P>A tribal government must adopt a gaming ordinance and the ordinance must be approved by the NIGC.</P>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><P>A tribal gaming operation must be audited annually by an independent auditor and the results of this audit must be submitted to the NIGC for its review.</P>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><P>All gaming related contracts for purchases of supplies, services, or concessions of   more than $25,000 in any year must be audited by an independent auditor.</P>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><P>A tribe must issue licenses to key employees and primary management officials. Further, a tribe may not issue a license to any person who poses a threat to the public interest or to the effective regulation of gaming.</P>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><P>Prior to issuing a license, a tribe must perform an extensive background check on each principal (major stockholder, directors, etc.) of a management contractor. The tribe's background check must include an investigation into the applicant's criminal history (through the FBI), as well as an investigation into the applicant's previous business relationships (both gaming and non-gaming). </P>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><P>A tribe must submit a detailed report to the NIGC for each background check it performs on an applicant. This report must describe the steps taken in conducting the background check, and the basis for the tribe's conclusions.</P>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><P>In cases where a tribe enters into a management contract with a non-tribal entity, the contract must be approved by the NIGC. The regulations promulgated by the NIGC impose numerous requirements on management contracts including, among other things, the maintenance of adequate accounting an internal controls as well as the preparation of verified monthly financial statements that comport with generally accepted accounting principles.</P>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><P>Although IGRA authorizes tribes to make per capita distributions of gaming earnings to tribal members, tribes may not do so without the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.</P>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><P>The regulations of the National Indian Gaming Commission implementing the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act are published in 25 CFR Chapter III.</P>
</UL>

<CENTER><H4>TRIBAL REGULATORY BODIES</H4></CENTER>

<P>Tribal governments have established regulatory commissions, gaming boards, compliance officers or monitors to ensure compliance with all applicable gaming laws, regulations, and policies.</P>

<P></P>

<CENTER><H4>TRIBAL REGULATORY TOOLS</H4></CENTER>

<P></P>

<P>	Tribal regulatory bodies use many tools that go beyond the standards required under New Mexico law including:</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>Background checks and licensing</P>
<P></P>
<LI><P>Internal accounting controls</P>
<P></P>
<LI><P>Internal cash accounting controls</P>
<P></P>
<LI><P>Internal audits</P>
<P></P>
<LI><P>Security systems</P>
<P></P>
<LI><P>Surveillance systems</P>
<P></P>
<LI><P>Operations manuals</P>
<P></P>
<LI><P>Dispute resolution procedures (gaming public)</P>
</UL>


<P></P>

<P></P>

<H3>Law Enforcement</H3>

<P></P>

<P></P>

<P>	Tribal government law enforcement departments are fully operational law enforcement agencies and exercise general law enforcement jurisdiction over gaming operations. Many tribes have cross commissioned officers with the local non-Indian governments, and many tribal officers are commissioned peace officers by the New Mexico State Police. Tribal law enforcement agencies work with local, state, and federal agencies to prevent criminal activity and enforce laws against offenders.</P>

<P></P>

<P>
</P>

<H3>Why Indian Gaming?</H3>

<P></P>

<CENTER><H4>A LEGACY OF POVERTY</H4></CENTER>

<P></P>

<P>For centuries, negative impacts have been endured by the tribes:</P>

<P></P>

<UL>
<LI><P>		Destruction of traditional economies</P>
<P></P>
<LI><P>		Population decimation</P>
<P></P>
<LI><P>		Loss of land and other natural resources</P>
<P></P>
<LI><P>		State regulatory barriers to economic development</P>
<P></P>
<LI><P>		State taxation of tribal natural resources</P>
<P></P>
<LI><P>		Denial of access to state services</P>
<P></P>
<LI><P>		Degradation of the environment</P>
<P></P>
<LI><P>		Indian culture commercialized to benefit state tourism</P>

</UL>

<P></P>

<P>	The legacy of these historical facts is poverty. According to the 1990 census, 46% of all New Mexico Indians are living in poverty; nearly half of these are poor children. Only 585 of adult Indians are high school graduates; only 6% are college graduates. Nearly a quarter of all Indian homes lack complete plumbing facilities.</P>

<P></P>

<CENTER><H4>USE OF GAMING REVENUES</H4></CENTER>

<P></P>

<P>	Under the IGRA, 25 USC 2710.Sec. 11(b)(2)(B), net revenues from tribal gaming may only be used for:</P>

<P></P>

<P>	(i)	Tribal government operations or programs:</P>

<P></P>

<P>	(ii)	The general welfare of the Indian tribe and its members;</P>

<P></P>

<P>	(iii)	Tribal economic development;</P>

<P></P>

<P>	(iv)	Donations to charitable organizations; or</P>

<P></P>

<P>	(v)	Operations of local government agencies.</P>

<P></P>

<P>	The New Mexico Gaming tribes are spending gaming revenues on the following types of projects:</P>

<P></P>

<UL>
<LI><P>		Senior Citizen centers</P>
<LI><P>		Day Care Centers</P>
<LI><P>		Fire Stations</P>
<LI><P>		Health Facilities</P>
<LI><P>		Environmental Clean-up and Protection</P>
<LI><P>		Scholarships</P>
<LI><P>		Elementary School Improvements</P>
<LI><P>		Educational Programs</P>
<LI><P>		Infrastructure Development and Maintenance</P>
<LI><P>		Law Enforcement</P>
<LI><P>		Cultural Preservation</P>
<LI><P>		Government Operations</P>
</UL>


<P></P>

<H3>Economic Impact ( As of June 1995)</H3>

<P></P>

<P>	Indian Gaming has positive economic and social impacts on the state. It creates jobs and jobs produce tax revenues. Indian Gaming has contributed the following to the state's economy:</P>

<P></P>

<UL>
<LI><P>		$4.6 Million State Tax Revenue</P>
<P></P>
<LI><P>		$35.7 Million Additional Tourism Spending</P>
<P></P>
<LI><P>		13,334 Total Jobs Created by Indian Gaming</P>
<P></P>
<LI><P>		$62 Million in Goods and Services Purchased </P>
<P></P>
<LI><P>		$46 Million in Wages and Salaries</P>
<P></P>
<LI><P>		2,650 Direct Gaming Jobs</P>
</UL>


<P></P>

<P>	The above figures do not include tribal government spending on projects and programs nor the impact of deposits and investments in financial institutions which are loaned out for economic and other purposes.</P>

<H2>Santa Ana Pueblo - renovation and expansion</H2>

<TABLE WIDTH=600>
<TR>
<TD ROWSPAN=3 WIDTH=225>

<P> Santa Ana has recently renovated an abandoned BIA school on its 
property and transformed it into additional office space for tribal 
business management and has office space available for small 
businesses willing to locate on tribal land.</P>

<P>Gaming revenue has also helped the tribe to maintain a championship 
golf course and the Prairie Star restaurant, one of New Mexico's best 
fine dining establishments. In the golf course complex there is also a 
pro shop, a grill for the golfers and a driving range.</P>

<P>Gaming revenues also have provided the money for an expansion and 
renovation of the tribal government offices, and the funding of 
programs for the youth of the tribe and services for the elderly. 
The tribe has recently purchased three new vans to transport the 
elderly to their elderly center and to assist them in shopping and 
other necessary business the elders may have in Albuquerque.

<H2>Santa Ana Pueblo - additional services through gaming revenue </H2>

<TABLE WIDTH=600>
<TR>
<TD ROWSPAN=3 WIDTH=300>

<P> Santa Ana Pueblo is located approximately 20 miles north of 
Albuquerque and just east of the fastest growing city in the country, 
Rio Rancho. Santa Ana began its gaming operation with Bingo and pull 
tabs in 1993. In this short time, the tribe has used its gaming 
revenues to provide additional services for its members and used its 
gaming revenues to economically diversify the tribe's business 
holdings. Santa Ana provides over 200 jobs for its tribal members and
non-tribal members in its Santa Ana Star casino. The jobs start at a 
very competitive salary and have provided a start in the working world 
for many people in the Pueblo and the surrounding community.</P>

<P>The tribe has expanded its police force, buying several new police 
cars and equipment to deal with crimes committed by non-tribal members 
on tribal land. The tribe is funding scholarships for its bright 
students, and has encouraged the youth of the tribe to strive for a 
better education through its Families and Youth Department and the 
expansion of the community library.</P>

<P>The tribal lands of Santa Ana Pueblo sit along the banks of the Rio 
Grande, and there is an extensive number of ditches that provide water 
for crops in the river valley. Over the years, the ditches had become 
over-grown with weeds and the result was flooding of many homes in low 
lying areas during times of extensive rain-fall. The tribe used gaming 
revenues to buy a bulldozer and pay for its operation in clearing 
miles of overgrown ditches of weeds and other refuse. The result is 
the Pueblo homes are no longer in danger of flooding in the sudden 
rains of New Mexico.

Under the IGRA, Tribal governments are the primary regulators of Indian Gaming. Due to states demand for a role in Indian gaming, Tribes are required to negotiate with states in order to conduct Class III gaming operations.  The IGRA creates a federal regulatory layer for Class III gaming and permits a third, state regulatory layer to be established by state-tribal compact agreements.  The Act contains a grandfather provision to allow gaming operations conducted prior to the passage of the Act to continue for a specified period of time and further provides such activities are proper subjects for negotiation.

<P><STRONG>November 1988</STRONG> - Sandia Pueblo notifies the Office of Indian Affairs of its request to enter negotiations for Indian gaming compacts with the State pursuant to NMSA Section  28-12-7 which designates the New Mexico Office of Indian Affairs as the coordinating agency for intergovernmental programs concerning tribal governments and the state.

POSITION PAPER<BR>
OF THE NEW MEXICO INDIAN GAMING ASSOCIATION<BR>
ON PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE INDIAN GAMING REGULATORY ACT<BR>
JULY 1995
</H2></CENTER>
<H4><CENTER>Introduction</CENTER></H4>
<P>
	Congress is considering, at the urging of many state governments, a number of amendments to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act ("IGRA"), the 1988 federal law governing gaming establishments on Indian reservations.  The Indian tribal governments that make up the New Mexico Indian Gaming Association present this paper to provide their position on the issue of Indian Gaming for the members of the New Mexico congressional delegation, other members of Congress, tribal governments in other states, and the people of New Mexico.  </p>
<P>
	Gaming on reservations has emerged in New Mexico and throughout the Nation as a means for tribal communities to climb out of the most dismal economic conditions that exist anywhere in the Nation.  Formidable obstacles impede economic improvement on the reservations, and, to date, they have proven largely insurmountable.  Gaming on reservations simply must be considered against this defining backdrop.</P>
<P>
	It is helpful, therefore, first to discuss the economic climate in which New Mexico Indian gaming exists.  New Mexico is one of our poorest states, ranking forty-sixth in the nation in per capita income.  In New Mexico, as in virtually every other western state, Indian people are the poorest of the poor.  According to the 1990 census, the average per capita income of New Mexico Indians was $5,141.  Of 34,170 Indian households in the state, 17,417 (51%) earned less than $15,000 in annual income.  Of 27,883 Indian families in the state, 12,092 had income in 1989 below the poverty level.  That translates to 60,431 Indian people, 46% of the state's total Indian population, living in poverty; 26,643 of these poor are children.</P>
<P>
	Other measures of economic well-being tell an equally grim story.  Of 63,991 Indians age 25 or older, 13,484 had less than a ninth-grade education, and another 13,287 failed to finish high school.  Only 58.2% of adult Indians were high school graduates; only 5.8% had college degrees.  Twenty-three percent of the state's Indian homes lack complete plumbing facilities.  The numbers are even worse in New Mexico's Third Congressional District, in which the majority of New Mexico's Indian reservations are located.</P>
<P>
	Clearly there is a compelling need for economic development on New Mexico's Indian reservations.  Many of the most impenetrable barriers to reservation economic development are the direct result of state government interfering in reservation affairs, sometimes with federal acquiescence.  For example, the state routinely claims the authority to tax reservation enterprises, even where the tribe and federal governments are taxing that enterprise and the state provides few or no services to either the enterprise or the Indian community.  This results in a ruinous double or triple tax burden on reservation enterprises that discourages the initial investment of capital and inhibits the growth of existing businesses.  Similarly, the states claim the authority to impose their environmental laws, their liquor laws, and their zoning laws to reservations, thereby either discouraging investment in or prohibiting altogether activities that might profit an Indian community.  We are dismayed that the states would attack the highly profitable business of Indian gaming in light of the states' uninterrupted history of discouraging reservation economic development through attempts to apply state laws, in addition to federal and tribal laws, to tribal development projects.  Only a few tribes have had the resources to fight these state laws in court but, when they have, tribes often have won.  In light of this history, we cannot accept the states' statements that they are concerned with economic conditions in Indian communities.  </P>
<P>
	One of the few bright spots in the bleak picture of Indian economies is Indian gaming.  Of the twenty-two Indian tribes in New Mexico, ten have tribal gaming operations located on their Indian lands.  All of the tribal gaming operations are 100% tribally owned and operated.  Several of the gaming operations were started with outside investors spending several million dollars in New Mexico on construction and start-up costs.  For many tribes, Indian gaming is the first successful Tribal enterprise that provides confidence and capital to venture into other businesses.  Tribal members employed by the gaming operations are gaining experience at every level of the operations.  For many tribal members, this is their first job, and the experience they gain at gaming operations prepares them to compete in the larger job market.  In addition to tribal members we each employ, we provide employment to individuals from surrounding Indian and non-Indian communities.  Based upon data gathered by the Center for Applied Research in Denver, Colorado, tribal gaming has created directly 2,650 jobs in New Mexico for both Indians and non-Indians.  These jobs mean that employees can provide the basic necessities of life: food on their tables, shelter for their families, school supplies and clothes for their children.  The multiplier effect (the impact of employees' income that is spent by employees on goods and services in the community) of these jobs, plus jobs related to our purchasing of goods and services, translates into over 13,000 jobs in the State of New Mexico.  Our annual payrolls exceed $46,000,000, and we purchase over $69,000,000 worth of goods and services, primarily from surrounding non-Indian communities.  (The multiplier effect of these expenditures is in excess of $215,000,000.)  Through our promotional out-reach, we have transported and attracted customers from all across the nation.  With few exceptions, these gaming customers stay at hotels, eat at restaurants, and spend money in shops located off our reservations. </P> 
<P>
	In addition, we make contributions to Indian and non-Indian charitable and non-profit organizations.  One gaming tribe, for example, has donated well over 1 million dollars to various charitable organizations since beginning operations nine years ago.  Unlike commercial non-Indian gaming profits, which go into the pockets of the few, the profits from our tribal gaming enterprises go to our tribal governments' general funds and support tribal government services, programs, and projects that benefit our people.  These revenues provide salaries for our employees and repair and maintenance of our community facilities, such as sewer and water systems.  These revenues provide funds for training and education programs, fire and law enforcement departments, and a variety of other programs and services.  These revenues provide investment capital for business acquisitions and reduce unemployment and the financial burden that unemployment brings.  </P>
<P>
	Despite these successes and contributions to the economy at large, we now find the Indian gaming industry in the State of New Mexico in serious jeopardy.  In a strange, though--to us--not surprising, move, the state Supreme Court ruled on July 13, 1995, that the Governor of New Mexico did not have the authority to sign the compacts on behalf of the state.  The court did not rule on the validity of the compacts already signed by the Governor and approved by the Secretary.  The Pueblos and Tribes in New Mexico are confident that the compacts are valid and we remain bound to our obligations under the compacts, and we will fulfill those obligations to the extent we are able, notwithstanding the state's recent action.  We expect and insist that the federal government stand with us to protect the validity of the compacts under the solemn trust responsibilities to protect tribal assets and under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.  We have placed too much reliance on our compacts to provide economic stability through economic diversification to have them threatened after these long years of struggle.  </P>
<P>
	The reason so many tribes have turned to gaming is that the tribes have few viable economic development options.  As discussed above, we believe that our inability to develop viable reservation economies is in large part due to state efforts to tax and regulate economic activities on our lands.  We also note terribly unfair federal laws that either give states jurisdiction over Indian lands or allow the states economic advantages that we are not granted.  If the states are genuinely concerned about the development of viable reservation economies, let them support legislation that levels the playing field between tribes and states, gives the tribes the same tax advantages the states enjoy, guarantees fair forums for the resolution of tribal-state disputes, and guarantees tribes the same ability states have to create a legal and regulatory climate that encourages economic growth.  Rather than attacking Indian gaming, Congress should:</P>
<menu>
<UL>
<LI>Prohibit state taxation of any person, property, or activity that the tribes have jurisdiction to tax;
<LI>Prohibit the application of state and local environmental and zoning laws to persons, property, and activities within Indian country;
<LI>Amend the Internal Revenue Code to allow tribes to issue tax-exempt bonds for the same purposes that states may do so, and modify the volume caps on such bonds to reflect the small populations and greater need for capital in Indian communities;
<LI>Amend Public Law 280 to require states, upon the request of an Indian tribe, to retrocede any jurisdiction they may have acquired under the statute;
<LI>Repeal the McCarran Amendment, which gives state courts jurisdiction to adjudicate tribal reserved water rights; and
<LI>Ensure that tribes are given equitable shares of federal funds for highways, sewage treatment facilities, solid waste facilities, drinking water systems, and other critical infrastructure.
</UL>
</menu>

<P>	In our judgment, the issue is a simple one.  The states claim the issue is one of morality or infiltration by organized crime or state sovereignty.  It is nothing of the sort.  The issue, pure and simple, is competition for resources.  It is the same battle we have fought with the states for two hundred twenty years.  Indian tribes have always had something the states want.  First it was our land; then it was our water; then it was our timber, our fish and game, and our oil and gas; then it was our tax revenues.  Now it is our gaming revenues.  The states have always couched the issue in terms of "what is good for the Indians."  As discussed above, after two hundred twenty years of the states dictating "what is good" for us, our people are poor, ill-housed, and under-educated.  We encourage all Americans to see this battle for what it is: yet another effort by the states to take from the tribes.</P>

Position on Proposed Amendments to the IGRA
</CENTER></H3>

<P>1. <EM>New Mexico tribal governments believe that the states have failed to demonstrate a genuine need for changes to the IGRA.  Before amendments are considered, the states should be required to prove the facts they allege about infiltration by organized crime and adverse impacts on the states. </EM> The states are complaining that, because of the IGRA and the states' lack of authority over Indian gaming, there either is or will be infiltration by organized crime of Indian gaming facilities and adverse impacts on non-Indian communities in the states.  Unlike most petitioners to Congress, however, the states have not been required to show, by credible proof, that the negative circumstances exist.  The facts that have been produced before Congress show that the concern about organized crime is unjustified and that Indian gaming is proving a boon, not only to Indian communities, but also to the non-Indian communities that surround them.  The problems with the implementation of the IGRA arise from the refusal of certain states to participate faithfully in the processes required by the Act.  Under these circumstances, we are not persuaded that the Act requires amendments, particularly amendments of the type being proposed by the states.  The only amendment that may be necessary to ensure effective implementation of the Act is an express waiver of the states' Tenth and Eleventh Amendment immunity.  However, even this may not be needed, as the United States Supreme Court has granted certiorari on the issue of whether the current IGRA waives the immunity of the states and, if so, whether such waiver is enforceable.  If the Court rules in the tribes' favor, there will be no need to amend IGRA. </P>
<P></P>
<P>
	2.	<EM><U>New Mexico tribal governments support the efforts of Senator McCain and Senator Inouye to find an approach to this issue that is acceptable to both the tribes and the states</U></EM>.  Senators McCain and Inouye have proven their commitment to tribal sovereignty and the advancement of tribal interests.  We support the Senate Indian Affairs Committee's efforts to develop legislation and accept Senator Inouye and Senator McCain as honest and knowledgeable mediators between the tribes and the states; we take them at their word when they say they will not allow tribal interests to be harmed.  We do, however, reserve the right to withhold our support of any legislative proposal that emerges from the Congress if it does not adequately address the concerns of New Mexico tribes.</P>
<P>
	3.	<EM>The tribes of New Mexico believe that the IGRA currently allows the states the ability they need to control the scope of games in which Indian tribes may engage. </EM> The states complain that the courts have interpreted the IGRA in such a way that, if a state allows any form of Class III gaming within its borders, then Indian tribes may engage in all forms of Class III gaming.  That is not the law.  Both the IGRA and the courts have said that, where a state allows a particular form of gaming under any circumstances, then the tribes may engage in that form of gaming.  Only if a state flatly prohibits a particular form of gaming may the state refuse to negotiate a compact with a tribe for the conduct of that particular game.  If the states wish for tribes not to offer particular games, the IGRA gives the states the practical ability to prevent the tribes from doing so; all a state need do is prohibit the game to all of its citizens.</P>
<P>
	4.	<EM>The tribes of New Mexico will oppose any amendment to IGRA that would increase state jurisdiction over Indian gaming. </EM> State governments in general, and the government of New Mexico in particular, have proven completely unresponsive to the economic needs of tribal communities.  We see absolutely no reason to believe that, if the states are given further authority over Indian gaming, they will exercise that authority in ways that advance tribal interests.  	
	In fact, very recent events in our state indicate why states' role in Indian gaming should be limited.  New Mexico tribes spent years attempting to negotiate a compact with then Governor Bruce King, who consistently refused even to sit at the negotiation table.  The tribes, after years of good faith efforts to negotiate, were eventually forced to pursue litigation, and two tribes sued the state in 1991 for failing to negotiate in good faith.   The state asserted that it was immune from suit, and the tribes litigated the immunity issue all the way to the Tenth Circuit.  The Tenth Circuit ruled in favor of the tribes.  The Governor still stalled the negotiations.  Then the 1994 elections took place, and New Mexico elected a new Governor.  After intensive and prompt negotiations with Governor Johnson, the tribes and the state executed comprehensive gaming compacts in February, 1995.  The Secretary of the Interior approved the compacts and published the compacts in the Federal Register.  At that point, after spending years of painstaking effort and enormous amounts of attorneys' fees and other related expenses, the tribes reasonably believed that the matter was finally over.  Acting pursuant to their clearly established rights under the federally-approved compacts, the tribes have invested millions of dollars to expand existing facilities, upgrade equipment, and make other improvements. </P>
<P>
	However, the New Mexico Supreme Court ruled just this month that Governor Johnson had no authority to execute the compacts.  Thus, after years of intensive efforts by the tribes to negotiate a gaming compact, and after diligently pursuing all the steps outlined in the IGRA, including hard fought battles in the federal district court and the Tenth Circuit, the New Mexico Supreme Court, consisting of political appointees of the former Governor, has attempted to invalidate the compacts.  (We do not know the repercussions of the court's ruling given, among other things, the fact that we believe the compacts remain valid as a matter if federal law, and the state court's ruling on federal law issues is not binding on a federal court.) </P>
<P>
	This turn of events is discouraging, as the tribes believe that the New Mexico Supreme Court's opinion is clearly wrong and politically motivated.  These recent events further underscore the fact that, if tribes are left to the mercy of the state political apparatus (including the state's court systems), the tribes will more often than not be left out in the cold.  For these reasons, it is essential that states' involvement in Indian gaming be reduced or eliminated, not expanded. </P>
<P>
 	Given the fact that some in Congress sincerely believe more regulation is needed on reservations, we are willing to consider a redefinition, and perhaps even an expansion, of federal regulation of high stakes or Class III Indian gaming.  However, state control must be reduced or eliminated.</P>
<P></P>
<P>
	5.	<EM>The tribes of New Mexico are willing to explore alternatives to the provisions of the Act that have given rise to litigation over the "good faith" of the states, so long as there is a federal authority to whom we may turn for relief and the acts of that federal authority are enforceable in court against the states. </EM> We are willing to consider alternative means of resolving tribal-state disputes.  Whatever the forum for dispute resolution, there must be clear and enforceable time limits; the decision whether to turn to the alternative forum must be available to the tribes and the states on an equal basis; the forum must be a federal or tribal one; and the decisions of the forum must be enforceable against the states in federal court.</P>
<P>
	6.	<EM>The tribes of New Mexico will oppose any effort to expand the authority or influence of states in federal decisions whether to take land in trust. </EM> The IGRA carves out a prominent role for state governors in the Secretary's decision whether to take off-reservation lands into trust.  We believe it is too large a role, and we strongly support the proposed amendments in S. 487, that require the Secretary of the Interior to review the recommendations of the Governor of a state where the trust land is located, but no longer requires the consent of the Governor.</P>
<P>
	7.	<EM>The tribes of New Mexico would not oppose legislation to expand the coverage of federal criminal law where there is a demonstrated gap in the coverage of tribal, state, and federal law and where such an expansion is not an attempt to expand the application of state law to Indian reservations. </EM> We believe that federal criminal law now adequately covers gaming-related crimes on Indian lands.  If, however, the states can demonstrate that this is not the case, we are willing to discuss the expansion of federal law to cover identified gaps in coverage.  We also believe that any problems that exist are more likely the result of inadequate enforcement of existing laws, and we would support legislation providing additional resources to federal and tribal law enforcement agencies.  We will oppose any legislation that is an attempt to expand the application of state criminal laws to Indian country.</P>
<P>
	8.	<EM>The compacting process established in the IGRA provides a proper format to address the costs to the states of Indian gaming within their boundaries. </EM> We doubt that the net impact of Indian gaming to state treasuries is negative.  However, if the states can demonstrate such an impact, we believe that it is an appropriate issue to address in the compacting process established under the Act.  In fact, in the compacts we executed with the State of New Mexico, we agreed to pay the state a certain percentage of our revenues, in part to help defray any costs the state would incur as a result of Indian gaming.  If other satisfactory procedures were established for Class III gaming, we would not object to language allowing the financial impact on a state to be considered in establishing the conditions for the conduct of Class III gaming.  We must note, however, that the states have never offered to help the tribes offset the costs to the tribes of dealing with the impact of the activities of non-resident non-Indians on the reservations, and we find it somewhat disingenuous for the states to complain about their financial concerns under the circumstances.</P>
<P>
	9.	<EM>The Tribes of New Mexico have no objections to the imposition of minimum standards regarding internal controls, even though we do not think they are necessary. </EM> We do not believe that minimum internal control standards are necessary, as tribes in New Mexico, as well as tribes throughout the country, have demonstrated that they are fully capable of operating their gaming establishments in a responsible manner.  Further, we note the inequity of requiring tribal gaming establishments to meet minimum federal standards, even though there are no federal standards that apply to non-Indian gaming establishments throughout the country.  Nevertheless, if Congress determines that minimum standards are essential, we will not object, provided, of course, that the promulgation of these standards includes consultation with tribal representatives and that the standards acknowledge that not all Indian gaming establishments are alike.  Some are large operations, whereas others are very small, and there must be some flexibility in the standards so as not to impose unreasonable burdens on tribes. </P>
<P>
 	10.	<EM>The New Mexico tribes strongly support the proposal that tribes be allowed to negotiate a compact directly with the Secretary of the Interior if tribes and states cannot reach a compromise.</EM>  If a state does not wish to be involved in the compact negotiation process, it should not have to be.  In such cases, it would be in the best interests of tribes and states for tribes to deal directly with the Secretary of the Interior. </P>
<P>
	11.	 <EM> The New Mexico tribes support the general regulatory scheme proposed in S. 487, 
under which, absent compacts to the contrary, tribes will have the sole authority to issue licenses and 
carry on regulatory functions, and the federal government will act in an oversight capacity only.</EM>  
There is no need for the federal government (or a state) to issue licenses and\or carry on regulatory 
functions.  We recognize, as does S. 487, that in those unusual cases in which a tribe fails to regulate 
its gaming operation adequately, the federal government needs to step in and take a more active regulatory 
role.  However, the presumption should always be that, absent reliable evidence to the contrary, tribes are 
capable of, and in fact do, regulate their gaming operations responsibly.  </P>

<H2>Sandia Pueblo - environmental cleanup and public safety</H2></center>
<P>Environmental problems have also been a primary concern for Sandia 
Pueblo. There have been several critical projects completed in a timely
manner that protect and preserve the environment for the residents of 
Sandia Pueblo, and for the surrounding communities. Some of these 
projects include: closing of a former open dump, water monitoring for 
potential contaminants, drinking water testing and analysis, disposal 
of leaking under-ground storage tanks, cleanup of contaminated soil, 
environmental training and education, recycling and community 
awareness. Without gaming dollars, these types of efforts would not 
be possible.</P>

<P>Police protection on the Pueblo has also been provided for by gaming 
revenues. 95% of all calls to the Sandia Police Force concern 
non-tribal members. The police have been provided state-of-the-art 
equipment including cars, a radio system, field drug testing and 
breathalyzer equipment, and protective vests.</P>

<TD ROWSPAN=2 WIDTH=300>

<P>Isleta Pueblo is planning for the future and using the revenues 
from gaming to provide a large number of services to its members 
including programs for the elderly of the community and the youth 
of the community.</P>

<P>The Isleta Gaming Palace is providing jobs for many tribal members 
and non-tribal members from the nearby Albuquerque area. Isleta 
currently employs over 600 people in its gaming, facilities at 
above average pay with a strong benefits package.</P>

<P>The revenues from gaming are providing tribal members with services 
that were currently unavailable because of the lack of tribal funds. 
The Pueblo of Isleta is also planning a strong economic diversification
program and is working to prepare its Pueblo for the future. Isleta 
is located just south of Albuquerque and north of the rapidly growing 
city of Los Lunas. </P>

<P>One of the goals of the economic diversification 
program is to be able to compete with the surrounding communities 
and offer services that will provide even more jobs to the members 
of the Pueblo, and its neighbors. Isleta is aggressively planning 
and reinvesting its gaming revenues in the people of its Pueblo, 
and the surrounding community.</P>

<H2>The Pueblo of Pojoaque - Cities of Gold Casino</H2>

<TD ROWSPAN=3 WIDTH=300>

<P>The Pueblo of Pojoaque, located about 15 miles north of Santa Fe, 
is using its gaming operation, The Cities of Gold casino, to finance 
environmental cleanup, infrastructure problems, Indian art and culture,
and economic diversification opportunities for both members of the 
tribe and the surrounding communities.</P>

<P>Since the new Cities of Gold casino opened after the compacts were 
signed by the Governor and approved by the Secretary of the Interior, 
the gaming operation now employs over 700 people, and has expanded 
from 10,000 square feet to approximately 40,000 square feet. </P>

<P>The jobs provided to Pueblo members, and local residents, including 
some of the displaced workers from the Department of Energy downsizing 
at Los Alamos national labs. The gaming operation offers above average 
wages, and a good health and benefit plan for its employees. These 
jobs are especially important in and around the Santa Fe area where 
many local residents are being displaced by rising real estate prices 
and property taxes in Santa Fe. Without a good job, many local 
families would be unable to stay in the area where they were born.

<HEAD><TITLE>Summary of Tribal-State Revenue Sharing Agreement</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">

<H2><CENTER>SUMMARY OF TRIBAL-STATE REVENUE SHARING AGREEMENT</CENTER></H2> 

<BR>
<P><LI>	<MENU><EM>Summary</EM>.     The Tribe agrees to contribute a percentage of its class III gaming revenues to the State and local governments.</MENU></P>

</P><LI>	<MENU><EM>Purpose</EM>.     The Tribe shall contribute a percentage of its class III gaming revenues to the State and local governments <EM>in exchange</EM> for the State's promise not to restrict class III gaming under the compact or to expand off-reservation class III gaming beyond the limits specified in the revenue sharing agreement.</MENU></P>

<P><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG>     The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act restricts an Indian tribe from using "net revenues" derived from class III gaming for purposes other than tribal government operations, general welfare, economic development, and charity.  25 U.S.C. 2710(b)(2)(B) & (d)(2)(A).  The Secretary of the Interior has determined that the revenue sharing agreement is a legitimate 
bargained-for-exchange and hence a legitimate cost of doing business (i.e., operating expense) 
that is not subject to the net revenue use restriction of the IGRA. </P>

<P><LI><MENU><EM>Revenue Sharing Payments.</EM>     The Tribe will make semi-annual revenue sharing payments to the State and local governments (located on or near the Tribe's reservation) as follows: 60% to the State and 40% to the local governments.  An Indian tribe does not qualify as a local government. </MENU></P>

<P><LI><MENU><EM>Calculation of Revenue Sharing Payments.</EM> </MENU></P>

<P><MENU><OL TYPE=A>
<LI>	<MENU><EM>Net Win</EM>.     The Tribe's revenue sharing payments to the State and local governments are based  upon a percentage of the "net win" derived from class III gaming.  The revenue sharing agreement defines "net win" as the gross class III gaming revenues less (1) the amounts paid out as prizes, (2)  federal, state, and tribal regulatory fees, and  (3) taxes.</MENU>
</OL></MENU></P>

<P><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG>     Tribal "operating expenses" for class III gaming are <EM>not</EM> deducted from the net win under the revenue sharing agreement.  Compare the definition of "net revenues" in the IGRA, which states that the "'term net revenues' means gross gaming revenues of an Indian gaming activity less amounts paid out as, or paid for, prizes, and <EM>total operating expenses</EM>, excluding management fees,"  25 U.S.C. 2703(9)(emphasis added), with the definition of "net win" in the revenue sharing agreement. </P>

<P><MENU><OL TYPE=A START=2>
<LI><MENU><EM>Tiered Percentage</EM>.     The percentage payable to the State and local governments is based upon two tiers:</MENU>
</OL></MENU></P>

<MENU><P><MENU><OL>
<LI><MENU>3% of the net win under $4 million.</MENU>
<BR>
<LI><MENU>5% of the net win over $4 million.</MENU>
</OL></MENU></P></MENU>

<P><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG>   Assume the Tribe makes $24 million in net win from class III gaming for the year.  The Tribe would pay the State and local governments $120,000 (3% of $4 million) plus $1,000,000 (5% of $20 million) for a total of $1.4 million or $840,000 to the State (60%) and $560,000 to the local governments (40%). </P>

<P><MENU><OL TYPE=A START=3>
<LI><MENU><EM>Due Dates</EM>.     The Tribe shall make the revenue sharing payments no later than 25 days after December 31 and June 30 of each year. </MENU>
</OL></MENU></P>

<P><MENU><EM>Limitations.</EM>     The Tribe's obligation to make revenue sharing payments is contingent upon the compact being in effect and the obligation shall terminate if: </MENU><P>

<P><MENU><OL TYPE=A>
<LI><MENU>The State restricts class III gaming allowed under the compact; or</MENU>
<BR>
<LI><MENU>The State expands off-reservation class III gaming. However, the following events do not constitute an expansion of off-reservation class III gaming: (1) the enactment of a state lottery, (2) the operation of electronic gaming devices by veterans or charitable organizations as of February 10, 1995, and (3) the operation of electronic gaming devices by horserace tracks, except that the Tribe shall only have to pay one-half of the percentage of net win on the days the horserace tracks operate such devices for <EM>less than</EM> 12 hours and the Tribe shall not pay any percentage of the net win on the days the horserace tracks operate such devices for <EM>more than</EM> 12 hours. </MENU>
</MENU></OL></P>

<P><MENU><EM>Effect of Variance.</EM> </MENU></P>

<P><MENU><OL TYPE=A>
<LI><MENU><EM>Compact Effective</EM>.     If the State violates the limitations of the revenue sharing agreement and the Tribe's obligation to make revenue sharing payments ceases, then the compact shall continue to remain in effect, but the Tribe's obligation to reimburse the State for documented regulatory expenses shall "automatically increase" to $100,000 per year.</MENU>
<BR>
<LI><MENU><EM>State Regulatory Expense Increase</EM>.     If the Tribe's revenue sharing payments to the State and local government amount to less than $100,000 per year, then the Tribe's obligation to reimburse the State for documented  regulatory expenses shall "automatically increase" to $100,000 per year less the revenue sharing payments. </MENU>
</OL></MENU></P>

<P><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG>   Under section 4(E)(5) of the compact, the Tribe agrees to reimburse the State for regulatory expenses not to exceed $25,000 per year. </P>

<P><MENU><EM>Interpretation</EM>.     The revenue sharing agreement shall be interpreted broadly to accomplish its purpose. </MENU></P>

<P><MENU><EM>Dispute Resolution</EM>.     The dispute resolution procedure set forth in the compact shall govern all disputes under the revenue sharing agreement. </MENU></P>

<P><MENU><EM>Effective Date</EM>.     The revenue sharing agreement is effective on the day the compact becomes effective. </MENU></P>

<P><MENU><EM>Amendments</EM>.     The revenue sharing agreement may be amended in writing by both parties. </MENU></P>

<P><MENU><EM>Definitions</EM>.     Unless otherwise defined, the terms in the revenue sharing agreement  have the same meanings used in the compact. </MENU></P>

<P><MENU><EM>Equal Treatment</EM>.     The Tribe is to be treated equally with other tribes so that if any other tribe enters into a revenue sharing agreement that has more favorable terms, then the Tribe may operate under the more favorable terms without amending the revenue sharing 
agreement or the compact.</MENU></P>

<H1>Isleta - Youth Programs</H1>

<TABLE WIDTH=600>

<TD ROWSPAN=2 WIDTH=300>

<P>Isleta's youth are considered one of the most important reasons for 
its gaming program. All of Isleta's youth programs are funded 100% by 
revenues from gaming. Youth is a constant concern of all Indian people 
and Isleta is no exception. There are over 1200 school age children in 
Isleta, and they are a top priority for the tribe. </P>

<P>The Isleta youth center and recreation area is composed of playing 
fields for baseball, foot-ball and soccer, basketball courts and now 
with the addition to a fully equipped fitness center the youth of 
Isleta have a place to play and be active in a controlled and 
supervised environment. The youth and recreation center also features 
a computer room, television, pool tables, and foosball tables.</P>

<P>The Isleta youth center is constantly supervised and activities are 
planned for youth of all ages. The youth center is open to kids from 
the surrounding community and is one of the most popular hangouts for 
not only the youth of Isleta Pueblo, but also for the youth from Los 
Lunas and Albuquerque, who are interested in having fun in a drug, 
alcohol, and gang-free environment.</P>

<P>Santa Clara is in its conceptual stages of planning for a Mini Mall type construction. This plan consists of both retail and outlet-type of businesses. The tribe realizes they are in a ideal location to capture a majority of business from Northern New Mexico. Currently Santa Fe is the closest city that has those types of facilities.
Gaming is also part of this lucrative plan which the tribe hopes to get construction going within one year.

<H2>The Pueblo of Pojoaque - education and tradition</H2>

<TABLE WIDTH=90%>

<TD ROWSPAN=3>

<P>Pojoaque has used the revenues from gaming to donate money to the 
local schools, the Pojoaque Valley school district. The children of 
Pojoaque attend this school district, but due to inadequate state 
funding, there are very few funds available for extracurricular 
activities. The money donated by Pojoaque Pueblo is being utilized 
for travel to academic and athletic activities. The emphasis on 
education is important to Pojoaque, for they believe the only way to 
beat the cycle of poverty is through education.</p>

<p>In a more practical application to education, when the Pojoaque 
Valley public schools water storage system broke down and left the 
school without water for a few days, Pojoaque Pueblo donated the 
money to have it repaired.</P>

<P>Pojoaque places high value on the preservation of the Indian 
culture. Pojoaque provided funds for the construction of a kiva, 
for use in religious and spiritual ceremonies. Pojoaque is continuing 
in its defense of the Indian culture of New Mexico by using its gaming 
revenues for the construction of the Poeh Center. The Poeh Center 
offers sculpting, clay and pottery, Tewa classes, and many other 
traditional activities known by the Pueblo Indian people. Pojoaque 
Pueblo is also taking an active role in the patronage of promising 
Indian artists. By sponsoring a young artist, the Pueblo feeds it 
can Promote Indian art in the art world internationally. The Poeh 
museum is also participating in cultural exchanges with Asia and 
Europe

<CENTER><P><I>Kivas among the other New Mexico Pueblos and tribes have 
been maintained through hundreds of years and are price-less. 
However, because Pojoaque had been abandoned by its tribal members 
in the past, its Kiva had not been maintained therefore $300,000 in 
gaming revenues were used to build this traditional Kiva. </I></P></CENTER>

<P>Without the benefit of gaming revenue, the tribe would not have 
been in the position to secure the capital to begin to develop 
economically in this region. San Juan is also using gaming revenue
to provide necessary services to its members including programs
to care for the tribe's elderly, and scholarship programs for youths
seeking additional education.

<P>Funds have also been used to expand the Police department as well
as other social service programs benefiting the tribal membership
and the development of infra-structure. In short, the tribal 
government's responsibility has increased due to the availability
of funds brought about through gaming revenues.  The Corporation as well
as the Tribal Government will continue to diversify its economy
through entrepreneurial means.

<H1>Tesuque - restoring traditional beauty</H1>

<TABLE WIDTH=600>
<TR>
<TD ROWSPAN=7 WIDTH=325>

<P>Tesuque Pueblo is using its gaming revenue to restore the 
traditional beauty of its historic plaza. For generations the 
traditional adobe structures surrounding the plaza have been 
slowly deteriorating due to the effects of weather and time on 
the century-old adobes. </P>

<P>Most of the members of the Pueblo had abandoned the sub-standard 
housing on the plaza and had moved into mobile homes or had to rent 
housing away from the Pueblo. The Pueblo of Tesuque used some of its 
gaming revenues to completely renovate the north side of the historic 
plaza. In putting together the renovation plans, Tesuque took great 
steps to preserve the traditional look and feel of their historic plaza</P>

<CENTER><P><I>Tesuque Pueblo Plaza after renovation. The project has 
been funded by gaming dollars and will cost several million dollars to 
complete.</I></P></CENTER>
</TD>

<TD WIDTH=325>

<P>They followed the plans exactly as the original plaza, which was 
built by their forefathers, with contemporary amenities, including 
rebuilding the infrastructure, including the plumbing and electrical 
system. The renovation project has only just begun, but the results 
are already evident. Many members of the Pueblo that had moved away 
from the plaza are now moving back, and enjoying the contemporary 
housing in a traditional Pueblo setting. </P>

<P>The tribe has completed the north side of the plaza renovation and 
will continue to restore and connect the entire plaza, as it once was 
before.</P>

<H1>Tesuque - Day School Renovation</H1>

<TABLE WIDTH=600>
<TR>
<TD ROWSPAN=2 WIDTH=300>

<P>This is the Tesuque Day School. The school has been renovated once 
before, and has currently been expanded through the use of mobile 
housing due to an increased number of school age children in the 
Tesuque Pueblo. The Pueblo is planning to expand not only the building,
so as to include children from elementary to middle school students, 
but also its curriculum. </P>
<P>The Tesuque Day School is dedicated to preserving and teaching 
traditional Tesuque culture to its children, including instruction in 
the Tewa language.</P>

<P>The plans include additions in the traditional adobe style of 
building, with the necessary improvements in the infrastructure.</P>

<P>Tesuque Pueblo has also used gaming proceeds to hire additional 
rangers to patrol mountain areas and fishing ponds within the Pueblo. 
The tribe is also setting up scholarship programs for tribal students. 
Tesuque realizes the future of its tribe depends on the education of its 
youth. Gaming revenues will finance the educational future of the children 
of Tesuque.

<H2>San Juan - Ohkay Casino</H2>

<TABLE WIDTH=600>

<TD ROWSPAN=3 WIDTH=325>

<P>The Pueblo of San Juan, which nests one half mile north of Espanola, 
has a great deal to offer to the city. The TSAY Corporation which is 
the wholly-owned business development entity of the Pueblo operates 
six different enterprises. The corporation employs over 230 people, 
both tribal members as well as Espanola Valley residents. It is 
anticipated that the entire business network will provide over $4 million 
in payroll, and another $2.5 million in goods and services this year. 
With its lands lying within the city limits, there is the opportunity 
for an ideal economic diversification.</P>

<P>The flag ship enterprise is the Ohkay Casino. The gaming revenues 
produced by this tribal enterprise has allowed the Pueblo to incept 
additional profit ventures. The Pueblo recently completed Phase 1 of 
their economic development plan by building a Travel Center which is 
just south of the Ohkay Casino facility. The Travel Center includes 
a convenience store and gas station, complimented by a new Laundromat 
and car wash. Also completed under Phase 1 is the construction of the 
new Ohkay Mini-Mart and RV Park found within the city limits of Espanola 
which includes camp sites, RV Pads, a gas station/convenience store with 
a Laundromat for use by RV campers, and a 100-acre Park containing three 
man-made fishing lakes, along with several nature trails. The development 
of TSAY Construction company has also helped alleviate the need for 
outside construction services on the Pueblo. The construction company
has also ventured outside the reservation boundaries and has begun to 
establish itself as a professional construction development company.

<BODY BACKGROUND="./images/sand.jpg"><CENTER><IMG
ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="./images/nnseal.gif"></CENTER>
<P>The Great Seal of the Navajo Tribe, designed by John Claw, Jr. of Many
Farms, AZ, was officially adopted by the Navajo Tribal Council on January 18,
1952 by resolution CJ-9-52</P>
<P>The 48 projectile points outlining the seal symbolize the tribes protection
within the  48 states (as of 1952). The opening at the top of the three
concentric lines is considered the east; the lines represent a rainbow and the
sovereignty of the Navajo Nation. The rainbow never closes on the tribe's
sovereign immunity. The outside line is red, the middle yellow and the inside is
blue.</P><IMG
ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="./images/seal.gif" ALT="The Great Seal of the Navajo Nation">
<P>The yellow sun shines from the east on the four mountains sacred to the
Navajo. These, located at the cardinal points, are in their ceremonial colors:
White in the east represents White-Shell Woman; Blue in the south represents
Turquoise Woman;  Yellow to the west represents  Abalone Woman; and the Black to
the North represents Jet Black Woman.</P>
<P>Two green corn plants, symbolic as the sustainer of the Navajo life,
decorate the bottom of the seal, with tips of the yellow pollen which is used in
many Navajo ceremonies. In the center are a sheep, a horse, and a cow, all
symbolizing the Navajo livestock industry.</P>
<P>In May 1988, the Navajo Nation Council amended the original wording from the
Great Seal of the Navajo Tribe to the Great Seal of the Navajo Nation. They also
increased the number of arrowheads to 50 to include representation of the states
of Hawaii and Alaska.</P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Navajo Nation Tourism - Introduction</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BACKGROUND="./images/sand.jpg"><CENTER><A HREF="seal.htm"><IMG
ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="./images/welcome.gif" ALT="Welcome to Navajoland" BORDER="0"></A></CENTER>
<P>Ya' at' 'eh' (meaning hello or greetings)! On behalf of the Navajo Nation,
the Navajoland Tourism Department welcomes you to the home of the largest Indian
tribe and reservation in North America. 
</P>
<P><A HREF="./images/lady2.jpg"><IMG
ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="./images/lady1.jpg" ALT="Navajo lady with pottery"></A></P>
<P>The Navajo Nation extends into the states of Utah, Arizona and New Mexico
covering over 27,000 square miles of unparalleled beauty.  The Navajo
Reservation is peppered with twelve lakes and ponds and is home to more than a
dozen national monuments, tribal parks, and historical sites.  Lake Powell alone
boasts of some 186 miles of waterfront and 2,000 miles of shoreline. 
</P>
<P>You can step back in time and see how the ancient ones - the Anasazi people
- who lived here thousands of years ago.  The Navajo Nation has an array of
ancient ruins including the world renown Navajo National Monument and the
tranquil Chaco Culture National Historical Park.  From the towering cliffs of
Monument Valley to the sparkling glints of Wheatfields Lake in the Lukachukai
Mountains, this is a land of great contrasts. 
</P>
<P>Embracing this diversity, Navajos relate to the land as their mother.  The
Navajo or Dineh, believe they're an extension of Mother Earth, and thus are also
a part of her beauty.  Because of this belief, the Dineh treat the land with
utmost respect. 
</P>
<P><A HREF="./images/jewelry2.jpg"><IMG
ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="./images/jewelry1.jpg" ALT="Navajo Jewelry & Rug"></A></P>
<P>Today, the Navajo Nation is striving to sustain a viable economy for an ever
-increasing population of about 200,000 while nurturing its cultural heritage. 
Accordingly, the Navajo Nation offers a spectrum of cultural events throughout
the year, including traditional song and dance contests and intertribal pow
wows. 
</P>
<P>The Navajo Nation is moving ahead and maintaining a strong economy while
still holding onto its cultural heritage.  The key to creating this delicate
balance involves the paramount use of the Navajo language, which is still cited
exclusively in Navajo prayers, songs and religious ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>Many worldwide visitors are intrigued and mystified with the Navajo language
as were the enemy during World War II.  Unknown to many, the Navajo language was
used to create a secret code to baffle the Japanese.  Navajo men were selected
to learn secret codes and serve on the front line to overcome and decipher the
enemy.  Today, these men are recognized as the fame Navajo Code Talkers, which
exemplifies the unsurpassed Navajo bravery and unequaled patriotism of the
Navajo people. 
</P>
<P><A HREF="./images/desert2.jpg"><IMG
ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="./images/desert1.jpg" ALT="Monument Valley Desert Scenery"></A></P>
<P>Scarcely anything depict American Indians more eloquently than their love
for dancing, singing and rodeoing.  The Navajo Nation is home to the &quot;Worlds
Largest American Indian Fair&quot; - the Navajo Nation Fair, among other
celebrations.  Visit Navajoland during our many fall fairs and other cultural
events to see top Indian talent and a panorama of Indian nations.  To assure
adequate accommodations for any of these events or to simply experience our
cultural wonders, come and explore the Navajo Nation, and may you walk in
beauty.

Bowhead provides a full complement of marine transportation solutions including Common Carriage, Contract and Charter services.<BR><BR>Direct through cargo service from the Lower 48 to Western Alaska and the North Slope is a mainstay of our business and has been offered each and every summer since 1982.<BR><BR>At Bowhead, remote site service is a specialty.  With the acquisition of the shallow draft tug SADIE and the 180 foot lighterage barge QAYAQ 1, Bowhead is able to provide service to locations unnavigable by deeper draft tow boats and barges.  Cargo loaded to larger line haul barges in Seattle can be lightered off directly to the beach in those areas that are not equipped with docks or terminals.<BR><IMG
ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="./images/workmen.jpg" VSPACE="5" HSPACE="20"><BR>The QAYAQ 1 barge is equipped with a 70 ton crane to handle ramps and over-length cargo as well as a full complement of all terrain articulating forklifts capable of handling up to 35,000 pounds.  Our seasoned crew are experts in their field, each with more than 15 years experience in cargo handling in the Arctic and nearly every other village on the coast of Alaska.  We take pride in our ability to complete virtually any job - even under the most adverse conditions.</P><P>A Minority Business Enterprise, Bowhead also operates in and around Washington's Puget Sound.  In addition to our own equipment, our affiliated partners provide access to vessels up to 4000 HP and barges to 330 feet allowing us to complete projects anywhere within the Pacific Rim and Alaska.</P><P><BR>SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS<BR><BR>Call us today to find out how Bowhead can help solve your marine transportation needs, we know the Arctic - and  a whole lot more.<BR><IMG

southern Florida. The i. laponki. are the Mikasuki speakers of the Seminoles who
have adapted to a constantly changing environment by learning various unusual
trades in order to remain independent of public assistance handed out by the
United States government. Their resentment of the U.S. government developed as a
result of  wars of removal which reduced their population from about 6000 to two
hundred people.</P>
<P>After these wars, the i. laponki. wanted to be left alone in their home in
the Florida Everglades. Living  off the lush plant and animal life found in the
Everglades, they traded such items as alligator hides, furs, and bird plums with
traders for necessary goods.</P>
<P>In time, the invading outside community changed the lives of the i. laponki.
In spite of these changes, the adaptable i. laponki found ways to modify their
lives in order to survive and prosper. After the eastern Everglades were drained
and the i. laponki. were no longer able to live off the land, they prospered by
entertaining the growing number of tourists visiting Florida with alligator
wrestling shows and selling patchwork clothing to the curious audience. Headsmen
who negotiated with the attraction owners were the communication link between
the i. laponki and the press. This connection kept the i. laponki. headsmen
informed of political events which might affect their people.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD

spiritual life in the community. These matriarchs traveled with their families
no matter where the tourist attractions ked them.</P>
<P>Disturbed that some i. laponki. preferred the independence of working in the
tourist attractions business to government assistance on the reservation, the
U.S. government sponsored surveys that condemned these people as being degrading
and bad. This bad press and the lure of increased government aid, found more and
more i. laponki. accepting the security the reservations offered, Unfortunately,
even on the reservation, the nativistic i. laponki. isolated themselves from the
Seminoles and Creeks who were influenced by different Christian missionaries.</P>
<P>Today, the i. laponki are still surviving both on and off the reservation.
Tourists can still see the i. laponki. wrestling alligators and selling their
crafts in Florida. Those on the reservation have chosen different occupations to
improve their lives.</P>

<B>Jack Kemp Returns!</B>
<P>
After taking a leave of absence to campaign as Bob Dole's vice-presidential running-mate,  
Empower America co-director Jack Kemp is now back with us.  Stay tuned to this site to see 
what ideas he will be putting on the table in the near future.
<P>
<B>Body Count</B>
<P>
Empower America co-director William J. Bennett has recently released his newest book, Body 
Count, which he co-authored with Professor John DiIulio and John Walters.   The book takes a 
look at the problem of crime in America, especially the prospect of a rising wave in violent 
crimes committed by juveniles.
<P>
<B>Issues</B>
<P>
We are currently improving our web site by creating an archive of various documents produced 
by Empower America.  The archive will be categorized by issue.  Several such issues are already 
up and running.  Click on the issues link in the left margin to see a list of choices.
<P>
<B>New Empower America Study</B>
<P>
On November 7, Empower America held a press conference on Capitol Hill to release a new 
study, In Defense of A Nation, on the contributions of immigrants to the U.S. military.  Look for 
a full text copy of the report to be up on this site soon.  In the meantime, check out what 
Empower America has had to say about immigration in the past.
<P>
<B>Press Conference</B>
<P>
Empower America co-directors Lamar Alexander, William J. Bennett, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin 
Weber, and Empower America board member Donald Rumsfeld were all assembled for a press 
conference on November 13th. See excerpts from their remarks on the future of conservatism in 
America.

<i>A regular tip sheet faxed free of charge to news and talk radio coast-to-coast</i><br>
<H3>A MESSAGE TO HOLLYWOOD: <i>Sleaze Doesnt Sell</i></H3></center>
<p>
<ul>
<li>In the absence of strong families, good schools and faithful churches and 
by the power of their own appeal, movies have become an increasingly 
dominant force on our social landscape.
<li>The real and most important power of film is its capacity to alter moral 
sensibilities, and to mold dispositions, outlooks, and habits of the mind 
and heart. The consistent bombardment of gratuitous violence, sexual 
innuendo, profanity, and degradation from popular movies eventually 
shapes, alters, and colors our sensibility.
<li>Despite the significant number of films in the category of <i>Showgirls, 
Striptease, Pulp Fiction</i>, and <i>Natural Born Killers</i> we have seen a 
resurgence in movies that promote traditional moral values such as: <br>
<center>Honor -- <i>Braveheart</i><br>
Courage -- <i>Apollo 13</i><br>
Patriotism -- <i>Independence Day</i><br>
Faithfulness -- <i>Forest Gump</i><br>
Perseverance -- <i>Babe</i><p></center>

<li>In fact, seven of the ten top-grossing movies of 1995 had ratings of G, 
PG, or PG-13 and all of the ten top-grossing movies of all-time had 
ratings of G, PG or PG-13 and are considered family oriented.

<li>These numbers indicate progress can and has been made through moral 
suasion and market forces, not government intervention. Empower 
America intends to keep making the case that civilization needs cultural 
guardrails and certain reliable standards of right and wrong that may not 
be enforceable in law but must be enforceable through conscience and 
consensus.
</ul>
<p>
<i>Empower America</i>, led by Jack Kemp, William Bennett, Lamar 
Alexander, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and Vin Weber is Americas leading grass-
roots conservative advocacy organization.

<Title>Clean Movies: Cleaned Up at the Box Office in 1995</Title>
<Body BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">
<p>
<img src="/empower/easmall.gif">
<p>
<blockquote>
<center><H2>Clean Movies: Cleaned Up at the <br>Box Office in 1995</H2>
<H3>Some see sleaze doesn't sell' trend</H3>
by Joyce Price, <i>The Washington Times</i></center>
<p>
Seven of the 10 top-grossing movies of 1995 had ratings of G, PG or PG-13, indicating they were family oriented.
<p>
"For half [or more] of the films [that grossed the most sales] to qualify 
for more general audiences is pretty encouraging, said James Wall, editor 
of the Christian Century, a historic mainline Protestant journal.
<p>
"The box-office results are a good indication that audiences are looking 
for more peaceful experiences in the theater and that they respond to 
worthwhile films," added Mr. Wall, who has testified on movie content at 
congressional hearings.
<p>
Only three films near the bottom of the top 10 were rated R, meaning 
children under 17 had to be accompanied by an adult to see those 
pictures.
<p>
No films with the NC-17 rating, meaning children under 17 are not 
admitted, were among the top 10 this year, according to Exhibitor 
Relations Co. Inc., a California entertainment research organization that 
tracks such information.
<p>
"This shows that, for now at least, sleaze doesn't sell and that, over time, 
the movie industry is moving toward general audiences, said Doug 
Besharov, a research scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.
<p>
Michael Medved, chief film critic for the New York Post and co-host of 
"Sneak Previews," which airs on 244 Public Broadcasting Service 
stations nationwide, put it this way: "Sixty percent of all movies that are 
released are Rated, yet only 30 percent of films in the top 10 and zero 
percent in the top six are R-rated . . . Samuel Goldwyn once said it's 
better to sell four tickets than two. That's common sense that the movie 
industry" is just now beginning to recognize.
<p>
Mr. Medved said the latest top 10 offers more evidence that a PG-13 is 
an easier rating to sell tickets on than R."
<p>
PG-13 means special guidance is cautioned because material may be 
inappropriate for ages 13 and under; PG means parental guidance is 
suggested; and G, for general audience, means all ages are admitted.
<p>
Jack J. Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America, 
argues that movie grosses in 1995 rose or fell on the basis of a film's 
"entertainment value, not its rating and whether it was or was not a 
family film.
<p>
He said there was no shortage of family films produced this year, but 
there was a "shortage of family audiences." He noted there were "10 to 12 
family films released this year that failed miserably at the box office."
<p>
One of those, he said, was "The Little Princess," which he described as a 
"wonderful, tremendous film" that few went to see. "The Little Princess" 
is about a young girl whose father, a distinguished British gentleman, 
goes off to battle in World War I. The child is enrolled in a private girls' 
academy in New York, where she suffers mistreatment by an abusive 
headmistress.
<P>
"The kind of films people claim they want in the marketplace, they don't 
patronize . . . this constant reference to wanting family films is 
hypocrisy," Mr. Valenti said in an interview.
<P>
The NC-17-rated film "Showgirls" was a box-office flop not because of 
its nudity and sex, Mr. Valenti said, but because it was a "mediocre film 
to begin with" and "the word got out it wasn't a very good movie." 
"Showgirls" depicted the struggles of an ex-prostitute who becomes a Las 
Vegas lap dancer and aspires to be a highly paid stripper.
<P>
Not everyone concerned about the content and quality of movie fare sees 
cause to celebrate this year's list of the biggest grossers.
<P>
Said Ted Baehr, chairman of the Atlanta-based Christian Film and 
Television Commission; which each year makes a thorough analysis of 
hundreds of films in a report to Hollywood":
<P>
"Last year, 60 percent of the top 10 grossing films met our moral criteria. 
This year, it will be 40 percent with the list as it now exists. In other 
words, we've slipped . . . it's been a lousy year for movies."
<P>
Movies in last year's top 10 included The Lion King, rated G, and 
"Forrest Gump," rated PG-13, which both have grossed more than $310 
million. Batman Forever, this year's biggest box office smash, has 
grossed $184 million to date.
<P>
Mr. Baehr said Hollywood was clearly aiming at children" when it 
produced films such as "Batman Forever," "Ace Ventura: When Nature 
Calls" (No. 5) and "Casper" (No. 6). But he does not view those pictures 
as true family entertainment and describes "Ace, "Casper, and 
"Waterworld" (No. 9) as "irresponsible."
<P>
Of Jim Carrey's latest "Ace Ventura detective comedy, Mr. Baehr said: 
We do not consider it to be a moral movie. It's racist and 
promasturbation, pro-sex and probuggery."
<P>
In Ace Ventura II: When Nature Calls, Mr. Carrey goes to Africa in 
search of a great white bat. There he encounters a tribe whose members 
spit or release other bodily fluids on people to show their appreciation.
<P>
"It's clear Hollywood knows it has to broaden" its horizons and make 
more films that will attract youngsters, he said. But many of these films 
feature "covert immorality" and take "philosophical positions most 
conservatives cant accept."
<P>
Mr. Baehr charged that the movie industry is "cutting back on [true] 
family films."
<P>
If they make this a trend, they can anticipate a drop in attendance, he 
said. He added this is already being reflected in the smaller revenues that 
have been generated by this year's top 10 compared with last year's.
<P>
"People want films you can take the family to, Mr. Baehr said.
<P>
Mr. Valenti denied there is a conspiracy afoot in the movie industry, as 
Mr. Baehr suggests. "Eighty to 85 percent of all films made in Hollywood 
are put together by independent producers, who are fiercely competitive, 
he said.
<P>
John Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., agreed. "These 
things go in cycles. Certainly, there is no premeditated plan to make a lot 
of kids pictures, he said.
<P>
As for the films that grossed the most this year, he said, "I don't think 
you'd call 'Batman Forever' a family picture. And 'Ace Ventura' is a little 
gross. There are some questionable scenes."
<P>
Mr. Wall offered this assessment of Batman Forever": "It's a rather dark 
film, but I don't object to it very strongly. 'Apollo 13' [No. 2] was well 
done, one of the finest inspirational films for people of all ages."
<P>
Those interviewed had little enthusiasm for the movie Pocahantas. Mr. 
Wall called it "adequate," while Mr. Baehr labeled it New Age" and 
"annoying."
<P>
Mr. Medved said he "didn't like the film's political correctness."

<blockquote>
<P>
(Washington D.C., October 30, 1996) -- Empower America's Chief Economist, Lawrence A. 
Hunter released the following statement on the state of the American economy in response to 
today's report on third-quarter growth in gross domestic product (GDP):
<P>
"Is the economy better off today than it was four years ago?  Clearly not.  Today, the Commerce 
Department reported that the economy was growing at a paltry 2.2 percent annual rate in the 
third quarter after correcting for inflation.  Four years ago at this time, the economy was growing 
at a respectable 3 percent.  And, in the fourth quarter of 1992, real, inflation-adjusted economic 
growth leapt forward at 4.3 percent.  One must look long and hard for any economist who 
expects the economy to grow faster than 2.5 percent in the upcoming fourth quarter.
<P>
"This pessimistic assessment of the economy is reinforced by a report on declining wages issued 
earlier this week by the Congressional Joint Economic Committee (JEC).  The JEC report, which 
is based on a release of data by the nonpartisan Bureau of Labor Statistic (BLS), points out that 
inflation-adjusted ("real") median weekly earnings declined between the third quarters of 1995 
and 1996.  The current level of real median weekly earnings is below their level four years ago of 
$493 in the third quarter of 1992.
<P>
"Best economy in 30 years?  Hardly.  The truth is, we are experiencing the slowest economic 
expansion in more than 100 years."
<P>

<center><h2>Empower America's Chief Economist Warns,</h2>
<h3>Todays' GDP Numbers are a "Statistical Blip"</h3></center><p>
(Washington D.C., August 1, 1996) -- We shouldn't pop the corks on the champagne quite yet over today's reported 4.2 percent second quarter increase in GDP.  The fizz will quickly go out of these numbers as American workers realize that they do not mean an end to the treadmill economy we have been experiencing since the end of the 1980's<p>
<i>Empower America's</i> Chief Economist Lawrence Hunter said, "The American people, to whom GDP statistics are a mere abstraction, will take little solace in this report because this statistical blip in the GDP numbers is not translating into rising real wages.  During the same time period covered by this GDP report, second quarter 1996, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that usual weekly earnings of workers are at their lowest level in three years."<p>
Even before today's report was made public, Federal Reserve Board Chairman, Alan Greenspan, made it clear that the expected strong second quarter report was an aberration, both by his words and by the Fed's deeds.  Greenspan said he fully expected economic growth to fall back to its more typical anemic norm of  two-something expansion in the second half of the year.  Confirmation that the Fed does not take the second quarter blip seriously comes from the fact that it has refrained from raising interest rates as one would expect if the central bank were taking this aberrant report as indicative that the economy was anywhere near this strong.<p>
"Today's report also is consistent with the expectation that this preliminary 4.2 percent increase may well be revised downward in the months to come.  First quarter GDP, which originally was reported to have increased 2.8 percent, was revised downward by almost one third in today's report, to 2.0 percent," Hunter said.<p>

<center><h2>BENNETT CRITICIZES McCURRY<br> 
AND WHITE HOUSE DRUG POLICY </center></h2>

<hr size=3 width=50%>
<p><i>July 18, 1996, Washington, D.C.</i><p>
  Today, Empower America co-director and former Bush "drug czar" William J. Bennett released the following statement:
<p>
"Yesterday we learned from interviews with Secret Service agents (released by a House committee) that background investigations on White House employees found that more than 40 had used drugs; a few dozen showed drug usage had been within the last five years; and that among those few dozen people were individuals who had used cocaine, crack cocaine and hallucinogens.  We learned, too, that the Secret Service initially rejected White House passes to an unspecified number of White House employees because they were considered a security risk -- a recommendation which apparently was unacceptable to the Clinton administration.  Instead, the administration opted for a far more lenient policy -- a twice-per-year surprise drug test.  These are very disturbing revelations -- but ones which do not seem to trouble the Clinton administration at all.
<p>
I have also read the transcripts of Mike McCurry's July 17th press briefing in which he stated that "of course" he used illegal drugs during the 1970s.  What exactly did Mr. McCurry mean by "of course"?  That every young person used drugs in the 1970s?  Or that it was no big deal?  Why didn't Mr. McCurry show any regret for having used illegal drugs?  Mr. McCurry is wrong on all counts -- and he should admit that he was wrong.        
<p>
These revelations by Secret Service agents, combined with Mr. McCurry's comments are, I think, emblematic of the Clinton administration's cavalier and indifferent attitude toward illegal drug use.  The Clinton administration doesn't seem to care about this issue.  They seem unwilling to take a strong and unambiguous stand against drug use.  And this nation is now paying a very heavy price for the Clinton administration's indifference, in terms of wrecked and lost lives.      
<p>
Mr. McCurry's comments are of course not helpful.  But neither are they surprising.  After all, President Clinton's record on fighting illegal drug use is abysmal.  It is worth pointing out that this is not a partisan opinion.  Democratic Senator Joe Biden has been a strong critic of the administration's anti-drug efforts.  And it was Democratic Congressman Charles Rangel who said this about the Clinton administration:  "I've been in Congress over two decades, and I have never, never, never found any administration that's been so silent on this great challenge [illegal drug use] to the American people."
<p>
Consider the record under Bill Clinton's watch: drug use among high school seniors has risen steadily since he took office.  The number of 12- to 17-year-olds using marijuana has almost doubled.  Methamphetamine emergency room cases are up over 300 percent.  LSD use has reached the highest rate since record-keeping started in 1975.  Drug-related emergency room admissions are at record levels.  And these trends have occurred after real progress was made against drug use in the mid-1980s and early 1990s.    
<p>
But there is more involved here than a failure of public policy.  The Clinton administration suffers from moral diffidence on this issue.  Policy follows attitude.  In 1991, when asked about his past drug use, Mr. Clinton declared that he had never "broken any drug law."  A year later, he admitted that when he was in England, he had experimented with marijuana but he said, "I didn't like it.  I didn't inhale it, and never tried it again."  Later, when asked whether he would inhale if he had to do it over again, he answered, to laughter: "Sure, if I could.  I tried before."  
<p>
Then there is President Clinton's former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, who had been one of this administration's most vocal voices on drugs and who had favorable words about drug legalization.  And of course now we have Mr. McCurry's comments. 
<p>
During the 1980s, Nancy Reagan was ridiculed for her "Just Say No" campaign.  But it turns out that "Just Say No" is far more effective than "I didn't inhale" or an attitude of "of course I used illegal drugs."
<p>
I realize that Mr. McCurry, a skilled press secretary, was simply reflecting the attitude of the President and his administration.  But I would be interested in the answer to two questions:  first, what does General Barry McCaffrey think about Mr. McCurry's comments and the underlying attitude they expressed?  And second, does President Clinton have any objection if a person who has used cocaine, crack cocaine or hallucinogenic drugs during the past five years is working in his administration?  Is there any kind of recent (pre-White House) drug use or drug activity that would disqualify somebody from joining the Clinton administration?  Perhaps the president could clarify what his policy is on these matters.       

<p>
On the issue of fighting illegal drugs -- like so many other issues of national importance -- the American people deserve better from their president."

<P>





<i>May 6, 1996, Washington, D.C. </i>
<p>On behalf of the Board of Directors, Empower America Co-Directors William J. Bennett, Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and Vin Weber today officially announced the appointment of Thomas W. Weisel as Chairman of the Board and Tex Lezar as President and Chief Executive Officer.  Weisel has served as acting Chairman since the Fall of 1995. 
<p>
Weisel is founder, Chairman, and CEO of Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, one of the nation's leading securities firms.  Under Weisel's leadership, Montgomery's annual revenues have grown over the last 25 years to exceed $500 million.  Weisel holds five National Master's titles in cycling and served in the past as Chairman of U.S. Skiing, the governing body of the U.S. Ski Team.
<p>
Jack Kemp called Weisel, who specializes in taking smaller "growth" companies public, "the embodiment of the American dream."  Kemp went on, "Thom has demonstrated in his professional life that entrepreneurial capitalism works.  He has spent his life pushing entrepreneurs toward success.  His real-world insight and world-class fundraising capabilities will continue to be of tremendous benefit to Empower America."
<p>
William Bennett said, "Thom Weisel is wonderfully accomplished in a whole range of pursuits.  His tenure with us has brought needed stability and energy to Empower America."  
<p>
Empower America's new President and CEO, Tex Lezar, comes to the organization from Dallas, Texas, where he is engaged in private law practice.  Lezar, who served as Assistant U.S. Attorney General under President Reagan and edited Making Government Work: A Conservative Agenda for the States, has been a prominent litigator and appellate lawyer in Texas since 1977.  In 1994, Lezar was the Republican nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Texas.  
<p>
Bennett, Kemp, Kirkpatrick, and Weber jointly said, "Tex Lezar comes from the school of Ronald Reagan and adheres to its credo -- an optimistic faith in freedom, democratic capitalism, strong national defense, and time-honored values.  He has a sound knowledge of public policy and politics, and brings to Empower America the fruits of an impressive career in government, law, and politics.  We are very pleased to have Tex aboard."
<p>
Former Empower America Board Chairman Steve Forbes will remain an active member of the Board.  Forbes said of Empower America's new leadership, "I am glad to see Empower America in the capable hands of Thom Weisel and Tex Lezar.  I look forward to working closely with both of them as an Empower America Board member."  William Dal Col, Empower America's former president, will be working with Forbes while continuing informally to advise Empower America. 
<p>
Under the leadership of Weisel and Lezar, as well as the Co-Directors, Empower America plans a very aggressive, focused policy agenda for the remainder of 1996.  
<p>
<UL>
<LI>On the economic front, Empower America will expand its efforts to promote a dynamic, pro-growth, pro-family, single-rate tax system based on the recommendations of the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform, which Jack Kemp chaired for Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich.  Additionally, Empower America will promote a plan gradually and responsibly to privatize our Social Security system, while honoring our obligation to those who have paid into the system and must be protected. <p>
<LI>Empower America is strongly supporting an urban renaissance agenda focusing on legislation proposed by members of Congress such as Senator Lieberman of Connecticut, Senator Abraham of Michigan, Senator Mack of Florida, Representative J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, and Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton of Washington D.C.<p>
<LI>Empower America will continue to make the broader argument for the need to restore decency and civility to American life.  It will continue its ongoing campaign in the area of popular culture, including the content of television and music.  It will also continue to address the issues of crime, drugs, educational choice, and adoption.  In addition, Empower America will begin systematically to address issues dealing with judicial activism and legal reform.
<p>
<LI>In international affairs, Empower America will continue its advocacy of an American foreign policy based on U.S. national interests and which reflects the need for the U.S. to exercise effective and prudent international leadership.  The support for the expansion and consolidation of new democracies, the restoration of an honest and sound money policy for America and the world, and furtherance of free- and open- global trade arrangements are of principal concern.  Empower America supports a strong national security posture and the development and deployment of a national missile defense system.

<center><h3>EMPOWER AMERICA'S WILLIAM BENNETT AND JACK KEMP
&quot;CORRECT THE RECORD&quot; WITH NEW STUDY ON LEGAL IMMIGRATION</h3></center>

<center><h4><i>Kemp and Bennett call assertions made in the GOP Presidential 
primarie regarding the impact of legal immigration &quot;naive, 
short-sighted, and now -- factually incorrect.&quot;</i></center></h4>
<P><hr size=3 width=50%>
<P>

(Washington, DC; February 28, 1996)  Empower America co-directors William J. 
Bennett and Jack Kemp released a study today which refutes many recent 
assertions against legal immigration policy in America.  The study comes as 
immigration is becoming an increasingly contentious issue in the race for the 
GOP presidential nomination.  Bennett and Kemp said, &quot;Certainly we must put 
an end to illegal immigration.  But that message cannot be mixed up with our 
view toward legal immigration, which has been, and continues to be, a net gain 
<tt></tt>for America.&quot;<p>

Through research conducted over a period of many months, visits to high 
technology companies, background interviews with government officials, and 
never before presented data, researcher Stuart Anderson has found, &quot;The entry of 
foreign-born engineers, scientists, and other highly skilled individuals provides 
extraordinary benefits to the United States and should be facilitated, rather than 
indered, by new restrictions.&quot;<p>

The Senate Judiciary Committee is considering legislation by Senator Alan 
Simpson (R-WY) to sharply restrict American companies' ability to hire foreign-
born skilled employees.  Moreover, in March, the U.S. House of Representatives 
will vote on the largest reduction in legal immigration in nearly 70 years.  Said 
Bennett and Kemp, &quot;The study gives evidence that both measures are ill-
conceived and ultimately counterproductive.&quot;<p>


Among the study's key findings:
<ul>
<li>	There is no evidence that foreign-born scientists and engineers increase 
unemployment or undercut the wages of the native-born.<p>

<li>	There is no evidence that employment-based immigration weakens 
companies' commitment to U.S. education or to training for their workforce.  
American companies annually donate $2.5 billion to schools and colleges, and 
spend $210 billion annually on workforce training.<p>

<li>	Key employees and even founders of high tech companies enter the country 
as refugees and family-sponsored immigrants, as well as employment-based 
immigrants.<p>

<li> 	The study concludes, &quot;New restrictions on employment-based visas -- and 
immigration more generally -- will drive more companies to locate research 
and development offshore ... and will lead to less innovation, a less dynamic 
economy, and fewer jobs produced in the cutting edge industries of 
tomorrow.&quot;<p>
</ul>
Jack Kemp said, &quot;We have got to understand that we are getting some of the best 
and brightest minds from all over the world to invest their talents in America's 
economy.  We are becoming more competitive and more prosperous and, as the 
study shows, we aren't displacing or devaluing American workers in the 
process.&quot<p>  

William Bennett added, &quot;We have seen too much anti-immigration rhetoric in 
our public discourse and in our Republican-led Congress -- and unfortunately, it 
has become a centerpiece of Pat Buchanan's presidential campaign.  It's time to 
remind Americans -- and the Republican Party especially -- that legal 
immigration helps, not hurts, America.  While there is no question that American 
society has experienced serious moral decay over the last thirty years, pinning 
the blame on immigrants for our problems is a dodge and distraction.  And it 
happens to be entirely wrong.  One can make a strong argument that many new 
immigrants have been corrupted by those degraded aspects of our culture, not 
causes of it.&quot;<p>

</h3><P>October 27, 1995</center><P>Contact: Christian Pinkston, (202) 452-8200, x223<P><hr size=3 width=50%><P>Washington D.C.--Empower America co-director <a href="/empower/kemp.html">Jack Kemp</a> today congratulated House and Senate Republicans on their historic achievement in passing budget plans that will reduce the burden of government in the lives of the nation's citizens and improve incentives for savings, investment and families.  Kemp urged congressional leaders to move quickly on a House-Senate package that strengthens these incentives and called on them to seek an accord with the Clinton administration.  Such an agreement, he emphasized, can be accomplished without compromising the integrity of the plan's objectives.
 <p>
"Newt Gingrich, Bob Dole and the entire Republican congressional leadership deserve great credit for their masterful job in bringing off this achievement," Kemp said.  "But none of this will matter unless Congress and the White House can find a way to resolve their differences.  This legislation is too important to the nation to be sacrificed in a fit of partisan acrimony and bickering.
                                                                                             <P>
"I would hope that Republicans in Congress and the Democratic Administration recognize that both have a lot at stake in reaching a successful conclusion.  Each should carefully evaluate options that are available.  For example, if the final package has the right mix of incentives, including a substantial capital gains tax cut with inflation indexing, there is no reason the American economy should not experience substantially higher growth with lower inflation.  In that case, the Administration's economic assumptions, though more optimistic than those of Congress, are within the range of consensus forecasts and would be entirely plausible.  The higher growth projections would mean substantially increased revenue estimates, easing the path to budget balance.
<P>
"At the same time, I would urge my former colleagues to tread very carefully before reducing the inflation adjustment for federal benefits and income tax liability.  Several economists have testified to Congress suggesting that the consumer price index overstates inflation.  However, others contend that the CPI has substantially under reported inflation over the past two decades.  It would be unconscionable to require sacrifice from the nation's retirees and taxpayers on the basis of a theoretical economic argument that has yet to be resolved.
<P>
"I would also add that, in my opinion, it is imperative that Congress go all the way toward fundamental change by following up this legislation with approval of the Abraham-Lieberman enterprise zone act. While I applaud the reconciliation bill for cutting taxes for working families and businesses, I believe there is one essential ingredient missing:  a provision to create jobs and opportunity for people who live in America's economically-distressed urban and rural communities.  The Abraham-Lieberman "Enhanced Enterprise Zones Act of 1995" would accomplish this goal by providing tax incentives to work, save, and invest in the over 100 urban and rural pockets of poverty across this Nation.  This legislation is the type of affirmative "effort" for which our party has been known for throughout history--from Lincoln to Reagan.  Furthermore, Republican-led efforts to combat the plight of poverty and unemployment in our inner-cities would begin the needed process of racial and ethnic reconciliation and give hope and opportunity to all people."    <P>

WASHINGTON, DC -- With a warning that trashy daytime talk-shows on television are debasing our aulture and harming America's children, <a href="/empower/bennett.html">William J. Bennett</a> and Senator Joe Lieberman today launched a campaign to rid the airwaves of <a href="/empower/pr1026c.html">sordid programs</a>.  Bennett, co-director of Empower America, and Lieberman, Democrat from Connecticut, say they will work together and with other concerned citizens to put pressure on those who produce and own daytime television talk shows to get rid of the licentious material that characterizes many of such programs today. To illustrate their point about the condition of daytime television talk shows, Bennett and Lieberman aired a series of clips culled only from shows that aired Monday and Tuesday of this week.
<P>Bennett and Lieberman are not calling for legislation or any govemment censorship of daytime television talk shows. They are calling on the producers and owners of the programs to recognize their responsibility to Amencan society and children by setting higher standards for the programs' content. They are also calling on parents to exercise their respons bllity to simply turn the programs off. Bennett and Lieberman said that hundreds of thousands of young children, and up to a million or more teenagers watch daytime television talk shows on a daily basis.
<P><a href="pr1026a.html">Bennett</a> and <a href="pr1026b.html">Lieberman</a> said the number of trashy talk shows has increased in recent
months, while the behavior exhibited on the shows has sharply declined. They argue that
exposing children, teenagers and even adults to hours of such programming on a daily basis has, over time, a deteriorating effect on the civility of American society, and becomes one                                                                   
more contributing factor to the host of serious problems facing our country today.

	<i>Announcing A Public Campaign Against
	Select Day-Time Television Talk Shows</i><P>
	October 26, 1995<P><hr width="35%"></center><P>


First, I want to express my thanks to Senator Joe Lieberman.  Senator Lieberman is the father of this idea.  It was his suggestion that we continue to bring pressure -- public pressure -- on the perpetrators of cultural rot by calling attention to these shows.
<P>
Earlier this year, <a href="/empower/pr1026b.html">Senator Lieberman</a> joined <a href="/empower/pr1026d.html">C. DeLores Tucker</a> of the National Political Congress of Black Women and me in our campaign to urge Time Warner to sell their stake in Interscope Records, Inc.  Today, we turn our attention to television.  Now these days there is a lot of criticism directed at television -- the casual cruelty, the rampant promiscuity, the mindlessness of sit-coms and soap operas.  Most of the criticisms are justified.  But this is not the worst of it.  The worst of television is the day-time television talk shows we have identified.  In these shows, indecent exposure is celebrated as a virtue.  
<P>
It is hard to remember now, but there was once a time when personal or marital failure, subliminal desires, and perverse taste were accompanied by guilt or embarrassment.  But today, these conditions are a ticket to appear as a guest on the Sally Jessy Raphael show, the Ricki Lake show, the Jerry Springer show, or one of the dozen or so like them.
<P>
I asked my staff to provide me with a list of some of the shows of some recent day-time talk-show topics.  The list included "A Mother Who Ran Off with Her Daughter's Fiance," "Women Who Marry Their Rapists," "I'm Marrying a 14-year old Boy," a woman who claims she got pregnant while making a pornographic movie; a 13-year-old guest who was urged to share her sexual experiences which began when she was 10; a woman eight months pregnant who boasted of having eight sexual partners during her first two trimesters; a 17-year-old girl who boasted of having slept with over a hundred men -- well, you get the idea.    
It is important here to point out who we are not talking about.  We are not talking about shows like Oprah, or Regis and Kathie Lee.  The shows which are the object of our criticisms are not close calls; they go way over the line of decency.  They are at the bottom of the television barrel.  Instead of simply lamenting the state of our popular culture, we think it's a good idea to try and do something about it.  So here we are.    
<P>
Our objectives are these: to raise a hue and cry across the land; to cast some light on what's being produced and distributed -- "Sunlight is the best disinfectant," Justice Brandeis once wrote; and to petition men and women of good will -- producers, sponsors, advertisers, and viewers -- to rethink their support and sponsorship, participation and promotion of these programs.
<P>
What exactly is the harm being done by these programs?  In his "Letter from Birmingham City Jail," Martin Luther King, Jr. instructed us that that which "uplifts human personality" is just and that which "degrades human personality" is unjust.  Can anybody doubt that these shows degrade human personality?  Do the sponsors think not?  If so, why not?  
<P>
Let me try and put this campaign in a broader context of the state of our popular culture, our country, and our civilization.  What is happening today is the pollution of the human environment, a kind of tropism toward the sordid.  This nation desperately needs more opportunities for moral uplift.  We believe that progress can be made through moral suasion and justifiable public discontent.  
<P>
In a fundamental way, that is what this effort and efforts like it are all about.  So today we declare ourselves to be part of a Resistance, a Resistance Operation to the giant popular culture sleaze machine.  We welcome more volunteers to our ranks.      
<P>
Let me conclude with a personal note.  Joe Lieberman is a Jew.  I am a Catholic.  Like most Americans, we believe in God; we both believe men and women are His creation, made in His image.  And so we believe that men and women should not be celebrated when they debase themselves.  Finally, what we are talking about is human dignity, the dignity of God's greatest creation -- and whether or not we still believe in it.

When I joined with <a href="/empower/pr1026a.html">Bill Bennett</a> and <a href="/empower/pr1026.html">Delores Tucker</a> to speak out against the vile rap music that Time Warner was helping to produce, I was trying to give voice to the thousands of people I represent in Connecticut who are angry about the degradation of our culture and <a href="/empower/pr1026c.html"> the messages</a> the media is sending to our children.
<P>
The people I talk to in Connecticut are part of a revolution that is beginning throughout the country, <i>a movement that might be called the revolt of the revolted</I>. A growing number of Americans are sickened by the morass of sex, vulgarity and violence that increasingly dominates our electronic media; and they are disgusted by what they see as the entertainment industry's abandonment of basic standards of decency, as if anything goes. The result is <i>an increasingily debased culture that rejects, rather than retlects the basic values that most Americans share</i>.
<P>
This anger is felt most deeply by parents. I can't tell you how many mothers and fathers I've talked with who <i>look at the media not as a source of information or entertainment, but as a threat to the well-being o f their children</I>. These parents feel like they are locked in a struggle with powerful forces outside of their control to 'shape their children's values, a struggle; they feel they are losing.
<P>
Bill Bennett and I are back today to focus attention on one of the worst parts of America's entertainment culture -- the daytime television talk shows. There are more than 20 nationally syndicated talk programs on the air this fall, many of which can be seen here in the Washington area, as this chart displays. Afl er watching a number of these shows, and-learning more about the behavior of their hosts and producers, <i>it is clear that talk is indeed cheap, and too often demeaning, exploitative, perverted, divisive, or, at best, amoral</i>.
<P>
Those are strong words, but it is difficult to exaggerate the willingness of some of these shows to parade any and every pathology and dysfunction into our living rooms. The nation caught a glimpse of what these shows are about last March, when a guest on the "Jenny Jones" was set up to meet a gay secret admirer, and responded by killing that admirer with a shotgun. To show you just how extreme these programs are, in a few minutes we will display a videotape showing some typical segments.
<P>
For now I would call your attention to the article from Electroriic Media that we have made available. This diary of a 20-day period during the February sweeps documents how sex saturates these programs, the more bizarre the better. Just look at some of the titles; "I Use Sex to Get What I Want"; "Sex Caught on Tape"; "Mom's Dating a Boy Toy" and "Get Bigger Breasts or Else?'.
<P>
As you will see, there's good reason why many people call these shows pornographic: during the February sweeps, viewers were treated to at least five different shows that focused heavily on porn: among them, "Rolanda" showcased porn stars reuriniting with their first loves; "Jenny Jones" had men confronting their girlfriends who want to be porn stars; and "Richard Bey" pitted "Housewives vs. Strippers."
<P>
Why should we be so concerned about the content of these shows? One of the most compelling reasons is that millions of children and voung teens are watching trashy talk TV on a daily basis. In fact, according to one report, children aged 2 to 11 comprise six percent of the national viewing audience for talk shows, which translates to 650,000 kids alone regularly watching "Ricki Lake," one of the worst offenders.
<P>
There is no real scientific evidence available yet documenting the impact these shows have on young viewers. But a number of psychologists, child development specialists and media experts have voiced serious concern about the dangers posed by these shows. The constant confrontations and emotional violence children see on talk shows teach them a perverse way to solve personal problems, and suggests to them that is the way normal adults behave. Also, because of the powerful appeal of the sexual messages being sent to young viewers, these shows have enormous potential to act as the worst kind of sex educators.
<P>
But the impact of these programs extends far beyond children. Trashy TV talk shows are wildly distorting our perceptions of what are normal and acceptable forms of behavior, adding to the alreadv overloaded cultural dictionary that is helping. in Pat Alovnihan's words. to define desiancy down. The fixation these shows have with the dysfunctional, and the way in which those pathologies are treated, is having a "destructive" effect on the nation's mental health, according to mental health professionals Jeanne Heaton and Nona Wilson, the authors of "Tuning in Trouble." The "driveby pyschology" dispensed by so-called experts and the hosts themselves serves to mislead people into believing that serious mental health problems can be cured with platitudes and the psychobabble that is so commonplace on talk TV.
<P>
The proliferation of perversion on daytime television is affecting our entire society by the example it sets, pushing the envelope of civility and morality in a wav that drags the rest of the culture down with it. It is a vicious circle, fueled by the competition among talk show hosts to be the most sensational, and one with no apparent end in sight.
<P>
We do not want to demonize any one show, to overstate their influence, or to argue that these programs are destroying America as we know it. What we do want to get across is that taken as a whole, and combined with the obscene gangsta rap music kids are listening to, the hyperviolent videogames they're playing, as well as other television shows and movies, these talk shows are surely contributing to the loss of values, and the moral decay that so many Americans are concerned about. 
<P>
Much as we did with Time Warner's involvement with Interscope records, we are launching this campaign today to impress upon the major companies who are producing the bulk of the daytime talk show the damage trash TV talk is doing, and to call on them to exercise the greater responsibility. These corporations [include] a number of communications titans, including Gannett Newspapers, Paramount, Fox, Time Warner, CBS, Columbia-TriStar Studios, and the Tribune Company.
<P>
As we have said many times before, <i>we are not calling for censorship, simply better citizenship</I>. We want to remind these producers that they are members of a larger community, to which they have certain obligations. We also want to remind them- that because of their stature and their power their decisions carry weight. They can and should do-better, and that is our appeal.
<P>                                                                                 <P>

Chair, National Political Congress of Black Women, Inc.</h2><P>
<i>October 26, 1995</i><P>
<br width=50% size=3></center><P>

I regret that a long standing engagement prevents me from joining <a href="/empower/pr1026a.html">Bill Bennett</a> and <a href="/empower/pr1026b.html">Joe Lieberman</a> this morning at this timely and necessary press conference. However, I am proud to join with them in focusing on other segments of the entertainment industry that is constantly poisoning the cultural environment of our society. <a href="/empower/pr1026c.html">Mindless television</a> shows that target young audiences are corrupting our culture and doing great harm to our children. I believe that it is time to confront the performers and companies that produce these shows. In our campaign against Time-Warner's involvement in the production and distribution of Gangsta Rap music to children we did not get results until Bill Bennett and I confronted the executives of Time-Warner. It is time now to confront those responsible for these culturally corrupt television shows.
          <P>
If we are to restore a measure of decency to the cultural mainstream of our society we must expand our efforts to the area of television. Those who produce and air these degrading and denigrating shows need to be made aware of what they are doing to the youth of America.
<P>
I look forward to working with Sen. Lieberman and Dr. Bennett and in this on-going public campaign.

<Center><i>Bennett and Lieberman petition producers to dispense with the grotesque and perverse subject
matter of some day-time television talk shows.</i></center>
<P>
(Washington D.C.; October 25, 1995) On the heels of their successful campaign against violently obscene music lyrics, Empower America co-director <a href="/empower/bennett.html">William J. Bennett</a> and Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-CT) will hold a Washington <a href="/empower/pr1026a.html">press conference</a> at 10:00am tomorrow to launch a new phase in their campaign against the cultural decomposition to which the entertainment industry is contributing. Specifically, Dr. Bennett and Sen. Lieberman will target certain day-time television talk shows which repeatedly focus on sordid subject matter, petitioning producers to acknowledge their responsibilities toward their viewers, both children and the general public, rather than just the profits they may stand to gain from them. Once again, Dr. Bennett and Sen. Lieberman are not calling for content censorship but corporate citizenship.
<P>
Daytime television talk show producers will meet this weekend in New York City for the "Talk Summit" to discuss program content.

<P></center>
<I><FONT SIZE = 2><blockquote><blockquote>Mr. Kemps remarks were delivered on November 19, 1996 at the Endowment for Democracy in Eastern Europe's Annual Dinner in New York, where he received an award named in memory of the distinguished humanitarian, Mr. Raoul Wallenberg.  Mr. Kemp was introduced by Rabbi Simcha Lyons.<BA></blockquote></blockquote></center></FONT></I>
<blockquote>
<P>
Thank you very much for this award in the name of Raoul Wallenberg, a great hero of mine.  In September of 1981 I had the honor of working with Congressman Tom Lantos to pass legislation granting honorary U.S. citizenship to this courageous "soldier of the soul."  And thank you to the Endowment for Democracy in Eastern Europe, for whose work in the causes of education and human rights -- and in so many other endeavors to promote liberty throughout the world --  I hold a profound regard.
<P>
In 1899, Emile Zola, in his famous outcry against the anti-semitism manifest in the French Army's conspiracy to convict Captain Dreyfus of treason, spoke to the inevitable triumph of truth over prejudice when he said, "truth is on the march and nothing in history can stop it."  At the time, the French people were polarized over the controversy which presented them with a moral choice between the life of one man and the reputation of the French Army.  
<P>
As America approaches the turn of the next century, we face many similar controversies -- controversies which challenge us to make a moral choice between political expediency and the inalienable right to liberty.  Fortified by the memory of our great heritage and what is occurring at breakneck speed in the world, we can now proclaim, with equal conviction: "Democracy is on the march and nothing in history can stop it."   But the task of preserving and advancing this democratic evolution will take truth-tellers, seekers of justice, men and women of honor and courage willing to act on their convictions.  
v
It will take men and women such as Raoul Wallenberg and people like you who form this great Endowment for Democracy in Eastern Europe.
<P>
 Historically, every form of government or societal structure that refused to recognize the basic human right of freedom has failed.  Whether it be the enslavement of the Israelites in Egypt, the persecution of the Christians in Rome, the oppression of the peasant class by the aristocracy in pre-revolutionary France, the lack of just representation for the American colonies by the British monarchy, the evil of slavery in pre-Civil War America, the abuse of labor in industrial England, the comprehensive manipulation and subjugation of people by the socialist systems of Eastern and Central Europe and in Asia, or the monstrous evil of apartheid in South Africa -- tyranny infallibly authors its own epitaph.   The oppressed are driven to the point of revolt.  The system collapses internally, unable to supply the hope, motivation and freedom that promotes the general welfare of a people and a nation and which responds to the Jewish and Christian ideal of freedom as an inalienable, God-given right of all people everywhere and always.
<P>
Raoul Wallenberg had the historical honor of being a victim of both Nazi and Communist tyranny.  I say an honor because this persecution is the mark of a  Godly man, of a liberal man in the classical sense.  For there is only one truth, but many lies; one charity, but many forms of envy and selfishness.  To stand up for what is good, right and true often, attracts enemies from very different directions.
<P>
The world is in a similar situation today, with democracy and freedom being attacked from different angles.
<P>
Democracy is on the march, and on the surface, appears to have unstoppable momentum.  Just yesterday, Romania celebrated the triumphal election of anti-Communist Emil Constantinescu as President -- a fact which, in Constantinescu's own words, signifies that "Romania comes back now to the great concert of a democratic Europe."  In the Freedom House survey, more than half the people of the world live in countries that are democratic or somewhat democratic.  In economic terms, the worldwide trend toward democracy is even stronger.  More than 93 percent of the world's trade  comes from democratic and partly democratic countries.  (Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, 1989 and 1996.)  As a matter of economic and industrial output, communism and dictatorship barely exist, and where their production is rising -- Vietnam, China -- it is only because regimes are falling all over themselves to "open up to the outside" and establish economic and trade liberalization.
v
But there are threats to political and economic freedom, to democracy, from without and within.  They are not as violent, purposive, or determined as the enemies Raoul Wallenberg fought, and we may thank God for it.  But they are serious and important, and if they are more corrosive than aggressive in nature, they may nevertheless poison our civilization if left unchecked.
<P>
One is the threat foreseen by Alexis de Tocqueville more than 150 years ago.  Tocqueville called this the velvet tyranny of mindless, numbing bureaucracy.  It would not outlaw religion, but it would sap the human spirit, and set up a new pseudo-religion, the worship of the state, in place of churches and synagogues.  It would not brazenly abolish private property, but it would smother property -- and, what is equally important, human initiative -- in a well-meaning but deadly array of taxes, regulations, and stipulations.
<P>
Lincoln summed up the animating spirit of Tocqueville's velvet tyranny when he described the spirit of slavery in America -- and we may regard it as chilling that the terms would have such a resemblance.  Lincoln called this the idea of "you plant the grain, you make the bread, and I'll eat it."  Lincoln went on to say that we must not rest until this "artificial weight is lifted from the shoulders of all mankind."
<P>
In the affairs of the world that Wallenberg cared so deeply about, the force of velvet tyranny is most visible, and certainly most important, in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.  On the one hand, these countries have enjoyed a miraculous transformation.  On the other hand, they have endured a decline in industrial production and gross output for which it is difficult to find a parallel.  Russian, Polish, Czech, and Hungarian output dropped by more than 50 percent in real terms over five years -- a record that puts our "Great Depression" to shame.
<P>
History teaches that this kind of economic implosion often hastens tyranny, whether it be tyranny of the far left or the far right.  The rise of Nazi Germany was preceded by the Weimar Republic's tragedy of runaway inflation in the '20s followed by democratically-elected Henrich Brunning's economics of austerity in the early '30s.  This precipitated Brunning's abolishment of the Reichstag and thus a coalition government in 1933, led by Adolph Hitler.  And Soviet Communism grew out of the state-directed industrial capitalism in Russia during the confusion of World War I.
<P>
The response of the West to today's economic threat to democracy has not been encouraging.  For more than five years, going back to the Houston Summit, the United States and the West have been presented with one of the great opportunities for creative statesmanship in human history.  Instead of seizing it, as we did under Harry Truman, General Marshall, and Western Unification, we have turned it over to the International Monetary Fund.
<P>
Today, the top Russian tax rate is close to 70 percent on income from labor, and what little money a Russian worker is left with after this is taxed through high value-added, excise, and other consumption taxes.  The same is true, by the way, in Hungary, Poland, the Ukraine, and the rest of Eastern Europe.  The tax rate on some types of labor and business activity is over 90 percent.
<P>
No wonder wages today are less than 38 percent of Russia's entire economy -- a situation which has driven one of the most talented peoples in the world underground.  Again, the pattern is nearly identical in Hungary and other countries.  (In OECD countries, wages typically account for more than 60 percent of national income.)  The people who have done some of the best reporting on the true Russian tax burden, a newsletter called Emerging Markets Watch down in Washington, have managed to cull these data out of the ridiculously secret IMF memoranda and staff reports that go by top officials there every few weeks.  But it is only by months and years of tireless digging that they've been able to uncover what should be public knowledge -- how the U.S. and the West are spending, or rather mis-spending, the billions in annual "aid" to Eastern Europe.
<P>
Somehow, the IMF and the West -- which should be leading a sweeping Russian tax, monetary and trade reform -- remain numb to the urgency of bringing economic growth to the new democracies.  Do you know that two years ago, the IMF insisted that Russia increase its taxes by 4.1 percent of GDP in one year?  To put this in perspective, both the Bush and Clinton tax increases that attracted such displeasure in the U.S. in the last five years were less than 1 percent of GDP, and these at least were not piled on the back of a crippled economy.
<P>
This is not a partisan issue.  It goes back to the Bush administration, when we encouraged the same mind-numbing austerity as is being applied to Russia, Hungary, and Poland today through the IMF's conditionality agreements and Article IV process.  In 1993, I joined with the late Ed Muskie, George Soros, Senator Joe Lieberman, and a group of nearly three dozen other leading Americans of both parties to urge the president to take the fate of Russia out of the hands of the inept and incapable economists at the IMF and devise a serious, direct program of Western aid and trade to bring economic growth to the emerging democracies of Central and East Europe.
<P>
The post-Cold-War peace must not become another Versailles settlement of pain and austerity.  America and the West must see that they cannot afford to send the common reply, "it isn't our concern."   We must dedicate ourselves to the opposite spirit, the spirit of liberal optimism and open trade with the East.  And we must resolve to include Eastern Europe and Russia at the table.
<P>
I am reminded of a famous cartoon from Wallenberg's time, in which Russia, Germany, and Hungary were at the front end of a ship that was rapidly taking in water.  The ship was labeled, "The World Monetary Crisis," and the year was about 1927, as the first signs of protectionism and deflation were making themselves felt.  In the back of the ship were three men labeled France, Britain, and the United States.  They watched with interest and a little bit of sympathy as the men bailed furiously in front.   But they were not concerned.  "Awful leak," said one of them.  "Yes, awful," said another.  "Thank goodness it's not in our end of the boat."
<P>
Today, democracy is doing much better, but the burden on us is that much higher.  We have a tremendous opportunity to secure the fruits of the Cold War victory: to build a stable and prosperous Eastern and Central Europe; to guard Russia from a new form of tyranny -- economic tyranny.  
<P>
 Indeed, we are bound by the awesome responsibility that comes with our own freedom to guard the rightful freedom of all people.  
<P>
Raoul Wallenberg had a profound understanding of this moral imperative.  He refused to accept the awful conclusion that we needn't be concerned about others, or that there is "nothing we can do."  He did not believe the unpragmatic counsel that we can ignore the front of the boat because it isn't our end.   His life was an incarnate assertion of the equal and opposite imperative -- the democratic imperative, the assertion of Rabbi Hillel, the New Testament, and Hebrew Scripture, that we are our brother's keeper, and our neighbor's brother.
<P>
As President Reagan said during the Rose Garden ceremony conferring honorary American citizenship upon Wallenberg:  " . . a man makes at least a start on understanding the meaning of human life when he plants shade trees under which he will never sit.  Raoul Wallenberg is just such a man.  He nurtured the lives of those he never knew at the risk of his own."  What better example to look to as we challenge ourselves to respond to the needs of a changing world -- to plant the trees of shade, succor and democratic successes under which we might never sit, but which will surely shelter our children and grandchildren in the 21st century.  Let us resolve not that it be an American Century per se -- but a Democratic Century for all.

<B><FONT SIZE = 4> REMARKS BEFORE THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB <BA></FONT></B>
<P>
by William J. Bennett 
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE = 2>Given on November 18, 1996 <BA></center></FONT></I>
<blockquote>
<P>
Now that the political season is over, let's talk about some other matters which are arguably as important -- indeed, I would argue that they are more important -- than the matters raised in the recent political debate.  Last week the National Commission on Civic Renewal was announced.  The executive director is Bill Galston, formerly Bill Clinton's domestic policy adviser, and a very able man.  The Commission is co-chaired by Sam Nunn and me, and it will address issues of civic trust; our morale and national mood; the fraying social fabric; and moral decline.
<P>
Today I would like to give you my take on this -- where we are, where I think we, the American people, need to go, and what's missing in our public conversation.  Let me say at the outset that I believe that in a fundamental way, many of our conversations are missing the mark.
<P>
Here's a question to start with -- a question which implicitly runs throughout my talk and one which is, I think, an interesting question for our time: why, when we have so much material wealth, are Americans so cynical, so distressed, so angry with each other, so untrusting, so ticked off about so many things?  Why, when for so many things are so good, do we feel so bad?
<P>
The evidence is all around us: the whining and the complaining; the explosion in recent years in the use of Prozac; and alcohol abuse and drug use.   The Commission takes as its fundamental data a dramatic national increase in rudeness; in incivility; in litigiousness; in the growing belief that we are all victims; in the frequency of visits to psychiatrists; in the increased amount of suicide, particularly among the young; and in increased complaints about stress.  
<P>
Earlier this month an American Automobile Association survey showed that aggressive driving cases involving death or injury are on a record pace in 1996, and incidents of violent "highway hooliganism" have increased 50 percent from 1990 through 1995.  And last week a survey of high-achieving students revealed that among many of these high school students stress, drugs and thoughts of death fill their lives.  This is a report from out youngest people in this, the most successful country in the history of the world.
<P>
Well, judging from mountains of interviews and stories from the political debate that we just concluded, many in politics still give an answer to this question that has economics at its base.  You know the litany -- and we've had a whole lot of it in the last couple of years: "economic stagnation," "flat wages," the "American Dream" is getting further and further out of reach, that sort of thing.  But is that diagnosis correct?  I don't think so.
<P>
I don't think the objective material and economic facts can explain what I'm talking about, because while it's obvious that economic things are far from perfect, the fact remains that we are the most affluent and materially prosperous people in the history of civilization.  As Robert Samuelson puts it, "By objective standards, the last half century of our national life has been hugely successful.  We have achieved unprecedented prosperity and personal freedom.  We are healthier, work at less exhausting jobs and live longer than ever."
<P>
But it seems we don't feel so great about it.  Did you know, for example, that the average American now consumes twice as many goods and services as in 1950?  Or that the poorest fifth of the current population consumes more than the average family did in 1955?  In a wonderful introductory essay for the 75th anniversary issue of Forbes magazine, James Michaels put it this way:
<P>
"When you're my age you don't have to ask: Are Americans really materially better off than they were in the recent past?  Those of us born in the 1920s and with vivid memories of the Depression simply know how much better things are today.  The improvement is implicit in almost our every memory, every experience.  Even for comfortable middle-class people life was much more difficult and insecure in the 1920s than it is today.  If he was fortunate enough to have central heating (less than one-third of the population in 1920 did), middle-class Dad had to pull himself from bed at 4 a.m. on cold winter mornings to unbank the furnace and shovel coal; if he overslept, the pipes froze.  But he usually didn't have to rake leaves or shovel snow.  Not in the 1930s.  That was done by shabby, humble men who knocked at the back door mornings, asking for a warm meal in return for doing chores."
<P>
Michaels goes on to say this:  "In 1921... the typical American workweek was 60 hours, and many people worked longer...  [A woman] worked a lot more than 60 hours in her home.  Leisure-time industry scarcely existed because few people had leisure.  For more than half the population, the family toilet was a hole in the backyard with a shack built over it.....  Senior citizens?  We called them old folks, and they were old in their 50s; if they were lucky, one of their kids had a spare room for them, maybe in the attic.  Life expectancy was about 54 years, which was just as well because there were few pensions beyond what the gold watch might bring at a pawnshop."       
<P>
My point is this: while people natter about economics, and it almost consumes many political debates, what I am talking about is not about economics.  It's about whether we can survive prosperity.  Now prosperity and wealth are certainly far preferable to poverty.  But can the human spirit survive it?  The problem is not prosperity per se; the problem is in making prosperity the object of our loves, the object of our heart's and soul's desire, thereby displacing other things.  In this connection think of Saint Augustine, who has the concept called ordo amorum, the "order of the loves."  I think that very often, for very many of us, we have the order wrong.
<P>
Now, if people want to be unhappy and angry and upset and sad, there certainly are plenty of things to be unhappy and sad and angry about.  While America is the most powerful, affluent, and envied nation in the world -- in many ways justifiably so -- America also leads the industrialized world in rates of murder; violent crime; juvenile violent crime; imprisonment; divorce; abortion; sexually-transmitted diseases; single-parent households; teen suicide; cocaine consumption; per capita consumption of all drugs; pornography production and pornography consumption.  I am told that California itself leads the entire world in pornography production.  And that's only a partial list.  Now these are serious matters, worthy of serious concern.  But these are not -- I think we can fairly say -- matters that are the consequences of an economic deprivation.  The root cause lies elsewhere.
<P>
Let me digress for a moment.  I do not want to be misunderstood; I don't mean to sound like a Jeremiah one-note.  There is genuine good news in America, and much of it is about things other than economics.  We have seen huge social advances when it comes to women and minorities; opportunity and equality have been extended to those who were once denied them.  We have witnessed extraordinary advances in medicine, in science and in technology in recent times.  Life expectancy has increased more than 20 years during the last six decades.  Studies show that if a person finishes high school, gets married and reaches the age of twenty before having a first child, the odds are less than 1 in 10 that that person will be in poverty.  The American system works: finish high school, get a job, don't get pregnant or get someone pregnant before you finish high school, and you can make it in America.  And of course, last but not least, America prevailed in the "long, twilight struggle" against communism.
<P>
Let me give you some more specific and more recent good news: we have seen what many people thought could not occur: a downturn in crime in New York and Houston -- almost a 40 percent decline in violent crime in New York (which accounts for a lot of the total crime decline in the nation as a whole).  We have seen effective welfare programs in several states across the country.  I must confess I was delighted that my beloved Western Canon of literature has now made it to Hollywood.  Jane Austen is an enormous movie success.  Now it turns out three Henry James novels are coming to the screen.  Can Anna Karenina be far behind?  We are seeing the popularity of shows on the radio and some on television that lift up the human spirit.  We are seeing a flattening out or decrease in some social indicators -- abortion, divorce, crime.  Maybe this will just flatten out at a high plateau.  Or maybe we will see a further decline.
<P>
We are seeing an emerging consensus on the importance of the "values" debate.  As Bill Galston says, 10 or even 5 years ago we would have been arguing about basic facts and basic premises.  That's not the case now.  People understand the importance of values, understand the importance of families.  For men, programs like Promise Keepers are an extraordinary event in American life.  For young women, for girls, my wife's program, Best Friends, is a tremendous success here in the District of Columbia and in other places.  This is extraordinarily important and extraordinarily hopeful.
<P>
Our popular culture campaign involving Joe Lieberman, Sam Nunn and DeLores Tucker, has had success.  People were actually willing to listen and to change some of what is on TV and what is marketed in music.  I think what we are seeing in America today, in many places, is the virus creating its own antibodies.  We are seeing people fighting back with their best, with their eyes and their sights and their standards raised.  And that is very important and very encouraging.
<P>
But the troubles we have remain our troubles; they manifestly have to do not with the pocket book, not with economics, but with the human heart, the human heart at odds with itself. 
It seems to me that almost all contemporary political campaigns miss the mark in terms of what most ails America.  The concerns which the two campaigns most sought to address were economic: things like wage stagnation, fear that our children will not have as much materially as we do, and how do we increase wealth creation.  Making a bigger pie is a fine thing to do.  We should do it, and I am for it.  But it is not everything.  Nor is it even the most important thing. 
<P>
More than ever before -- and thanks largely to affluence, to mass marketing, to television, to the nature of our political discourse, and I say this knowingly, as a Republican, thanks to the unbridled and omnipresent market, to capitalism, we are constantly pushing our children and adults to buy things which they don't need.  We are pushing goods and the idea of life as having things and having experiences.  We are making desires into needs, and as a result we are not living at the center.  We are misreading the essential human condition.  Because if we actually are moral and spiritual beings -- which a lot of us say we are -- then we ought to act in ways which are consonant with that fact, that reality.  But too often, we aren't doing that -- officially, politically, publicly, privately.  We are not living, or advertising, or talking, or even making public policy, as if we are what we profess ourselves to be.  I know often I'm not.  And maybe you're not.  Maybe a lot of us aren't.  And I think that explains, in large part, the cynicism, the anger, the drift, and the deep and pervasive sadness.
<P>
Let me conclude and then open this up to discussion.  And in conclusion, let me borrow briefly from three people who are a lot smarter than I am.  In doing a philosopher's exercise like this, I thought it was advisable for me to draw on people who thought these things through a lot longer and better than I did.  See if you think they hit it closer than what we here in Beltway Central have been obsessing about for so long.
<P>
First Walker Percy, my favorite contemporary novelist.  When asked about what issue most concerned him about the future of America, Percy said this: "Probably the fear of seeing America, with all its great strength and beauty and freedom ... gradually subside into decay through default and is defeated, not by the Communist movement ... but from within by weariness, by boredom, by cynicism, by greed, and in the end, by helplessness before its great problems."
<P>
Second, the great and prophetic Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn had this to say: "In the United States the difficulties are not a Minotaur or a dragon -- not imprisonment, not hard labor, death, government harassment and censorship -- but cupidity, boredom, sloppiness, indifference." About the West, Solzhenitsyn said this simple, straightforward sentence: "the spiritual axis of life has grown dim."
 <P>
And finally, Scottish author John Buchan, writing a half-century ago, described the "coming of a too garish age, when life would be lived in the glare of neon lamps and the spirit would find no solitude."  Here is what Buchan wrote about his nightmare world:
<P>
"In such a world everyone would have leisure.  But everyone would be restless, for there would be no spiritual discipline in life...  It would be a feverish, bustling world, self-satisfied and yet malcontent, and under the mask of a riotous life there would be death at the heart.  In the perpetual hurry of life there would be no change of quiet for the soul...  in such a bagman's paradise, where life would be rationalised and padded with every material comfort, there would be little satisfaction for the immortal part of man."
<P>
This sounds right to me.  I'd love to know how it sounds to you.  Thank you very much. 
<P>
<P><HR>
<center><b>QUESTION-AND-ANSWER</B></center> 
<p>
<B>Question:</B>  How will the new Bennett-Nunn commission actually address moral decline -- through studies, surveys, academic papers, hearings, recommendations for legislative actions, exhortations and speeches?  How will you address moral decline?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</b>  All the above (laughter).  It's a commission.  The Commission members are an exceedingly interesting group: Richard Land from the Southern Baptist Convention is one member, and Henry Louis Gates from Harvard is another member, so that gives you a sense of the ideological spread of the group.  I don't want to presume ideology on the part of anybody, but I have a sense there may be differences of opinion between those two, as with others of us.  It will be interesting to tape the conversation.  And the meetings, I believe, are open to the press, so we welcome members of the press to come.
<P>
We'll have witnesses.  We will hear from people about problems and about solutions.  We very much want to profile what works, what's effective.  We want to see programs that address some of the hardest issues in American life and are finding a way to ameliorate them, if not always solve them.  If there are grounds for this anger and this lack of trust and this grousing that seems to be so increasingly prevalent, we want to know what it is.  But if there are grounds for others, as St. Paul says, if there be any virtue, if there be any praise, we'll think on those things, too.  And so we will want to do both.
<P>
What Bill Galston has stressed -- and one of the reasons I so much admire Bill Galston and was so sorry to see him leave the Clinton White House -- was that he doesn't think we should speak on these things until we have established an absolutely unassailable factual basis for anything we have to say.  And so I think we will have a solid empirical basis for talking about these things.  These are difficult concepts, and some people might say, what is all this about trust and sadness and all that?   Well, we're going to get a hard empirical basis for it, so people who need that sort of thing to believe it -- who need to touch something before they believe it's there -- will be satisfied.  There will be a lot of social science, I will admit.  You know what one person called social science?  The elaborate demonstration of the obvious by methods that are obscure (laughter.)  
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  The National Endowment for the Humanities, at the beginning of the Clinton administration, launched a national conversation on what it means to be an American.  Little has been heard from that since.  Isn't this similar to that you are doing?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  No, you'll hear from us (laughter).  I don't know what happened to that conversation.  They may still be building toward it.  They may still be footnoting it.  I don't know what happened to the National Endowment for the Humanities conversation.
<P>
I don't think there are too few conversations in American political life.  I don't think anybody can go through campaign season and say, you know, we're not talking enough about politics.  It's that I don't think we have a sufficient number of conversations that are focused on things that I think we ought to focus on.  And what I was trying to do today -- and what we will try to do in the Commission, I think -- is to bring some other kinds of things into the conversation, some of the most important things are not getting talked about.
<P>
<B>Question</B>:  Perhaps you answered your own question, perhaps wealth is at the core of our hollowness.  In short, do we have too much of a good thing?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  Well, the philosophers worried about this.  Again, I don't think prosperity per se is the problem, I don't think wealth per se is the problem.  I think the problem is, as I read some of these other people whom I've quoted, is when the pursuit of these things leads to the displacement of other things.  It's when they become the idol, the actual object of the pursuit, rather than simply a way in which one lives.
<P>
Look, one of my arguments with the market is that it makes people think their desires are needs.  And this is a very, very important distinction.  When I was chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, the first budget we did -- I remember submitting to Congress a huge document -- talking about the "needs" of the humanities community.  Well, as I read through the "needs" of the humanities community, these weren't needs, these were desires.  It's important to make the distinction.  They said, "we need summer seminars in warm climates." (Laughter.)  Well, they wanted summer seminars in warm climates, and I understand that.  Other people get summer seminars in warm climates; why shouldn't professors?  By the way, we took it away from them and gave it to elementary and high school teachers because I thought they were more deserving of summer seminars in warm climates.  But there was the substitution of the word "need" for what was actually the desire.
<P>
Maybe the smartest thing ever said about this was by Reinhold Niebuhr, who said, "Human desires grow with the means of their gratification."  And I think that just turns out to be a truth of human nature.  One of the ironies of this tremendously successful commercial machine which we have made in this country is that we now regard deprivation relatively much higher than we used to.  It's at a much higher threshold.  Consider what people have now and what they regard as deprivation.  The machine is constantly trying to transmute desires into needs, so that we think of those things in that way, and we ratchet ever higher and pursue it ever the more.
<P>
So, unbridled capitalism is a problem.  It may not be a problem for production and for expansion of the economic pie, but it's a problem for human beings.  It's a problem for that whole dimension of things we call the realm of values and human relationships, because it distorts things.
<P>
The other thing to keep in mind is that with the interest in selling, people have now decided to sell by way of philosophy.  You just don't sell a beer or sell a cigar or sell a piece of furniture; you sell a style of life and a philosophy of life.  Now, this is a free country and anybody can practice philosophy.  But when the young are around and are listening, they may take it seriously in the absence of the real stuff.
<P>
For example, when I was growing up I remember the commercial from the Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company.  It made a tremendous impact on me, and maybe on other people.  It said, "You only go around once in life, so grab for all the gusto you can."  Now Schlitz produces pretty good beer.  I still buy it occasionally.  But I don't buy the philosophy.  How much of that philosophy is getting across?  Now Schlitz might make good beer, but where did they do their philosophy?  How do they know you only go around once in life?  (Laughter.)  I mean, is that part of the brewing process?  This was not a claim about beer.  And if you spend time with undergraduates, you spend time in high school and you talk to young people about life, and what the Good Life is, you will find that what you're hearing very often -- not all the time but very often -- is an echo and a translation through their own internal systems of what they are picking up from the most successful and omnipresent marketing and philosopher's machine ever invented: television.  Television is telling people what to think, and what to believe, and what to feel, and what to buy. And that creates a different view of the world.
<P>
Again, it's a free country.  I'm not even in favor of the v-chip.  I don't want government regulating television; I don't want government legislating about the content of television. I think these are matters best left to individuals.  But what we can't say, it seems to me, is these matters have no consequence; or that television has no consequence; or that advertising has no consequence; or that a relentless market has no consequence.  These things have an enormous consequence.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  More Americans are regular church-goers than in any other developed country. Are you saying that somehow religious organizations are failing to stimulate this spiritual renewal?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> Yes, I guess I am.  I've looked into this, because it's a very interesting fact, the number of Americans who go to church. The question is what goes on there, what are the consequences, what's the carryover, and what's the impact?
<P>
Maybe the more interesting thing is to see the shift in church-going, the shift from some of the old established Protestant sects, for example, to some of the newer, more evangelical ones. That seems to be a more interesting, a more revealing direction.  Also, there is still an increase, I think, in registrations in the Catholic Church.
<P>
This is the country which in many ways is the nicest, the most generous, the most considerate, the most sensitive to the needs of people in the world and its citizens.  And yet the kinds of things that go on every day in America, cited in my litany, suggest that we're of two minds on this. I don't think that going to church does it any more. I think that for a lot of us -- and again, I put myself in this group, I don't exempt myself from the charges -- I think that sometimes all it amounts to is going to church.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Do you think America's cultural decline is irreversible? And what nation would you point to as historic precedent for such an about-face?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  Well, there is none. There is no precedent. I've found lately -- we've spent a lot of time talking to cultural anthropologists and historians, trying to find a precedent for this. There are so many things going on in America that are unprecedented.  For example, I was reading a book the other day in which Lawrence Stone, formerly at Princeton (I don't know where he is now), points out that we are in entirely uncharted territory in this country in terms of the disintegration of the family.  There has been a relentless assault on marriage as the central cementing institution of society; it has been going on for decades now, and in its place we see the substitution of the idea of individual self-fulfillment with or without commitment.  This is unprecedented, certainly in the West, and we don't know where this goes.
<P>
Nobody's ever done this before; nobody's ever tried to sustain a society with this level of familial disintegration, and we're not sure whether we can or not. I think that the familial disintegration is a corollary of the larger point here -- that is, the focus and the order of the loves.  Because if you regard yourself as, let's say, a moral and spiritual being on the one hand -- and I'm not saying you have to -- but if you say you do, or if on the other hand you're a "Schlitzian" and you believe you only go around once in life and you should grab for all the gusto you can -- well, one thing you can't say is it doesn't matter which you believe.  Because if you believe one or believe the other -- or if you have a foot in both camps, which a lot of us do -- it makes an enormous difference.
<P>
There is no precedent for the United States in so many ways.  I do not think there's any example that's even close.  We could look to Britain, I suppose, in the 19th Century.  Some historians have suggested that you had a kind of revival occurring which changed things.
<P>
If it happens, it will happen on our own terms by our own people. Regeneration comes from within, I'm pretty sure of that.  And the things I cited as grounds for hope I think are very, very important, because if you go through that list -- if you go through Best Friends, if you go through Promise Keepers, if you go through the successful programs in drug treatment, or the successful welfare programs -- I think you find that there's a common basis to many of them. There's something that they are all share, and that is they all tend to raise people sights up, they tend to lift people up, to look beyond where they've been looking. If you want the quick version of my speech, it is that country Western song, "Lookin' for Love in all the Wrong Places."  
<P>
Marvin Olasky has taught us, I think, in this whole discussion of contemporary charity and compassion, that if you're looking at welfare problems, people who have been on welfare generation after generation, if you're looking at people with serious drug problems, alcohol problems, this requires a refocusing of one's life.  It's not simply a matter of getting a job, or getting a message from the government.  It's a matter of refocusing your life, and refocusing your life requires more than the kind of fooling around with the details, messing with the details of bureaucracies and incentives.  I'm for welfare reform, but unless we offer something to people by way of other agencies or institutions for them to focus on, they will fall back. That's why I think the role of churches is so crucial in this whole welfare debate, and indeed beyond the welfare debate.
<P>
But there are people -- I should say this in fairness to some pretty sophisticated literature out there -- there are people who think we are going through a great spiritual reawakening right now in this country.  I don't see it.  There are people who say we are going through it.  It would be nice if it occurred -- provided it was American in tone, provided it was open and tolerant and not vindictive, not authoritarian -- then it would be a good thing. But I'm not sure I see it.  I see all the signs, the interest of people in religion.  I see the New York Times Best Sellers list, and all the books on religion.  I see movies getting quasi-religious. The latest thing in Hollywood seems to me, from what I can tell, is objective immortality. They can't quite say we have souls yet but you may -- you're to be measured by the impact you have on other people's lives.
<P>
It may also be the case, as demographers have pointed out, that this is not a religious revival, this is simply the yuppies turning 50 and getting nervous (laughter.)  After putting the nation through granola and jogging and marijuana and weight machines, they are now going to make us pray because they're approaching 60.  Maybe so.  I don't know for sure.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Does the gap between the richest Americans and the poorest Americans likely affect public discontent?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  I think it's very troubling to Americans to see the gap between an overclass and an underclass, to take both ends increase and increase dramatically.  We've got what people have called "cognitive stratification" to a degree we have never had before.  It's always better to be smart, and it's always better to be well-educated, and it's always better to have an economic base.  But the gap now widens because the sheer value of an education; the sheer value of intelligence matters more, in today's complicated world, than it ever did.
<P>
So yes, I think that's troubling.  But the other side of that is the good news.  The other side of that is a society in which we now find that if you play by certain basic minimal rules -- if you graduate from high school, get a job, keep your nose clean, don't have a child before you get out of high school -- the odds that you will succeed in American society increase dramatically.  But you need to observe certain basic rules.
<P>
The problem is -- and I think now there's a lot of agreement among social scientists who have studied poverty -- that poverty is behavioral in nature,  And that's not a different malady -- except when a malady hits the poor, it knocks them out.  When a malady hits the wealthy suburbs, they can absorb it.  I remember when I was "drug czar" and we went to Hollywood and talked about the drug problem.  The people in Hollywood told me that they were not doing drugs any more.  Out in Hollywood, whenever somebody gets a drug problem, they go to the Betty Ford Clinic and they're fine.  Well, when it hits Beverly Hills, people had the money and resources to be able to do that.  But when it hit Watts, it knocked Watts on its ear.  How bad is the earthquake?  Well, how strong is the foundation of the building in which you live?
<P>
It's never good to be poor, it's never good to be without material resources.  But the resources I'm talking about are perhaps the ones that are missing the most across the board, and they raise the question as to whether this country, and the things for which it stands, the hopes it has for itself and its children, can continue without some fairly significant change.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Do you think Bob Dole made a serious mistake in his campaign by stressing the 15-percent tax cut?  What moral and ethical issues should have he raised, beyond just calling President Clinton immoral?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  Well, he did more than that.  If you just stand there and say "You're immoral," that's not persuasive, it's not a very good argument, it's not persuasive when one needs to make one's case.  But as I said during the campaign, I think issues of public character and public trust are central to public confidence.
<P>
Look, one of the things that distressed me -- I don't want to make this a political talk -- is that 55 or 60 percent of the people in exit polls said that they didn't have the trust in the president, that they didn't think he was a trustworthy person.  Mario Cuomo said, well, if that's what they thought of Clinton, then what did they think of Dole, if Clinton got elected?  Well, I guess in some ways less, in terms of electability.  But that's not good, that's the point I would make.
<P>
It's perfectly fine to talk about a 15-percent tax cut if that's what you truly believe is essential to the well-being of the country and will spark an economic recovery.  I have no objection to it.  Other things can be talked about and were talked about -- the drug problem, the education problem.  But let me make two points: first, we could be more explicit and talk about real-life issues in ways that are broader than we usually talk about it.  For example, talk about education not just about SAT scores, but talk about education as the architecture of the soul, which is how we used to talk about it, and which why I think many schools are so successful and others are not.  Some schools address students as moral and spiritual beings, and that makes a difference.  I think that helps, when it's done by people who genuinely care for the children.
<P>
We can talk about welfare as life-refocusing effort.  And we can talk about crime as arising not from what I think the usual root-cause argument is but, as we argue in Body Count, the root cause of most crime is moral poverty, kids who are not taught the difference between right and wrong at an early age.  When I traveled as drug czar and talked to wardens and police chiefs and judges, this is what we heard over and over again: nobody's teaching these kids the basics of right and wrong.  Now that's an interesting way to talk about crime, and we could do that.
<P>
Now sure, we could all broaden and deepen our debates in this way.  But at the end of the day, it's not a matter of saying to politicians, "Take all this stuff about the soul and right and wrong and put all that into your political speeches and your political debates."  The point is about the limits of politics itself.  We can't get where we need to get by politics.  The secularization of so much of what matters to us has become so complete that we think of politics as the vehicle of national self-recovery.  And it is not.
<P>
Samuel Johnson said, in his great lines, "How small of all that human hearts endure, That part which laws or kings can cause or cure."  And I think that's right.  But we have now, unwittingly, created a situation in which people are unhappy and so the government needs to do something about it, the president needs to do something about it.  Of course, they can't do something about those things which laws or kings can't cause or cure.  And so we have gotten into a cycle of frustration and unhappiness.
<P>
It is the limits of politics.  It is not as if I'm saying we need to step forward and transform American politics and get into all these things more explicitly.  Politics is a very limited activity, if you think of men and women in the ways that I have been talking about.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  As the story goes, when Bob Dole queried you about interest in running for vice president, you suggested Jack Kemp.  Why didn't you want to run?  Is that because of the limitations of politics?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  Because of the limitations of politics, plus my own.  And I thought Dole-Kemp would be a better ticket.  I thought it would have more lift than Dole-Bennett.  And there were other reasons.  Yeah, I thought Dole-Kemp was a good idea, and that was my recommendation.
<P>
I did not grow up in the soil of politics.  A thought that has occurred to me recently that to run for president in our time one needs to be obsessed with running for president, and I do not have that, I don't seek it.  I don't come from that soil.  I don't think this is something I will do.  And my relationship with campaigns has always been a little bumptious, a little difficult.  It's never a smooth fit.  So, yeah, I made that recommendation in good conscience, and I thought it was the best call at the time.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Do you think the world of the Internet is helping to form caring communities by linking people beyond their geographic boundaries, or isolating them from person-to-person contact?  If the latter, what as a society can we do about it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>   I don't know.  I'm no expert on the Internet.  But I'll tell you it seems to me to be a very mixed blessing.  I read that chilling New York Times story.  It was about a little town in Minnesota and about this network on the Internet on a topic I don't want to get into -- one of the worst and most grisly aspects of American life.  The Internet has made it possible for lots of really horrible things to happen, and it's made it possible for lots of obviously wonderful things to happen.  Here, again, the technology outruns or outpaces the ability to legislate against it, to regulate it, to keep control of it.  What's important are internal constraints, a sense of responsibility, a sense of involvement, participation on the part of parents and others.  I don't know where this is going to lead, but we are going to have a big debate on this.  It's a very mixed blessing indeed.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  California voters recently passed Proposition 209 which ends affirmative action and racial and gender preferences in government and public education.  Do you back this as a national improvement?  And do you believe this would be appropriate for federal hiring programs?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  Yes, I was a supporter of Prop. 209 and went out there a few times, campaigned for it.  And I think it is one of the more interesting consequences of the elections.  It does not end affirmative action.  What it ends is preference by race or gender in hiring and in college admissions and so on.  And I think that's right.  I think finally there is only one way to live in this society, which is to lift the burdens of discrimination from the shoulders of every man, woman, and child in the country, and to have a level playing field, and to give opportunity where opportunity hasn't been given before.  And I think this is the way to go.
<P>
Yes, I would like to see it on the federal level.  And I am very encouraged, as I think other Americas should be, by the results of the recent election in which when those redistricted districts were redistricted once more, and black members of Congress, incumbents who were now running in majority white districts, were still elected.  It was encouraging for this reason: it shows that the American people, the vast majority of them, can look past race and want to look past race.  And I would hope that Proposition 209 will be given a sympathetic hearing across the country and a full discussion.  I hope that this issue, like so many other important issues, doesn't get decided for us by the courts.  The courts must enter if they think it appropriate.   But these are vital issues of democracy, and people must be encouraged and invited to speak.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  The rise of dual-income families explains some of the affluence you describe.  Is there an antidote that would give parents more time with their children to impart values?  What do you propose?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  It really all depends. Some people say that two parents have to work to keep body and soul together.  Sometimes that's true.  Sometimes two parents work to keep the boat together -- you know, the boat for the summer vacation.  You pay your money, you take your choice.
<P>
The two statistics I am still trying to get together are the one that says people, the average American adult, has very little time to spend with his family and with his children because of the demands of work with the statistic that tells us the average American adult watches 21 hours of television a week.  Now, it seems to me that if it's as easy as that we can just answer what people ought to do: turn off the TV -- at least during the week -- and check the homework or something.  But this is a matter of people's priorities.  As I've said, it's a free country and people can do what they want.  But every parent -- and I'm a parent -- knows that how you spend your time and where you spend your time has consequences for your children.
<P>
Years ago there was this nice idea of quality time.  "Quality time" is all you need.  Well, maybe there's something true about quality time, but you don't know when it is, and you've got to log a lot of quantity time in order to get the right quality time, because you can't say to your son, "This is our time, buddy.  We're together now for two hours -- what's on your mind?"  It may turn out there isn't anything on his mind.  Then there's some other time he wants it, and it's nice if you were there as opposed to not being there.
<P>
<P>
<B>Question:</B>  How to you feel about your regular appearances on CNN's "Late Edition" with Mario Cuomo?  Is there any convergence of liberal and conservative ideas?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B>  Oh yeah.  I think he would agree with a lot of this.  Yes, we had some good moments.  One of the reasons I like Governor Cuomo is he's a liberal and he's not embarrassed to be a liberal.  He and Paul Wellstone, you know, "Here we are, we are liberals, we can do no other."  I don't agree with them, but I admire their guts, because it's two versus everybody in the Republican Party, and virtually everybody in the Democratic Party.  Today liberal is an epithet, and people run from it.  You know, if you call somebody a conservative they say, "Thank you, come to dinner."  But if you call somebody a liberal, they say, "Not me" -- unless you're Paul Wellstone or Mario Cuomo.  So I admire that.
<P>
The other things is we have somewhat similar backgrounds -- two New York Catholics -- although he has pushed that a bit far.  During one of the CNN shows I answered, then he answered, and then he said to Frank Sesno, "What you had in our two answers is the respective perspectives of the Dominicans and the Jesuits."  And that's not good TV.  That is not good talking-head journalism (laughter).  Thank you.<br>

Governed by an independent Board of Directors, Empower America is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization. Empower
America relies on the private financial support of the general public and accepts no government funds. Empower America is one of the nation's largest grassroots public policy organizations comprised of tens
of thousands of activists.

<p><br><p><br><br><blockquote>
Dear Friend:
<P>
I would like to take this opportunity to give you information about <I><B>Empower America</B></I> and our ongoing internship program. 
<P>
<B><I>Empower America</I></B> is a conservative non-profit grass-roots advocacy organization.  We were founded on three main principles which include the beliefs of democratic capitalism, economic growth through entrepreneurship, job creation, lower taxes, sound money, less government regulation, and developing new approaches to cultural and social issues.
<P>
We conduct extensive research into public policy and laws that are being made in Congress.  With this valuable information, we then take positions on the issues.  At that point, we begin to educate our membership on the details of the current policy topic and our positions, and encourage them to become involved in the political process.  We have worked on such issues as the North American Free Trade Agreement, Welfare and Healthcare reform, the California School Choice Initiative and the Washington "Three Strikes Your Out" initiative, to name a few.
<P>
The internship program consists of "hands on" working experience with a leading national grass-roots organization.  We also invite leaders from the political community to participate in our internship program's speakers series which focuses on current government and political issues of the day.  Educational tours of federal and historical buildings will be provided, as well.  This is an exciting, interesting, and educational internship for any college student.
<P>
If you have any questions, or would like to apply, please contact me at (202) 452-8200 or write me at:

<blockquote>
Lamar has been Governor of Tennessee, President of the University of Tennessee, and U.S. Education Secretary.  During his two terms as Governor, Tennessee created jobs at twice the national average, improved from last to third in production of new automobiles and from 48th to 36th in average family income, and enacted the nation's only state program to pay teachers more for teaching well.  In 1987, he and his wife, Honey, helped found Corporate Child Care Services, a company that today has 2,000 employees.  In 1988 he became President of the University of Tennessee; and, in 1991, the Senate unanimously confirmed him as President Bush's Education Secretary.  Lamar is a country and classical pianist who has played at the Grand Ole Opry.  Lamar and his wife, Honey, live in Nashville, Tennessee.

<TITLE>Jack Kemp Biography</TITLE>

<P>
<br>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="NewCenturySchlbk">JACK KEMP<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<br>
Jack Kemp currently is on leave
of absence as co-director of Empower America, a public policy
and advocacy organization he co-founded in 1993 with William Bennett,
Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin Weber. Empower America is
dedicated to three founding principles: expanding freedom and
democratic capitalism; promoting policies to expand economic growth
and entrepreneurship for our nation; and advancing social policies
which empower people, not government bureaucracies.<BR>
<P>
Prior to founding Empower America,
Mr. Kemp served for four years as Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development, and proved to be one of our nation's most innovative
leaders in that role. He was the first and strongest advocate
of Enterprise Zones to encourage entrepreneurship and job creation
in urban America and of expanding homeownership among the poor
through resident management and ownership of public housing.<BR>
<P>
 In March, 1995, Senator Bob Dole
and Speaker Newt Gingrich put Jack Kemp at the center of the tax
and economic debate for the `96 campaign by naming him chairman
of the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform to
study how major restructuring of our tax code can help unleash
the entrepreneurial spirit of Americans, grow the economy without
inflation and create opportunity for people to escape poverty.
<BR>
<P>
 Before his appointment to the Cabinet,
Mr. Kemp represented the Buffalo area and Western New York for
18 years in the United States House of Representatives from 1971
to 1989.  He served for seven years in the Republican Leadership
as Chairman of the House Republican Leadership Conference.</FONT>
<P>
<P>
 Jack Kemp came to Congress after
13 years as a professional football quarterback.  He was captain
of the San Diego Chargers from 1960 to 1962 and also of the Buffalo
Bills, the team he helped lead to the American Football League
championship in 1964 and 1965 when he was named the league's most
valuable player. He also co-founded the AFL Players Association
and was five times elected president.<BR>
<P>
 Mr. Kemp, born and raised in Los
Angeles, is married to the former Joanne Main of Fillmore, California.
 Both Jack and Joanne are graduates of Occidental College. They
have four children, Jeffrey, Jennifer, Judith and James, eleven
grandchildren, and reside in Bethesda, Maryland.<BR>

<blockquote>
<IMG SRC="/empower/ea2.jpe" align="left" alt="Jeane J. Kirkpatrick"</CENTER>


	Scholar, diplomat, syndicated columnist, political scientist, Jeane Kirkpatrick is one of America's few true experts on world politics and international affairs.  Kirkpatrick speaks and writes with clarity and sophistication about the politics of many issues, areas, countries, and organizations.

	<P>Dr. Kirkpatrick's first hand experience in the United Nations and as a member of the U.S. Cabinet and National Security Council gives her an unusual understanding of the dynamics of global politics.  A lifetime of study gives her analyses unusual depth and breadth.  She knows world leaders personally and understands them in their institutions.

	<P>During her years as United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations and as a member of Ronald Reagan's cabinet, Jeane Kirkpatrick had a remarkable impact in the United States and in the world body.  Her stature has not diminished since she left that office.  Her strong voice and keen mind, her analyses and opinions are sought on a wide range of international and geopolitical questions.

	<P>Today, Dr. Kirkpatrick is Leaving Professor at Georgetown University, Senior Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, Co-Director of Empower America, and author of a syndicated column on world affairs.

	<P>She is the author of seven books, several monographs and a large number of substantial articles on American political issues and foreign policy that appear in such journals as Commentary, Foreign Affairs, and The National Interest.

	<P>Her most recent book, The Withering Away of the Totalitarian State, describes the collapse of Communism and the end of the Cold War.  Other books include Legitimacy and Force (two volumes), Dictatorships and Double Standards, The Reagan Phenomenon, The New Presidential Elite, a pace-making study of American presidential nominating politics, Dismantling the Parties, Political Woman, a trail-blazing study of women in public life, and a book-length study of the Peronist movement in Argentina, Leader and Vanguard in Mass Society:  A Study of Peronist Argentina.

	<P>Dr. Kirkpatrick has lectured extensively in the United States and abroad.  She has also participated in programs of the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) and the Department of State in Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America.

	<P>A noted academic, Jeane J. Kirkpatrick holds undergraduate degrees from Stephens College and Barnard College, and M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Columbia University.  She has studied at the University of Paris.  Dr. Kirkpatrick has been awarded more than a dozen honorary doctor degrees including degrees form the University of Michigan, Georgetown University, St. John's University, the Hebrew University (Jerusalem), and Tel Aviv University.  She has received research grants from a number of leading foundations.  

	<P>Dr. Kirkpatrick was awarded the Medal of Freedom (the highest civilian award given by the U.S. government), and the French Prize Politique for political courage.  She is also the recipient of the award of the Commonwealth Fund, the Gold Medal, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Hubert H. Humphrey Award of the American Political Science Association, the Gold Medal of the Nicholas Society, the Christian A. Herter Award of the Boston World Affairs Association, the Harry S. Truman Good Neighbor Award, the Humanitarian Award of B'nai B'rith, the Defender of Jerusalem Award, and, most recently, a second Distinguished Public Service Medal awarded in December 1992 (the highest civilian award given by the Department of Defense).

	<P>Dr. Kirkpatrick has been active in professional organizations, including the American and International Political Science Associations, and she has served as a board member on numerous academic, public affairs, and public service organizations.

	<P>Dr. Kirkpatrick was born in Duncan, Oklahoma.  She is married to Dr. Evron M. Kirkpatrick.  They have three grown sons.  In addition to English, she speaks French and Spanish and travels widely.

<h3><I>Liberal Historians and the</I> New York Times <I>Deny Ronald Reagan His Due</I></h3>

<b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i><br>
March-April 1997, Number 82</b>
</center><p>
<P>
<DD>
	<FONT SIZE="+2">O</FONT>n December 15, 1996, the <I>New York Times Magazine</I> published  Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.'s recent survey of 32 historians and other "experts." He had asked them to rate every U.S. president as "great," "near great," "average," "below average," or "failure."

<P>
<DD>	Three presidents were ranked as "great": George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Franklin Roosevelt. Six were rated "near great": Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, James K. Polk, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and Harry Truman.

<P>
<DD>	The most astonishing part of Schlesinger's poll was the low assessment his panel gave Bill Clinton's most illustrious recent predecessor: Ronald Reagan placed in the bottom half of the "average" category. Sharing this designation were Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, William Howard Taft, Chester A. Arthur, and Benjamin Harrison.
<P>
<DD>	To be sure, Reagan generated anything but a consensus among the judges. Seven rated him "near great," eleven saw him as "average," nine considered him "below average," and four graded him a "failure." Still, something is amiss in Reagan's overall grade. A close inspection of Schlesinger's panel invites suspicion that participants were selected as much for the conclusions they were likely to reach as for their scholarly credentials.

<P>
<DD>	Eminent presidential biographers Merrill D. Peterson (Jefferson), Robert V. Remini (Jackson), Arthur S. Link (Wilson), and Robert H. Ferrell (Truman) deservedly made the list. Authors sympathetic to the New Deal and its legacy, such as James MacGregor Burns, Doris Kearns Goodwin, and Alan Brinkley, were represented in abundance. Also there were Lyndon Johnson enthusiast Robert Dallek and left-of-center historian Eric Foner. To top it off, the panel included two liberal Democratic politicians, former New York governor Mario Cuomo and former Illinois senator Paul Simon. Forrest McDonald was the only conservative scholar represented.

<P>
<DD><I>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</I> asked a number of leading authorities on the presidency whether they agreed with the Schlesinger panel's assessment of Reagan. Their answers follow.

<P>
<DD><B>William F. Buckley Jr.:</B> Reagan had the best intuitive sense of priorities of any president in the postwar period, when it became a constant struggle to know what to pay attention to. His designation of the Soviet Union as an "evil empire" froze the blood of international diplomacy, but agitated the moral imagination and did more to advance U.S. national objectives than a year's Pentagon spending. Speaking of which, Reagan was exactly correct in knowing that the resources of the U.S. could not be matched by those of the enemy. His willingness to install theater weapons in Europe, to explore anti-missile technology, and to commit great sums to defense effectively disarmed the potential aggressor. And then who, more resonantly than he, made the case against Big Government? Could he have known that a Democratic president, seven years after Reagan left office, would serve as an echo chamber on the matter of an end to Big Government?
<P>

<P>
<DD><B>A.M. Rosenthal:</B> There was a communist empire and it was evil. Ronald Reagan did as much as any leader in the world to help bring about the end of that empire. He also proved it false, as the Clinton administration now claims in the case of China, that struggling against a foreign dictatorship necessitates consigning to total isolation. President Reagan was able both to keep up the pressure on the Soviet Union militarily, economically, and politically and to maintain contact with its leaders because it was to their interest to do so. I think all this certainly raises Mr. Reagan to the status of above average.

<P>
<DD>		I think it is silly for contemporaries of a president to try to fit him into a permanent historical niche. I would expect that, as time went on, history, if not the historians, will judge him as near-great for his contribution to the downfall of the evil empire.

<DD><B>Jeane Kirkpatrick:</B> Nothing but liberal prejudice can prevent some distinguished Democrats (which most historians are) from discerning the extraordinary achievements of Ronald Reagan. I mention just two: his crucial role in rebuilding American and Western military strength after a period of Western decline and Soviet expansion, and his great success in demonstrating the superiority of free markets and free societies over socialism -- especially, but not only, Marxist socialism. His leadership in these achievements strengthened peace and expanded freedom.

<P>
<DD><B>Michael Barone:</B> Reagan clearly deserves a rating of near-great. This is a president whose deliberate policies produced seven years of economic growth with low inflation after Democratic economists said that was impossible and won the Cold War when almost no one in either party believed that could happen. These were not just accidents. They were the intended results of policies adopted and supervised by Reagan personally, very often against the advice or attempted manipulation of his own advisers. Anyone who doubts that Reagan took charge on these issues should consult David Stockman's <I>The Triumph of Politics</I> on economics and Lou Cannon's <I>Reagan</I> and Don Oberdorfer's <I>The Turn</I> on policy toward Russia.

<P>
<DD><B>Forrest McDonald:</B> I was one of the 32 historians Schlesinger asked for a ranking, and I was one of the seven who ranked Reagan as near great.

<P>
<CENTER><HR WIDTH=50%></CENTER>
<P>
<DD><B>Martin Anderson:</B> One hundred years from now, when reasonably objective historians look back, they will rank Reagan as a great president, right up there with Washington, Lincoln, and Roosevelt. Why? Because, like those three, he presided over epochal changes: On Reagan's watch, the philosophical idea of communism went belly up, the Soviet empire collapsed, and the threat of global nuclear war vanished.

<P>
<CENTER><HR WIDTH=50%></CENTER>
<P>
<DD><B>Joshua Muravchik:</B> Just as a body of conservative opinion was unable to reconcile itself with "that man in the White House" (FDR), a mirror-image body of liberal opinion has treated Reagan in the same way, utterly blind to the greatness of his presidency, which deserves to be ranked with Roosevelt's. Never mind the accumulated federal debt, nor even the pathetic self-deception about trading arms for hostages. The big picture is that Reagan assumed office when America's Cold War strategy of containment was crumbling, and its morale and self-confidence was at a nadir. Reagan reversed all that and led us to victory over the mightiest foe we have ever faced.

<P>
<DD><B>George H. Nash:</B> As the 1980s recede into history, three achievements of Ronald Reagan loom larger. In a time of dangerous drift and malaise, he restored Americans' sense of self-confidence and greatness. He transmuted American conservatism from theory to practice, undermined the intellectual pretensions of long-regnant liberalism, and decisively shifted the paradigm of political discourse for the rest of the 20th century. Above all, he mobilized the resources -- rhetorical, military, and diplomatic -- that put Soviet communism on the road to extinction. As time passes, Reagan's stature rises -- a sure sign that he will be remembered as one of our most successful and important presidents.

<P>
<CENTER><HR WIDTH=50%></CENTER>
<P>
<DD><B>Alonzo L. Hamby:</B> In general, historians probably should abstain from ranking presidents elected during their adult lifetimes. They are, after all, no more exempt from ideological conviction and partisan inclination than the regular contributors to the New York Times op-ed page. In practice, however, none of us observe that rule, so here goes.

<P>
<DD>When passions cool after a generation or so, Ronald Reagan will be widely accepted by historians as a near-great chief executive. The faults of his presidency have been amply publicized. Supply-side economics was at best a partial success, because the president was better at talking about reducing government than actually accomplishing the goal; the result was a manageable but undeniably burdensome increase in the national debt. Americans, moreover, while not wanting a president to be a micromanager, generally expect a higher degree of engagement than Reagan demonstrated with many of the issues of his presidential tenure. Yet Reagan uplifted a depressed national spirit with his rhetoric, revived a sick economy, and established a policy course that won the Cold War. He may not end up on Mount Rushmore, but more than any other president since Truman, he will be a contender.

<center><h1>The Future of Conservatism</h1>
<p>
<H3>An Address<br>
by<br>
Malcolm Wallop</h3></center>
<p>

The future of conservatism, which seemed so clear and promising after
the 1994 elections, has been made dim and uncertain by the results of
the 1996 elections and even more so by the dismal campaign waged by Bob
Dole and Jack Kemp. While some conservatives may be approaching the next
few years fearfully, I believe that during the ferocious battles that
are sure to take place over President Clinton's conversion of power into
money, the conservative movement has a rare opportunity to instruct
itself and the country about the necessary consequences of discretionary
government power, and hence about the difference between government as
it has been practiced since the New Deal and the way of life established
by the Founding Fathers. The future of conservatism will depend in no
small part on what we do with this historic opportunity.<p>

In our time, government has become the main source of America's
troubles. It deprives us of freedom and self rule, makes us poorer, sows
strife among us, undermines our families, and debases our souls. Hence
my main theme is that the practical, everyday mission of American
conservatism must be to cut back the size and scope of government. But
before I consider conservatisms mission, two distinctions must be
made.<p>

First, we must be clear that conservatism and the Republican Party are
different and distinguishable. While the Republican Party may well deny
its birthright, conservatism is a permanent part of the American
landscape because the American people will always feel the need for
protection against the excesses of their leaders. Nowhere in the recent
lamentable campaign was this difference more noticeable than in
California, where the California Civil Rights Initiative, a basic
reaffirmation of equality before the law, withstood a titanic campaign
by proud, powerful, united left wing groups as well as by a thoroughly
split and embarrassed Democratic Party. It won by ten points while the
Republican candidate, down by double digits, waited until the final week
to associate himself with the issue, and then weakly.<p>

The Republican leadership's unwillingness to ride a horse that was
obviously heading for victory, a horse that was so rightly its own,
indicts its elementary political competence, as well as its commitment
to conservative principles. This was also all too clear with regard to
the rest of the so-called social issues. The political consultants of
the Washington Beltway who now have in their bank accounts the millions
contributed by the Republican rank and file, and the Warren Rudmans, the
Christine Whitmans, indeed the Alfonse D'Amatos and even the Jack Kemps
and Newt Gingriches, along with the Republican political committees, all
tacitly accepted the liberals' premise that the voters disapprove of the
conservative vision of American society. In their view, piety,
propriety, responsibility, standing for the rights of citizens and
families against bureaucratic encroachment are the hallmarks of
"extremism," and so the Republican leadership pressed upon candidates
nationwide an agenda best characterized as Rockefeller
Republicanismfiscal astringency combined with claims of superior
competence in management, and guilty protestations of "moderation."<p>

Meanwhile, President Clinton and the Democrats baldly cast themselves as
the defenders of families, religion, indeed of "our values" against dark
forces threatening them. According to exit polls, some 25 percent of
self-described conservatives and a big majority of self- described
moderates, most of whom share the cultural premises of conservatism,
voted for him. I stress that Clinton was able to occupy this
conservative ground only because the Republicans vacated it. The
cynically counterfeit character of Clintons appeal to cultural
conservatism could have been blasted away by a single picture of a
partial birth abortion, or by a pointed reference to Romer v. Evans, or
by a real commitment to tax reduction. But a Republican leadership
afraid of the California Civil Rights Initiative could not be expected
to take on such issues. Republican candidates prospered to the extent
that they disregarded the leadership's advice.<p>

Let me draw an even more important dimension of this distinction.
Compare if you will Bill Clinton's victory speech of 1996 with Richard
Nixons statement, after the 1968 election, "Watch what we do, not what
we say." Nixon was signaling none too subtly that he would give only lip
service to the conservative principles on which he had been elected, and
that in the substance of his decisions he would satisfy the liberal, big
government constituencieswhich in fact he did with decisions on
welfare, affirmative action, the environment, and court appointments for
which we are still paying today. But in 1996 Bill Clinton did the very
opposite. He gave his rhetoric to the opposition. For example, he spoke
passionately about school uniforms, something he can and will do nothing
about (nor should he), while quietly but tenaciously defending the
monopoly of the teacher's unions (the Democratic Party's most powerful
constituency) over most of American education. He spoke tearfully about
his devotion to families, while rewarding the sex education industry,
the entertainment industry, and the government workers of this country
in every practical way available to him. While Clintonian and Nixonian
duplicity are equally immoral, the Nixonian pragmatism of the Republican
establishment has the additional liability of being stupid.<p>

My second distinction concerns the self-definition of American
conservatism. The character of conservatism is not written in the stars.
It is subject to change for the better or the worse. It could just as
easily come to resemble the small and mean-minded thing we see nowadays
in Europe as it could the conservatism of Reagan, Goldwater, Coolidge,
Lincoln, Clay, the Adamses, and Washington.<p>

Lest I be mistaken as an uncritical admirer of California conservatives,
let me tell you how disappointed I was two years ago to watch the
success of an initiative that denied state services to illegal
immigrants. Proponents had an important pointthose who are here
illegally should have no lawful claim on any services. But few deny that
the overwhelming majority of illegal immigrants sustain themselves by
hard work, and that thus they contribute more to the real economy than
they take from it. The real impetus behind the initiative lay in the
public's rightful frustration with the growing cost of social services.
But the harsh political fact is that by far the biggest share of those
costs is imposed by native-born Americans, by the recipients of benefits
and above all by providers of benefits. Anyone proposing to really cut
the cost of government must face the kind of vilification that the
Democrats visited on the Republicans in the latest campaign. Illegal
immigrants were by definition without political power, and hence were an
inviting target. Do not misunderstand me; I am not advocating opening
the borders, though it is true that if by a magic wand I could trade
domestic welfare addicts for foreign workers I would do it. My concern
is with the character of American conservatism. I know all too well that
in Europe conservatives long ago gave up the principled battle against
the welfare state, became just another set of claimants, and have taken
up the anti- immigrant cause, not without racism. If you want to see a
conservatism more niggardly and with less of a future than Nixon's,
Dole's, Pete Wilsons, or Christine Whitman's, just go to Europe.<p>

The American conservative tradition, which began with Washington and
Adams, is founded on a concern for character. No phrase came from
Washington more often than, "We have a national character to establish."
Following Aristotle, Cato the Elder, Livy, and Montesquieu, George
Washington repeated that the Republic could only be built on the firm
foundations of private morality. John Adams surveyed the world's peoples
and found that only in America were there the habits that had
undergirded freedom in a few ancient republics. The Founding Fathers
crafted our institutions, limited government foremost among them, to
encourage those habits. Abraham Lincolns chief objection to the
acceptance of slavery was precisely that it undermined such habits,
namely the expectation of human equality and the honor due to labor. Nor
can anyone read the writings of Calvin Coolidge without noting the same
sober faith, founded on the virtue of the American people, that had
characterized his illustrious predecessors. These and many other sources
of the American conservative tradition knew precisely what the habits
necessary to the health of the Republic were, and they crafted their
political careers to fostering them. The government established by the
Founders did not make us moral, but it took pains to be on the right
side of the great moral questions.<p>

That is why it hurts so to listen to the debased discourse of the last
two presidential campaigns. Trustees of the character of the world's
most virtuous people, a people whose ways have been under attack by
their own government, the leaders of the Republican Partya party whom
the American people by and large elected to stand on their side against
the forces of immoral big governmenthave trivialized the issues into
slogans such as "family values." Such slogans explain nothing, energize
no one, are easily co-opted, and quickly get the ridicule they deserve.
Truly, America is likelier to get family values at Wal-Mart than from a
Republican leadership unable to articulate just what they are and what
threatens them.<p>

Republicans did themselves and the country a disservice in 1996 by
talking about the "character issue" without ever mentioning Bill
Clintons specific misdeeds, and above all, without explaining what
about them is wrong. During the coming months, Kenneth Starr and the
grand jury will surely fill in some legal blanks. But they cannot make
the essential political point. The conversion of power into money, or
sex for that matter, is the inevitable result of big government. Big
government is inherently lawless because it necessarily runs on
discretionary power over people's lives. No scheme is conceivable that
could restrain any official entrusted with the power that Bill Clinton
had in Arkansas, or has in Washington. The moral of the story must be
that in America today there are literally thousands of officials with
such opportunities and that putting a few in jail now and again will not
stop our becoming a nation of insiders and aspiring insiders. Corruption
can be fought only by restricting the opportunities to profit from
it.<p>

Now to the main point: today government at all levels taxes, spends and
regulates roughly twice as much as when I grew up. It touches every
aspect of our lives and harms just about everything it touches. It will
fine you for not wearing a seat belt, but will not protect your life
from criminals. It will deliver contraceptives to your children, but
cannot deliver the mail. It prohibits a Jewish community in New York
from having a school districtwho knows what politically incorrect
things their kids might learn from reading the Bibleand it forces the
culture of abortion on the whole country. In the name of racial
equality, the government forces us to discriminate on the basis of race.
And in the name of environmental protection, the government orders
farmers to stop using their land to grow food.<p>

Once upon a time, our government was a bulwark against domestic enemies.
Now, big government has become our chief domestic enemy. Examples are
numerous, but one has only to look at the FBIonce the paragon of
American institutions, and now shamelessly political. Witness their
treatment of Richard Jewell in Atlanta, their illicit complicity in
seeking to frame employees of the White House travel office, and their
complicity in supplying 900 FBI files on political opponents of the
Democrats.<p>

This country was peaceful and secure not because the streets were
patrolled by government agents, but because citizens enforced high
standards of civil behavior, because citizens were armed and protected
their own property, and because local police were highly responsive to
the demands of local citizens. This country was wealthy not because of
its natural resources (the Indians had lived in violent
semi-starvation), nor because government gave us this or that, nor
because government forced wages up, nor because it granted privileges to
favorite companies. Americans created more wealth than the world had
ever known because government in America protected property rights more
zealously, taxed less, regulated less, and gave fewer privileges than
any other government in history.<p>

This country became a world power not because there are so many of us
(the Chinese are six times as numerous), or because we are so rich (the
European Union has a bigger economy), or because we have so many weapons
(Russia has more). Our numbers, our wealth, and our weapons became
military power because the American people are more patriotic and more
apt to think that we have a duty to do what is right and reasonable than
any other people in the world. And we became powerful because until
recently our leaders honored the American people's religion and
manlinesshow quaint that word sounds in the age of Clinton and
Gingrichand because they themselves served in the armed forces.<p>

With each passing year, however, this country resembles less and less
what the Founders left us and looks more and more like the countries our
immigrant forefathers tried to get away from. This is happening in large
part because the people who run our government, our universities, our
media, the entertainment industry, the arts, and so forth have used the
enormous powers of the U. S. government to make it happen.<p>

But why? What do they have against us?<p>

They think our patriotism is unsophisticated at best, and chauvinism at
worst. They thought our opposition to communism was dangerous and
anti-progressive. The current generation of American leaders thought
that we were on the wrong side in the Vietnam War. Military service is
the rare exception in the families of those who have the most to say
about putting Americans in harm's way. They clearly do not understand
the country they rule, but do not serve. They say that America is
nothing special, and that our troops ought to do the bidding of the
United Nations. Moreover, our patriotism exalts qualities that they
abhor: manliness, righteousness, the capacity to use force.<p>

They dislike the American people's prosperity. It is the policy of the
U. S. government that the American people consume too much of the
world's resources. But whether the excuse is the environment, or
poverty, or crime, the recipe is always the same: take money away from
independent working people and give it to the favorites of the governing
class. Of course, this is a recipe for economic decline. Let me remind
you that nowhere in the writings of the Founding Fathers is there
anything about "managing the economy." Our Founders wanted to promote
prosperity. So they set about ensuring that government would be small,
frugal, impartial, and moral. We became rich because government, in
Jeffersons words, would not "take from the mouth of labor the bread it
had earned." If we abandon the Founders' mores, no economic policy can
keep us out of the poorhouse.<p>

Our leaders dislike our tradition of self-government. They equate local
control of crime with brutality and racism. Local zoning is racism.
Local control of schools is racist. We are all racistsexcept they. They
have turned laws that prohibit racial discrimination into mandates for
racial preferences in everything from school admissions to congressional
districting, to hiring and firing and promotions, contracting, insurance
and lending. A whole industry has grown up to administer this American
form of apartheid. If you want your town or business to stay out of
trouble nowadays, you need highly paid, well-connected human relations
specialists. But in the end this has nothing to do with race and
everything to do with politics. The people who run this country are
still by and large white men, who are not about to give up their own
privileges to anybody. In the name of racial justice, and at the price
of racial harmony, they are increasing their own power to privilege
their friends at the expense of everyone else, and to diminish
competition for themselves.<p>

The people who run this country don't care about public safety. Having
made it very difficult for States and localities to police themselves,
having left ordinary citizens with no choice but to protect themselves
as best they can, the people who run this country are now trying to take
our guns away. In fact they blame us and our guns for crime. This is so
wrong that it cannot be an honest mistake.<p>

The people who run this country do not care that our children are being
diseducated, that schools are becoming factories of ignorance and decay.
Every proposal regarding education that has come out of the
establishment has called for more money. Over the past thirty years we
have tripled the amount of money that we pay to the public schools per
pupil, in real terms. And guess what? Not only has educational
performance dropped like a rock everywhere, but it dropped worst where
we spent most. The places where kids are not being hurt too badly, where
test scores are highest, are out in the sticksin places like Utah,
Iowa, and Wyoming, where the establishment has not yet been able fully
to implement its model. Maybe we hicks arent so stupid after all. But
the establishment continues to want money, tries to grab more control,
and keeps looking down on us.<p>

Above all, the people who run this country have deep contempt and enmity
for the culture on which it rests. They tell us we are zealots if we
talk about social issues like abortion, education, homosexuality, race
relations and the role of religion in public life. I say, what else is
worth talking about? They say, concentrate on the economy. But I repeat
the Founding Fathers' lesson: economic prosperity comes from the
morality and sense of responsibility of the population, as well as from
small government. It comes from the culture, not from recipes dreamed up
in government offices or think tanks. Try restoring a sense of personal
responsibility in this country while keeping it perfectly legal to trash
a baby you have conceived, or give it over to the state for safekeeping.
I think Lincoln would warn us against expecting that any sort of
prosperity, never mind decency, could be built on such views of
responsibility and human life. <p>

Again, can education serve even to turn out competent workers, never
mind decent citizens, if it continues to stress condoms over continence
and relativism over religion? And again, are we going to be healthy
economicallynever mind in other waysif our establishment keeps on
talking and spending as if "alternative families" and "alternative
lifestyles" were on the same moral plane as mom, dad and the kids? Not a
chance. It is all too easy to list the ways in which the U. S.
government is providing incentives to break up families, to put
generations and races at war with one another, to devalue honest work,
to dumb-down and coarsen children, for bureaucrats to seek their own
interest, for businesses to court regulators, to seek protection, and
the public be damned. It is also easy enough, as well as satisfying, to
discuss remedies for all these phenomena.<p>

We can and should end welfarenot "as we know it". Just end it, period.
Charity for those who deserve it is something with a long and honorable
history. But the short history of welfare tells us that it does no good,
only harm, and that the current touted reform bill has enough loopholes
that administrators and recipients will be able to do business pretty
much as before. We can and should eliminate Social Security and replace
it with private savings obviously people who are already retired should
get every penny already promised. But just imagine if every penny
deducted from us henceforth went into individual retirement accounts. We
could all look forward to a lot more money, and the government would
have a lot less to spend from day to day.<p>

For the monsters of Medicare and Medicaid, we can and should substitute
individual medical savings accounts backed up by vouchers.<p>

We can be rid of the monstrous educational establishment by giving
parents vouchers for whatever amount any level of government taxes them
to educate their children.<p>

We can be rid of the most noxious parts of the university world by
cutting all direct aid to higher education and substituting tuition
scholarships to individual students, which they must repay. Where this
scheme has been tried in Chile, students deserted rotten professors in
droves.<p>

We can re-establish the crucial line between what is mine or yours and
what is the governments by replacing the counter-productive Endangered
Species Act and other failed environmental laws with conservation
programs that do not violate the peoples rights to property. By
respecting property rights, we will actually do a better job of
protecting the environment because we will stop making enemies out of
Americas landowners.<p>

We can stop our tax system's pressure against families by increasing
deductions for children. Perhaps those moms who want to will be able to
raise their own children again. We can be rid of the terrible,
tyrannical bureaucracy of the IRS and of all the distorting inequities
and privileges of the system by simply instituting a flat tax.<p>

We can restore self-government by reducing the power of the federal
courts to review the acts of State courts and the enactments of State
legislatures. The Founding Fathers wrote Article 3, Section 2 of the
Constitution precisely to make sure that the judiciary would be, in
Alexander Hamilton's words, "the least dangerous branch." Now that the
courts have become a clear and present danger to our democracy, it is
time to use the Founders' remedy. Shrinking the government would yield
many specific benefits. But these are not the main reasons why we should
cut government.<p>

We want to cut taxes not primarily because doing so will put more money
in our pockets, but principally because it will put the means of freedom
in our hands. We want to cut the governments power to grant privilege,
not primarily because privilege is economically inefficient, but because
we dont want to be a nation of favor-seekers. We want to keep and bear
our guns not because we want to shoot somebody, but because we have an
irreducible right to take care of ourselves. Moral leadership, today as
in 1789, does not mean that the President of the United States forces
anyone to go to church or synagogue. But it does mean that by word and
deed he leads the country in giving unto God the things that are God's.
According to the current Supreme Court, Abraham Lincolns proclamation
of Thanksgiving Day would be unconstitutional. I say that Lincoln knew
better, and that recent Supreme Court decisions on religion, and on many
other matters, are unconstitutional.<p>

This country faces a choice between two radically opposed views of
itself and of the good life. On one side is the view many of us grew up
with, the view of the Founders, the way of life of most families in this
country. On the other is the view you can read in the pages of Time
magazine, the New York Times, and most of the rest of the prestige
press. This is the view that animates the U. S. government. The great
question of our time is whether government will continue to work against
the original American way of life, or will switch and support it as it
once did. The only possible way of enabling government to make this
switch, I think, is to cut it down to a small fraction of its current
size. Now, this is an issue that transcends parties. It is an issue
that, most likely, will cause a realignment of parties, or even the
death of one or both of our current parties and the birth of a new one.
All of that is not so important. The only important thing is that the
American people and the American way of life be defended against their
enemies, and that they be defended worthily. Conservatism could if only
conservatism would.<p>

<title>The Balanced Budget Amendment -- An Idea Whose Time Has Come</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<p>
<center><h1>The Balanced Budget Amendment -- An Idea Whose Time Has Come</h1>
<p>
<H3>by<br>
J. Kenneth Blackwell<br>
Monday, January 13, 1996</h3></center>
<p>

Every generation or so, an idea which requires amendment or
reinterpretation of the Constitution comes along.<p>

Just over two hundred years ago, the idea was the Bill of Rights --
adopted to make sure American citizens would never be subject to
arbitrary federal intrusions on their liberty.<p>

In the aftermath of the Civil War, the idea was embodied in the 13th,
14th and 15th amendments -- abolishing slavery, conferring citizenship
and extending voting rights to a sizable and productive segment of our
society.<p>

In the first two decades of the twentieth century, the idea was women's
suffrage. In the middle decades, the idea was fulfilling the promises of
the 13th through 15th amendments.<p>

The idea now is the Balanced Budget amendment.<p>

In My American Journey, Colin Powell says correctly that the "great
domestic challenge of our time is to reconcile the necessity for fiscal
responsibility with the explosive growth in entitlement programs," and
that we have to face up to reducing the entitlement system or raise
taxes to pay for it. We cannot continue to pass on to "your children and
grandchildren the crushing debt that we are currently amassing as their
inheritance."<p>

Nobody these days is expressing much disagreement with the General's
point. Eliminating the deficit is the motherhood issue of the '90's.
Everybody is in favor of it. The question I ask opponents of a balanced
budget amendment is, if they are so in favor of motherhood, what do they
have against marriage. I.e., why should we not solemnize with a
constitutional contract our commitment to do what they agree must be
done about our spending?<p>

Two of William F. Buckley's current Firing Line series feature the
balanced budget amendment. I was part of the team supporting it; the
other side was led by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. I think most
observers would agree that nobody opposing the amendment is likely to
grasp and articulate the arguments more effectively than he, so it
follows for me that if his points can be addressed, the case for the
amendment is made.<p>

The Senator asserts we should not try to solve every political problem
by tinkering with the Constitution. True, but if it were not for some
tinkering in 1913, the Senator would now occupy his office only if he
were able to campaign as effectively among members of the upper house of
the New York legislature as he does among the state's registered voters.
We have been trying to fix the deficit problem with legislative action
for more than twenty years, but our legislative and executive branches
have not had the political will to get it done. Some political problems
can be solved only by amendment. The 17th Amendment was not tinkering,
and neither is the Balanced Budget amendment.<p>

The Senator noted that states have become dependent on federal monies,
and he asked what the impact of the amendment would be on Ohio. The
answer is it will be a $2.4 billion hit, or about eight percent of the
state's budget. Cutting spending enough to make up for this loss will
not be fun, but we are already making plans to do it, and other states
can do the same.<p>

Opponents say the federal budget is too complex, that a workable
amendment simply cannot be drafted. If they really believed that, we
would not be having this debate. The opponents would pass it, watch it
fall of its own weight, spread around the wreckage, and blame proponents
for a dumb plan. Forty-eight states have a working balanced budget
requirement. It is precisely because it can be made to work at the
federal level that they are so against it.<p>

Opponents say an ironclad amendment would leave us unable to come up
with funds to fight wars or recessions. One sentence from the 14th
amendment will dispose of this objection: "Congress may, by a vote of
two-thirds of each house, remove such a disability." And if two- thirds
of each house cannot be persuaded to agree, then maybe the bills for
such wars or economic problems are not ones we should leave for our
grandchildren.<p>

The historian Henry Brooks Adams wrote in 1907 in The Education of Henry
Adams that "Practical politics consists in ignoring facts."<p>

With the amendment, our elected representatives at the federal level
will have to choose between offending taxpayers by paying for programs
as we go or offending important constituencies by facing the fact that
we cannot afford their programs. With no amendment, our politicians can
meet the Adams test of practicality by continuing to ignore the fact
that their programs are affordable only if we stick generations to come
with the tab.<p>

The only salient questions about a Balanced Budget amendment have been
asked before in the context of all the other amendments.<p>

If not us, who? If not now, when?<p>

The questions are unanswerable for opponents of the amendment. For
proponents, the answers are clear: The who is us. And the time is
now.<p>

<blockquote>
Potomac, MD, November 12, 1996</b> -- The Phillips Foundation today announced that it is now accepting applications for the 1997 Phillips Foundation Journalism Fellowship Program.  Working journalists with less than five years of professional experience in print journalism are eligible to apply.  The Phillips Foundation offers one full-time $50,000 fellowship and two part-time $25,000 fellowships to undertake and complete a one-year project of the applicant's 
choosing focusing on journalism supportive of American culture and a free society.
<p>
The Phillips Foundation is a non-profit organization founded in 1990 to advance the cause of objective journalism in several ways, including this annual journalism fellowship.  The Foundation established this program to provide grants for projects to be undertaken by working print journalists who share the Foundation's mission to advance constitutional principles, a democratic society and a vibrant free enterprise system.  The Foundation awarded two fellowships in 1996:  a full-time fellowship to Stacy Mattingly for her proposal to write a book on a highly-charged school prayer case in northern Mississippi; and a part-time fellowship to Daniel Richardson to write a series of articles on the growing Patriot movement in America.
<p>
The three Trustees of the Phillips Foundation serve as judges for this annual competition.  The Trustees include:  Thomas L. Phillips, President and Chief Executive Officer of Phillips Publishing International, Inc.; Robert D. Novak, prominent national journalist and author of one of the longest running syndicated columns in the country; and Alfred S. Regnery, a Washington attorney and President of Regnery Publishing, Inc., a Washington, D.C.-based book publishing firm.
<p>
The Foundation is looking for journalism projects which are both original and publishable.  The winning projects will be delivered in four installments with the potential to be published sequentially in a periodical or all together as a book.<p>

Applications are now being accepted for the 1997 Phillips Foundation Journalism Fellowship.  Applications must be postmarked by March 1, 1997. The winner will be announced on May 6, 1997 at an awards dinner in Washington, D.C.  The starting date for the fellowship will be September 1, 1997.  Applicants must be citizens of the United States.
<p>
For an application, contact:  The Phillips Foundation, 7811 Montrose Road

<b>This was originally posted to the Town Hall Forum (#3474)</b>
<P>

    TO: MY DEMOCRAT FRIENDS <P>
    FROM: MARK F. (THOR) HEARNE, II<P>
    DATE: OCTOBER 11, 1996<P>
    RE: THE CASE FOR CHARACTER<P>
<P>
<blockquote>
"Bill Clinton would rather climb a tree to tell a lie than stand on the ground to tell the truth." So said an Arkansas official familiar with Clinton on CNN during the 1992 presidential campaign. Democratic Senator Bob Kerry has said, "Clinton is an unusually good liar. Unusually good. Do you realize that?" Senator Kerry did not make this observation during the heat of a primary battle but this past January in Esquire Magazine. Kerry is not only a Democratic Senator, but is also a leader of his party and Chairman of the Democrat Senatorial Campaign Committee. Senator Kerry knows whereof he speaks. 
<P>
Forget what this says about Clinton - what does it say about us. We are told that Clinton is leading by a significant margin in his campaign to be our next president. (51% to Dole's 38% according to last week's Wall Street Journal/ABC poll.) We are told that "character" does not count. We are told that a candidate's "personal life" has no relevance to the office of President and has no "traction" as a political issue. Indeed, we are even made to feel ashamed for raising the issue. (On July 15th Clinton said, "I think character is a legitimate issue and I look forward to having that discussion." But, whenever the issue of character is mentioned Clinton dodges the discussion by claiming any question about his character is a viscous, Republican-motivated "personal attack.") 
<P>
    Consider the current best seller list. A list which includes an astounding number of books about the
    corruption of the Clinton administration. Boy Clinton, Unlimited Access and Blood Sport are
    only a few. But let's concede Clinton the benefit of his denials and explanations. Taking only those facts Clinton has acknowledged, and even
    granting him his spin on these facts, Clinton is far and away the most dishonest president or presidential candidate in the history of our nation. 
<P>
    Let us assume that only 10% of what is reported about Bill Clinton is true. Assume that only 10% of the reports of drug use, rampant promiscuity, financial fraud,  and blatant violations of state and federal law are accurate. Assume only 10% of the Wall Street Journal's four year, two volume documentation of Whitewater, Travelgate and FBI Filegate is not innuendo and conjecture. Assume that Clinton's unlikely explanation of Whitewater is correct. (It wasn't a crooked deal to funnel taxpayer guaranteed funds from a Savings and Loan into his political campaign. Rather, we are told, Bill and Hillary, naive in matters of money -- notwithstanding Hillary's wildly successful commodities speculation -- were duped by the crafty McDougalls into a foolish real estate investment scheme funded by kited checks and illegal loans. Frankly, even if valid, I fail to find any comfort in this explanation. Do we want a sharp crook or a financially unsophisticated waif in charge of our national economy?) 
<P>
    Granted even these assumptions, impeachment should be likely, reelection unthinkable. Consider the following: 
<P>
        Richard Nixon's administration collapsed, Nixon resigned the presidency and Chuck Colson
        was jailed over misuse of only one FBI file and the related cover-up. By contrast, Clinton and
        Craig Livingstone spirited away the FBI files of their political opponents by the hundreds,  and the
        cover-up and stone-walling continues. 
<P>
        Spiro Agnew resigned the Vice-Presidency over charges of tax evasion stemming from
        $16,000 he accepted from contractors when he was Governor of Maryland. By contrast,
        Clinton has conceded that he filed misleading tax returns that did not properly disclose illegal
        loans made by a now-defunct S&L,  the proceeds of which were used in his campaign for
        Governor. The reason he was not charged with tax evasion was that he released the tax returns
        after the statute of limitations had expired. Equally well established is the fact that Hillary
        enjoyed more than $100,000 in "profits" from commodities trading orchestrated
        by Tyson Foods in exchange for favorable treatment accorded Tyson Foods by her husband, 
        then the Governor. 
<P>
        Gary Hart bowed out of the 1988 presidential race because of one wild weekend in the
        Bahamas and a sleep-over in Washington DC. By contrast, Clinton is being sued in federal
        court for enticing a young woman - against her wishes -- into his hotel room, dropping his
        trousers and suggesting she engage in a lurid sex act. Clinton's known sex-partners could form
        a single-file line longer than the inaugural parade route. (At least JFK was honest about his
        philandering. During a 1961 meeting in Bermuda with British Prime Minister Harold McMillian
        Kennedy said, "I wonder how it is with you, Harold? If I don't have a woman for three days, I get terrible headaches.") 
<P>
        Ginsburg is not a member of the US Supreme Court because he used marijuana during
        college. By contrast, during Clinton's term national drug use has doubled due to Clinton's
        eviscerating drug enforcement. Remember also Jocelyn Elders, Clinton's selection for Surgeon
        General. In addition to her crusade to distribute condoms (for which she earned the moniker
        "the Rubber Maid") and to have mast. taught in public schools, she campaigned for the
        legalization of drugs. During her term as Clinton's Surgeon General, Elders son was convicted
        of felony cocaine and crack distribution. (If she couldn't keep her own son from pushing
        crack, how could she be expected to reduce national drug use?) It is simply beyond belief
        that, with someone of Elder's views as his pick for the nation's chief medical officer, Clinton
        expects us to believe he truly wants to battle illegal drugs. 
<P>
        On a personal level Clinton acknowledges that he used marijuana but claims he "didn't inhale".
        Yet in an MTV interview with high school students Clinton states that if he had it do over again
        he, "probably should have inhaled." Roger Clinton described his brother's appetite for cocaine
        by stating, "He (Bill Clinton) has a nose like a Hoover." (Referring to the vacuum cleaner not
        the president who preceded Roosevelt.) But, we can discount this allegation because Roger
        Clinton, along with Friend Of Bill Dan Lasater, have been convicted of felony drug charges for
        the distribution of cocaine. 
<P>
    (As an entry for the "How'd They Do That" file consider this: Roger Clinton served only two years
    for his cocaine distribution charges and Dan Lasater served only six months. Roger cut a deal with
    the prosecutor to testify against Lasater. Lasater was convicted but pardoned by Governor Clinton.
    (Clinton says the pardon was so Lasater could qualify for a hunting license.) However, even as
    Lasater was being investigated for drug dealing Clinton's Arkansas Finance Authority awarded
    Lasater authority to underwrite a $30 million bond issue. An undertaking for which Lasater pocketed
    $750,000. The purpose of this bond issue for which the state of Arkansas awarded $750,000 to a
    drug dealer? An Arkansas state police communication facility. Clinton's pardon of Lasater raises an
    interesting point. Why won't Clinton promise to not pardon Susan McDougal (who is currently in jail
    because she refuses to testify about Clnton's role in the Whitewater scandal) and other Whitewater
    defendants? Clinton has already indicated a willingness to put the power of a presidential pardon to a
    personal purpose. Clinton has pardoned Jack Pakis a Hot Springs, Arkansas bookie and close friend
    of the Clinton family. 
<P>
    Given this, why is Clinton the favored candidate for president? Have our standards for the office of
    president fallen this far this fast? What does it say about us and our esteem for our nation that we
    would trust Bill Clinton with the United State of America. 
<P>
    A question should be asked of each vice-presidential candidate in the upcoming debate. "Would you
    want your daughter to marry a man with the personal character of your running mate?" Recall the
    question to Mike Dukakis about how he would view the death penalty if his wife Kitty was raped.
    Well, why not a similar question to Hillary. How would she feel if Chelsea brought home a boyfriend
    with the same character and integrity as Bill Clinton? (Some may be upset with me for bringing Hillary
    into the discussion. After all, they may retort, she is not running for office. Would it have been fair
    they ask to deny Lincoln the presidency because Mary Todd was a lunatic? To which I reply, Yes, if
    Lincoln had threatened to put Mary Todd in charge of the Union Army as Clinton tried to do with
    Hillary and health care.) 
<P>
    Two responses, and only two responses, are possible. One, all the charges against Clinton are false
    and Clinton is, in truth, a noble and honest - though much maligned - man. (This is the official White
    House position.) Two, the charges are, in whole or part, true but it just doesn't matter. Clinton's
    character is irrelevant to his fitness to serve as president. 
<P>
    If you opt for option number one, "Clinton is a wrongly- maligned honest man", than you probably
    also thought O.J. Simpson was framed. Haley Barber's line, "Clinton may not believe anything, but his
    friends have convictions - for bank fraud, embezzlement, conspiracy..." resonates because it is true. 
<P>
    Two-thirds of the Rose law firm, the source of Clinton's closest colleagues including his wife, are either dead under suspicious circumstances (Vince Foster), in jail after serving in the Clinton
    administration (Webster Hubble) or under indictment or investigation by a special prosecutor
    (William Kennedy). A similar fate has befallen many of Clinton's other top advisors. Housing
    Secretary Henry Cisneros and Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy are currently subject to an independent counsel
    investigation; former Commerce Secretary Ron Brown was a subject of an independent counsel
    investigation prior to his death; Clinton understudy and friend Arkansas Governor Guy Tucker and
    Clinton business partners Jim and Susan McDougal have been jailed for 24 count conviction for bank fraud and
    conspiracy. Clinton testified on behalf of the McDougals and Governor Tucker. After the trial, jurors
    told reporters that they did not believe Clinton's testimony and several jurors stated that, based upon
    the evidence they considered, Clinton was definitely involved in the wrongdoing. 
<P>
    It is simply not possible to consider the incredible number of Friends Of Bill who are under
    indictment, under investigation by independent counsel, in jail or awaiting sentencing and conclude
    that all the charges against Clinton are false. 
<P>
    Clinton apologists reply that it is unfair to paint Clinton with the same brush as his jailed colleagues.
    Democrat Senator Chris Dodd claims that to view Clinton in light of his friends is to engage in "guilt
    by association". These defenders argue that Clinton has just suffered the misfortune of being
    surrounded by dishonest people and is not, himself, dishonest. This explanation, even if credible, is of
    little comfort. Do we want as president a man so lacking in judgment that he has a profoundly
    uncanny ability to choose as his closest advisors a collection of crooks and felons. 
<P>
    Bluntly put, Bill Clinton is an unmitigated, dissembling liar. What Clinton says is meant to deceive not
    to inform. During an interview on September 23rd with PBS's Jim Lehrer Clinton said, "There is not
    a single solitary shred of evidence of anything dishonest that I have done in my public life." Most of us
    hearing this proclamation would understand it to be a blanket denial of any wrongdoing. Clinton
    clearly intended to communicate this understanding. However, reread Clinton's statement. "There is
    not a single solitary shred of evidence...." Clinton does not deny dishonestly, rather he denies that
    there is any evidence of his dishonesty. Quite a different proposition. Continuing with a further
    qualification Clinton said, "...that I have done in my public life." The injection of "public life" presumes
    a distinction with Clinton's private life. Given the mountainous evidence of Clinton's dishonestly, we
    can only conclude that Clinton believes using drugs, funding his Arkansas gubernatorial campaigns,
    funding his presidential campaign, managing the White House travel office and FBI files and
    formulating national policy are all part of his private life. 
<P>
    Option Two, "Clinton is dishonest but character doesn't count when choosing the President", is
    equally untenable. Consider the purpose of the election. For starters, this November we will decide
    who will take the constitutionally prescribed oath next January. A candidate for president does not
    become president by winning the election. The candidate must also take the oath of office and does
    not become president until he does so. (Recall the photograph of Lyndon Johnson taking the oath of
    office in Air Force One on the tarmac in Dallas standing next to a blood- splattered Jackie
    Kennedy.) 
<P>
    We do not make much of oaths now days. Yet, the men who crafted our form of government,
    founded our nation and authored the Constitution placed great significance on oaths and,
    correspondingly, the integrity of the individual taking the oath. A man's honesty and integrity were
    vitally important to our founding fathers. Thomas Jefferson, founder of the Democrat party, wrote,
    "We mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor." Of what value is
    Bill Clinton's "sacred honor" and to what cause would he pledge it? (Obviously not his wife, nor his
    country when called to military service.) More importantly, would you believe him if he did? 
<P>
    This is a more troubling question for my principled liberal friends. (Especially for those who make so
    much of Republican scandals whether it be Watergate, Iran- Contra or the Teapot Dome.) The most
    outrageous Republican is a piker compared to the mythomaniacs, miscreants and poltroons which
    populate the Clinton administration. (Will someone please tell me George Stephanopoulos's job
    description and how whatever it is he does furthers the legitimate business of the presidency.) 
<P>
    Those Democrats who support Clinton (and their allies in the media who overlook the Clinton
    scandals) have lost the right to ever again mention Watergate, Iran-Contra or any other allegation of
    Republican corruption. 
<P>
    Most liberals acknowledge Clinton's fundamental dishonesty. However, they appear willing to
    tolerate or overlook his moral failings because they believe Clinton will advance a liberal ideology and
    Bob Dole will oppose the liberal's agenda. But, in choosing Clinton as their standard bearer, what are
    liberals saying about their own integrity and the validity of their ideology? 
<P>
    How can the noble ideals proffered by the liberal be reconciled with the tawdry and untrustworthy
    reputation of their candidate? What does is say about the validity of liberalism that the adherents
    chosen advocate is a consummate fraud? In choosing Clinton as their candidate (a candidate who
    liberals support because they believe he will govern with a liberal bent even though he publicly
    campaigns as a conservative) aren't liberals saying that their agenda is best advanced by disguising
    and concealing their ideology and, by implication, recognizing that if American voters truly
    appreciated the liberal agenda they will reject the ideology? 
<P>
    If I believed I had a worthy policy to advance I would not choose an unworthy spokesman to
    advance the policy lest the message be sullied by the messenger. If I was trying to sell a drug to cure
    cancer I wouldn't choose Jack Kevorkian to be my spokesman. 
<P>
    Indeed, Clinton's failure to keep the faith even with political bed-mates is why two high-ranking
    administration officials resigned when Clinton signed the Republican welfare reform bill that
    he had previously promised to veto. Abandoning Clinton is the only rational response available
    to honest liberals who truly believe in the merits of their ideology. 
<P>
        Others don't defend Clinton but disparage us.  They argue:
<P>
    "So what if Clinton lies, uses drugs and cheats on his spouse, most American's behave this way and it
    is hypocritical to hold a leader to a standard higher than the standard by which we measure our own
    behavior." 
<P>
    While I don't agree that Clinton's behavior is characteristic of the typical American, I will grant this
    point for the sake of argument. Granted even that assertion, I dispute the central premise. Americans
    aspire to greatness and have always been an optimistic people. Our leaders should be the best from
    among us not the worst. 
<P>
     The political results of a second Clinton term are certainly to be feared.  However, an even sadder result of a Clinton reelection would be that a majority of
    Americans would seem to believe that a man of Clinton's integrity is representative of the character of our nation. 
<P>
    It has been said that hypocrisy is vice's tribute to virtue. Well, if so, Clinton should be Master of
    Ceremonies for a Telethon for Virtue. Within hours of being elected president Clinton proclaimed
    that his administration would be the most ethical ever. This promise was made in the context of
    Clinton's campaign attacks upon the Bush administration that it claimed was unethical. 
    Clinton called attention to a State Department official who allegedly tried to pull Clinton's visa file to document Clinton's trip to the Soviet Union; a trip that was made while Clinton was leading anti-American rallies overseas. Clinton was "shocked" at the Bush campaign's "outrageous" use of official personnel and records to gain an advantage on a political adversary. Ironically,  Clinton can not understand why everyone seems so outraged by the hundreds of FBI files on Republican opponents that he and Craig
    Livingston had squirreled away in the White House. 
<P>
    What does it mean when the victor of this fall's campaign will take the oath of office to lead our
    nation into the next millennium? For me I want to believe the man who places his hand on the Bible
    and says, "I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United
    States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United
    States." 
<P>
    November 5th is national examination day. The question is one of character. Not Clinton's character
    but our character; our character as a nation and as individual voters. And, if the answer is Bill
    Clinton, we all fail.

<title>ABIC - Term Limits To Be First Item of Business in New GOP-led Congress</title>

<h3>Speaker Promises to Make Term Limits
the First Item of Business<br>if the
GOP Retains Control of the House
<p>
</h3></center>
<p>
<i>This is the speech given by Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich on March 29, 1995 in the closing moments of the House Term Limits debate.  In it, the Speaker promises to make the Term Limits Amendment the first item of business, H.J.Res. 1, in the new Congress if the Republicans maintain control of the House.</i>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
I listened with great fascination to the extraordinarily articulate gentleman from Massachusetts (Rep. Barney Frank-D), and I tried to remember back to the platonic concern about the ability of one to argue any side of a question with equal facility. I looked up the word `sophistry'. 
<p>
A subtle, tricky, superficially plausible but generally fallacious method of reasoning. 
<p>
And I realized that speed of language is not the same as wisdom. Let me give just a few examples. 
<p>
This amendment does not preempt the States. It sets a cap. The Supreme Court will decide what that cap means, but the cap is not in any way worded to be binding and, in fact, in no way would change any of the current relationship of the States to their ability to do what they wish to do. 
<p>
I can assure the House that if the Supreme Court rules later on this year that the Congress need act, that we will visit that question and it may well be on a legislative rather than constitutional basis which will take 218 and not 290 votes. 
<p>
Let me say second that I believe this is a historic vote. I have been frankly surprised by our friends on the left. I would have thought, having been defeated last fall for the first time in 40 years, that paying some attention to the American people would have been useful. 
<p>
But I will tell you where I think we are historically. This is not a new experience in America. In the late 19th century, a radical idea emerged, that Senators should be elected by popular vote, that State legislatures should no longer select the Senators. This was a change in the Constitution, an effort to take power away from professional politicians, the State legislature, and return it to the people. 
<p>
It took about 20 years for the idea to permeate Washington. But in that 20-year period, it became obvious and even the most entrenched old-time political machine came to realize that in fact there was no alternative. 
<p>
I think term limits is a very similar pattern to the election of U.S. Senators. When it first came up, I rejected it. I am troubled by it. I think in some ways it is anti-democratic. I think that part of the argument is fair. On the other hand, from city council to county commission, to school board, to State legislature, to governor, to the Congress, everywhere in America the people say they are sick of the professional politicians, they are tired of
those who use the taxpayers' money to stay entrenched, and they want to find a device to take power back from the professional political class. They say it in New York City, they say it in Los Angeles. They say it in Idaho, they say it in Florida. Everywhere in America. 
<p>
Now, we are being visited tonight by the fifth grade from Cliffside School in Rutherford County, North Carolina. I would bet a great deal of money that by the time they are old enough to vote, we will have passed term limits, because in the end, the will of the American people is sovereign, no matter how much sophistry, and no matter how many reservations. The fact is that if over time in State after State in county after county the American people say this is an experiment they are willing to risk, sooner or later they will get their way. 
<p>
One of our good friends the gentleman from Montana got up and said. `This is the sound of the Contract dying.' Let me tell you, my friend, tonight 85 percent or more of the Republican Party will vote with the American people for term limits. My guess is tonight 60 to 70 percent of the Democratic party will vote against the American people and against term limits. We will go to the country in 1996 with a simple pledge. It will be a new version of the contract. We are not going to have one of these between now and 1997, but a new version. It will say H.J.Res. 1, Term Limits, will be voted on as the first item in the new Congress if we are the majority. 
<p>
The Democratic Party has it in its power tonight, if half the Democrats, only half, vote with 85 percent of the Republicans, term limits will pass tonight. It will take deliberate decision of the Democratic Party to deny the American people an opportunity, and we are not even fully passing it, we just send it to the Senate, then the Senate has to send it to the States. 
<p>
We are not afraid to allow the American people to have a chance in their State legislatures to render judgment. We are not afraid to allow the Senate to look at this amendment. But I can promise you, if the Democratic Party tonight defeats term limits, the Contract may have been postponed in one of its 10 items, but it will be back and when we have picked up enough additional seats in 1996, we will pass it as H.J.Res. 1 in 1997.

<h2>Term Limits Questions and Answers</h2>
</center>
<br>
Term Limits opponents often tend to ask the same questions over and over again.  ABIC has developed this page to help set aside some of the anti-term limit myths once and for all.  Below, you'll find some of the most frequently asked questions by opponents and our responses.  If you have any questions about this issue, please feel free to e-mail us and we'll try to answer your question, too!<p>
<br>
<b><i>"With congressional term limits, wouldn't we lose all that experience?"</b></i>
<p>
First of all, what has all that experience gotten us?  A huge federal deficit.  A spiraling federal debt.  Budget bills with little pork-barrel spending items that their sponsors know wouldn't pass on their own.  And a federal bureaucracy and a set of regulations that aren't serving the people and issues they were set up to serve.
<p>
Second, sure we have lots of members who have years of experience in that office.  But how many insightful intellects and energetic hearts have we lost because the process is so closed?  Who in his or her right mind would run against a 15- or 30-year incumbent?  Is Henry Hyde really the only person from north Chicago who can serve that constituency?  Is Vic Fazio really the only person in Sacramento qualified to serve the citizens of his district in the national legislature?  And if that expericnce is so wonderful, who's to say that it can't be used in another office, perhaps the other chamber of Congress or a statewide seat or the state legislature or even in the federal executive branch?
<p>
<br>
<b><i>"We have term limits--they are called elections."</b></i>
<p>
This assumes that today's elections are 100% open and fair, giving voters true choices.  Americans inside and outside the beltway know that the current electoral process is incredibly skewed toward the incumbent.  The financial and other advantages available to incumbents grossly tip the playing field toward incumbents, making it virtually impossible to have truly competitive electoral races.  The point of term limits is to open up the process.  Term limits will create more <i>open</i> and <i>fair</i> elections. 
<p>
<br>
<b><i>"What we really need is serious campaign finance reform."</b></i>
<p>
Everyone agrees that campaign finance reform is needed.  But that alone won't do it.  And no one believes that politicians will pass a law which makes it harder for them to win their elections.
<p>
There are several problems with some of the campaign finance reform ideas:  if you set a spending limit (the idea most discussed in political circles), instead of hurting the incumbent or even leveling the playing field, this actually helps the incumbent.  A challenger has to spend more than an incumbent just to break even: the incumbent already has much more name recognition, a franking ability, and so on.  Incumbents spend years serving their constituents.  When there's a flood, the local media interviews the congressman, senator and local officials to see what they are doing to help.  And so on.  The member communicates every so often with constituents to let them know what he/she is doing.  To a certain extent, this is part of the process of governing.  But it does give the incumbent an advantage that the challenger must overcome.  And spending limits will only hurt the challenger.
<p>
There is an interesting anecdote which illustrates this: Rep. Bob Inglis (R-SC) tells the story of his first campaign for the U.S. House in 1992.  Running against an incumbent, he was faced with all sorts of problems unique to challengers.  While the incumbent was invited to factory after factory, workplace after workplace, event after event, his campaign had to bite, pinch, scream, and kick to get invited to <i>one</i> factory.  Now he's invited to factories and workplaces all the time.  When he was running as a challenger, he had to spend his nights working at his law practice to keep his billable hours up to support his family while he campaigned during the day.  Meanwhile, his incumbent opponent was given a month's <i>recess</i> to come home and campaign <i>full-time</i>.
<p>
How does campaign finance reform help any of this?  We need <i>both</i> term limits and some <i>real</i> campaign finance reform.  And we won't get the latter without first having the former.
<p>
<br>
<b><i>"The 1994 elections proved that we don't need term limits."</b></i>
<p>
In the "revolutionary" 1994 elections, 90% of those incumbents who ran won.  In 1996, the rate was 95%.  The message to incumbents is: if you run, you have better than a 9 in 10 chance of winning.  The message to potential challengers is: if you run, you have less than a 1 in 10 chance--pretty poor odds if you're thinking about running for Congress against an incumbent.  Term limits are necessary to even the playing field.
<p>
<center>* * *</center><br>
<p>
The bottom line is that term limits will open up a process which is currently closed to average American citizens.  For example, in the current 105th Congress, 70% of the women serving in the House of Representatives were elected in open seats.  And 83% of the minorities in the House were elected in open seats.  Creating more open seats creates more opportunities for <i>all</i> Americans to participate in their democratic process and makes our federal government less responsive to the needs of inside-the-Beltway special interests and more responsive to the needs of everyday Americans.

<title>ABIC - Demographic Breakdown of American Support for TL</title>
</head>

<img src="/abic/images/demograp.gif" border="0" ALT="Chart: Demographic Breakdown of American Support for Term Limits">
</center>
<p>
<br>

In the first House floor vote on term limits, 82% of the Republicans voted <i>yes</i>.  Conversely, 82% of the Democrats voted <i>no</i>.
<p>
These numbers are even more significant when viewed in light of the wishes of the American people.  In January 1996, the Tarrance Group conducted a national poll of registered voters on behalf of the Term Limits Amendment National Campaign.  According to the data, 77% of the American people favor term limits while only 17% oppose the idea.  Of those, 59% <i>strongly</i> favor term limits while only 9% strongly oppose it. (See <a href="/abic/peoplepie.html.cgi">chart</a>.)
<p>
But most importantly, when broken into demographic groups, every group supports congressional term limits, including Conservative Democrats (who support the issue by an <b>80%</b> margin) and even Moderate and Liberal Democrats (65%)!  This means that the House Democrats were not just voting against the wishes of the American people as a whole, <i>they were voting against the wishes of their own voters!</i>

Source: "Corporate Welfare Reform?", Janice C. Shields and James M. Sheehan, <a href="http://www.washtimes.com">Washington Times</a>, P. A17, September 4, 1996.
<p>
<i>Excerpts from the Washington Times piece:</i>
<p>
The Federal Government's Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) "doles out corporate welfare through direct loans, loan guarantees and political risk insurance...
<p>
OPIC's welfare for multinational corporations can be very costly.  As of Sept. 30, 1995, the agency reported more than $4 billion in outstanding loan guarantees and $10 billion in outstanding insurance.  OPIC estimates that $14.6 million of its outstanding direct loans won't be repaid.  In the event that borrowers default on the direct or guaranteed loans, the ultimate risk is borne by the U.S. government (read: "taxpayers").
<p>
To balance the federal budget and downsize government, Congress claims to be scaling back wasteful spending programs and eliminating others.  No so for corporate pork, which has somehow survived the cuts and will even grow faster.  The bill to reauthorize OPIC through the year 2001 nearly doubles the ceiling on OPIC's investment insurance to $25 billion, and more than doubles OPIC's financing authority to $20 billion."

<H3>"The Mysterious Disappearance of the Metcalf Amendment:<BR>
<EM>A True Life Congressional Thriller</EM>. . .</H3>
<P>
<b>Chapter 3</b>
<P>
The Metcalf Amendment Reappears...<br>
....as the Thompson Amendment!!
</center><p>
In Chapters 1 and 2, we learned that ABIC has been following the disappearance of the so-called Metcalf Amendment. In July, we pointed the finger at the 67 House members who voted against the Amendment offered by Rep. Jack Metcalf (R - WA) to stop the automatic pay increase scheduled for members of Congress.  The House adopted the amendment and under its provisions, Congress would receive no payraise this year.  (Note:  Congressional salaries in 1996 are $133,644 per year.)
<P>
We also learned that when the bill came out of the Senate committee, the Metcalf amendment had <b><i>vanished without a trace</i></b>.  No one knew how it disappeared or whodunnit! In <a href="/abic/ptf/7-29-96.html.cgi">Chapter 1</a>, ABIC pointed the finger at the prime suspects.
<P>
While no amount of detective work will reveal how the Metcalf Amendment disappeared in the Committee, <b>the day was ultimately saved by none other than...<P>
<center><h3>Senator Fred Thompson (R-TN)!</b></h3></center>
<P>

Charles Grassley</b> (R-IA), <b>sponsored an amendment on the floor of the Senate which would do the exact same thing as the Metcalf Amendment.</b> It would stop the automatic congressional payraise!<p>

<P>
In his floor statement, Sen. Thompson said, "The amendment we offer today is based upon the simple proposition that while we are asking the American people to make these (sacrifices), we must ask the same of ourselves...  We need to lead by example by showing the American people that we in Congress are willing to make a personal contribution to the effort of balancing the budget."
<P>
In short order, the Amendment passed the full Senate with a voice vote.  So now that both the House and the Senate have passed this measure, it is now very likely that it will clear the conference committee and become law.<p>
So, this week ABIC points the finger at a group of <i><b>good</i></b> guys: the six co-sponsors of the Thompson Amendment.

</tr>
</table>
In a classic story of unrestrained government, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) has finally apologized to an elderly Maine couple for illegally seizing their retirement "nest egg" property.  In a July letter, ACE admitted that Corps officials "were clearly guilty of innappropriate behavior in (this) case."
<P>
After 10 years of legal wrangling in which ACE claimed that the property was a protected wetland, even though it was surrounded by a road, railroad tracks and houses, the Corps finally settled a lawsuit filed by the couple, the Roberges.  Worse, during the course of the lawsuit, the Roberges' attorneys discovered a memo signed by an ACE caseworker, Jay Clement, in which he stated, <STRONG>"Roberge would be a good one to squash and (make into) an example."  </STRONG>Apparently, Mr. Clement continues to be employed by the Corps despite its July acknowledgement that the case was mishandled.

This is exactly the kind of big government arrogance that insinuates itself into 
Americans' lives every day.  As Thomas Jefferson professed: "I own that I am not a friend of
a very energetic government.  It is always oppressive."   ... How prophetic!

<P>

Send us news clips our fax number is 202-371-0210 or <a href="mailto:abic@abic.org">e-mail</a> us the anecdotes.  Tell us about ways the government (local, state or federal) is out of control.

<h2>About Americans Back In Charge Foundation</h2>
</center>

In 1990, the voters of Colorado began a nationwide revolution with their vote in favor of
term limits for Members of Congress.  Their vote was soon joined by 25 million more votes for
term limits in 23 states around the country over the last four years.<p>

Americans Back In Charge grew out of the original Colorado citizens' group, Coloradans
Back In Charge.  Founded in 1991, ABIC has been active in the state efforts by providing
grassroots support to other state citizens' groups.  Once those state term limits laws were passed,
ABIC Foundation was an integral part of the effort to defend those initiatives in courts of law
around the country, including the U.S. Supreme Court.  ABIC's legal project, the Term Limits
Legal Institute, served as co-counsel for the State of Arkansas when the Arkansas Attorney
General defended his state's term limits law before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1994.  Further,
TLLI served as counsel for the Washington state term limits group, LIMIT, when former House
Speaker Tom Foley sued his constituents in an effort to overturn the term limits law they passed
in 1992.<p>

ABIC Foundation continues its work of compiling information and analyzing the data on
the issues of term limits, the balanced budget amendment, and other key issues.  This web site is
an effort to provide some of that information and analysis to Americans who feel that these issues
are important to the future of our republic so that they may be empowered to put Americans Back
in Charge!

<h3>Union Members Resent AFL-CIO Aid to Dems  - Frank Luntz
The Hill, May 8, 1996

</H3></CENTER>
<BR><P>

<P>
Virtually everyone inside the Capital Beltway is familiar with the much ballyhooed political campaign being waged against the Republican Congress by organized labor. In fact, Washington-based labor bosses have bragged openly of their plan to spend $35 million in a campaign to defeat targeted Republicans. They have already increased mandatory dues to foot the bill, aired some of the most negative ads in years, and organized at the grass-roots level. In fact, the only thing they have not done is to inform their rank-and-file membership and ask their approval.
<P>
So we did. On behalf of Americans for a Balanced Budget, Luntz research surveyed 1,000 union members nationwide from April 23 through the 28th. The margin for error is +/-3.1%.
<P>
What we found may not please the Washington union leadership. What is surprising is not  the rank-and-file's objection to their dues being used for political activity - they do - but the depth and breadth of that opposition.
<P>
Union members overwhelmingly prefer the leadership of their local chapters to the leadership of their national chapters. When deciding union policy and priorities, members feel better represented by local chapters by a sizable 66 percent to 21 percent margin. When asked who does a better job in terms of "candidates, politics and political issue," local leadership again beast national leadership - 44 percent to 32 percent
<P>
Furthermore, 25 percent told us they "rarely" or "never" follow the advice of their local leadership, and that reaction jumps to 33 percent for national leadership. If forced to choose, only 13 percent would support a nationally endorsed candidate, while 41 percent would be more likely to support the local candidate. That does not bode well for the unions' current political effort. In fact, opposition to the effort will undoubtedly increase the split between local and national loyalty - with local unions the benefactors.
<P>
Union members have activities other than politics in mind when asked to prioritize union efforts. Preserving jobs was by far the top choice (58 percent), followed by increasing wages (27 percent). Improving the image of unions was a distant third (8 percent), but still chosen more often than engaging in political election activities (at just 4 percent). Even when given a second choice, only 9 percent chose election activities - the lowest response of the four.
<P>
This brings us to the partisan political campaign being waged by the Washington leadership. More than half of the rank-and-file had no idea such a campaign even existed. After they were told the AFL-CIO was planning to spend $35 million in mandatory monthly dues to defeat congressional Republicans, their reaction was overwhelmingly hostile.
<P>
Overall, 15 percent of the rank-and-file "strongly support" the campaign, 16 percent "somewhat support" it, while 21 percent "somewhat oppose." The bulk of members (41 percent) are "strongly opposed."
<P>
These results don't change by gender, age, education level or income. Even a plurality of Democrats (48 percent) oppose the campaign against the Republican Congress.
<P>
The biggest surprise? Those who voted against a GOP candidate for Congress in 1994 (and should endorse this effort) are evenly split :46 percent support the union effort, 46 percent oppose it.
<P>
Perhaps more importantly, among newest union members, the political campaign is opposed by a 77 percent to 19 percent margin. For a national leadership that claims to be committed to rebuilding their image, this is a very dangerous result.
<P>
We asked members if they knew they were eligible for a refund of their due spent for political purposes. Less than one-fifth responded affirmatively.
<P>
And when union members were told they had a right to a refund of dues spent for political purposes, one 20 percent would "definitely" request their money back, and another 20 percent would be "very likely" to request a refund.
<P>
Regarding the upcoming presidential campaign, Bill Clinton holds a healthy 50 percent to 20 percent lead over Bob Dole among union members, with Ross Perot at 11 percent and the remaining 19 percent undecided. The president leads among every union demographic group.
<P>
But while rank-and-file union membership is predisposed to support Clinton and other Democratic candidates in 1996, Republicans should not give up hope.
<P>
The beliefs and priorities of union members ought not to be confused with the beliefs and priorities of union leadership. After all, on issues like welfare reform, a balanced budget amendment and tax reductions - all opposed by national labor leaders - union members agree with us (87 percent, 82 percent and 78 percent respectively).
<P>
A local campaign waged from union hall to union hall - emphasizing balanced budgets, welfare reform and family tax cuts - could deliver up to 40 percent of the union vote, enough to ensure a GOP sweep in November. From ideology to issues, the rank-and-file is still up for grabs. The fact is, the average congressional Republican has more in common with them than their own Washington leadership.<P>

<h3>UNION MEMBERS OPPOSE AFL-CIO ATTACK ADS
</H3></CENTER>
<BR><P>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact:  Robert Udowitz<br>
202-434-8336<br>
<p>
April 30, 1996			
</b>

<P>
More than 60%of union members oppose the AFL-CIO's negative advertising blitz against Republican House members, according to anationwide poll released today by Americans for a Balanced Budget. National AFL-CIO officials have earmarked $35 million in members' compulory dues money to defeat Congressional Republicans who support a balanced budget, tax cuts and welfare reform.
<P>
The poll, conducted by Frank Luntz and Associates between April 23-28, shows that national union officials are oput of touch with their members on union politics and priorities.
<P>
<ul>
<li> 62 percent of union members oppose the use of their dues for negative political advertising against Republicna House members.

<li> 82 percent want a constitutional amendment that requires Congress to balance the budget each year.

<li> 87 percent favor work requirements for welfare recipients and limits on the limits on the length of time they can collect welfare checks.

<li> 78 percent support tax reductions that include a $500 per child tax credit.

<li> When informed of national union officials' campaign against Republicans who support these porposals, 59 percent say they would ask for a refund of their dues.
</ul>
<P>
"Clearly Washington union officials are hopelessly out of touch with rank and file union members," said ABB president Tony Zagotta at a news conference at the National Press Club. "They are shamelessly plundering workers; compulsory dues to promote tax-and-spend policies that union members oppose.
<P>
"Union members, like their fellow Americans, overwhelmingly support a balanced budget. Fiscally responsible House members should take heart from these figures, and continue to press forward with genuine budget reform proposals. The American people are on our side."
<P>

Republican leaders are preparing an all-out attack designed to counter a $35 million campaign mounted by labor unions to help elect Democratic candidates this fall. Among the legislative plans being considered: a proposal that would require more-detailed disclosure of political lobbying and contributions by union members and a bill that would make it easier for workers to resign from a union. In addition, GOP leaders are expected to tout a new poll of 1000 union members that purportedly shows a split between the AFL-CIO's official political policies and the view of its rank-and-file over such issues as welfare reform, the minimum wage and a $500-per-child tax credit. The sponsor of the survey, a conservative organization called Americans for a Balanced Budget, also claims that about 70 percent of union members would likely ask for part of their dues back if they were aware of the difference between their view and those of the union leaders.
<P>

The Wall Street Journal, Tuesday, April 30, 1996   Page 1
<P>
Union Politics spark mixed reaction, survey shows.
<P>
With the AFL-CIO vowing to spend at least $35 million to defeat House Republicans this fall, rank and file union members have been mostly mute. But silence doesn't mean support, says Americans for a Balanced Budget, a right-leaning lobby. In fact, the group says its own poll, to be released today, shows widespread dissent.
<P>
Republican pollster Frank Luntz questioned 1000 union members last week and found that 41% "strongly oppose" the AFL-CIO's spending plan while only 14% "strongly support" it. The remaining 45% have no strong opinion. Gerald McEntee, president of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees union and head of the AFL-CIO's political efforts, said the AFL-CIO's own surveys show overwhelming support.
<P>

The Washington Times, Wednesday, May 1, 1996 Page A18
<P>
What union members think
<P>
Perhaps more galling than the fact that the AFL-CIO has launcheda massive - and dubiously legal - political campaign to unseat freshmen House Republicans is the fact that they are wagin this campaign with the wages of their members, and without the workers' consent.
<P>
A poll conducted by Frank Luntz for Americans for a Balanced Budget, released yesterday, reveals just how far the union bosses have strayed from the priorities of the union rank and file. When union members were asked whether they supported or opposed the AFL-CIO's decision to spend $35 million in dues in an effort to defeat Republicans, 62 percent said they opposed the unions' political use of dues. Only 31 percent supported the big l;abor campaign.<P>
Union bosses like to pretend that they are "representing" workers in the political arena. But it's news to the workers. Less than half of the union members polled knew that the national labor unions were garnishing their wages to pay for a national political campaign. And only 19 percent knew that they were entitled to demand a refund on the portion of their dues apenst on politicking. Told about that right, a majority of the worker said they wanted those dollars back. As od now, the unions do not have an accounting to members for how their union dues are spent. Asked if they would support a new law to require full disclosure of where their due dollars are going, an overwhelming 84 percent of union members said yes.
<P>
The disconnect between big labor bosses and the workers becomes even more pronounced whenthe union members are asked - free of partisan labels - what they think of key proposals being advanced by the Republican Congress. Not suprisingly, workers were not too patient with those who don't work: Eightly-seven percent support welfare that requires work and I slimited of duration. They also support a balanced budget ammendment by a huge margin, with 82 percent in favor of a constitutional requirement that Washington keep its fiscal house in order. And more than three-fourths of the union workers voiced their support for tax cuts for working families.
<P>
Twice as many of the workers describe themselves as Democrats than Republicans. But the real leanings of the workers come through when asked if they are conservative, moderate or liberal: 44 percent call themselves conservative, 32 percent are moderates, and only 18 percent say liberal. Given that union bosses are lobbying for liberal policies, is it any surprise that well over half of the workers polled say that the attack on the Republican Congress is no way to spend their union dues?
<P>
What could better illustrate the Democrats' true concern for the "workers" whose interest they are always invoking? Presidentr Clinton and his compatriots are more than happy to benefit from money that has been taken from workers against their wishes. Reductions in employees take-home pay are all right, it seems, as long as the differenc ends up in Democratic campaign coffers.
<P>

<h3>BLASTS AFL-CLO CONGRESSIONAL ELECTION EFFORT<BR>
$35 MILLION TARGETED FOR 75 DISTRICTS<BR>
</H3></CENTER>
<BR><P>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Ben Magliano<br>
202-638-6124<br>
<p>
             February 1, 1996</B> -- The AFL-CIO is planning to punish Republican congressmen who voted in favor of a 
balanced federal budget by pouring over $35 million dollars into 75 congressional races this 
year. Their goal is to win back Democratic control of the House of Representatives.<p>

This years $35 million dollar expenditure is seven times the normal amount spent by the 
ALF-CIO during an election year and represents an average of $466,000 per race. This figure is 
substantially higher than the $322,929 expended on all 1994 congressional races, according to 
current FEC data.<p>

&quot;I am amazed at the lengths the AFL-CIO will go in order to kill the balanced budget 
initiative, &quot; says Tony Zagotta, President of Americans For a Balanced Budget. &quot;Next to Bill 
Clinton, organized labor is a balanced budget's worst enemy.&quot;<p>

Americans For a Balanced Budget recently launched a nationwide radio campaign to 
correct the lies being told by the AFL-CIO over Medicare. These ads have run in Illinois, 
Massachusetts, New Jersey, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Washington, and 
Wyoming over the past month.<p>

&quot;The AFL-CIO launched a dishonest campaign last year against 27 Congressmen for their 
courageous votes to balance the budget,&quot; says Zagotta, &quot;It now appears that the union leadership 
is poised to take their deceitful message to an even greater audience.&quot;<p>

In addition to the millions of dollars the AFL-CIO will pour into these congressional 
races, the labor giant will also make in-kind contributions of AFL-CIO personnel and facilities. 
These in-kind donations could easily double the $35 million dollar independent media campaign.<p>

&quot;The Oregon Senate race is a good example of the in-kind support that the AFL-CIO will 
be extending to upcoming congressional races, &quot; says Zagotta. &quot;More than 25 union activists 
were sent to Oregon to work full-time for Ron Wyden - that's a force nearly as big as Gordon 
Smith's entire campaign staff! In addition, the AFL-CIO paid for over 200,000 pieces of direct 
mail and set up phone banks throughout the state.&quot;<p>

AFL-CIO Leaders met with President Clinton for nearly two hours on January 8th 
and urged him to hold fast against Republican budget demands. In particular, the union 
representatives wanted to kill Medicare reform and reject any budget proposed 
tax cuts.<p>

&quot;Actions speak louder than words, so it is readily apparent that Bill Clinton lied to the 
American people during his State of the Union Address, &quot; says Zagotta. &quot;The era of Big 
Government is alive and well and has a good friend in the White House.&quot;<p>

Americans For a Balanced Budget is one of the leading groups fighting for a balanced federal 
budget. Founded in 1990, the non-partisan grassroots organization has over 200,000 members in 
all fifty states.<p>

<p>
          February 2, 1996</B> -- Americans For a Balanced Budget has launched the fifth wave of its nationwide campaign to correct the 
distortions and lies being told about Medicare spending. The first radio spots began airing in 
Wyoming today.<p>

Washington Congresswoman has been targeted by the AFL-CIO 
and other liberal special interest groups due to her votes in favor of the balanced budget. 
Numerous television and radio advertisements funded by these groups have made the erroneous 
claim that Congresswoman Cubin voted to cut Medicare.<p>

Americans For a Balanced Budget has decided to answer this charge with the truth. The budget 
passed by congress and vetoed by President Clinton increases Medicare spending by 48%.<p>

&quot;Check with any major news organizations - The New York Times, The Washington Post, ABC 
News - Their reports all prove that the congressional plan increases Medicare spending, &quot; says 
Tony Zagotta, President of Americans For a Balanced Budget, &quot;These lies and distortions are 
designed to divert our attention away from President Clinton and his unwillingness to propose 
his own seven year balanced budget .&quot;<p>

Americans For a Balanced Budget is one of the leading groups fighting for a balanced federal 
budget. Founded in 1990, the non-partisan grassroots organization has over 200,000 members in 
all fifty states.<p>

</center>
<P>
Americans for a Balanced Budget(ABB) was founded in 1990 by David Miner, a 	member of the North Carolina General Assembly.  With over 200,000 members in all fifty 	states, ABB is one of the leading groups fighting for a balanced federal budget.
<P>
ABB is a non-partisan, grassroots lobbying organization and registered as a 
501(c)(4) with the Internal Revenue Service.
<P>
The mission of ABB is to promote a balanced federal budget, a Balanced Budget
Amendment -- with tax limitation -- to the United States Constitution, and pro-growth
economic policies.
<P>
ABBs efforts in these areas have earned the respect of senior political leaders
like Senator Bob Dole, who recently said, "Long before it became popular, ABB was 	working hard for a balanced budget and fiscal responsibility in Washington.  And since
its founding, ABB has played a major role in exposing the dangers of the welfare state
and of big government."
<P>
The current president of ABB is Tony Zagotta.  He is the former National 		Chairman of the College Republicans, and he most recently managed a congressional
campaign in North Carolina. 
<P>
<h2>The People at ABB</h2>
<h3>Tony Zagotta</h3>
Tony Zagotta, president of Americans for a Balanced Budget, joined ABB in February of 1995. 
He has overseen the growth of the organization to over 200,000 members nationwide. He is also 
directly responsible for the success of ABB's latest radio ad campaign.<p>

In addition to his time at ABB, he is the Chairman of the International Youth Democrat Union, 
the conservative international youth organization. He was elected in 1994 to a two-year term.  
The parent organization, the International Democrat Union, was founded by Ronald Reagan and 
Margaret Thatcher in 1983. The current co-Chairman is Jack Kemp.<p>

Previously, Zagotta was the National Chairman for the College Republicans. Originally elected 
in 1989 for a two-year term, he was re-elected in 1991. With a staff of ten, he planned the largest 
College Republican event in history when over 1200 students showed up for the Centiennial 
Celebration in July of 1992. During that time he was served as the Honorary Chairman of Youth 
for Bush/Quayle `92.<p>

Zagotta has been involved in politics since his graduation from Illinois State University. He has 
had experience in all different fields, ranging from being a Political Instructor for the 
International Republican Institute, to an International Observer at the Guatemala Presidential 
Elections in 1990. He was also a field representative for Jack Kemp for President in 1988 and 
was employed as a legislative assistant in the Illinois General Assembly in 1988.<p>

Zagotta relocated to Washington, DC, from his hometown in Chicago six years ago.<p>
<h3>Emily McGee</h3>
Emily McGee has been  at Americans for a Balanced Budget since February 1995. In addition to 
her tasks as Program Director, she has recently been promoted to Director of Online Services.<p>

Before McGee joined ABB, she worked at Smith & Harroff, Inc. in Alexandria, Virginia as an 
intern during the 1994 elections. While there she focused on several different aspects of 
campaign work, most notably media buying. She also assisted on research for the corporate 
clients.<p>

While a student at Colgate University, located in Hamilton, New York, she was active in College 
Republicans at the school, state, and national levels. Not only was she the club chairman and 
state executive director, she also spent several summers in Washington, DC volunteering at the 
College Republican National Committee. During that time she helped with the College 
Republican Biennial Convention as well as the Republican National Convention.<p>

Originally from Massachusetts, McGee moved to Washington shortly after she graduated from 
college in 1994. <p>

<title>Current Program Interests</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/bradley/bg.gif">
<blockquote><blockquote>

<center>
<img src="/bradley/hdr-cpi.gif">
</center>
<P>
The Foundation's Board, on occasion, undertakes to define and redefine its current program interests. At present, the Foundation aims to encourage projects that focus on cultivating a renewed, healthier, and more vigorous sense of citizenship among the American people, and among peoples of other nations, as well.<p>

The free society so central to the convictions and success of the Bradley brothers rests upon and is intended to nurture a solid foundation of competent, self-goveming citizens, who are understood to be fully capable of and personally responsible for making the major political, economic, and moral decisions that shape their own lives, and the lives of their children. Such decisions are made on the basis of common sense, received wisdom, traditional values, and everyday moral understandings, which are in tum nurtured and passed on to future generations by healthy families, churches, neighborhoods, voluntary associabons, schools, and other valuegenerabng "mediating structures."<p>

This expansive understanding of citizenship is being 
challenged today, however, by contemporary forces and ideas that regard individuals more as passive and helpless vicbms of powerful extemal forces than as personally responsible, self-goveming citizens, and that foster a deep skepticism about citizenly values and mediating structures. Consequently, authority and accountability tend to flow away from citizens toward centralized, bureaucratic, "service-providing" institutions which claim to be peculiarly equipped to cope with those extemal forces on behalf of their "clients." This systematic disenfranchisement of the citizen, and the consequent erosion of citizenly mediating structures, pose grave threats to the free society that the Bradley brothers cherished.<p>

In light of these considerations, projects likely to be supported by the Foundation will generally share these assumptions:<p>
<ul>

<li>They will treat free men and women as genuinely self-goveming, personally responsible citizens, not as victims or clients.

<li>They will aim to restore the intellectual and cultural legitimacy of citizenly common sense, the received wisdom of experience, everyday morality, and personal character, refurbishing their roles as reliable guideposts of everyday life.

<li>They will seek to reinvigorate and reempower the traditional, local institutions -- families, schools, churches, and neighborhoods -- that provide training in and room for the exercise of genuine citizenship, that pass on everyday morality to the next generation, and that cultivate personal character.

<li>They will encourage decentralization of power and accountability away from centralized, bureaucratic, national institutions back to the states, localities, and revitalized mediating structures where citizenship is more fully realized.

</ul>
<p>

In addition to these thematic considerations, eligible projects will exhibit these  features:<p>

<ul>
<li>They may address any arena of public life -- economics, politics, culture, or civil society -- where citizenship as here understood is an important issue. It is important to note that our view of citizenship is not primarily concerned with promoting civics education, voter awareness or tum-out, or similar activities narrowly focused on voting and elections.

<li>They may address the problem of citizenship at home or abroad, where the fall of many (and the perpetuation of some) totalitarian regimes has made this issue particularly urgent.  In light of our emphasis on decentralization, and considering the Foundation's deep roots in Milwaukee and Wisconsin -- areas with proud traditions of innovation and experimentation in democratic citzenship -- community and state projects will be of particular interest to us. Such projects will aim to improve the life of the community through increasing cultural and educabonal opportunities, grass-roots economic development, and effective and humane social and health services, reflecting where possible the Foundation's focus on the resuscitation of citizenship.  

<li>Projects may be actual demonstrations of the resuscitation of citizenship in the economic, political, cultural, or social realms; policy research and writing about approaches encouraging that resuscitation; academic research and writing that explore the intellectual roots of citizenship, its decline, and prospects for revival; and popular writing and media projects that illustrate for a broader public audience the themes of citizenship.
</ul>
<p>

Much of the creative and energetic leadership essential for a renewal of citizenship will be supplied by gifted individuals, who must receive challenging and stimulating programs and instruction at all levels of their education. The Foundation supports programs that research the needs of gifted children and techniques of providing education for students with superior skills and/or intelligence. Research programs investigating how learning occurs in gifted children and demonstration programs of instruction are to be considered. 

<br>

</center>
<P>

The programs and funding decisions of The Bradley Foundation are the responsibility of the Board of Directors. At the discretion of the Board, the policies set forth herein will be modified in response to changing conditions and priorities.<p>

The guidelines established by the Board of Directors will normally preclude funding for unspecified and undetailed overhead costs. No funds will be authorized for fees payable to fund- raising counsel. In addition, grants without significant import to the Foundation's areas of interest will only under special conditions be considered for endowment or deficit financing purposes.<p>

The Foundation will:<p>
<ul>
<li>Normally award grants only to organizations and institutions exempt from federal taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Intemal Revenue Code and publicly supported under section 509(a)(1), (2) or (3);

<li>Favor projects which are not normally financed by public tax funds;

<li>Consider requests from religious organizations and institutions only when the resulting impact of the project is not primarily denominational;

<li>Consider requests for building projects on rare occasions and, in such cases where projects are reviewed, limit grants to only a small fraction of the total project cost.
</ul>
<p>

Grantees must possess the resources to properly administer grants from the Foundabon. The Foundabon conducts an annual evaluation of grants, and grantees are asked to provide periodic reports on the progress of their work.

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/bradley/bg.gif">

<img src="/bradley/hdr-gp.gif">
</center>
<P>
In 1903, Lynde and Harry Bradley established a new business in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It took courage and confidence for them to risk resources in a new venture, based only on their judgement of what was and their vision of what could be. The Bradleys' confidence was bolstered by the knowledge that in America, not only were they free to start a business, they could also begin again if they failed. The Bradleys, however, would not fail. Their business grew to become the Allen-Bradley Company.<p>

When the Allen-Bradley Company was acquired by Rockwell Intemational Corporation in 1985, a significant portion of the proceeds was dedicated to establishing The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation. Although it has no direct ties to the Allen-Bradley Company, the purpose of the Foundation is to commemorate Lynde and Harry Bradley by preserving and extending the principles and philosophy by which they lived and upon which they built the company.<p>

As their efforts succeeded, their business grew and eventually extended far beyond its Milwaukee headquarters. Lynde and Harry Bradley remained devoted to the city where they began their enterprise and in which they lived and worked for so many years. Their foundation will continue the Bradleys' interest in helping to improve the quality of life in the Milwaukee metropolitan area.<p>

The Bradleys lived and worked according to several philosophical principles. They :believed that, over time, the consequences of ideas were more decisive than the force of political or economic movements. They recognized the interdependence of human endeavors --  cultural, educational, philosophical, economic -- and they rejected exclusionary emphasis on any single element. The brothers had an abiding belief in the dignity and decency of each person. They felt that only in an environment of political and economic freedom could individuals develop their talents, hone their skills and intellects, and contribute to the improvement of the human condition. The success of the Allen-Bradley Company stands in eloquent testimony to the enduring quality of these principles.<p>

The Bradley brothers were committed to preserving and defending the tradition of free representative govemment and private enterprise which has enabled the American nation and, in a larger sense, the entire Westem world to flourish intellectually and economically. The Bradleys believed that the good society is a free society. The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation is likewise devoted to strengthening American democratic capitalism and the institutions, principles and values which sustain and nurture it. Its programs support limited, competent govemment; a dynamic marketplace for economic, intellectual, and cultural activity; and a vigorous defense at home and abroad of American ideas and institutions. In addition, recognizing that responsible self- government depends on enlightened citizens and informed public opinion, the Foundation supports scholarly studies and academic achievement.

<h3>Milwaukee's Bradley Legacy<br>
Continues as Foundation<br>
Moves to Historic "Lion House"<br>
</h3>
<img src="/bradley/lionhouse.gif">
</center>
<P>
In Milwaukee's sesquicentennial year, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation has taken stewardship for one of the community's architectural treasures, relocating it headquarters to the landmark "Lion House" in the First Ward Triangle Historic District. Noted as the city's "finest surviving pre-Civil War home" and named for the carved lions crouched upon its portico, the Lion House represents the aspirations of Milwaukee's immigrant settlers and the community's heritage of civic participation.<P>

Built in 1855 as the vision of German immigrant Edward Diederichs, the Lion House has been the home of many prominent citizens, including entrepreneur Henry Mann in the 1860's banker and civic leader John Johnston in the 1890's, and, in the 1940's, president of Marine National Exchange Bank, Eliot Fitch, who was also an active leader in many local civic institutions. Architecturally restored and converted to commercial office space by James A. and James D. Hummert in the 1980's, the building was chosen last year by the Foundation's Board of Directors as a headquarters that will mark the continuing and active presence of the legacy of Lynde and Harry Bradley in the Milwaukee community.<P>

Combining the institution's office needs with a project of historical restoration is particularly apt at the time of Milwaukee's 150th anniversary, said Foundation President Michael S. Joyce, noting that "our Board is very intentionally sending the message that the Bradley Foundation is at once rooted in Milwaukee's heritage and looking to its future." The move, Joyce added, "ensures the preservation and stewardship of one of our city's most charming landmarks and provides efficient office space in a convenient location for the Foundation's philanthropic operations."<p>

The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, established in 1985, is a private, independent grantmaking organization directed to supporting research and education. Due to its modest size and near-downtown location, the Lion House will be a suitable headquarters for the Milwaukee-based institution's small staff. Extensive renovations consistent with the building's architectural integrity were planned by Uihlein Architects and executed by D.G. Beyer, Inc. to coordinate operational and historic objective.

<blockquote><blockquote>
<P><B>APPLICATION PROCEDURE</B>
<P>
<P>Two steps are required in the application process.  
First, the applicant should prepare a brief letter of 
inquiry, describing the applicant's organization and intended project. 
 If the Foundation determines the project to be within 
its current program interests the applicant will be invited 
to submit a formal proposal.
<P>
<P>The second step is the actual submission of the proposal. 
 Applicants should submit a letter presenting a 
concise description of the project, its objectives and 
significance, and the qualifications of the organizations and 
individuals involved.  Included with the letter should be a project 
budget, the amount of the grant sought from The 
Bradley Foundation, and other sources of support.  The 
applicant should complete the &quot;Grantee Tax Exempt 
Status Information&quot; form included with the Program 
Guidelines and submit a copy of the IRS letter confirming 
the organization's tax exempt and public support status 
under Sections 501(c)(3) and 509(a), respectively, of the 
Internal Revenue Code.
<P>
<P>Meetings between the Foundation staff and 
applicants, where necessary, will be arranged after the receipt of 
a written proposal.  Final authority for making grants 
rests with the Board of Directors, which meets four times a 
year, February, May/June, September, and November.  
The Directors act on grant requests after proposals have 
been comprehensively reviewed by Foundation staff.  
Each proposal is reviewed according to its unique characteristics. 
 To be considered at one of these meetings, proposals 
should be submitted by the following dates:  December 1, 
March 1, July 1, September 1.
<P>
<P>Whenever possible, proposals submitted by these 
deadlines will be considered at the next Board meeting.  
However, circumstances may sometimes require a lengthier period 
of review.
<P>
<P>Because of the necessarily limited resources of 
the Foundation, many worthwhile projects cannot be supported.  The demands on the Foundation's 
resources also limit the size of particular grants and the ability of 
the Foundation to make commitments for extended periods.
<P>
<P><B>DEVELOPING A DETAILED PROPOSAL</B>
<P>
<P>This is a checklist which we hope will be useful to you 
in developing a detailed proposal.  It is intended as a 
guide only on points to make in a request.  We do not expect 
or want a lengthy proposal but need only sufficient detail 
to go forward with our review.
<P>
<P><I>Program Description</I>
<P><ul>
<P><li>     Statement of the basic objective of the 
proposal (one paragraph).
<P><li>     Definition of the problem to which the proposal 
is addressed.
<P><li>     Statement of potential impact of the proposal 
on the problem.
<P><li>     Whom will it benefit and how?
<P><li>     Description of work plan and time frame 
for accomplishing the objectives of the proposal.
<P><li>     Length of time Bradley Foundation aid will 
be needed and most desirable times to start and terminate the grant.
<P><li>     How will the project be supported beyond 
the period of funding requested from the Foundation?
<P><li>     Is this a new or an ongoing activity on the part 
of sponsoring institution?
<P><li>     Has the field been researched to find similar efforts?
<P><li>     Has a similar project succeeded or failed?  Why?
<P><li>     Description of evaluation plan:
<P>     <ul><li>  ongoing evaluation of program during period of
<P>         the grant
<P>     <li>  criteria by which the effectiveness of the grant
<P>         should be judged at the end of the grant period.
<P></ul></ul>
<P><I>Project Personnel</I>
<P><ul>
<P><li>     Brief description of the qualifications of 
individuals who will be conducting the project and administering the grant if awarded.  Include 
resumes for key personnel.

<CENTER><I>David Wilkinson was the first Inspector General of 
the Legal Services Corporation (1989-91) and the Utah 
Attorney General from 1981 to 1989.</I></CENTER>

<P>The Legal Services Corporation (LSC), a federally 
funded agency designed to support legal services 
organizations that serve the poor, has been the focus of 
controversy almost without interruption since its creation in 1974. 
 Conservative critics charge that LSC funds are 
improperly used to challenge electoral redistricting plans, 
represent illegal aliens and drug dealers, and bring class 
action lawsuits against laws made by elected officials.  
Liberal supporters counter that LSC-funded organizations 
spend most of their resources representing the poor and 
disadvantaged in routine legal cases such as landlord-tenant 
disputes.
<P>Until recently, however, few have questioned 
whether federal dollars are needed at all to provide legal 
assistance to the poor.  Whatever may have once been the case, 
are adequate private and non-federal resources available 
today to meet the legal needs of the poor?
<P><I><B>Unknown to many, legal services providers 
receiving LSC funds also take in at least $324 million from 
private and other public sourcesan amount in excess of 
the LSC's current federal appropriation of $283 million. 
 Moreover, there are an additional 1,350 providers 
of legal services to the needy who receive no 
government funding and whose budgets total over $200 million. 
 Finally, some 400,000 to 600,000 lawyers perform 
an estimated 24,000,000 hours of pro bono work 
annually valued at $3.3 billion.</B></I>
<P>
<a name="1">
<B>The House of Representative's Aborted Plan</B>

<P>In 1995, the House of Representatives developed a 
three-step budget resolution to phase out the LSC's funding 
by October 1997.  Both the House and Senate took the 
first step last year by reducing LSC funding from $400 
million to $283 million.  The second step called for a 
further reduction of funding to $141 million for fiscal year 
1997, followed by an end to all federal support.
<P>The House Appropriations Committee voted earlier 
this year to take the second step.  But when the 
appropriations bill reached the House floor on July 23rd, 56 
Republicans voted with all but three Democrats to fund the LSC at 
$250 million.  Lobbyists for increased funding, led by the 
Americ Bar Association, had predicted a close vote and 
were elated by the comfortable margin of victory.  Their 
success was complete when the final fiscal budget figure came in 
at $283 million -- the same amount the LSC received in 
fiscal year 1996.  The House three-step plan, in other 
words, appears to have been aborted after achieving only 
one-third of its planned savings in federal expenditures.
<P>House reformers planned to phase out LSC funding 
in order to give LSC-supported legal services 
organizations sufficient time to acquire replacement funds.  Many of 
these organizations originally received all their funding from 
the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), a War on 
Poverty agency created in the mid-1960s.  However, other 
LSC-funded legal services providers that predate the OEO 
have had substantial non-federal funding for years.
<P>Today, almost all LSC-funded organizations 
receive funding from non-federal sources.  In fact, in the 
just-ended 1996 fiscal yearthe first year of the reduction in 
the LSC's budgetnon-LSC funding of these 428 
providers surpassed LSC funding.  That the LSC is now providing 
less than half the total funding of all its granteesand only 
a third of the funding of all providerswas never 
discussed in the lengthy debate preceding the recent House vote.  
Nor was there any mention that some 1,350 legal service 
providers receive no money from the LSC yet have 
budgets totalling over two hundred million dollars.  Although 
the House debate did address the question of whether pro 
bono lawyers who volunteer their services for the needy 
could &quot;fill the gap&quot; created by further cuts in the LSC's budget, 
no mention was made of how much non-LSC money the 
nation's legal services providers have at their disposal.
<P>

<a name="2">
<B>States Move to Fill the Gap</B>
<P>Less than a month before the House vote, the state of 
New Jersey, using court filing fee revenue, increased funding 
to its network of 15 legal services providers by an 
estimated $8.2 million.  The state legislature acted on the belief 
that LSC funding, already reduced, would probably be 
cut again, and might ultimately disappear.  New Jersey's 
legal services providers now have a total budget of $25.5 
million28 percent more than last yeardespite a $2.2 
million reduction in LSC monies.
<P>New Jersey is not the only state that has recently 
increased its budget for legal services.  Pennsylvania, only 
six days before the House vote, cleared the way for an 
estimated $6-million annual infusion of new money for its 
19 LSC-funded and 22 non-LSC-funded providers.  
The legislature's decision was based on the same 
argument made in the New Jersey legislaturethat LSC 
funding would likely be cut this year and eliminated next year.  
In fact, as <a href="#Table I">Table I</a> shows, at least six states have found 
their legal service resources greater this year due to new 
money from private and other public sources.
<P>The chief source of this money is state funding in 
the form of first-time or increased filing fee revenue and 
general operations revenue.  States that began funding 
civil legal services for the first time in 1995 include 
Kentucky, Missouri, and Rhode Island.  Still other states, 
including California, Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts, 
Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Tennessee, raised their level 
of support.  All told, an unprecedented surge of over 
$35 million in new state money was added to legal 
services budgets in the last year and a half in 17 states, 
including those in <a href="#Table I">Table I</a>.
<P>

<a name="3">
<B>A Conspiracy of Silence</B>
<P>Many LSC recipients and supporters know that the 
amount of non-LSC funding available to legal services providers 
is far more than anyone has ever communicated to 
Congress, but they have kept this fact well guarded.  For instance, 
all but one of New Jersey's thirteen members in the House 
of Representatives, including eight Republicans, recently 
voted to increase LSC funding.  None of them informed 
their colleagues during the July 23rd floor debate that 
New Jersey recently provided $8.2 million in new state 
money for legal services.  Likewise, Republican 
Representative Jon Fox of Pennsylvania, co-sponsor of the measure 
to increase LSC funding, was silent about 
Pennsylvania's allocation of an additional $6 million for legal services.
<P>This pattern of seeking federal funds for legal 
services with prior knowledge that one's own state is already 
providing state funds seems to be common.  Retiring 
LSC president Alexander Forger acknowledged the practice 
in an unguarded statement before the LSC Board in 1994. 
 While Forger was president of the New York State 
Bar, New York adopted IOLA. (Most other states use the term &quot;IOLTA,&quot; 
or Interest on Lawyers' Trust Accounts.)  
Under this program, most states require lawyers to turn 
over interest generated by their clients' trust funds to a fund 
used mostly to finance legal services programs.  Forger 
advised his colleagues, &quot;I would put in a footnote, for 
budgetary purposes in congressional presentations, that New 
York State... last year, in recognition of the decrease in 
IOLA funds at the state level and at the city level, 
appropriated unrestricted funds for legal services to poor people. . . .  
I trust Congress won't inquire as to whether local 
jurisdictions are undertaking some of that responsibility.&quot;  
The state funding referred to was $3 million, and it 
continued for at least three years.<B><I>1</I></B>
<P>Forger, no doubt, would excuse his failure to 
volunteer this information by arguing that this amount, even 
when supplemented by LSC funding, was inadequate to serve 
the legal needs of the poor.  But the flaw in this reasoning 
was identified by the executive director of Chicago 
Volunteer Legal Services, a non-LSC-funded legal services 
provider that relies on hundreds of pro bono lawyers.  In a 
public debate last year over whether filing fees should be 
increased to generate more revenue for legal services in 
Cook County (Chicago), M. Lee Witte remarked, &quot;what 
legal service providers want . . . is 
infinite.&quot;<B><I>2</I></B>
<P>

<a name="4">
<B>The LSC's Questionable Data</B>
<P>There is a wide disparity between the actual amount 
of funding for legal services for the needy and the figure 
the LSC has presented to Congress for the last ten years.  
This discrepancy exists because the LSC only disseminates 
information about providers who receive direct grants 
from the LSC.
<P>There are good reasons to question the LSC's figures. 
 First, the LSC compiles the amounts of non-LSC 
funding from paperwork submitted by providers when they 
apply for LSC grants.  These amounts are not audited.  
Furthermore, the amounts sometimes differ significantly 
from figures in other published sources.
<P>For instance, in 1995 the Legal Aid Society (LAS) of 
San Diego, an LSC-funded provider, reported to IOLTA 
administrators of the California State Bar that its non-LSC 
funding in 1994 was approximately $1.6 million.  LSC 
records, however, showed its 1994 non-LSC funding to be less 
than $1.1 million.  This half million dollar difference could 
be due to the LSC's failure to include the provider's 
so-called &quot;derivative income,&quot; such as attorney fee awards, 
publication and investment income, and unexpended or 
carry-over funds.  Until the early 1990s, such derivative income 
was always included in LSC figures presented to Congress. 
 This generally amounted to 15.2 percent of providers' 
non-LSC funding and 4.9 percent of their LSC grants.  For 
some individual providers, the amount was much higher.  But 
the $500,000 difference could also be due to the 
provider giving one figure to the LSC and another to the 
California State Bar.
<P>In any case, the LSC should inform Congress how 
much derivative income all LSC-funded providers have reported. 
 Providers are still required to submit this information to 
the LSC.
<P>

<a name="5">
<B>Subgrantees' Non-LSC Funding</B>
<P>The LSC has also failed to provide Congress with 
adequate information on the many LSC subgrantees.  
These are providers who receive money indirectly from the 
LSC in the form of subgrants made by LSC-funded providers.
<P>No one knows the exact number of subgrantees.  In 
1995, the LSC compiled a list of subgrantees that was intended 
to be official.  It listed 98 subgrantees, some of whom 
received more than one LSC subgrant.  Since the list was 
released, however, research has identified another 12 to 14 
providers that claim to have received LSC funding in 1995, in 
some cases as subgrantees.  For instance, the LSC's list 
includes only ten California subgrantees.  However, 
Congressman Julian Dixon of California referred to 14 
California subgrantees as of 1995 during the recent House 
debate.<B><I>3</I></B>
<P>While the LSC has provided Congress with 
information on the non-LSC funding of its direct grantees, it has 
not offered amounts of non-LSC funding for its 
subgrantees, which in 1995 numbered at least 112.  <a href="#Table II">Table II</a> shows 
the total budgets of eight subgrantees in 1995.  (These eight 
had the largest budgets of 18 subgrantees for which total 
budget funding information was available.)  Total 1995 non-LSC 
funding for these eight subgrantees was nearly $29 million.  
Another $8 million in non-LSC funding derives from 
the combined budgets of the remaining 10 subgrantees 
and from a portion of the combined budgets of another 
27 subgrantees.  Together, these 45 subgrantees obtained 
$37 million in non-LSC funding.  This amount was not 
included in the LSC's non-LSC funding figure of $249 million 
for 1995.<B><I>4</I></B>
<P>Yet this $37 million figure is far from complete 
because it does not account for the non-LSC funding of at least 
67 remaining subgrantees for which adequate information 
is unavailable.<B><I>5</I></B>  Available data suggests that the 112 or 
more subgrantees of LSC monies spent over $75 million in 
non-LSC funds on legal services to the poor in 1995.  Added 
to the LSC's figure for 1995 of $249 million, total 
non-LSC funding for the 428 or more providers receiving 
LSC grants, directly or indirectly, probably exceeded $324 
million.
<P>

<a name="5">
<B>Total Non-LSC Funding</B>
<P>This amount does not include the more than 1,350 
legal services providers, such as Chicago Volunteer Legal 
Services, that have operated year after year without any LSC funding.  
One must take into account over 950 largely 
pro bono &quot;private bar involvement&quot; (PBI) programs which 
the ABA lists in its annual PBI directory and over 1,110 
legal services providers that received IOLTA grants during 
the last year.  After adding the 428 direct and indirect 
recipients of LSC money in 1995 and eliminating duplicates 
from these three lists, over 1,625 providers remain.  To this 
can be added a number of providers who do not appear on 
any of these lists, such as the approximately 45 chapters 
and affiliates of the American Civil Liberties Union.  All 
told, there are easily 1,800 providers of civil legal services in 
all 50 states.
<P>Although the combined funding of these providers 
has never been the subject of a comprehensive study, 
enough data exists to make a fairly reliable estimate of total 
non-LSC funding.  <a href="#Table III">Table III</a> shows the non-LSC funding of 
of all states that compiled and reported on their non-LSC funding
over a 12-month period during the last three years.  
These 13 states had combined non-LSC funding of $175 million.
<P>Extrapolating to the 50 states, total nationwide 
non-LSC funding for legal services is $463 
million.<B><I>6</I></B>  To this can be added the resources of the ACLU's network of chapters 
and affiliates -- $35 million.  This total of $498 million is 
more than double the $210 million in non-LSC funding that 
the LSC estimates its direct grantees received in 1996.
<P>Yet even this figure of $498 million is incomplete.  
It does not count, for instance, the hundreds of millions 
in public funds that each year support consumer 
protection and constituent service functions at the federal, state, 
and local levels of government.  Much of this addresses the 
civil legal problems of the poor in the same way as do pro 
bono and salaried legal services lawyers.  Nor does this 
amount include the hundreds of millions that government and 
private sources distribute each year to social services 
agencies that deal with non-legal problems often brought to 
legal services lawyers.  Considerable data show that most of 
the &quot;cases&quot; handled by LSC-funded lawyers are actually 
problems that can be addressed by non-lawyers.  To cite 
only one instance, the Legal Referral Service of the San 
Francisco Bar Association refers 75 percent of its 85,000 
yearly calls to government agencies or social 
services.<B><I>7</I></B>
<P>

<a name="6">
<B>The Future of Legal Services for the Poor</B>
<P>The impact of reduced LSC funding in 1996 
together with the potential loss of IOLTA funds resulting from 
a recent federal appeals court decision will be the 
overriding concern voiced by LSC supporters in the near future. 
 Whether further cuts are made in the LSC's budget 
will largely depend on whether Congress is convinced 
that private and other public resources can &quot;fill the gap.&quot;
<P>If LSC funding is reduced by another substantial 
amount, at least some LSC grantees may have to cease 
operations given the competitive and rapidly growing legal 
services industry.  Clearly, however, there are considerable 
private and other public resources for meeting the legal needs of 
the poor.  Alan Houseman, a key draftsman of the 1974 
LSC Act, has observed that &quot;There's an unfortunate notion 
in Legal Services that only experts like themselves can 
litigate these kinds of [class action] cases.  But there's a 
broad range of public interest programs around the country 
that don't take Federal money that can do them.  And we 
haven't really even begun to tap the private 
bar.&quot;<B><I>8</I></B>  Houseman would no doubt stress that his comments apply only 
to class actions, but they apply equally if not more so to the 
routine types of cases that Congress has said should be the 
only focus of LSC-funded providers.  Another longtime 
legal services lawyer, Mike Daniel, has remarked, &quot;I don't 
know how you can justify taking federal money to provide 
routine legal services.  There are other lawyers who will do 
those routine [cases].&quot;<B><I>9</I></B>  Indeed, not only are there other 
lawyers; there are considerable non-lawyer resources that can 
assist the needy just as effectivelyand for less 
money.<B><I>10</I></B>
<P>If the LSC were abolished, there would still be at 
least half a billion dollars available each year for legal 
services for the needy.  This does not count the far greater value 
of pro bono work on behalf of the poor.  Nor does it count 
the support of government and private consumer and 
social-service agencies whose work directly affects the poor.
<P>Is $283 million in federal legal services funding 
still necessary?  If Congress is serious about balancing 
the budget and reducing the role of the federal government, 
it might wish to revisit the LSC budget next spring.
<P>

<LI>It is not within the scope of this article to examine whether providers are receiving LSC monies from direct grantees without the knowledge, authorization, or oversight of the LSC.
<LI>The LSC provided the figure of $249 millionwhich it said was &quot;slightly incomplete&quot;after being directed to by appropriations subcommittee chairman Harold Rogers (R-KY) after its budget hearing.
<LI>Over half of the 67 subgrantees for which non-LSC funding figures are unavailable are state or local bar associations.  Bar association contributions to all LSC-funded legal services providers have never been more than a few million dollars a year.
<LI>The extrapolation is made on the basis of the 1990 population figure for the 50 states.  The 1990 poverty population figure was deemed unreliable for extrapolation.

<B>Pro Bono Legal Services for the Poor</B>
<BR>
Lawyers have a long and distinguished history of providing free or 
<I>pro bono</I> (from the Latin &quot;Pro bono publico,&quot; meaning &quot;for public good&quot;) legal services 
to the poora history that predates the nation's founding. 
 Accounts of the young lawyer Abe Lincoln 
representing poor clients for little or no compensation have 
always been part of the lore of the young Republic.  The 
history of formal pro bono legal service organizations is 
almost as long and equally distinguished.
<P>Organized delivery of free legal services began 
in 1876 with the founding in New York City of what 
became the Legal Aid Society (LAS).  Created to help 
poor German immigrants, by 1901 it was serving 16,000 
clients of all nationalities.  (Today, the LAS civil office 
has a $20-million budget, all of which comes from 
sources other than the LSC.)  Another venerable provider of legal services, the Chicago Bureau of 
Justice, was created in 1888 and was the first organization 
to provide civil legal help to the poor regardless of 
nationality or race.  By 1923, at least 33 legal aid societies 
in over 40 cities were providing basic legal services.
<P>According to the LSC, the number of private 
attorneys in the United States today who perform pro bono 
civil legal work for the poor is roughly 130,000.  This, 
however, was the figure cited by an ABA spokesman 
seven years ago when there were less than 500 organized 
pro bono programs.  Whatever the figure's accuracy then, 
it is totally unreliable today since the number of pro 
bono programs has increased to 950.  Moreover, ABA 
official Laurie Zelon recently conceded that the 130,000 
figure does not count the many lawyers who perform 
valuable pro bono service outside of organized 
legal-services programs.
<P>By conservative estimates, at least 400,000 and 
possibly as many as 600,000or between 44 and 67 
percent of all private attorneysdo pro bono work.  
These numbers are derived from surveys conducted in 
states with lawyer populations totalling half the lawyers in 
the U.S.
<P>Assuming that the remaining number of lawyers 
per forms an equal amount of pro bono work, the total number of lawyers rendering pro bono service in 
1991 was approximately 473,000.  Since the total lawyer 
population grew from 805,872 in 1991 to 896,172 in 1995, 
the number of lawyers currently providing at least some 
pro bono work is probably close to 525,000.  Thus, the 
range of 400,000 to 600,000 is realistic.  Whatever the 
exact number, it is far greater than the 130,000 
commonly cited.
<P>Information on the amount and value of pro bono 
work lawyers perform is available for six 
statesCalifornia, Florida, Maryland, New York, Oregon, and Texas.  
Together, these states contain 40 percent of all lawyers. 
 Assuming that these states and the value placed on their 
lawyers' time by their state bar leaders are representative 
of the total lawyer population, an estimated $3.3-billion worth of pro bono work is 
performed annually in the U.S.  That is over 8 times the LSC's 
1995 budget.
<P>Critics may dismiss this figure by arguing that 
most LSC-funded lawyers are full-time and compensated on 
a salary basis; their much lower hourly rate cannot 
be compared to this estimated value of pro bono hours.  
A more accurate analysis, they say, would compare 
the number of hours LSC-funded lawyers work to the 
number of pro bono hours.
<P>If we extrapolate the number of pro bono hours 
contributed in the six states surveyed (9,659,709) to 
all lawyers, this suggests that lawyers contribute 
over 24,000,000 pro bono hours per year.  In other words, 
pro bono attorneys contribute over five times the number 
of hours worked annually by the 4,749 staff attorneys of 
the approximately 281 providers in the LSC's network.

<h2>Pennsylvania Legislative Report: Restricting Foundation Influence Over State Government</h2>
<p>
<i>Editor's Note:  Last month we reported in "Briefly Noted" that the Pennsylvania General Assembly was considering a measure to curtail nonprofit foundation grantmaking to state agencies.  In this issue, Genevieve Young, a lawyer specializing in health law issues, provides a thorough review and analysis of the proposal, explores the events that led to its consideration, and explains why this has become an important issue for all state governments.</i>
<p>Imagine this scenario:  An organization obtains the names of every Medicaid-eligible student under the age of 21 in a state's public school system, and provides those names to the local school district.  It explains that it has figured out how to get Medicaid to make payments to the district every time a school encourages one of its eligible kids to go to the school guidance counselor.  Now imagine that every time one of those students visits a guidance counselor, the Medicaid program is billed for "mental health services."  Does this sound far-fetched?  It does.  Is it happening?  It is.  Does it sound like Medicaid fraud?  Yes.  So why haven't we heard of any investigations by the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (OIG)?  
<p>The reason the public is unlikely to hear Washington officials express outrage about this development is that the fraud has not been perpetrated by a fly-by-night health care company or a cabal of doctors.  It's being carried out by state officials in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and other states that have established public school health clinics.
<p>But this idea did not originate with the "educrats"; they're only implementing the programs, defending the benefits they derive from the program, and hiding the costs.  The real impetus for the creative exploitation of school health clinics and related programs comes from certain prominent private foundations.  They have discovered a new way to affect public policy -- just pay for what you want to have happen.  Foundations have found that it's possible to get the government to initiate unpopular programs by simply giving grants of money to state agencies to set up pilot projects.  
<p>The money comes with conditions, but cash-hungry agencies don't mind.  Agency heads are happy to do the foundations' bidding because they are always in search of new missions that they can use to justify their budgets.  The idea is to use foundation "seed money" to launch new government social programs or expand existing ones.  Soon various clients and interest groups will see the benefits for them; agency officials will argue that that there is an evident need for the programs; and the taxpayers -- not the foundations -- will be stuck with the bill.
<p>The problem with this cozy partnership of public agency and private foundation is that it's undemocratic.  If they wanted to provide services to people who want them, the foundations could spend their ample funds creating charitable institutions to accomplish a mission they think needs doing.  They could even practice the kind of public interest advocacy that unfortunately has become the commonplace way to generate support for programs that nonprofits think the government should provide.  But the foundations prefer to skip the process of public persuasion.  They would rather simply pay state agencies to buy their programs off the shelf.  
<p>This novel approach to public policy has gone unnoticed until recently.  But state legislators, protective of their own prerogatives, are taking notice.

<p><b>Pennsylvania Targets the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation</b>
<p>
<p>On November 19, 1996, the Subcommittee on House Resolution 37, a body reporting to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives' Committee on Education, adopted certain Findings of Fact and issued a Report.  It concerned abuses of a state program intended to allow public schools to tap into Medicaid funds.  House Resolution 37 directed Pennsylvania legislators to scrutinize the program, which it said lacked adequate statutory authority and which state agencies had initiated without affording to the legislature the opportunity to consider its consequences.  
<p>The Report's recommendations were based on thousands of documents, seven hearings, and testimony from nearly 75 persons.  While investigating how the legislature's authority had been circumvented, the Subcommittee discovered that state agencies had entered into relationships with certain private foundations in exchange for grant money to support the establishment of school-based health clinics.
<p>The Subcommittee Report expressed the concern that these relationships were usually carried out without notice to the general public.  It also became clear during the inquiry that certain employees of state agencies were having their salaries paid, in whole or in part, by private foundation money.  Moreover, foundation documents indicated that although money was distributed as a "grant," it had strings attached.  In the case of grants made by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), Pennsylvania had executed contracts with the foundation giving RWJF exclusive and perpetual rights to data collected in connection with the state program, even if the data would otherwise be considered confidential and private under federal and state law.
<P>The Report is a historic step -- and it is likely the first of its kind -- that a state's legislators have taken to curtail encroachments on their constitutional authority by unelected officials serving in the state's executive and administrative agencies.  The language of the Report is unambiguous:
<p>
<blockquote>The Select Subcommittee's inquiry has... found that the Executive Branch's school based mental health and rehabilitative programs have been created and implemented in ways that cavalierly disregard the proper role of the General Assembly as the elected representatives of the people in formulating public policy.  In this regard, the Executive Branch has implemented this massive program... through a patchwork of bureaucratic initiatives rather than the legislative process where these difficult social and fiscal issues are more properly decided.  For instance, comprehensive mental health services are being provided throughout the public school system despite the absence of clear and specific statutory authority....  While there may be funding authorization for these initiatives within the state budget, this is a woefully inadequate substitute for the solid statutory framework that forms the only legitimate foundation for exercise of power in a representative democracy.</blockquote>
<p>The Report specifically focuses on the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF).  It finds that besides bypassing the General Assembly, the Executive Branch "tailored its discretionary authority to meet the specifications of a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a private entity, in order to obtain funding from this private source."
<p>The Report further establishes that the Executive Branch relied upon a RWJF "pilot project" to develop techniques for implementing Pennsylvania's statewide program to provide comprehensive mental health and related services to students, a program that is heavily dependent on Medicaid and other state monies.  In fact, a Department of Public Welfare memorandum that the Select Subcommittee obtained identified RWJF as a primary source for all of Pennsylvania's school-based mental and other health initiatives.
<p>The authors of the Report say that its findings will be the basis for legislation on the use of medical and educational records by the public school system to protect the privacy rights of parents and children, and that the legislation should require parents' prior written and informed consent for their children to participate in activities and services provided in the schools.  The proposed legislation will also protect the fiscal integrity of Pennsylvania's Medicaid program, particularly as it is used by the public schools.  Finally, there are several specific recommendations about how private foundations may interact with state agencies.  Says Rep. Samuel E. Rohrer, Chairman of the Subcommittee on House Resolution 37, "It's going to have a tremendous ripple effect on all the policy coming out of this administration."
<p>The Report calls for laws that would require authorization before the state can receive grant funds.  It calls for prior notice to the public and the General Assembly before state officials can apply for private grant monies.  Without express statutory authorization, it says agencies cannot participate in pilot projects or other foundation initiatives that come with strings attached.
<p>The Report also recommends that any foundation-funded project narrative, its costs, and proposed terms and conditions should be reported in the Pennsylvania Bulletin, the official administrative register, along with 30 days' notice, and that the Majority and Minority Chairmen of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees and other committees should be notified before a state agency makes a commitment to participate in a project.  It would prohibit agencies from accepting private funds to pay the compensation of any state employee without providing similar detailed notice.
<p>Finally, the Report urges the Pennsylvania General Assembly to consider legislation to restrict the types of agreements that state agencies can enter into in exchange for grant money.  Adequate privacy safeguards should be instituted before agencies extend contractual rights to private organizations for any data collected in connection with their participation in or funding of state programs. 
<p>
<p>
<b>What's Going On in the Public Schools?</b>
<p>House Resolution 37 directed the Select Subcommittee to examine four major issues relating to Pennsylvania's public school system:
<p>1.	the use of the public schools to deliver mental health services;
<p>2.	whether existing safeguards and procedures for protecting student and family privacy were adequate, as well as whether there were proper procedures for obtaining the written, informed consent of parents on a full range of school activities, including participation in special education programs;
<p>3.	in the Report's words:  "fiscal, regulatory, privacy, informed consent, and other issues relating to a program enabling school districts to tap into Medicaid funding for certain health services (known as "ACCESS");"
<p>4.	the impact of recent changes in federal law, regulation, and policy as they related to education curriculum, learning outcomes, and other educational standards and goals for students.
<p>The Report's findings on those four issues included discussion of the results of the Subcommittee's investigation of the activities of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, other private foundations, and certain officials in the years 1988 through 1994 during the administration of Pennsylvania Governor Robert Casey.  On the issue of school-based clinics and school mental health programs, the Subcommittee found that "Private foundations have been utilizing their private funds in order to shape state programs for the delivery of mental health services in public schools without any oversight or regulation by the General Assembly."  It also stated that this policy had been driven by an agenda "which appear[s] to be indifferent to the privacy interests of students and families."
<p>The Subcommittee obtained documents from state agencies which showed how RWJF projects and activities in those agencies strongly influenced their programs.  For example, the state's director of the Office of Mental Health ("OMH") wrote that the RWJF's Mental Health Services for Youth project "was the prototype for our expanded mental health services under OBRA 89/EPSDT...a major OMH initiative."  "OBRA 89" stands for the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1989 and "EPSDT" means the federal Medicaid benefits known as "Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment."  This program is discussed in greater detail in the March 1996 issue of Organization Trends.  The state Mental Health Office began its ambitious project to deliver EPSDT services to children in Pennsylvania public schools and to bill Medicaid.  The elaborate scheme promised to transform schools into Medicaid providers so that school districts could become claim recipients for Medicaid funds.
<p>The Report notes that Medicaid law does not require states to use their public school systems to implement the EPSDT program.  Indeed, critics warn that there are important public policy reasons why the education system should not be commingled with a health care delivery system that emphasizes mental health diagnosis and treatment.  Will children be referred to mental health treatment for pedagogical reasons rather than medically indicated ones?  According to the report "The mental health alternative will be very tempting to some educators and school administrators who are frustrated by their inability to improve their students' academic and/or behavioral performance."  Already huge numbers of children all across the country are given Ritalin, a drug presribed for a condition labelled Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Is this a real health concern, or is it just easier for teachers to control kids by putting them on drugs?  
<p>
<b>Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Shows State Health Agencies How To Shape Education Policy</b>
<p>The RWJF is funding other states besides Pennsylvania to implement its program to establish school-based health services that can be billed to Medicaid.  In 1995, nine states received RWJF grants from its "Making the Grade Program: State and Local Partnerships to Establish School-Based Health Centers."

<b>Kentucky Follows Where Annie E. Casey Foundation Leads</b>
<p>
<p>The Johnson Foundation is not the only player in this Medicaid shuffle.  The Annie E. Casey Foundation has been a driving force behind a similar multi-million dollar initiative in Kentucky.  In December 1996, a small group of Kentucky state legislators who make up the state's Administrative Regulation Review Committee approved regulations funding a new $80 million dollar Medicaid program in the public schools.  Federal Medicaid monies would provide about $56 million and some $23 million would be from state education dollars.  Kentucky's Department of Medicaid Services provided the names of all Medicaid-eligible individuals under the age of 21 to the Kentucky Department of Education ("KDE").  This is the same procedure that was also followed by the Department of Public Welfare and the state's Department of Education.  The KDE then created a new Medicaid provider category -- local school districts.  Armed with their very own Medicaid billing numbers -- heretofore reserved only for health care institutions and practitioners licensed under state law -- school districts are now free to supplement what they consider their meager education budgets with "free" federal money from the Medicaid program.
<p>The KDE and the local school districts claim that children needing "special services" can now get them -- because Medicaid will pay for them.  These are services the schools are required to provide after all.  The regulations, however, allow the Medicaid program to be billed for all sorts of "physical and mental health services" provided not by licensed health care professionals, but by school personnel -- such as guidance counselors -- whose licensure or certification is assured by the "Kentucky Education Professionals Standards Board."
<p>Kentucky parents testified that they were concerned not only for the fiscal ramifications of this new program, but also, most importantly, for the welfare of the school children involved.  While state officials tout the program's potential for providing services to the state's most vulnerable children, the poor and disabled, they ignore the possibility that these children will be harmed, physically and emotionally, and that parents' rights to oversee and provide proper care for their children's needs will be infringed.  No Kentucky statutes provide standards for the administration of this program.  All of these concerns, however, apparently pale in comparison to the prospect that Kentucky's education bureaucracy will receive $80 million dollars in federal and state money.
<p>Pennsylvania's Committee on Education has aired its finding of facts before members of the state General Assembly.  It is hoped that hearings will be held soon in Kentucky, and that other states may follow suit.
<p>Two things are clear.  First, the giants of American philanthropy have directed their efforts again to the promotion of programs that intrude into areas that should remain the province of the family, not the state.  Second, they have done so in a manner that undermines the democratic process by excluding meaningful public discourse and flouting the authority of elected representatives.  
<p>Back room policymaking -- for that is what the "public-private partnership" is -- is being subjected to the glare of public scrutiny.  The Pennsylvania legislature has undertaken an important public service by exposing how private monies are used to initiate and implement state regulatory programs that ultimately are funded by the taxpayers.  How will Pennsylvania taxpayers respond?

<TR><TD>The Select Subcommittee's findings and recommendations are summarized in a report available from Rep. Samuel E. Rohrer, Chairman of the Select Subcommittee on House Resolution 37.  Room 423 South Office Building, Harrisburgh, PA  17120-2020
<p><b><center>EXCERPTS OF COMMITTEE REPORT:</center></b>
<p><blockquote>"When Executive Branch officials accept conditions in return for private funds, and without legislative oversight, this raises the disturbing question of whether the program was adopted because it best reflected legislative intent . . . or whether those objectives were compromised by the desirability of obtaining money from a private organization with its own notion of the common good.  It may be unclear, perhaps even in the bureaucracy's own collective mind, as to whether components of its program were adopted on the basis of money or merit."</blockquote>
<p><blockquote>"It is one thing to seek change, it is quite another when changes in public policy are influenced by the offering of private money to state governmental institutions, especially when those changes vitally affect individuals' privacy ... and dramatically affect the public treasury, all without ever approaching the General Assembly....  Rather, the changes sought are purchased from executive agencies, absent necessary statutory limits and protection, and then the agencies -- and these `purchasers of public policy' -- turn to the legislative branch with bloated budgets -- the consequences of their acts -- seeking continued funding of programs already administratively implemented under the inducement of private grant moneys."</blockquote>
<p><blockquote>"The availability of the mental health option for educators, together with the fact that federal and state taxpayers, rather than the school district, will pick up the cost, is likely to lead to a gross misutilization of Medicaid resources for reimbursing services that would not have been indicated as medically necessary if the child had accessed the Medicaid system through sources other than the public school system."</blockquote>

How the Great Foundations Established PBS</FONT><P>by Laurence Jarvik<BR><P><FONT SIZE=2>What we know as our present Public Broadcasting Service
began with a $5 million federal appropriation in 1967. Over thirty years PBS has grown 
into a multi-billion dollar worldwide multi-media empire.  While its public sources of funding and its 
commercial enterprises are common knowledge, its foundation ties are little understood.  PBS is largely the 
creation of the great private foundations.  The most important of these are the Ford Foundation -- which has 
poured over $300 million into the television market to support non-commercial broadcasting -- and the 
Carnegie Corporation of New York, whose 1967 Carnegie Commission report led to the establishment of 
the federally-funded Corporation for Public Broadcasting in the Johnson Administration. </FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Today, public radio and television comprise the largest networks on the air.  When judged by 
number of affiliates, PBS is bigger than Fox, CBS, NBC, or ABC.  Public broadcasters also publish 
magazines and newsletters, and they provide computer programs, on-line services, sites on the World Wide 
Web, and classroom study guides and textbooks.  They host conferences; license toys, games, and clothing; 
stage live shows; run mail order catalogs and retail stores; and distribute videocassettes and compact disks.  
These activities have created a large industry that parallels commercial broadcasting.  Yet the natural 
checks and balances of the marketplace do not govern their operations, nor are they regulated by the 
political checks and balances of a federal agency.
</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>The bureaucratic structure of PBS is deliberately complicated and very difficult to describe.  
Former PBS president Larry Grossman has said it is "a system no one in the outside world understands or 
can penetrate. It is a system that ensures that public television will remain mired in second-class status with 
a top-heavy, expensive and stifling bureaucracy..."  But in other ways it is like the other broadcast 
networks.  MacNeil-Lehrer Productions president Al Vecchione testified to Congress in 1988 that "all of 
the same functions, duties and responsibilities that exist for commercial broadcasting also exist for public 
broadcasting.  Commercial networks have a corporate division which does the allocating of money and 
establishes the priorities through policies; we have CPB.  They have a network division which obtains, 
schedules, and distributes the national programming; we have PBS."</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>In 1993 New York's Twentieth Century Fund, a liberal foundation based on the Boston 
department store fortune of Edward I. Filene, assembled a blue-ribbon task force to examine the finances 
and practices of PBS.  (PBS stations declined to open their books and therefore research was dependent on 
what station managers estimated rather than actual figures).  The panel was chaired by Brown University 
president Vartan Gregorian and included executives Eli Evans from the Revlon Foundation and Lloyd 
Morrissett from the Markle Foundation as well as former PBS president Larry Grossman and current PBS 
president Ervin Duggan.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>The task force's conclusions were presented in a final document, <I>Quality Time?</I>, which 
described a system that wastes three-quarters of its money, produces mediocre programming, and depends 
on British imports to please its audience.  The Twentieth Century Fund task force recommended that all 
federal aid to local PBS stations be ended, a conclusion that it based on the principle that "individual 
station operations should be supported by the communities they serve."  While the diagnosis of PBS's 
problems was telling, the task force prescriptions were not implemented.
</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT><P><I><B><FONT SIZE=2>BUNDY, FRIENDLY, GARDNER: PRESENT AT THE CREATION<BR></FONT></B></I><P><FONT SIZE=2>The origins of public broadcasting lay in a 1960's era decision by the Ford Foundation to shift its spending 
on television programming from support for <I>Omnibus</I>, a cultural affairs program hosted by Alistair 
Cooke in the 1950's on all three networks, and to invest instead in the creation of a national educational 
network.  That decision had the unintended consequence of drawing educational and cultural programs out 
of the commercial networks and putting it into the television equivalent of a fancy suburban subdivision 
insulated from civic life.  "Quality" programs like <I>National Geographic</I> specials, Texaco 
broadcasts from the Metropolitan Opera, and Leonard Bernstein's symphony concerts switched to PBS 
from the networks where they originated, and became the corollary to the hollowing out of American cities 
that resulted as the upper-middle classes retreated to secure enclaves of safe streets and good schools.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>In the 1950's, the commercial networks did a good job in exposing large audiences to cultural 
programming.  NBC mingled adaptations of Shakespeare (e.g. Sir Maurice Evans's 1954 <I>Hallmark Hall 
of Fame</I> production of "Macbeth") with its popular fare.  CBS's Ed Sullivan Show exposed audiences 
to the Bolshoi Ballet as well as Elvis Presley, and Agnes De Mille's ballets along with The Beatles. The 
networks in the 1950's and 1960's did much to provide "highbrow" entertainment for the mass audience, a 
fact that academic critics of television have tended to overlook.  Indeed, much PBS programming was 
poached from the commercial sector.  The <I>MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour</I> was produced by a team 
from NBC News and resembled the <I>Huntley-Brinkley Report</I>.  Bill Moyers shuttled between CBS 
News and PBS.  William F. Buckley's <I>Firing Line</I> first appeared on RKO General stations before 
moving to PBS.  <I>Frontline</I>'s first anchorwoman was NBC News' Jessica Savitch.  Veteran Moyers' 
producers from CBS News launched <I>The American Experience</I> while <I>National 
Geographic</I> specials simply moved from CBS.  <I>Nova</I>'s science producers came from the 
BBC.  The makers of CBS's <I>Captain Kangaroo</I> produced <I>Sesame Street</I>.  Even the 
Muppets had done early commercials for La Choy Chow Mein.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Yet, in his best-selling 1967 memoir, <I>Due to Circumstances Beyond Our Control</I>, Ford 
Foundation television consultant Fred Friendly called for the establishment of National Educational 
Television _ what would become PBS _ by postulating a conflict between "common stock"  and "the 
common weal."  Friendly claimed that ratings, commercials, and the profit motive were obstacles to first-
rate television coverage and argued that television would never live up to its potential until it abandoned its 
connection to the commercial marketplace.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Friendly recognized what writer Jane Jacobs in <I>Systems of Survival</I> (1992) has described 
as a conflict between the "commercial moral syndrome" based on trade and the "guardian moral syndrome" 
based on power and position.  But unlike Jacobs, who argues that each has its appropriate function, 
Friendly clearly disdained trade.  He argued that "television will gain the most if it is given a less profit-
minded base; instead, its health would be guaranteed by the nation's intellectual well being, which it must 
help develop in order for both the country and the medium to survive."  Simply put, Friendy wanted to 
replace popular and entertaining shows with programs acceptable to his personal taste and notions of 
quality.  He even boasted to readers that Ford Foundation president McGeorge Bundy recently had hired 
him to develop projects in "public service" broadcasting in opposition to the principles of commercial 
television.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Bundy and Friendly were an odd couple.  Friendly had built his personal fortune as Edward R. 
Murrow's radio and television producer:  their <I>Hear It Now</I> records were bestsellers.  He was an 
autodidact, a middle-class striver from Providence, Rhode Island who never graduated from college yet 
became a Columbia University professor.  By contrast, Bundy was a genuine Boston Brahmin who had 
won all the glittering prizes in education and public service.  The grandson of Harvard president A. 
Lawrence Lowell, Bundy moved from elementary school classmate of John F. Kennedy to dean of the 
Harvard faculty.  As a young man he had helped Secretary of War Henry Stimson write his memoirs, and 
in 1961 he left Harvard to serve as national security advisor to presidents Kennedy and Johnson, helping to 
develop the policies that led to the Bay of Pigs, the Cuban Missile Crisis and the war in Vietnam.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Bundy's reward for public service was the Ford Foundation.  As president from 1966 to 1979 
Bundy authorized the expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars for television _ for projects selected 
and overseen by Friendly.  The largest grant recipient was WNET channel 13, a flagship operation in New 
York City, America's largest television market and the nation's media center.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Sizeable grants also went to WGBH, Boston, whose president, Hartford Gunn, was McGeorge 
Bundy's Harvard roommate.  Not surprisingly, WGBH became the largest supplier of programs to PBS 
after Gunn became PBS's first president in 1969.  In public television lore the Boston station's call letters 
stand for "God Bless Harvard."</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Like many of the "best and brightest," Bundy could not have helped but be affected by one of the 
most influential books of the period, John W. Gardner's <I>Excellence: Can We Be Equal and Excellent 
Too?</I>, which appeared in 1961.  Gardner was a foundation man, too, heading up the Carnegie 
Corporation.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Gardner's arguments provide an intellectual roadmap for one of the great exertions of the early 
1960s:  The attempt by those in and around the Kennedy and Johnson administrations to foster a national 
program of cultural uplift and, with it, a new social and cultural elite.  Public broadcasting was but one 
element alongside New York City's Lincoln Center, Washington D.C.'s Kennedy Center, and the National 
Endowments for the Arts and Humanities in the mission to create American equivalents to Europe's 
national monuments of culture and learning and a social class to appreciate them.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>In his book, Gardner argued that America's leadership class at the close of the 1950's was 
inadequate for a great world power.  A Ph.D. in psychology with expertise in intelligence testing, Gardner 
was appalled by what he perceived as the middle-brow mediocrity of Eisenhower's America.  Like Bundy, 
he worked for the OSS during World War II and was obsessed by the idea of "excellence" and the 
possibility of engineering it.  Gardner wanted to make a clean break with middle-class values in order to 
properly organize America's "natural aristocracy."</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Because leadership responsibility in America was too widely dispersed among different interest 
groups at different social levels, Gardner argued that leaders were failing to recognize the "obligations 
which they have incurred as a result of the eminence they have achieved."  Lacking badges of rank, they 
could not recognize one another let alone claim "their responsibility to the larger community. Opposed to 
notions of middle-class individualism, Gardner sought ways to encourage opinion leaders "to help a society 
achieve the best that is in it."  One way was clearly to establish a broadcasting system dedicated to "public 
service" and aimed at a target audience of the social strata that ought to hold sway in society.  Watching 
such a network would be a marker of respectability.
</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Like Bundy, Gardner was a philanthropist, educator, and government official.  As president of 
Carnegie, he personally approved the initial $500,000 grant which made possible the 1967 Carnegie 
Commission report on public television.  As President Johnson's Secretary of Health, Education, and 
Welfare, Gardner testified before Congress in 1967 to urge federal funding of the Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting.  And shortly after that he approved the first HEW grants to produce <I>Sesame Street</I>.
</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2><i><b>THE ORIGINS OF PUBLIC BROADCASTING</i></b><BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>On September 16, 1962, the his-tory of American television changed when the legendary broadcast 
journalist Edward R. Murrow hosted the dedication of WNET channel 13 to the cause of public 
broadcasting.  It became the first non-profit educational television station to broadcast in New York City.  
This event marked the transition of what was then called "educational television" from an instructional 
medium for extension courses carried in secondary broadcast markets into what would become at decade's 
end the PBS network.  FCC chairman Newton Minow appeared with Murrow on the maiden broadcast.  
Minow's position was made clear the year before when, in a speech to the National Association of 
Broadcasters (NAB), he had scolded his audience for creating a "vast wasteland" - two words that 
influenced public perceptions of commercial television for a generation.  In due course Minow became 
chairman of PBS and later of the Carnegie Corporation of New York.  But on that day Murrow and Minow 
were celebrating the start of a public broadcasting system whose origins began in an earlier era of radio.  
Foundation financing, however, was always a key ingredient in the attempt to shape its development.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>The first educational stations were established by colleges and schools on radio in the 1920's.  
They tended to depend on the goodwill of state legislatures, boards of regents, and local philanthropists.  In 
1929, however, two major New York philanthropic institutions, the Carnegie Corporation and the Payne 
Study and Experiment Fund, evinced interest in the new trend by financing an Advisory Committee on 
Education by Radio.  The committee issued its report in 1930 with recommendations that the federal 
government reserve broadcast bandwidth for educational purposes and that it work to obtain funding for 
education programs.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>In July 1930, the Rockefeller Foundation commissioned its own report.  Unlike the Carnegie-
Payne study, Rockefeller recommended that educational programming be integrated into commercial 
broadcasts.  The straightforward reason: money.  Educators, it concluded, could not be expected to raise 
the budgets necessary to finance their own stations.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>A third group, the National Committee on Education by Radio (NCER), opposed a commercial 
takeover and supported the college and university stations.  Established in 1931 and financed by the Payne 
Fund, its members included the National Education Association and the National Association of State 
University Presidents.  The Committee urged the federal government to reserve 15 percent of available 
radio bandwidth for noncommercial educational use.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>The Federal Radio Commission, the FCC's predecessor, eventually agreed to set aside five radio 
channels for non-commercial use in 1938,  and it added fifteen more by 1945.  After World War II radio 
expanded into the FM portion of the dial, and the FCC reserved still more room for educational radio, a 
precedent that subsequently would be applied to television channels in the 1950's.
</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>At the end of World War II, fledgling commercial television broadcasters did not see educational 
broadcasters as potential rivals.  In October 1950, the University of Iowa began broadcasting on 
commercial channel WOI-TV, making it the first educational television station in the United States.  (It 
received funding from the Ford Foundation's Fund for Adult Education.)  Commercial broadcasters even 
offered educational institutions free television air time because in those early days they could not generate 
enough advertising to support a full schedule of paid programming.  For instance, DuMont (the forgotten 
fourth and least profitable television network, many of whose stations eventually became Fox affiliates 
when Rupert Murdoch set up shop in the 1980's), made a deal with the New York Board of Education to 
carry instructional programs at no charge.  Philadelphia's WFIL-TV collaborated with the University of 
Pennsylvania and the Annenberg Foundation, headed by publishing magnate Walter Annenberg (later 
funder of the Annenberg/CPB Project) to produce Penn faculty lectures grandly labelled "University of the 
Air."  So poor was the National Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB) that it resorted to 
"bicycling" - routing from television station to station - sound tapes (and later films) for broadcast among 
its 52 member stations.
</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>In 1948 the FCC froze new licenses for commercial television channels, an act that would have 
far-reaching consequences.  Officially, the action was caused by a dispute between CBS and NBC over 
incompatible color broadcasting systems that delayed the introduction of color television by a decade.  But 
one effect was that it helped to preserve the commercial networks' broadcasting oligopoly and, with it, the 
industry's dominance by Democrats.  The networks' FCC television licenses had been issued during the 
Roosevelt and Truman administrations, and many Democratic leaders considered that their partisan 
advantage in the new medium of television merely balanced the predominantly Republican owners of the 
major daily newspapers.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>A second consequence of the freeze was that it gave an opening to advocates of noncommercial 
broadcasting.  NAEB took quick advantage.  It retained the law firm of Leonard Marks and Marcus Cohn, 
both former FCC officials, and filed to reserve for educational use ten Ultra High Frequency (UHF) 
television channels.  UHF was a new television technology, analogous to FM in radio.  To discredit 
commercial VHF channels NAEB conducted a study of violence on television (a tactic repeated today in 
the debate over the so-called "v-chip").  Supported by a grant from the Ford Foundation, it documented 
2,970 "acts of violence" on commercial television in the single week, seventeen in children's viewing hours 
before 9 p.m.  This would be the first of many such studies that supporters of public broadcasting would 
use for political ends.  The National Education Association (NEA) and the American Council on Education 
(ACE), both Washington, DC-based education lobbies, supplied funds to prepare testimony before the FCC 
supporting channel reservation for educational purposes.  The NEA and ACE also supported the Joint 
Committee on Educational Television (JCET), a new group whose purpose was also to lobby for channel 
reservation.  It had a $90,000 grant from the Ford Foundation's Fund for Adult Education to pay for legal 
expenses incurred in preparing testimony on this issue before the FCC. </FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>JCET hired Telford Taylor to prepare its case.  He was the former prosecutor at the Nuremberg 
War Crimes Trial, a former FCC general counsel, and one of the most prominent attorneys in the United 
States at the time.  Exuding high-mindedness yet not lacking in political connections, Taylor prepared his 
testimony using the NAEB violence study as evidence of the need for commercial-free television channels.  
With financial help from the Ford Foundation's Fund for Adult Education, the JCET compiled over seventy 
statements supporting its case.  They came from the AFL-CIO, the PTA, and many prominent educators.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>By the time the FCC "freeze" on commercial licensing ended in 1952 American educational 
institutions had succeeded in obtaining exclusive rights to 242 radio and television frequencies for the 
purposes of non-commercial instructional broadcasting.  They were divided between 80 VHF stations and 
162 UHF stations.  Although educational television proponents did not have the equipment, staff, or 
programming to fully use all 242 channels, they promised a golden future.  In 1953, KUHT at the 
University of Houston, Texas, became America's first non-commercial educational licensee.  By 1960 there 
would be 49 educational television stations operating on the 257 channels reserved by the FCC.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2><I><B>HIS MASTERS' VOICE</I></B> <BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>In 1952 the Ford Foundation set up the National Citizen's Committee for Educational Television with a 
$90,000 grant to lobby for educational broadcasting.  That same year the Ford Foundation's Scott Fletcher 
became director of the Educational Television and Radio Center, which was established in Ann Arbor, 
Michigan to provide programs to educational broadcasters.  Ford gave the Center an initial grant of 
$1,350,000; a year later the grant was more than doubled.  By 1960, Ford's annual support was around $14 
million.  By 1970, Ford would pour over $300 million into a variety of educational stations and 
programming, creating in the process the National Educational Television network (NET).  "Without 
repeated Ford Foundation transfusions," Erik Barnouw, a Columbia University professor and historian of 
American television has said, "NET and the whole system might have soon collapsed."  NET would be the 
dominant force in educational television until the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) was 
established in 1967.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Other events in the 1950s helped to taint commercial broadcasting and aid Ford's cause.  Public 
broadcasting's proponents would argue that commercial interests were vulnerable to McCarthyism and that 
noncommercial broadcasting was less susceptible to blacklisting and the "Red Scare."  The television quiz 
show scandals of the late 1950s also helped discredit commercial sponsorship.  After English instructor 
Charles Van Doren confessed that producers had coached him to give the right answers on a popular quiz 
program, Congress in 1960 passed legislation prohibiting rigged contests and requiring notice of paid 
consideration.  The "payola" scandals involving recording company payments to radio disk jockeys 
followed in 1961.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Under these circumstances the commercial networks came to see support for educational 
broadcasting as a good way to relieve the pressure from Congress while transferring requirements for 
public service programming to a third party. As one commercial broadcaster told an interviewer, "PBS got 
the crazies off our backs."  From its inception, then, public broadcasting has been a servant of many 
masters. It was the result of a deal struck in the 1950's which has not come undone.  Commercial 
broadcasters seeking to maximize profits and reduce congressional interference sealed a pact with 
academic and foundation professionals seeking prestige, money, and influence.
</FONT><P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=2>USING PULL TO GET A TV STATION IN NEW YORK<BR></FONT></B></I><P><FONT SIZE=2>There was no national program schedule in educational television's early years.  Viewership of the mostly 
UHF stations was extremely sparse, and the quality of their instructional programs was low.  Almost none 
of Ford's money had gone to the creation of original programming.  And out of constitutional concerns, no 
federal funds were used to produce programming for educational stations in the 1950's.  John F. White, 
NET president from 1958 to 1969, adamantly opposed federal support, warning that a domestic United 
States Information Agency was a danger to democracy.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>The major purpose of the NET organization was to overcome the shortage of quality 
programming.  But NET was not a genuine network in the manner of NBC, CBS, or ABC.  Instead, it 
syndicated programs to educational television stations by bicycling films and tapes from station to station.  
In fact, a Ford Foundation grant enabled many stations to purchase their first videotape recorders in 
exchange for using NET materials in their broadcasts.  Still, John White wanted to create a national 
educational "fourth network," and he pushed for electronic interconnections over telephone lines and for 
more national programming, often against the objections of local university stations that had their own 
priorities.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>White's most important accomplishment was to establish an educational television station in New 
York City.  Although it was the nation's cultural and media center, New York had no educational non-
commercial television station until WNET was launched in 1962.  White understood that this single station 
would promote the political cause of his entire NET system.  He was right.  As television critic Martin 
Mayer has observed, "The breakthrough in non-commercial television came in 1962, when a self-
perpetuating nonprofit corporation raised the money to buy channel 13 in New York.  Educational 
television lost its state-college, school-system image and became something the New York-based national 
media started to discuss more seriously.  Congress responded with the first appropriations to help build and 
equip non-commercial stations, and Ford escalated its support."</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>White decided that the New York station had to be on a VHF channel because VHF had a better 
quality signal than UHF, where most educational stations were found.  To facilitate plans to purchase such 
a station, he assembled some of the wealthiest and most influential men in the city in the fall of 1959.  
They included Standard Oil heir John D. Rockefeller III, New York University chancellor George 
Stoddard, Corning Glass chairman Arthur A. Houghton, Jr. and New York Life chairman Devereux C. 
Josephs.  In November 1960, he met again with Josephs as well as Howard C. Sheperd, retired chairman of 
First National City Bank, and Henry G. Fischer, who later served as NET's FCC attorney.  As a result, 
Fischer tendered a $4 million offer to purchase station WNTA in Newark, New Jersey on February 9, 
1961.  The owner was National Telefilm Associates, whose chairman was a New York producer, Ely 
Landau.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Meanwhile, White had met with his friend Charles Heald,  president of the Ford Foundation 
(before Bundy)  to secure Ford's help on the purchase.  Heald's only condition was that NET not be 
publicly identified with the station's purchase.  White and Heald agreed that the New York station could 
not be perceived as more important to NET than any of the other 79 stations then subscribing to the 
network.  Rural stations were already worrying that NET might be "going New York" when its corporate 
headquarters earlier had moved from Ann Arbor to Manhattan.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>White also met with FCC Chairman Newton Minow.  Minow's primary interest was to keep the 
station out of commercial hands.  "As far as I'm concerned," he threatened Ely Landau at the time, "we're 
going to get a non-commercial station in there, one way or the another.  I don't know how yet, but I'm 
going to be very straight with you.  I'm going to oppose any transfer to another commercial licensee."  In 
other words, Minow intended to use his power as a regulator to force Landau to sell his station to the group 
he preferred.  Minow unsuccessfully tried to persuade his fellow FCC commissioners to pass a rule 
requiring cities with seven VHF channels to set aside one channel for educational broadcasting.  However, 
the FCC did agree to a special inquiry, which created a credible threat.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>On May 9, 1961, Minow delivered his "vast wasteland" speech.  "The public is your beneficiary," 
he said to the assembled broadcasters.  "If you want to stay on as trustees [of the airwaves], you must 
deliver a decent return to the public -- not only to your stockholders."  Minow went on to differentiate 
between shows he found worthwhile -- "CBS Reports," "The Twilight Zone," and Fred Astaire -- and the 
westerns and police dramas (many now regarded as classics) he scorned for their violence and 
simplemindedness.  And he denounced the "screaming, cajoling, offending" commercials that paid for such 
programming.  At a later press conference President Kennedy chimed in:  "Mr. Minow has attempted not to 
use force but to use encouragement in persuading the networks to put [on] better children's programs, more 
public service programs."  Then JFK tried to calm those who feared greater government involvement in 
broadcasting: "I don't know of anyone -- and Mr. Minow has already denied -- changing the basic 
relationship which now exists."</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>In fact, the chairman of the FCC had made clear to the American public how federal funding for 
educational broadcasting would be justified, and the President had endorsed his position.  Although most 
non-commercial broadcast frequencies were still unused, educators were determined not to relinquish them 
to the private sector.  In 1962 the federal government authorized $32 million dollars in matching grants for 
the construction of educational television facilities.  The educators and foundation heads had secured a 
beachhead to federal money and power over educational broadcasting and would use it for their political 
purposes.</FONT><P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=2>BRINGING UP BABY: CARNEGIE AND FORD SIRE PBS<BR></FONT></B></I><P><FONT SIZE=2>The 1960's were the most important decade in the development of public broadcasting.  "Public" replaced 
"educational" television under the aegis of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society.  In 1964, the federal Office of 
Education sponsored an educational broadcasting conference whose most significant result was the 
formation the next year of the Carnegie Commission on Educational Television.  It looked at issues in 
long-range finance.  When MacGeorge Bundy and Fred Friendly arrived at the Ford Foundation in 1966 
they focused on NET's potential for news and "public affairs" (i.e. political) programs unconstrained by a 
popular audience or commercial advertising.  Bundy had doubled to $40 million the annual budget of 
Ford's Division of National Affairs and he saw educational television as an outlet to promote "public 
discussion of issues which are controversial."  That meant Ford's agenda to shore up Great Society 
measures in race relations, poverty programs, and community action.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Bundy and Friendly drew up ambitious plans for satellite programming distribution and the 
establishment of a national broadcasting network.  At its peak the foundation was spending $100 million a 
year on educational television, sponsoring NET projects to influence the development of local and regional 
flagship stations around the country.  What Ford really needed now was a way to more clearly promote its 
political agenda on the most powerful station under its control in the largest market in the country, New

wish (Ford had actually paid for some of Carnegie's costs).  It called for a Corporation for Public 
Television, guaranteed federal support of educational stations, the establishment of two production centers 
and telephone or satellite facilities to make possible live broadcasts to the entire network.  In short, it 
recommended the basis for public broadcasting as it is today.  Legislation was introduced in Congress and 
LBJ declared his support for passage of the Public Television Act.  In 1967 Johnson signed the bill

<B><FONT SIZE=4>The Dramas of Donorship</FONT></B><P>by Robert Huberty<BR><P><FONT SIZE=2>Waldemar A. Nielsen, <I>Inside American Philanthropy: The Dramas of Donorship</I> (University of 
Oklahoma Press, 1996), 279 pages.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>The transfer of private wealth from one generation to the next will soon reach astounding 
magnitudes.  Assuming that fortunes currently accumulated will continue to grow, it has been estimated 
that Americans will inherit $225 billion annually for the next forty years, an amount totalling $3.2 trillion 
by the year 2010 and $10.3 trillion by 2040.  It is also estimated that one percent of all heirs will receive 
one-third of the wealth transfer, nine percent will receive the second third, and the rest of us will get the 
remainder.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Waldemar Nielsen, author of <I>The Big Foundations</I> (1972) and <I>The Golden 
Donors</I> (1985), ponders what this will mean for philanthropy.  As of 1994 there were about 39,000 
American foundations with combined assets of $196 billion.  Nielsen predicts that if only two percent of 
estimated private wealth is dedicated to philanthropy it is likely that the number of American foundations, 
their assets and their grantmaking will double by 2010.  That's only thirteen years away.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Inside American Philanthropy</I> is a fast-paced survey of dozens of American donors and 
the foundations they created.  Neither a scholarly history nor a research analysis of current philanthropic 
practices, it wears its learning lightly and its opinions are couched in careful and discreet language.  Yet 
Nielsen is a preeminent observer of the foundation scene, and the authority of his prescriptive judgments is 
implicit in the little parables he tells.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>For Nielsen the most salient feature of American philanthropy is that it is giving by individuals.  
No matter that their staffs think themselves professional and their procedures grow bureaucratic, American 
foundations are the creations of individual donors.  Each donor is differently motivated and all take 
distinctive courses of action.  The resulting "dramas of donorship" vary: some develop into heroic odyssey 
(Andrew Carnegie) while others take on the appearance of tragedy (Edwin Land) and farce (Andy Warhol).  
Good intentions yield bad results and vice versa.  Nothing can be taken for granted about the future 
creation of foundations because each donor is differently motivated, has a different end in mind, and 
chooses different means to achieve it.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Nielsen's book is a collection of stories.  California's Arnold O. Beckman, who has advanced 
scientific knowledge through the discriminating distribution of major gifts during his lifetime, is a 
philanthropist in the classic mold.  More innovative is George Soros, who is using his wealth to open 
markets and promote political integration in the formerly Communist states of Europe at the same time that 
he is wheeling and dealing to make money in those markets.  Nielsen applauds the scope and creativity of 
Soros's giving but worries that it may move beyond "its proper boundaries."  He says nothing about Soros's 
giving for drug legalization.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Arts philanthropy seems especially prone to high-handed and questionable behavior.  The uranium 
tycoon Joseph Hirshhorn seems to have outsmarted the federal government by giving it his enormous but 
less than mediocre art collection on condition that the Smithsonian build a museum on the Mall with his 
name on it.  And Occidental Petroleum's Armand Hammer for years hindered sensible art planning by the 
Los Angeles County Museum of Art.  It deferred to his demands because it expected to get his art 
collection, only to discover that he was building his own museum down the street.  Such entertaining 
examples are reminders that philanthropy involves dealmaking as well as generosity.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>Nielsen also identifies new trends in philanthropy.  For instance, it is likely that women will have 
more power over philanthropy as more become successful entrepreneurs or inherit vast estates (a 
consequence of the "unlimited marital deduction" permitted by tax reforms in 1986).  Women now create 
about one-quarter of new foundations.  One welcome result, Nielsen speculates, is that foundations 
increasingly will stress the importance of family life.  But he also notes that women seem more apt to treat 
private giving as an initial investment in social programs whose upkeep can then be transferred to the 
federal government.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2>The notion that private foundations should fund ideas to make government more active is another 
recent development.  Nielsen gives major credit to Mary Lasker, president of the Albert and Mary Lasker 
Foundation, for promoting the concept of foundations as  public interest lobbyists.  Beginning in the 1940s, 
she helped launched the war on cancer and lobbied Franklin Roosevelt for government funding of medical 
research.  The Lasker Foundation also pioneered such then-innovative devices as soliciting celebrity 
endorsements for disease prevention, offering public awards for achievements in medical journalism, and 
publishing an annual health fact book.  This makes her in Nielsen's book "one of the half-dozen greatest 
American philanthropists ever."</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>If it is ironic that philanthropists who made their money in the marketplace should want to see 
government spending replace it, it is doubly so that Nielsen should have such confidence that government 
can carry out their intentions.  Whatever their flaws and idiosyncracies, individual donors are Nielsen's 
heroes.  They are the driving force behind what might be considered a final stage of capitalism: the urge to 
give away voluntarily the wealth that one has spent a lifetime acquiring.  Donors fuel philanthropy's vessels 
and set the course; foundation executives only steer.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Indeed, Nielsen's convictions are so strong that he makes a concluding argument against 
foundation perpetuity.  Using the example of the Carnegie Corporation, Nielsen shows how chance and 
circumstances have shaped its leadership and grantmaking since Andrew Carnegie's death in 1919.  Nielsen 
has a high regard for the post World War II initiatives of Carnegie president John Gardner and his 
successors, but he thinks Carnegie might just as easily have followed other unnamed prominent 
foundations into "stagnation, fragmentation, and bureaucratization of programs."</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Waldemar Nielsen looks forward to the next century's explosion of private wealth and the 
prospects for a flood of major giving by individuals.  Whatever his own political convictions, this makes 
<I>Inside American Philanthropy</I> a socialist's nightmare.</FONT><P>

<blockquote>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times">You made a valuable contribution to unmasking the Ford Foundation's ethnic agenda with the 
insightful and very informative article by Linda Chavez and Jorge Amselle ["Inside the Ford Foundation's 
Plan to Split Apart America,' vol.1, no.10].</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times">Chavez and Amselle are absolutely on target when they describe the leaders of La Raza and 
MALDEF as crated and "kept" by Ford Foundation funding and in their description of how these self-
styled Latino leaders do not represent what a majority of Latinos perceive to be in their best interest.  
Nevertheless these Ford Foundation-nurtured organizations merit close scrutiny because they exert political 
influence and they tned to shape news in the Spanish media.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A good example is California's Proposition 187 initiative. During the petition phase, opinion 
polling found that about a three-fifths majority of Latinos supported the measure. Alarmed by these results, 
the Latino activist groups launched a major public relations campaign to convince Latinos that the measure 
was racist and inspired by anti-Latino sentiment. By the time the vote took place, the Latino vote in support 
had fallen to about 40 percent.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Latino organizations and their supporters in the Spanish-speaking media have also conducted 
major efforts to convince Latinos that immigration reform is racist-inspired and anti-Latino. Yet, as Chavez 
and Amselle document, Latino opinion still favors reduced immigration.  It is not hard to figure out why.  
The survey data indicate that the strongest support for immigration reduction among Latinos is by those 
who immigrated themselves most recently, and whose job might be readily taken by another new 
immigrant.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Even though the Latino activist organizations have been cowed by public opinion for the moment 
into dropping defense of illegal immigration, that still is on their agenda, albeit in disguise.  That really is 
what the call during the Hispanic March for an extension of the amnesty for illegal aliens was all about. 
Yet, in one of the ironies of having so much money to spread around, the Ford Foundation also funded 
research on the conditions of the US migrant labor workforce that came to the conclusion that their best 
hope for the future lies in restricting the supply of illegal aliens taking those jobs. A Latino leader who 
wanted to advance the working conditions of his fellow Latinos would be a strong supporter of a system of 
verifiable identification along with employer sanctions against employing illegal aliens. Instead it appears 
that the Ford Foundation-backed Latino leaders are focused only on building the size of their supposed 
constituency as fast as possible through wide-open immigration.</FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Your readers who want to pursue information on the Ford Foundation's 
social agenda with Latinos might want to read <I>Importing Revolution: Open Borders and the Radical 
Agenda</I>, by William Hawkins. Like Chavez and Amselle's article, and Georgie Anne Geyer's 
investigative reporting, it documents how the Ford Foundation has been relentlessly pursuing a social 
policy designed to remake the American society in ways that most of us would oppose.</FONT>

<B><FONT SIZE=4>Why would a &quot;Hoosier&quot; concert pianist
interrupt his musical careeer to found a Washington think-tank?</FONT></B>
<P>
by Laurence Jarvik<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>By any measure Dr. Balint Vazsonyi has had a remarkable
life. A refugee who fled his native Hungary after the failure
of the 1956 revolution, he is a concert pianist who has performed
on four continents, including the complete cycle of Beethoven
sonatas in New York, London, and Boston. He is also a historian,
professor, businessman, producer and host of  television documentaries
on Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert and Brahms, a cultured man of the
world who has lived in Budapest, Vienna and London. Yet at the
same time he is a middle-American family man, a loving father
and husband who studied at Florida State University in Tallahassee,
and who taught music at Indiana University in the 1970's and 80's.
His favorite film is Frank Capra's Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,
he once ran for mayor of Bloomington on the Republican ticket,
and his favorite television program is  Seinfeld.  Last year he
moved to the Watergate apartments and became director of the Center
for the American Founding at the Potomac Foundation in McLean,
Virginia.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Very few Americans have the special gifts Vazsonyi
possesses.  &quot;Balint was a very gifted young pianist when
I knew him at Florida State,&quot; recalls Ellen Taafe Zwilich,
today Carnegie Hall's Pulitzer-prize winning composer-in-residence.
When he performed in London The Times declared, &quot;Beethoven
himself might have played his sonatas much as Mr. Vazsonyi did.&quot;
Daniel F. McDonald, president of the Potomac Foundation, recruited
the pianist for his team of experts after hearing Vazsonyi speak
and play at the Smithsonian Institution.  &quot;He  represented
a special intellectual resource,&quot; he said.  &quot;There's
no one else like him.&quot; McDonald backed Vazsonyi's plan for
the Center for the American Founding because he felt it was important
to &quot;frame policy dialog in terms of the most fundamental
considerations&quot; -- the Constitution and the founding principles
which inform it, principles which have been incorporated into
something Vazsonyi calls his &quot;Reaffirmation of the American
Founding,&quot; a document which has been signed by scores of
public figures.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We therefore resolve actively to oppose those practices
which are in direct contradiction to the American Founding and
reaffirm our commitment to its basic principles,&quot; reads the
conclusion to the document Vazsonyi has circulated to the nation's
policy elites and thousands of ordinary citizens across America
who have heard him on radio talk shows.  He calls his reaffirmation
campaign &quot;Re-Americanization&quot; in a September 1996 National
Review article. And his efforts are beginning to pay off. The
1996 Republican platform contained a commitment to the American
Founding. And there may be Congressional hearings on the American
Founding in the next Congress if Vazsonyi has his way. He calls
his political agenda simply &quot;American&quot; and says the
issues at stake are neither Democratic nor Republican; rather
they are the fundamental principles which undergird what he sees
as the unparalled success of this nation over two centuries. In
the National Review Vazsonyi declared: &quot;By the other side
I do not mean true Democrats: indeed many of them  might seize
the moment to reaffirm their American foundations. No: I refer
to those whose ideas clearly derive from opposing doctrine.&quot;
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The opposing doctrine, says Vazsonyi, &quot;has 
worn many labels -- all variations on socialist philosphy.&quot;
Socialism depends on dividing people: Hitler used race and nationality,
Lenin and Stalin mostly class. The outcome is the same. Germany
and Russia oppressed Vazsonyi's native Hungary for many years,
and his family experienced persecution under both regimes.  He
perceives no real difference between the various forms of tyranny
he endured and sees a continuous struggle between their forces
and the free world. World War I, World War II and the Cold War
were, in the Vazsonyi analysis,  episodes in a century-long attempt
by socialist forces to achieve world domination, opposed consistently
by English political thought representing freedom and respect
for the rights of the individual.  English has given us the word
fairness,&quot; he says. &quot;No other language has yet come
up with even a translation of this word.&quot; He has presented
this perspective in newspaper articles, journals of opinion, and
faxes titled &quot;The Vazsonyi Analyis&quot; as well as in speaking
appearances at venues as varied as the International Monetary
Fund, the National Press Club, the Library of Congress, the Leadership
Institute and the International Platform Association.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Vazsonyi's most important essay, written for the
Potomac Foundation in 1995, is called &quot;The Battle For America's
Soul.&quot; It traces the origins of America's founding principles
to English political thought, and the current proliferation of
group rights mostly to German philosophy. The latter has acquired
bridgeheads in the media and the entertainment industry, and undermined
the traditional political health of American universities. Vazsonyi
speaks from personal  experience on college campuses.  He was
a professor of music at Indiana University and later dean of music
at the New World School of the Arts in Florida. While teaching
at Indiana in 1991, Vazsonyi confronted an organizer who arrived
on campus to co-ordinate opposition to Desert Shield  for a left-wing
group called &quot;the Committee Against the War in the Middle
East.&quot;The Bloomington Herald-Times did not identify C. Clark
Kissinger as anything other than an &quot;author.&quot; Vazsonyi
investigated and discovered that not only were there no books
by this Kissinger in his University library, but that he was a
professional anarchist whose ideal was the Chinese Cultural Revolution.
The lcoal paper did not disclose that the &quot;peace&quot; group
teach-in featured books by Marx and Trotsky, nor that a student
spokesman defined himself as &quot;a Marxist.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Outraged at the deception by the only newspaper in
his community, Vazsonyi organized a &quot;Stand Up for America
Alliance.&quot;  He confronted then-Congressman Frank McCloskey
at a town meeting and took issue with what he thought were McCloskey's
irresponsible statements against U.S. government policy in the
Gulf. Vazsonyi found himself greeted with applause and enthusiasm
by the crowd. He was approached to run for Mayor of Bloomington
as a Republican, a town as liberal as Berkeley, California or
Cambridge, Massachusetts. Although he lost, Vazsonyi had caught
the political bug. He started sending out faxes to his friends
and acquaintances that they called &quot;V-grams,&quot; containing
his perspective on political developments. He joined the Potomac
Foundation as a fellow in 1993, and in 1995 moved to Washington
to oversee the Center for the American Founding, carrying his
struggle to the heart of the American Leviathan.<BR>

In June, author Joe Maxwell attended the 
first-ever reunion of Booker T. Washington's descendants, which 
was held at the institution Washington founded, the 
Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. He records here his impressions of 
 the legacy of this great man.</font>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<P>
<a name="1">
<BR>
<P>Everything at Tuskegee seems to have changed for 
Ethelda Murray Hockett.  The room where once she learned 
the trade of &quot;domestic science&quot; is now a lavish testament to 
the man she reveres.  At one end of this massive boardroom, 
a life-size oil portrait of her uncle, Booker T. 
Washington, gazes from behind Mrs. Hockett's graying 
90-year-old head. Seated in her wheelchair, Mrs. Hockett has 
joined about 100 other relatives at a first-ever reunion 
of Washington's family.
<P>While Mrs. Hockett's creamy brown face registers 
justifiable pride, she also registers a melancholic hint of 
sorrow and regret as she wonders aloud what her uncle would 
think of his school today.
<P>&quot;You see,&quot; she notes in a wistful whisper, &quot;they've 
gotten away from the trades.&quot;
<P>In fact, Tuskegee University, a school founded with 
a $2,000 Alabama state grant in 1881 on the premise 
that every graduate should master basic academic 
disciplines and a marketable trade, no longer even has a &quot;trade 
building.&quot; Instead, the scores of stately Greek Revival 
brick buildings that Mr. Washington's early students built 
with their own hands are now completely devoted to 
&quot;higher&quot; academia.
<P>&quot;I have been told that the reason there has been such 
a transition is that the emphasis is more on the trades in 
higher development and sciences,&quot; continues Mrs. Hockett. 
&quot;Of course, in those early days, Dr. Washington was 
interested in young people who came to the school learning to use 
their hands so they could really help their family.&quot;
<P>Mr. Washington's niece is old enough to 
remember hearing her uncle preach his dignity-through-work 
vision for climbing out of slavery.  &quot;There is no position, 
however high in science or letters or politics, that I would 
withhold from any race, but I would have the foundation clear,&quot; 
Mr. Washington once said.  His goal crossed lines of race 
or class: &quot;Usefulness . . . is the supreme end of education.&quot; 
<P>Early in this century Mr. Washington's 
philosophical rivals overtook him, and they still reign today.  Where 
Mr. Washington emphasized respect earned, modern 
elitists have emphasized rights possessed.  Today, politicians 
and reporters now frequently babble that man's highest goal is education, 
defined most often in the narrow sense of 
a college degree.  Little is said about the usefulness of 
one's schooling.
<P>Yet market realities today vindicate Mr. 
Washington's wisdom: all-too-familiar are stories of college 
graduates who either can't find a job in their field, or find they 
have pursued a college degree that has prepared them for 
nothing useful.
<P>In the name of equality, Washington's opponents 
have virtually demanded that a college education be available 
to and sought by all, regardless of desires or talents.  No 
one, they suggest, should have to endure a life of manual labor.
<P>
This, of course, was just the sort of thinking 
Washington's life and words refute: &quot;The ambition to secure an 
education was most praiseworthy and encouraging.  The idea, 
however, was too prevalent that, as soon as one secured a 
little education, in some unexplainable way he would be 
free from most of the hardships of the world, and, at any 
rate, could live without manual labour.&quot; 
<P>
But Washington's opponents actually have erased 
the very thing they sought to achieve: options.  
Twenty-two-year-old John McLeod is a good example.  He feels 
torn between a truly valuable career and society's 
expectations. &quot;Part of me says that I ought to go on to college and get 
a degree just for the sense of accomplishment and 
because that is what society says I ought to do,&quot; confesses the 
lanky Mr. McLeod, adorned in a hairnet at the bagel shop 
where he works while considering his future goals.  &quot;But the 
other part of me says that I'm good with my hands--I can 
make a good living as a welder.&quot;
<P>Twice Mr. McLeod has entered Tennessee universities, only to exit 
without any clear goals.  He moved to Jackson, Mississippi, to apprentice as 
a welder.  &quot;I think I could make a living as a tradesman,&quot; he says. &quot;I'd like 
to have the option of schooling. . . .  But if I enjoy, say, being a mechanic or welder, I want to do 
it without any feelings of guilt or reservation because 
society might look down on a blue-collar job.&quot;
<P>Today's students often forgo the necessary and 
difficult training they need for a promising career in the 
trades. Many prefer the shiny bauble of an academic degree but 
no job prospects.
<P>
<a name="2">
<P><B>Washington and W.E.B. Du Bois</B>
<P>Booker T. Washington foresaw the problem of the dumbing down of America.  He did not diminish the 
importance of ideas, but he showed the earthy wisdom of 
someone who does not need the accolades of others.  Throughout 
his life, Washington was attacked mostly by Northern 
liberals, including W.E.B. Du Bois, who argued that blacks 
could not achieve equal status with whites except by radical, 
top-down intervention.  Washington championed work; Du 
Bois called for political action.  By the time Washington died 
in 1915, Du Bois seemed to have won the argument, 
especially given the establishment of Jim Crow laws in the South 
to impede black economic progress.  Washington soon 
was being called an &quot;Uncle Tom.&quot;
<P>&quot;Booker T. Washington was dealt one of the 
toughest hands of any black leader in American history,&quot; 
conservative black economist Thomas Sowell has written.  
Washington, says Sowell, understood that in the post-Civil 
War South, the fates of the black and white race were inextricably 
linked; merely looking at the statistical mix of the region70 percent white, 
30 percent blackmade that point clear. &quot;Washington was able to enlist 
the support of some whites by arguing that blacks would either help lift up the 
South or help to drag it down,&quot; says Sowell.
<P>
In actuality, argues Sowell, Du Bois and Washington were  
opposite sides of the same coin.  Du Bois concentrated his energy 
on ending the segregation which was held in place by the majority 
of whites, while  Washington focused on &quot;the internal 
self-development of blacks.&quot;  This led him to seek 
out and nurture positive relationships with those whites who would 
support his efforts.  &quot;The net result was that Washington was 
often praising whites of good will, while Du Bois was 
attacking whites of ill will,&quot; writes Sowell.
<P>
Both men recognized that, no matter when civil 
rights were secured, diligent, hard work would always be 
required for self-improvement.  Both men worried about those 
in their race who would seek a hollow sort of advancement 
that circumvented diligent labor.  Du Bois, notes Sowell, 
spoke of &quot;the Great Lack which faces our race in the 
modern world, lack of Energy,&quot; which he attributed to 
&quot;indolence&quot; growing out of tropical origins and which had now 
become a kind of &quot;social heredity.&quot;  Du Bois doubted that 
merely achieving certain rights would lead to the immediate 
improvement of his people: &quot;Some few would be 
promoted,&quot; observed Du Bois.  Nevertheless, &quot;the mass would 
remain as they are&quot; until the younger generation began to 
&quot;try harder&quot; as the race &quot;lost the omnipresent excuse for 
failure: prejudice.&quot;
<P>&quot;Du Bois' assessment of the black masses at that time 
was not very different from that of Booker T. Washington, 
who characterized many of them as sunk into `listless 
indifference, or shiftlessness, or reckless bravado,'&quot; asserts  Sowell.
<P>Over the long haul, however, the two men pursued 
different strategies.  Du Bois chose to concentrate his energies 
for improving his race on the &quot;talented tenth,&quot; those blacks 
who had been freed and gained social development before 
the Civil War.  Washington, on the other hand, staked his 
claim on improving the lives of the other 90 percent, those 
who lacked education and opportunities. Washington 
urged blacks to envision work as a divine right to be 
exercised along with the vote.  Washington also urged them to be 
self-reliant rather than reliant on whites, and he warned them 
not to be sidetracked by the &quot;geegaws&quot; of their 
newfound freedom whether they were material possessions or 
legal rights. Although the school now seems focused on 
the &quot;talented tenth&quot; approach,  Tuskegee Institute was 
founded to uphold Washington's teachings.
<P>In <I>The Future of the American Negro,</I> Washington  
states: &quot;An individual or a race that is strong enough, is 
wise enough, to disregard makeshifts, customs, prejudices, 
alluring temptations, deceptions, imitationsto throw off 
the mask of unreality and plant itself deep down in the clay, 
or on the solid granite of nature, is the individual or the 
race that will crawl up, struggle up, yes even burst up; and in 
the effort of doing so will gain strength that will command 
for it respect and recognition.&quot;
<P>Sadly, however, Washington's basic teachings on 
the dignity of hard work and earned respect have lost 
authenticity in modern America.  Being grateful for an 
opportunity, or the idea of  &quot;starting at the bottom and working to 
the top,&quot; has been supplanted.  In the process, too many 
people of all races have recklessly dismissed altogether the great principles of living espoused by Booker T. Washington.
<P>
<a name="3">
<P><B>The Washington Family Reunion</B>
<P> The Booker T. Washington reunion was attended 
by nearly 100 people.  The vast majority knew very little 
about their great ancestor's life, much less about his 
teachings. Almost none of Mr. Washington's descendants live 
either philosophically or geographically near the soil of 
Tuskegee. In fact, many of the descendants had for years concealed 
the fact that they were Washington's offspring.
<P>The widow of Booker T. Washington III, Joyce 
Washington, related to one group at the reunion how her husband, 
 Washington's own grandson, had been ashamed of 
his ancestry at times and had distanced himself 
geographically and emotionally.  &quot;Booker was not telling people in 
New York what his name was,&quot; she said.  &quot;He went through 
this whole story about what a difficult time he had with 
the name, and especially in New York City, where there are so many 
minorities.&quot;
<P>But, she says, later in life he began to see the value of his 
grandfather's teachings.  Similarly, many at the reunion seemed to realize for 
the first time the greatness of the man and his teaching.  Sarah Thrash is 
the great-granddaughter of Booker T. Washington; she attends church 
at the Allen Temple in Oakland, California, where several stained 
glass windows depict historic black figures including Frederick 
Douglass and Booker T. Washington. Though she was his 
direct descendent, Mrs. Thrash kept quiet about her relation 
to Washington.  But after the reunion weekend, she said 
she had gained a much greater appreciation for the man.  
&quot;It gives me a great sense of pride,&quot; she said. &quot;After 
this weekend, I'll feel so much more pride looking up at 
that window.&quot;
<P>Though she was his direct descendent, Mrs. Thrash 
 kept quiet about her relation to Washington.  But after the reunion weekend, she said she had

<P>
Throughout the Washington reunion weekend, Edith Washington, one of four living granddaughters of 
the Tuskegee legend, played the role of proud 
grandparent, great-grandparent, and great-great-grandparent.  At an 
introductory  gathering of the family outside Washington's home, 
The Oaks, at the edge of Tuskegee University, Edithwith microphone 
in handproudly introduced virtually all of the estimated 100 
attendants by name and explained their place in the family tree.
<P>When she got to one name, 26-year-old Douglass 
Washington Morris, she gushed about the recent Tuskegee graduate.  &quot;And 
back there is Douglass Washington Morris,&quot; she said, noting his 
amazing heritage: his great-grandfather is Booker T. Washington, while his 
great-great-grandfather on his other side is Frederick Douglass.
<P>&quot;Douglass is a consultant with IBM in Chicago,&quot; 
Edith boasted. &quot;He makes $100,000 a year.&quot;
<P>Everyone laughed at her grandmotherly candor; 
Mr. Morris seemed a bit embarrassed.
<P>
<a name="4">
<P><B>Education for What?</B>
<P>&quot;There are too many people in the world who give 
their whole lives grasping at the shadow instead of the 
substance&quot; wrote Booker T. Washington.
<P>Eleven out of the 13 great grandchildren at the Booker 
T. Washington reunion have achieved college degrees: 
surely their forefather would be proud, especially since most of 
them seem actually to be using their advanced educationthe 
very thing Mr. Washington called for.
<P>As the Washington family gathered at the old Oaks 
home on the grounds of Tuskegee University, Tuskegee 
president Benjamin Payton commended them for returning to 
their forefather's home.  He explained how difficult it has been to 
continue raising the money the university needed to 
keep growing and thriving.  He reiterated that Tuskegee's 
effort to carry on the Washington tradition remains strong.
<P>
Yet Payton never bothered to mention that the 
university now has no vocational offerings in its catalogue. 
What would the champion of dirt farmers and manual 
laborers have thought of that?  Would he be pleased or dismayed 
that none of the nearly 100 descendants at the reunion earn 
their living in a trade?  When asked whatever happened to 
the Washington emphasis on trade school training alongside 
traditional academic training, President Payton replied: &quot;We 
think that the education of the whole person is extraordinarily 
important.  We do it now at a different level.  What was being done 
in 1881 was to meet a need at that time.  There were so many 
African Americans that needed a knowledge of how to make 
the transition from agrarian to industrial [society]. . . .  We 
don't need a Tuskegee training blacksmiths now. . . .  We need 
blacks trained in electrical engineering, in aerospace 
engineering, and in health sciences. . . .  All these are contemporary 
expressions of providing an education that meets the needs of 
today's society . . . and not just what was going on in ancient 
Greece and Rome.&quot;
<P>
<a name="5">
<P><B>Work toward Usefulness</B>
<P>Later in the weekend, Edith sat with Washington's 
three other living granddaughters at a table of honor. The 
remaining family members sat at tables according to their 
age. Edith called for quiet and introduced Ethelda 
Murray Hockett, &quot;the oldest living descendent of Booker T. 
Washington,&quot; and the clan hushed to hear her memories of 
their family hero.
<P>Her uncle, she says, would love the pristine 
modern Tuskegee campus, built by early students who rotated 
three days of vocational training with three days of 
academic schooling.  &quot;He wanted students to use the knowledge 
they had and learn trades,&quot; she said, noting quietly: &quot;The 
trade building is gone now.&quot;
<P>&quot;It has been replaced by engineering,&quot; injected Edith, 
&quot;a higher step up.&quot;
<P>Throughout the weekend, Edith and other elders 
urged their youth to attend special college admittance 
sessions being offered by Tuskegee's recruitment staff.  The role 
and value of vocational training, however, was never discussed.
<P>Contended Agnes Louise Washington O'Neal, 
Edith's sister: &quot;[Washington] was a man of his times.  Times 
have changed.&quot;
<P>Have times changed?  Or has our understanding of 
what the times need changedand for the worse?
<P>Booker T. Washington foresaw two courses that all 
Americans, regardless of color, could take.  One esteems a 
person for his degree of  work; the other merely esteems the 
degree worked for.  &quot;I would say to the black boy what I would 
say to the white boy, `Get all the mental development your 
time and pocketbook will allow,'&quot; said Washington.
<P>The earnest desire to work toward usefulness inspired Booker T. Washington.  
Today he would surely applaud those in his family whose work ethic has led them to 
become doctors and lawyers; but he would surely give an 
equally rousing round of applause to those whose hard work 
ethic has led them to become master carpenters or masons.
<P>At one point during the Tuskegee reunion, several 
family members visited a bronze statue that depicts the &quot;Wizard 
of Tuskegee&quot; standing to lift a veil from a kneeling black 
man whose face looks skyward.
<P>The statue begs this question: what does the veil 
symbolize?  Does it represent an ignorance of &quot;higher 
knowledge&quot; that is being removed?  Or does it represent the removal 
of another sort of ignorance: the myth that human dignity 
is rooted purely in the vocation chosen, rather than in 
the excellence of work done in a chosen vocation?  &quot;Any 
man,&quot; said Mr. Washington, &quot;regardless of color, will be 
recognized and rewarded in proportion as he learns to do 
something well, learns to do it better than anyone else, 
however humble.&quot;
<P>Life, he taught, is the greatest classroom, and its 
graduates earn the highest degree.  &quot;The person who has 
mastered something, who understands what he is doing . . . out in 
the world, master of himself everywhere, that person,&quot; said 
Mr. Washington, &quot;is a scholar.&quot;
<P>
<BR>
<a name="6">
<B>Where Have All the Tradesmen Gone?</B><BR>
<P>
Washington understood what was at stake: &quot;We 
shall prosper as we learn to dignify and glorify common labour 
and put brains and skill into the common occupations of life; 
shall prosper in proportion as we learn to draw the line between 
the superficial and the substantial, the ornamental gewgaws 
of life and the useful.  No race can prosper until it learns that 
there is as much dignity in tilling a field as in writing a poem.&quot;
<P>And now, a hundred years later, corporate and 
small-town America is begging for tradesmen.  From bricklaying to 
tool-and-die work, the sort of high-skill, brain-and-brawn 
labor that Mr. Washington advocated is in rare supply but 
high demand.
<P>A recent Arthur Andersen Enterprise Group survey 
revealed that 25 percent of 919 small businesses surveyed 
fret over a dwindling supply of qualified workers in the 
trades. &quot;People have aimed for what was considered the most 
prestigious positions.  We don't have people for the other 
technologies,&quot; laments Julianne Inverso, student personal 
supervisor at Mercer County Vocational Technical Schools in 
Trenton, New Jersey.  At the Mercer County facility, students can 
be trained in air conditioning and refrigeration, auto body 
repair, business technology, computer operation, electrical 
construction, graphic arts, plumbing and heating, general 
building construction, and visual communicationsjust to name 
a few.  The student pool is diverse, from local teens learning 
a trade while attending  high school, to displaced members 
of the modern workplace.
<P>If holding a steady job and achieving a certain salary 
level are the measures, then Mercer's graduates may outdo 
those bound for college.  In 1995, Mercer County's facility 
graduated all of its 132 students. Only eight of 125 who 
later responded to a follow-up survey were unemployed, while 
86 had gone on to full- or part-time employment (some 
part-timers were attending college).
<P>While the historic reason for attending a university 
&quot;to learn to think&quot; has been supplanted by a utilitarian 
one, &quot;getting a job,&quot; growing numbers of today's students 
aren't even achieving that.
<P>The result is twofold.  First, the quality of education is 
 diminishing today: an Association for American 
Colleges survey reported that 78 percent of modern college 
graduates never take a Western history course; 77 percent avoid 
studying a foreign language; and 45 percent end-run even 
basic literature courses.  Second, less-learned college 
graduates leave school with their Holy Grail degree, only to find 
their cup empty as they are unable to find decent work.
<P>&quot;There is clearly a supply and demand problem for 
many manufacturers,&quot; says Michael Cantwell, national director 
of manufacturing at a management consulting firm, Grant Thorton, in a 
<I>Wall Street Journal </I>interview.
<P>The <I>Journal </I>article cites several examples of the paradox 
 in the American workforce: Lincoln Electric Company 
in Euclid, Ohio, currently has about 200 openings, with 
hourly pay ranging from $8.39 to $20.  While some openings are 
at the lowest rung of the plant, the company also needs 
tool-and-die makers, mold makers and machinists.
<P>But few of the thousands who apply for jobs at Lincoln 
can do high-school trigonometry or read technical drawings, 
and most don't show an aptitude for learning how to 
operate computer-controlled machines--skills that Lincoln says 
even entry-level workers need.
<P>Employees with certain skills are hot commodities.  
&quot;A journeyman welder is like a free agent in baseball,&quot; says 
Walt Elish, executive director of the Economic Development 
Corporation of Waukesha County, Wisconsin.  &quot;We can't 
find welders, we can't find tool-and-die makers, we can't 
find [computer-controlled] machine operators.&quot; He says 
such workers can earn from $35,000 to $50,000 a year, and it 
isn't uncommon for a good toolmaker to pull down $60,000 
with overtime.
<P>But to command those wages, today's factory 
workers need to use advanced math, have good communication 
skills and understand the use of computers.  Most 
high-school students with those abilities are college-bound.
<P>&quot;It is very frustrating,&quot; says Bruce Cable, Lincoln's 
employment manager, whose eight-person staff has 
screened thousands of candidates.  &quot;These days even if 
high-school students have C-minus grades, they can go to college.  
So, instead of getting the B student to handle a manual lathe, 
we are now getting the D student.&quot;
<P>Conservative columnist Don Feder has noted the 
same trend: &quot;Memo to incoming college freshmen: Most of you 
are wasting your parents' money, society's resources, and 
your own time.  The typical collegian would be better off at a 
trade school or in a job training program. . . .&quot;
<P>Feder quotes author William Henry III's 1994 book, 
<I>In Defense of Elitism</I>: &quot;For many adolescents . . . college 
is simply a holding pattern until they can get on with their 
lives. It is understandable that they should want to extend 
their youth and ponder their identities (or navels) for a bit; what 
is rather less clear is why they should do so at public as well 
as parental expense.&quot;
<P>Adds Feder: &quot;For most students, it's a cruel hoax; 
for families, an onerous burden to buy their progeny a 
paper credential.  For society, degree-worship is a huge and 
growing drain on the economy.
<P>&quot;And so, dear freshmen, heed those ads offering training 
in the operation of commercial vehicles or the art of dying 
hair and giving perms.  Compared to what you'll be doing for 
the next four years, this would be time well spent.&quot;

<CENTER><h2>New CRC Book Frees Seniors <br>Held Captive
by the Age Lobby</h2></CENTER>
<P>
 WASHINGTON -- Older Americans who join seniors advocacy groups
like the AARP are often attracted by insurance deals, credit card
offers and colorful publications.  But a new <B>Capital Research
Center</B> book entitled <U>Frightening America's Elderly:  How
the Age Lobby Holds Seniors Captive</U> shows seniors they are
really imprisoned by a rich and powerful lobby that promotes wasteful
government programs while taking tax dollars for itself.<BR>
<P>
 &quot;Establishment seniors groups have become as harmful and
counterproductive as the welfare state itself.  They have a vested
financial stake in maintaining the status quo, even if it leads
to the bankruptcy of programs that seniors depend on,&quot; writes
author and Loyola College of Maryland economist Thomas J. DiLorenzo.
 <BR>
<P>
 The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) and dozens
of lesser-known organizations that make up the age lobby have
become expert at exploiting the fears and needs of the elderly
to build their own power.  This power comes courtesy of taxpayers.
 In 1993, the federal government gave AARP $86 million to show
seniors how to find jobs and do their taxes.  Yet a year later,
AARP itself had to pay the IRS $135 million in taxes and penalties
for a decade of business activities the government deemed unrelated
to its nonprofit mission.  AARP's 1994 earnings on the sale of
insurance, pharmaceuticals and auto-club services totaled $191
million.<BR>
<P>
 &quot;The reader will come away from this text knowing far more
than even most AARP members do about the nature of that organization,&quot;
writes preface author<B> Sen. Alan K. Simpson</B> (R-WY).  Simpson,
chairman of the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Social Security
and Family Policy, held hearings investigating the AARP's business
and lobbying practices.  &quot;As the possessor of a sizable stack
of chaotic, random and disorganized material about the AARP, I
commend Tom DiLorenzo and the Capital Research Center for condensing
this serpentine tale into a direct and comprehensible tract.&quot;
<BR>
<P>
 Recently, AARP and friends raised their taxpayer-funded voices
loud enough to drown out reports of the impending bankruptcy of
Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.  Trustees of these three
federal trust funds, on which most elderly rely, report that America's
aging population will empty the coffers faster than the smaller,
working-age population can re-fill them.  But the seniors lobby
falsely labeled efforts to save the system by slowing growth as
an attempt to &quot;cut&quot; benefits.<BR>
<P>
 &quot;These special interest lobbyists whose paychecks are tied
to failed welfare-state programs are stalling innovative reforms.
 <U>Frightening America's Elderly</U>  alerts members of these
groups that their support is contributing to the decline of the
American way of life,&quot; said Capital Research Center President
Terrence Scanlon.<BR>
<P>
 <U>Frightening America's Elderly:  How the Age Lobby Holds Seniors
Captive</U> explores the activities of the coalition of seniors
advocates that DiLorenzo calls the &quot;dependency lobby&quot;:
 AARP's unfair business practices; the National Council of Senior
Citizens' labor union ties; the Gray Panthers' socialist agenda;
and others.  It also heralds the more recent formation of a new
generation of seniors groups that emphasize voluntarism, consumer
choice and fiscal responsibility.
<P>
 
<P>
 To order <U>Frightening America's Elderly:  How the Age Lobby
Holds Seniors Captive</U>, send a check or money order for $15

<CENTER><h2>New Monthly <I>Culture Watch</I></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>Is &quot;True Alternative Arts and Culture
Coverage&quot;</h2><BR></CENTER>
<P>
 WASHINGTON -- Capital Research Center in June begins publishing
<I>Culture Watch</I>, a new monthly newsletter which Editor
Laurence Jarvik calls &quot;true alternative arts and culture
coverage, highlighting those who have been sidelined by the shock
artists who have demoralized the intellectual community.&quot;
 <BR>
<P>
 &quot;We intend to raise the profile of those who defy the tide
of political correctness and stand up for the traditional values
of society,&quot; said Laurence Jarvik, Ph.D., Capital Research
Center cultural studies fellow and <I>Culture Watch</I> editor.
<BR>
<P>
 Every month, <I>Culture Watch</I><B> </B>will spotlight trends,
ideas and personalities that enrich the arts and cultural life.
 The June issue profiles Frederick Stocken, &quot;Britain's most
backward-looking composer.&quot;  Stocken is a musician dedicated
to classical musical ideals, despite the opposition of an avant-garde
power structure supported by public funds.<BR>
<P>
 &quot;The official guardians of the English music establishment
obviously were out of touch with their audience when they rejected
Stocken for his adherence to traditional standards -- a composer
who ultimately created a best-selling recording widely embraced
because of its harmonious melody,&quot; Jarvik said.<BR>
<P>
 Subsequent issues of <I>Culture Watch</I> will feature Maureen
Dowd, feisty <I>New York Times</I> columnist;  Professor Alan
Sokal, the NYU professor who discredited the field of cultural
studies by publishing an article challenging the law of gravity;
Mrs. Eugene Casey, who single-handedly donated $18 million to
give the Washington Opera a new home; and Will Fitzhugh, editor
of <I>The Concord Review</I>, a journal written by high school
students devoted to non-PC interpretations of American history.
 Trend stories will include an analysis of how Republicans are
portrayed in pop culture; and a look at the aftermath of Senator
Bob Dole's attack on Hollywood.<BR>
<P>
 &quot;America's moral standards have strayed so far from decency
that the artists who believe in the positive aesthetic value of
their work have been outcast by their colleagues.  <I>Culture
Watch</I> is a forum for these creators,&quot; said Capital Research
Center President Terrence Scanlon.<BR>
<P>
 <I>Culture Watch</I> will be Capital Research Center's fifth
monthly newsletter. It complements the institutional focus of<I>
Foundation Watch</I>, a newsletter that monitors the activities
of private foundations and analyzes their impact on American society.
 CRC launched <I>Foundation Watch</I>, also edited by Jarvik,
in February.<BR>
<P>
 CRC's other existing newsletters are <I>Organization Trends</I>,
which monitors advocacy organizations; <I>Alternatives in Philanthropy</I>,
which provides fresh perspectives on current trends and issues
in philanthropy; and <I>Philanthropy, Culture and Society</I>,
which examines the impact of philanthropy on American cultural
institutions and traditions.

<FONT SIZE=5>Inside the Council on Foundations &quot;Fishbowl&quot;:
How Foundation Executives Wash Each Other's Brains</FONT>
<P>
by Laurence Jarvik<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The foundation world is deeply into self-examination.
 A num ber of recent events _ President Clinton's signing of the
welfare reform bill, passage of the California Civil Rights Initiative,
the bitter legislative struggle over the Istook amendment to limit
federally-subsidized lobbying, and Republican retention of both
houses of Congress _ have led top foundation leaders across the
country to return to the query first posed by Admiral Stockdale:
&quot;Who am I?  Why am I here?&quot;  Since the May 1996 annual
gathering in Atlanta of the Council on Foundations [see <I>Foundation
Watch </I>vol. 1, no. 5 &quot;The Council on Foundations Message
to America: The Era of Lady Bountiful is Over'] foundation staff
and executives have been meeting, and meeting, and meeting.  They
have gathered together in affinity groups and planning sessions,
attended workshops and made on-site visits, and endlessly reconfigured
conference table and chair arrangements to facilitate dialogue,
optimize understanding, and in general decide what to do next.
 </FONT>
<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>To see how foundation grantmakers wrestle with challenges
they face<I> Foundation Watch </I></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>attended an unprecedented &quot;National Symposium
on Foundations and the Public Sector&quot; held in the Dupont
Circle Hotel in Washington, D.C. on November 14 and 15.  We were
also at an October session of the Communications Network in Philanthropy
in Detroit.  Not-for-profit self-scrutiny is further on display
in the latest publications from the foundation world.  See, for
example, Gerald Freund's new book <I>Narcissism and Philanthropy
</I>which chastises foundations for their insularity and urges
them to recognize and support talent [see review by Robert Huberty
on page 7]. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> In the methods they are adopting to confront what
they see as a threat to their legitimacy, the foundation aristocracy
is repeating the mistakes of group-think which helped create the
initial pattern of problems they confront and that have generated
so much anxiety.  Indeed, their choice of guru, former Federal
Trade Commission Chairman Michael Pertschuk, insures the continuation
of what Heather MacDonald characterized as a pattern of &quot;Destructive
Philanthropy&quot; in a recent <I>Wall Street Journal </I>article.
 Pertschuk, who now heads a Washington organization called the
&quot;Advocacy Institute,&quot; encourages nonprofit support for
liberal political advocacy _ precisely the type of activity drawing
the attention and ire of the Republican majority in Congress.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT></I>
<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=2>THE GODFATHER  OF ADVOCACY<BR>
</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Michael Pertschuk is not as well known as Ralph Nader
and he has less public visibility than Common Cause founder John
Gardner or Fred Wertheimer, the group's campaign finance lobbyist.
 But wherever an observer inquires into foundation and nonprofit
advocacy of government social welfare programs Pertschuk's imprint
is today visible.  More than any of the others, Pertschuk _ who
earns a $71,000 annual salary from the Advocacy Institute _ represents
the view that the purpose of philanthropy is to use private dollars
to leverage tax revenues for left-of-center causes. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Pertschuk has been called &quot;the Grover Norquist
of the Left&quot; by those familiar with his activities.  He helped
draft the strategy which defeated Robert Bork's nomination to
the Supreme Court, and he has been a consultant to the American
Cancer Society in its fight against the tobacco industry _ work
he began over thirty years ago as the coordinator of the Surgeon
General's first conference on Smoking and Health. More recently,

Foundation deal with dissent? Squash  it!&quot;].<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> A  prep school graduate who attended both Yale University
_ as an English major, Pertschuk studied with <I>All the King's
Men</I> novelist Robert Penn Warren _ and Yale Law School.  Coming
to Washington in the Kennedy administration, Pertschuk served
for about a decade as chief of staff to Senator Warren Magnuson
(D-WA), chairman of the powerful Senate Commerce Committee.  Magnuson
was in his dotage near the end, and Pertschuk's power and influence
over legislation before the Committee grew so great that he gained
the reputation of being &quot;the 101st Senator&quot; and enjoyed
the social clout that accompanies power in Washington.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Pertschuk currently lives in the fashionable Northwest
section of the city and his children attended the Georgetown Day
School, an expensive academically prominent private school in
the Capital, alongside spawn of the Graham family, owners of <I>The
Washington Post</I>.  Pertschuk was named chairman of the Federal
Trade Commission in the Carter Administration.  In his ironically-titled
memoir <I>Giant Killers</I> (Norton, 1986), he boasts of enjoying
lunch at the pricey Four Seasons restaurant on the expense account
of a founding member of Washington's exclusive Congressional Country
Club.  His plutocratic habits extend to a taste for fine cigars,
which he smokes discreetly, inasmuch as he is professionally committed
to the anti-tobacco lobby's attempt to ban smoking in public.
 Pertschuk told <I>Foundation Watch </I>that he now only smokes
on hikes far from civilization and &quot;at my daughter's wedding.&quot;
 (James Miller, the FTC chairman during the Reagan administration
and Pertschuk's successor, recalls, &quot;When in fact he smoked
cigars, he made a point of not smoking in public, or when the
TV cameras were around.  But he smoked cigars.  I smoke cigars,
too.&quot;)  As a consultant to the American Cancer Society, Pertschuk
co-ordinates global anti-smoking programs.  Invited to acknowledge
this small personal weakness, Pertschuk retorts that his opposition
is to large corporations that profit from harmful products, not
to smoking<I> per se</I>.  By such ideological logic are Cuban
cigars preferable to Marlboro cigarettes.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> When he was chairman of the Federal Trade Commission
Pertschuk tried to ban television advertising to children, a move
that earned him the sobriquet &quot;the national nanny&quot; in
a critical <I>Washington Post </I>editorial. Pertschuk dismisses
the <I>Post</I>'s criticism, claiming that the paper's opposition
was motivated not by its editorial  commitment to free speech
but by the corporate self-interest of its parent company, the
owner of television stations.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> This instinctual opposition to corporations is inherent
in Pertschuk's mind-set.  He searches for the vicious corporate
self-interest in every private sector act while attributing a
noble public interest to every nonprofit sector act.  Indeed,
this is the assumption that underlies Pertschuk's Advocacy Institute.
 Co-chaired by veteran Common Cause lobbyists David Cohen and
Kathleen D. Sheeky _ and supported by the Ford Foundation, the
Joyce Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation, the Nathan Cummings
Foundation, the Kaiser Family Foundation, the New York Community
Trust, the Tides Foundation, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation
and the Florence and John Schumann Foundation (headed by Bill
Moyers's son, John) _ the Advocacy Institute spends some $2 million
annually running workshops, training sessions, and networking
activities for foundations and &quot;community&quot; organizations.
 Its mission statement declares its political objective, &quot;strengthening
the capacity of social and economic justice advocates to influence
and change public policy.&quot;  Despite decades of misguided
social spending, Pertschuk remains blind to the failures of federal
government programs and foundation support for nonprofits who
promote it.  When asked about the Great Society's ignominious
War On Poverty, he only responds that its initiatives &quot;were
not fully funded.&quot;  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> One might go so far as to say that the Advocacy
Institute's sources of funding suggest a self-interested reason
why Pertschuk won't publicly criticize his patrons and the failure
of their initiatives, to use his own method of analysis.  Pertschuk
knows how the bread of advocacy is buttered.  The Institute's
1995 annual report states &quot;the largest grants to the Institute
come from private foundations.&quot;  If the priority of foundation
giving were direct provision of services rather than advocacy,
the first casualty would be the Advocacy Institute.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Pertschuk's uncritical attitude toward the mandarins
of philanthropy was manifested at the three-day meeting of the
Communications Network in Philanthropy in Detroit on October 9-11.
 He was there to inform public relations staffers from the foundation
sector about the &quot;threats&quot; to their activities and to
recommend how they could be overcome.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> By words the mind is excited and  the spirit elated,&quot;
read the quote from Aristophanes gracing the cover of the program
packet for the 1996 Communications Network in Philanthropy Fall
Conference.  Hosted by the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation of
Flint, Michigan, the conference was held at the Atheneum Hotel
in Detroit's Greektown.  This was the venue for the annual gathering
of public relations officers who belong to the &quot;affinity
group&quot; of the Council on Foundations, and those in attendance
represented the giants of philanthropy. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Among those present were emissaries of the biggest
of the big foundations: America's largest, the $7.5 billion Ford
Foundation, was represented by vice-president Robert Curvin. 
Karen E. Lake, director of communications, carried the flag for
the $6 billion W.K. Kellogg Foundation.  Victoria D. Weisfeld
was there; she is outgoing president of the Communications Network
in Philanthropy and Senior Communications Officer of the $4 billion
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.  And so was Raymond C. Boyer,
director of communications for the $3 billion John D. and Catherine
T. MacArthur Foundation.  <I> </I></FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The meeting participants found themselves in a focus
group led by Richard Harwood, whose private consulting company
has been a major beneficiary of so-called &quot;public journalism
grants from the Pew and Kettering foundation. In another event
they heard  from Hedrick Smith, the former <I>New York Times </I>Moscow
correspondent -- who was pinch-hitting for <I>U.S. News and World
Report </I>editor James Fallows, a last minute cancellation. Smith's
anti-Republican PBS election special &quot;The People and  the
Power Game&quot; had received significant support from the funders
represented in Detroit (the event hosts, the Charles Stewart Mott
Foundation, had given his show a quarter of a million dollars).
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  <I>Foundation Watch</I> was there as well, as an
invited speaker at a closing-day panel called &quot;Foundations
Under Scrutiny.&quot;  This panel allowed the foundation communication
chiefs to hear themselves attacked from Left and Right.  The other
speakers on the panel included the Hudson Institute's Michael
Horowitz, who, as a Reagan Administration official at the Office
of Management and Budget, tried some fifteen years ago to end
federal funding of advocacy groups, and Robert Bothwell, director
of the liberal National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy.
 The conservative criticisms were strong, with Horowitz accusing
foundation officers of being &quot;little better than thieves&quot;
who worsened the plight of the poor by diverting resources from
the needy to themselves.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  The <I>Foundation Watch</I> presentation, subdued
by comparison, asked those assembled to consider the advantages
of a more even-handed approach to funding controversial public
issues.  Bothwell, who had recently received a $30,000 foundation
grant to study conservative foundation activity, singled out the
Pew Charitable Trusts for special criticism, arguing that they
so micromanaged their grant projects that independent thought
became almost impossible.   <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> It is doubtful, however, whether any of these criticisms
were taken to heart.  <I>Foundation Watch</I> was privileged to
observe two days of networking, seminars, and fellowship.  Perhaps
as befits a convention of public relations spinmeisters, the purpose
of their meetings was not to change foundation behavior but to
change the perception of foundation behavior.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> There was one critical session at which we were
not present.  However, materials concerning the session are available,
and they offer perhaps the most significant evidence of the failure
of the foundation sector to understand that more is at stake than
public relations imagery and perceptions.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>On the first day of the Detroit conference, Wednesday,
October 9, the Communications Network in Philanthropy held its
business meeting and election of officers.  This was followed
by a motor coach excursion to the Detroit Zoological Institute
where the participants enjoyed a cash bar social hour, followed
by dinner and a keynote address by Michael Pertschuk.  A printed
outline of his talk, &quot;A Wake-Up Call: It's Your Turn,&quot;
discloses that he discussed neither tobacco nor children's advertising.
 <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Foundation Watch </FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>was not
present for the give-and-take.  But the outline, which is entitled
<I>A Menu of Possible Responses to Meeting the Growing Challenges
to Foundation Legitimacy</I>, invites foundations to confront
their critics aggressively with a battery of opposition research
and public relations initiatives.  Nowhere in the document does
Pertschuk suggest that the giants of philanthropy take criticism
seriously and reform their giving.  Instead, his analysis reassures
foundations that it is the critics who are to blame.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Section one, bearing the title &quot;'Opposition'
Research: define the problem,&quot; defines the problem in a curiously
self-serving way.  It identifies foundations as victims.  Point
&quot;a&quot;: <I> &quot;Keep track: who is thinking about doing
what to foundations, and when?  Organize an on-line, private information
exchange among foundation communications officers.&quot; </I>underscores
a defensiveness toward public discussion that one would not expect
of foundations that want to improve communications.  Rather than
call for increased openness, public scrutiny and accountability,
the promise made by Dorothy Ridings, the new Council on Foundations
president, Pertschuk's first recommendation is for a proprietary
exchange of privileged information.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Pertschuk's point &quot;b&quot; reframes an important
debate over policy into a strategy to capture political rhetoric:
<I> &quot;Do or fund research on 'defunding the left' initiatives
and rhetoric to identify percursory moves for future attacks on
foundation.  Analyze the rhetoric of the Christian Right, the
populist right, Istook, Simpson, et. al.; George Mason University,
the Cato Institute, the Heritage Foundation.&quot; </I> Rather
than answer conservative critics seriously on the merits of their
claims, Pertschuck  instead advocates &quot;deconstructing&quot;
their arguments. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Point &quot;c&quot; reiterates the strategy of out-talking
your critics:  <I>&quot;Develop likely scenarios for future attacks
on foundations, including rhetorical devices that demonize foundations.&quot;
 <BR>
</I></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Finally, point &quot;d&quot; formalizes public relations
&quot;spin&quot;:<I>  &quot;Commission polls and focus groups
designed to elicit knowledge, feelings and responsive chords so
as to gauge the success of attacks on foundations and to provide
guidance for affirmative responses.&quot;</I>  With the right
focus groups, nothing needs to change. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Building on the questionable premises of these appetizers,
the Pertschuk menu's second course is &quot;Strategic Planning:
define the goals.&quot;  The goal is to defend against change.
 Point &quot;a&quot; calls upon foundations to<I> &quot;build
broad public recognition and support, through public education,
for the role of foundations in society_free of government controls?&quot;</I>
 Of course, foundations are creatures of government control, specifically
the I.R.S. and the states that charter foundation activities.
 Service to the public interest is what asset-rich foundations
are supposed to provide in exchange for their tax-exemption .
 It is odd that Pertschuk, who would increase government control
over other parts of society, downplays the legal restrictions
currently placed on foundations. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Point &quot;b&quot;: attacks what to this observer
is the reality of the Foundation sector and again urges new strategies
focused on changing perceptions:<I>  &quot;To zero in on changing
public perceptions of national foundations as elitist, unaccountable,
wasteful, illegitimate, too left, too liberal, too big.&quot;
<BR>
</I></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Pertschuk's point &quot;c&quot; flatters his patrons:<I>
&quot;To build support for foundations as an integral part of
the 'independent sector' and, specifically, as public policy watchdogs
identifying private sector failures and government corruption,
inefficiency, overreaching? (The foundation as the latter day
equivalent of the old testament prophets?).&quot;  </I>When a
corporation hires a management consultant, it looks for internal
problems before it blames external conditions.  But Pertschuk's
menu of responses reverses the order.  Public criticism of foundations
is occurring not because the public fails to see the good that
foundations do, but because it disapproves of what it sees. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The menu's third section, &quot;Smorgasboard of
possible initiatives,&quot; repeats the effort to manage criticism
of the grantmaking activities of foundations with public relations
stunts. One point, however might especially interest readers of
this publication:<I>  &quot;Support an independent, investigative
'Foundation Watch' Watch.&quot;</I>  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> This particular invitation to dig up dirt on foundation
critics -- specifically this periodical -- highlights the cowardice
and disingenuousness of the foundation sector in the face of criticism.
Rather than engage in civil debate over contested issues based
on facts, figures, and the historical record,  the advocates of
&quot;advocacy&quot;  prefer to sling mud at those raising questions.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  This editor told Pertschuk in an interview that
he could find out all he needs to know about <I>Foundation Watch</I>
by purchasing a subscription and reading the publication.  But
clandestine activity is a constant temptation for those with vested
interests in maintaining the <I>status quo</I>.  When invited
to contribute an article to Capital Research Center on his vision
for philanthropy, Pertschuk replied, &quot;I don't have a particular
vision for philanthropy.&quot;  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Instead, Pertschuk suggests public relations ploys:
 editorial board visits, the production of videos, sponsoring
PBS and NPR programs, funding public relations campaigns through
Independent Sector, and &quot;strategic communications training&quot;
_ not coincidentally a specialty of the Advocacy Institute _ for
foundation leaders, staff, selected grantees, and &quot;'esteemed'
non-foundation leaders as spokespersons.&quot;  All are methods
which are designed to make concrete criticisms of foundations
go away, rather than receive the attention they deserve.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=2>THE FISHBOWL'S INNER CIRCLE<BR>
</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> One needed only to wait one month to see Michael
Pertschuk's recommendations turned into action items.  The National
Symposium on Foundations and the Public Sector held in Washington
on November 14 and 15 bore all the hallmarks of the Pertschuk
influence.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Participants at the first day's session of the Symposium
seemed to be reading from Pertschuk's script. All the &quot;esteemed&quot;
foundation and non-foundation leaders were gathered together by
the Council on Foundations and by a number of non-profit groups.
 There were dozens of participants at the opening ceremonies.
 But a curious segregation occurred shortly afterwards.  On the
morning of the first day, participants were arranged into an &quot;inner
circle&quot; and an outer circle in what conference organizers
called &quot;the fishbowl.&quot;  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The fishbowl was the central feature in a two-day
exercise in consensus formation that might remind filmgoers of
a scene in &quot;The Manchurian Candidate.&quot;  It was fascinating
to an outside observer.  For in their rush to confront their critics,
the foundations justified the critics' strongest claims.  The
foundations were engaging in a public demonstration of &quot;group-think&quot;
as shallow and embarrassing as it was doomed to failure.  And
the failures of the group dynamics on display in the fishbowl
reflected the failures of a philanthropy enamoured of faddish
trends in media relations and public opinion formation that were
on display in Detroit and Washington.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> In the &quot;fishbowl&quot; were gathered the &quot;inner
circle&quot; _ one might call them the usual suspects _ who represented
the central committee of the liberal philanthropic establishment.
 <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Notably absent were representatives of any conservative
foundation or organization, although at least two representatives
of the Philanthropy Roundtable -- Whitney Ball and John Walters
-- were in the room.  The conservatives later were permitted to
lead small group sessions.  But the main event was reserved for
liberals.  All others were were relegated to the &quot;outer circle.&quot;
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Moderator Judy K. Chynoweth, executive director
of the Foundation Consortium for School-Linked Services, announced
that she would &quot;play Oprah.&quot;  Her language was thick
with the phrases familiar to foundation types _ she once actually
did say, &quot;Thank you for sharing.&quot;  Chynoweth would call
on individuals from the &quot;outer circle&quot; to sit briefly
in an &quot;inner circle&quot; guest chair to ask a  question
_ a procedure used to insure that the &quot;inner circle&quot;
remained secure.  Not only was she insensible to the elitism of
the enterprise, but in technocratic phrases she charged the participants
 to recognize that the session was &quot;a production meeting,&quot;
and that the participants should see themselves as &quot;assembly
line workers&quot; who were manufacturing a &quot;learning tool&quot;
in a &quot;carefully crafted process&quot; involving the &quot;construction
of small groups.&quot;  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Occupants of the inner circle dutifully nodded,
then launched into tense and peculiar disquisitions on the dangers
foundations faced from a Republican Congress.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The first speaker, Joel Orosz, read aloud from a
1952 <I>American Legion Magazine</I> article describing foundations
as composed of &quot;outright communists...fellow travellers...</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>one worlders&quot; and what he called &quot; my personal
favorite: well-meaning dupes.&quot; <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  That comment was greeted by condescending laughter
as Orosz outlined the failure of Congress' 1954 Reece Committee
investigations as well as the 1969 Wright Patman investigations,
which he characterized as &quot;relatively benign&quot; compared
to today's criticisms. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Waving Heather MacDonald's <I>Wall Street Journal</I>
article in the air, Orosz declared that the present situation
was &quot;more dangerous&quot; than ever, and that foundations
faced a political climate unseen since the days of Andrew Jackson.
 Jacksonian democracy, he said, regarded foundations as closed
corporations, and the danger was that foundation opponents like
those of the nineteenth century Anti-Masonic party were mobilizing
against the assembled foundations and eyeing their tax exemptions.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Peter Edelman, whose judicial nomination was left
twisting in the wind by the Clinton Administration, praised conservative
foundations.  He announced that he was &quot;grateful for Scaife,
Mellon, Olin, and Bradley, the people on the conservative side
who are unabashed in their willingness to spend money on advocacy
and public policy.&quot;  The problem, he said, was that the liberal
side was letting conservative efforts go &quot;unanswered.&quot;
 To correct this &quot;imbalance&quot; was the task before philanthropy.
 Ironically, conservative foundations would assist this task because,
he said, they would be able &quot;to resist changes and to protect
the ability to advocate.&quot;  Whether Edelman was pursuing some
private joke or on to something new was unclear to this reporter.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Only Robert Wood Johnson Foundation vice-president
Paul Jellinek  said something of genuine insight during the seemingly
endless round-robin, perhaps because of  his organization's participation
in the Clinton administration's ill-fated health care plan.  He
observed that the nonprofit sector got &quot;so wrapped up in
fighting Istook that we missed the big policy debate&quot; over
welfare.  Jellinek suggested that next time foundations &quot;keep
at least one eye open&quot; for issues other than their own institutional
self-interest. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The fishbowl session ended.  Much like the family
goldfish, life eventually drained out of the panelists who tired
of the discussion.  They moved on to small group discussions which
were intended to raise &quot;questions&quot; for the larger group.
 (Social science research has determined that small groups are
most conducive to reinforcing shared opinions, which is called
&quot;consensus formation.&quot;) <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The activities of the small groups were obviously
a pretext for political networking, as was apparent when the &quot;questions&quot;
were posted on the wall in the hotel ballroom.  Written in magic
marker on giant sheets of paper held up by masking tape, each
repeated the banalities of &quot;community&quot; and &quot;public
interest,&quot; &quot;accountability&quot; and &quot;the role
of the press.&quot; <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> What was the meeting really about?  (&quot;Who am
I?  Why am I here?&quot;)  Sara Melendez, president of Independent
Sector, offered some hint in remarks at the first and final public
discussions of the conference.  She warned the assembled group
that Independent Sector would be investigated in the next session
of Congress by Rep. Nancy Johnson's (R-CT) House oversight committee
as &quot;payback&quot; for its advocacy efforts to defeat the
Istook amendment.  Melendez asked for their support in the coming
months. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> After cutting through all the New Age psychobabble,
here was what the National Symposium was about: creating a network
to defend Independent Sector and derail congressional oversight.
 Rally the troops, issue marching orders, and, no doubt, follow
up with memoranda and private communications which will not be
provided to <I>Foundation Watch</I>.</FONT>

<I><B>Narcissism and Philanthropy</B></I></FONT></B>
<P>
by Robert Huberty<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>DEFENDING THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Gerald Freund, <I>Narcissism and Philanthropy: Ideas
and Talent Denied</I> (Viking, 1996) 158 pages. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Modern liberals deny that one can know the true
and good.  But this ignorance does not stop them from wanting
to win, nor does it interfere with their desire to reward the
success of those who share their convictions, or lack thereof.
 Washington abounds with such people, who seek to dazzle through
brilliance.  The best and the brightest, as they once were called,
believe they deserve rewards and honors, and it is the thesis
of this book that they are not getting what they deserve.  Gerald
Freund, an administrator and official active in foundation affairs
for over forty years, is the former director of the John D. and
Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation &quot;genius&quot; awards program.
 In <I>Narcissism and Philanthropy</I> he mourns the failure of
other foundations to appreciate the importance of grace and favors
for golden boys.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Writing for foundation insiders, Freund argues that
foundation grants are used most productively when they support
&quot;exceptional&quot; individuals of &quot;extraordinary&quot;
promise.  Increasingly, however, foundations are caught between
the forces of left and right.  Multiculturalists pounce on grants
for individual excellence to find evidence of racism and elitism,
while conservative populists abhor cutting-edge creativity.  Freund
worries that foundation officers are turning inward: they have
become sensitive to appearances and have grown self-assertive
and self-regarding (hence the book's peculiar title).  Freund
contends that the networks of talent scouts to which foundations
once turned for advice are deteriorating.  Foundation program
officers don't consult with outside experts as they once did.
 They don't seek out bright minds to explore ideas and create
programs to reward risk-takers.  Instead, they carefully screen
grant applicants through complex criteria and narrowly define
projects to fulfill specific goals.  Self-conscious of their own
professional standing (and defensive about it), foundations impose
limiting conditions on their dispensations.  The arrogance of
the insecure purseholder is making a comeback.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Freund is a former Rockefeller Foundation program
officer who handled grants to individuals and he has fond memories
of the days when program officers dispensed them freely and easily.
 He extols the example of John D. Rockefeller and his family,
who recruited &quot;the best brains they could attract to investigate
competing claims on their philanthropies.&quot;  He contrasts
Rockefeller to the narcissist Andrew Carnegie who trusted only
his own philanthropic judgment.  Freund has no sympathy for &quot;donor
intent,&quot; the notion that donors should insure that their
intentions are precise and fully observed when they establish
foundations.  He argues instead that foundations misuse their
power, not when they violate donors' intentions, but when they
are unresponsive to grant recipients' needs.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> And who are the needy?  Certainly not the recipients
of charity.  Freund is careful to distinguish philanthropy from
charity, and, one suspects, he would make the latter a handmaiden
to the welfare state.  No: philanthropy's task is to identify
the &quot;imaginative minority&quot; and &quot;superior talents&quot;
who are &quot;our most important resource.&quot; <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Trapped in a New Frontier time-warp, Freund says
foundations once honored that obligation to find and help the
very best.  He commends the Rockefeller Foundation:  During the
dark days of the 1950s Dean Rusk, its president and a future Secretary
of State, supported the recruitment of talent to specialize in
international legal theory, which international legal theorists
warned was in short supply.  Then there was the Ford Foundation
under president McGeorge Bundy, President Kennedy's former National
Security Council advisor:  In 1968 Ford braved controversy by
giving individual grants to Robert Kennedy's presidential campaign
staff after the Senator was assassinated, thereby providing Peter
Edelman and others with much-needed &quot;turn-around time.&quot;
 And the Carnegie Corporation under president John Gardner (HEW
secretary to LBJ) rescued overworked college presidents of exceptional
talent by funding year-long sabbaticals, enabling them to recharge
their batteries.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Most of <I>Narcissism and Philanthropy </I>consists
of foggy tips on ways that foundations can continue to seek out
&quot;excellence&quot; and shepherd &quot;the creative spirit.&quot;
 Worthwhile grants to individuals are possible, says Freund, when
foundations pick grant selection committees whose members &quot;have
sufficient knowledge to make rigorous judgments, but one wants
them also to be generous and imaginative, open-minded, seasoned
and perspicacious.&quot;  Foundations should employ mature and
knowledgeable program officers who can offer their grantees &quot;nurturing
support and an ongoing relationship.&quot;  Foundation professionals
should be tactful, too:  &quot;Helpful when called upon but not
intrusive or prying; they do not make grantees feel they need
to express inordinate or inappropriate gratitude.&quot;   <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> In a book notably lacking in clarity or humor, the
ten pages Freund devotes to the origins of the MacArthur Foundation
&quot;genius&quot; awards provides some relief.  In spring 1979
the Foundation hired Freund, then a Hunter College dean, to assemble
assorted luminaries to brainstorm the purpose of the awards and
consider how to pick their winners.  The deliberations recounted
here reveal how silly bright people can be.  Jonas Salk &quot;urged
MacArthur to create a program that would enable people to train
in a discipline other than one they were in and also to create
an ambience that would encourage people to change fields.&quot;
 Unnamed others worried that interviews and written applications
might give articulate candidates an unfair advantage.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Freund says nothing about the MacArthur awards'
notorious reliance on race, gender and ethnicity, and he is silent
about when and why he left MacArthur's employ as the awards' program
director.  But from other remarks it is clear that he is dismayed
by foundations' use of multicultural criteria and worried that
conservatives will attack them for it.  In an aside, he consoles
himself that a conservative Congress may hesitate to encroach
on foundation autonomy because it will not want to interfere with
the bold work of conservative foundations like Bradley and Olin.
 They, apparently, are the final defense of Camelot.<BR>

<center><h2>Michael Lind's Ad Hominem Attack On Conservative Foundations</h2></center>
<blockquote>
<center><h4>by Robert Huberty</h4></center>
<P>
<I>Up From Conservatism: Why the Right Is Wrong for America <I>
by Michael Lind (The Free Press, 1996, 295 pages, $23).
<p><br>
Michael Lind's hate letter to the conservative movement is a peculiar
production. It's a complex and sour brew of personal memoir and social
history, public policy analysis and political punditry. The author
deliberately aims to devalue
every intellectual and moral claim of Reagan-Gingrich conservatism.^M
 He is intent on revealing as counterfeit an inside-the-Beltway^M
Washington conservative establishment and the grantmaking foundations^M
that fund it.  Part expose and part bitter reflection, Lind proclaims^M
himself a one-time insider who has seen the belly of the beast.
<P>
Its title echoing William F. Buckley,^M
Jr.'s <I>Up From Liberalism</I>, Lind's book unfolds as an autobiographical^M
complaint.  As a young friend of Buckley's, Lind yearned to imitate^M
his mentor's feat of expelling someone from the conservative movement.^M
 But while Buckley won applause for criticizing Ayn Rand and the^M
John Birch Society, conservatives seemed not to care about Lind's^M
whistleblowing essays on what Pat Robertson believed about the^M
history of central banking, the Rothschilds and Karl Marx.  Conservatism^M
endent^Mement of combative writers and scholars had given way^M
to conservatism as a political movement, and theoretical and theological^M
differences among allies were downplayed for the sake of immediate^M
common ends in public policy.  The young writer was appalled.
<P>
Lind asserts that grantmaking foundations^M
have played the key role in orchestrating this development in^M
conservative opinion.  Through the power of the purse, he credits^M
them with an extraordinary capacity to advance careers, inhibit^M
dissent and shape public policies.  Like other conspiracy theorists^M
on the left and right, Lind sees interlocking directorates of^M
power in which orders are issued, tasks assigned, and projects^M
coordinated among favored writers and think-tanks.  [See the September^M
1996 issue of the radical <I>Z Magazine</I> which makes Capital^M
Research Center the center of a &quot;Meese/Simon axis.&quot;]^M
 Lind claims that conservative magazines and think-tanks are dep
on five conservative foundations: the John M. Olin Foundation,^M
Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, J. Howard Pew Freedom Trust/Pew^M
Charitable Trusts, Smith-Richardson Foundation, and Sarah Scaife^M
Foundation.  But Pew has not been on anyone's list of conservative^M
funders in recent years while the others pursue more diverse and^M
fluctuating interests than he admits.
<P>
Lind construes the small number of^M
conservative grantmakers as evidence of a powerful conspiracy:^M
plutocratic pseudo-populists at work.  Of course, it's really^M
evidence of conservatism's weakness in the field of institutional^M
grantmaking and among foundation professionals.  Conservatives^M
are fortunate to have developed support from individual and foundation^M
donors.  And because they have lacked academic contacts, major^M
publishing outlets, and access to the national news media and^M
subsidized public broadcasting, conservatives have been entrepreneurial^M
in establishing their own think-tanks, newsletters and magazines,^M
creating direct mail and talk radio to get around the big media,^M
and securing footholds on the op-ed pages of major newspapers^M
through the excellence of their writing.  Lind mistakes initiative^M
for intrigue.  The liberal bias in major corporate giving to nonprofit^M
advocacy groups should be enough to undermine the claim that conservatives^M
are pampered mouthpieces of a corporate elite.
<P>
For someone with his intellectual ambitions,^M
Lind's writing can be incredibly snide and callow.  An advocate^M
of restricting legal immigration and an opponent of NAFTA, Lind^M
labels both Clinton Democrats and conservative Republicans as^M
members of the &quot;overclass.&quot;  He says both allow foreign^M
labor to dispossess white working class Americans and they do^M
it to justify their hired help:  &quot;Here, then, is a simple^M
test of overclass status.  Americans who do not have advanced^M
degrees and cannot afford maids or nannies are middle class; Americans^M
who have advanced degrees and can afford maids or nannies are^M
overclass.  It's as simple as that.&quot;  Lind's own opinions^M
are tinged with a nativist resentment and he insinuates that the^M
conservative movement is somehow alien.  He finds it peculiar^M
that so many conservative intellectuals have been Jews, Catholics^M
or foreign-born, and he disparages the major role &quot;foreigners^M
and immigrants&quot; like Rupert Murdoch play in funding journalists^M
of the right.
<P>
Because he covers so much political^M
and historical ground, <I>Up From Conservatism</I> could have^M
been an interesting book to argue with.  Lind believes conservatism^M
grew strong in the 80s because the culturally radical left destroyed^M
liberalism in the 60s and 70s.  An advocate of what he variously^M
calls &quot;national liberalism&quot; and &quot;neo-paleo-liberalism,&quot;^M
Lind argues that the modern Republican party is radical, not conservative,^M
and that its anti-tax, anti-regulation policies derive from a^M
&quot;Jefferson-Jackson populist liberalism.&quot;   Lind also^M
attacks the obsessive identity politics of the multi-culturalist^M
Left, and he faults New Democrats for promoting free trade and^M
entitlement reform instead of cultivating the FDR/LBJ legacy of^M
labor unions, social insurance and income redistribution, which^M
are the core of his own welfarist politics.  It is a mystery,^M
however, why this former Heritage Foundation fellow  should think^M
conservatives betrayed him by failing to honor these opinions.^M
 That sense of personal betrayal warps everything he has to say^M
about conservatism, and it gives his book its irate and even demented^M
tone.
<P>
Michael Lind is now a staff writer^M
at <I>The New Yorker</I> (edited by the British-born Tina Brown).^M
 HarperCollins (owned by Rupert Murdoch) has just published his^M
first novel, <I>Powertown</I>, a  depiction of greedy, conniving,^M
degraded residents of Washington, D.C.  which helps explain why^M
he might have written <I>Up From Conservatism. </I>The first reviews^M
of the novel should help Lind decide whether his new colleagues^M
in the New York literary world are more fair-minded and generous^M
than the conservatives he thinks let him down.<BR>^M

<title>Hocking the Halo:  Are America's Charities for Sale?</title>

<center><h2>Hocking the Halo:  Are America's Charities for Sale?</h2></center>
<blockquote>
<center><h4>by Thomas DiLorenzo<BR>
(As seen in The Washington Times on August 17, 1996)
</h4></center>
<P>
<DD>	Small business is raising hell as it discovers that some of America's largest nonprofit charities unfairly earn millions of dollars by "hocking their halos."<BR>
<DD>	The American Cancer Society, American Heart Association, American Lung Association, Arthritis Foundation and others are entering the business world and setting up operations that sell everything from vacation packages to mutual funds.  
Small businesses complain they can't match the deals offered by their tax-exempt business rivals.  They say such practices are "unfair competition."  Some businesses even accuse charities of "ripping off" their products and customers and trading on the charity's good reputation.<BR>
<DD>	A recent news story described how small businesses that sell turbans, hats, scarves and prostheses to female cancer patients have attacked the American Cancer Society (ACS) for distributing a new, mail-order catalogue peddling the same products they sell for a living.  The catalogue sales undercut small business in two ways:  ACS's tax-exempt status allows it to offer the products at a lower price, and its charitable status gives the products an perceived seal of approval.  The ACS is "using its vast reservoir of goodwill and trust to sell products," complains Peggy Childs, proprietor of Designs for Comfort, a Chicago business that is forced to compete with ACS products.<BR>
<DD>	The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) is the most notorious example of a non-profit organization that uses its good name to sell hundreds of millions of dollars of products annually.  AARP sells insurance policies, mutual funds, mail-order pharmaceuticals, auto rental s, auto club memberships, Visa and Mastercard credit cards, and hotel discount packages.  Companies like Scudder Financial Services, Prudential Insurance, American Express, New York Life, JTT Hartford, Amoco, and Bank One provide the products and services.  Then they pay AARP a percentage of their sales in return for the use of the charity's name and reputation.<BR>
<DD>	AARP pays taxes on ad revenue from its Modern Maturity magazine and on income from its money market funds and credit cards.  But its pharmacy, auto club and insurance profits are not taxed, prompting the charges of  "unfair competition."  Business has a good point:  Why should AARP be exempt from taxes when virtually identical companies not affiliated with the non-profit giant must pay taxes to provide the same services?  <BR>
<DD>	Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY) aptly summarized this conflict at a 1995 Senate hearing.  It is as if "U.S. Steel decided to rename itself the 'American Association of Steel Enthusiasts,' offered some discounts and rebates to millions of Americans in exchange for a strictly nominal contribution, and then used that incidental association to gain tax-exempt status."<BR>
<DD>	There is evidence, moreover, that AARP members relying on the group's good reputation are buying inferior products. For instance:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>	Last year, Money magazine evaluated AARP's businesses and concluded that of AARP's ten types of insurance, only its supplemental Medicare insurance deserved high marks; the rest were rated "decent to dreadful."  
<LI>	In 1994, 25 mutual funds did better than AARP's best performer, its Growth and Income fund.
<LI>	And in 1983, 500 San Diego AARP members purchased cellular phones for $209 each from a firm that promised to pay AARP $5 for each phone sold to a member.  But the company went bankrupt, the members did not receive their phones or a refund, and AARP -- with $358 million in revenues that year -- refused to reimburse them, saying it "couldn't afford" the cost.<P>
<BR>
<DD>	Other charities are jumping on the commercial bandwagon.  The American Heart Association sold its "Heart Check Seal of Approval" for $550,000 to the Florida citrus industry.  (Earlier, it abandoned its "HeartGuide Seal" program after the FDA warned the public that some of its claims might be "illegal" and "unproven.")  The American Lung Association endorses home carbon monoxide testing kits for a fee.  The Arthritis Foundation has endorsed Johnson and Johnson products in return for $1 million in annual donations.  And the Skin Cancer Foundation's "Seal of Recommendation" is for sale for $100,000 per year.<BR>
<DD>	The commercialization of non-profit activities is a disturbing trend, because it squanders the organization's most valuable asset, the public's trust.  In the long run, the nonprofit sector is jeopardized.  The mere perception that a charity is hocking its halo -- its good name -- for profit will scare donors away.  They won't contribute to a charity that prefers to sell its services instead.

Traditionally, newspapers have shied away from developing close relationships with the foundation world. Because newspapers and television have long ago taken  the position that outside money is tainted, they'd sooner turn to advertisers for revenues -- even advertisers they don't like -- than apply for a grant.The code of ethics of Sigma Delta Chi (the journalists' professional organization) prohibits accepting "any thing of value" in exchange for covering a story. But lately things have changed. On June 20, 1996 the Pew Charitable Trusts announced grants of  $4.3 million over the next three years to the Pew Center for Civic Journalism in Washington, D.C. as one component of an enterprise called "Renewing Our Democratic Heart."
Pew is composed of  seven named charitable trusts with different missions, established from 1948 to 1979. One hundred fifteen employees give out $180 million each year, making Pew the nation's third largest foundation. Pew is currently footing the bill for 34 media projects nationwide as part of a movement known as civic journalism (the movement is more commonly called public or community journalism depending on which group is pushing it). Although the names are different, the purpose is the same. However, civic journalism  remains controversial among editors such as Howell Raines of the New York Times and Leonard Downie of the Washington Post chary about outsiders influencing their editorial decisions. Smaller papers seem to have fewer hesitations about taking Pew's money.
And so Pew, with no previous track record in journalism, has suddenly emerged as a major player in the news business. Foundation president Rebecca Rimel proudly declares that thanks to her multi-million dollar expenditure, civic journalism "is becoming the way to do business in many newsrooms across the country." This is happening, in large part, because Pew is paying newspapers, and radio and television stations to cover stories in the way it wants to see them covered.
Pew's $4.3 million commitment is only the most recent development in Pew's onging love affair with the media. Since fall 1993, the foundation has pledged at least $19.7 million to various media enterprises, $10.7 million of it to support civic journalism. In some cases, Pew provides lump sums to newspapers and broadcast outlets so they can conduct opinion polls and convene focus groups. Pew pays newspapers to send reporters out of town and even to rent apartments for reporters to live in selected neighborhoods. The overarching goal of these activities is to use the "extradordinary power" of the media to stimulate the public "to participate in community life," as Rimel puts it. "Civic journalism is one way to engage people in seeking solutions to their local problems."

<h3>THE PEW MEDIA MONOPOLY</h3>
<p>
The Philadelphia-based Pew 
		Charitable Trusts established a 
		Washington, D.C. beachhead for its Pew Center for Civic Journalism in September 1993. The Center's staff of three is run by Walter Cronkite's former CBS News producer, Edward Fouhy. The Center distributes money to news organizations, holds seminars around the country and spreads the gospel of civic journalism to newsrooms across the land [see grants list box on page 4]. Last year, Pew gave Ed Fouhy's group an additional $300,000 over three years to "raise the visibility and stature of civic journalism through an awards and symposium program."
	This spring,  the Pew Center for Civic Journalism awarded prizes of  $25,000 to three newspapers _ The Charlotte Observer, The Kansas City Star and The Argus Leader in South Dakota _ for: "Doing journalism in a manner calculated to re-engage people in the process of public life."  While significantly smaller than a MacArthur "genius" award, the  $25,000 sum is among the more lucrative in the field.
	And when The Times-Mirror Company announced last year it would be forced to shutter its well-respected  Center for the People and Press, Pew donated money to keep the Washington-based polling organization open for three more years, and asked that it be called the Pew Research Center.
 	Pew is bankrolling former Washington Post reporter Paul Taylor's efforts to the tune of $111,864 for a six-month consulting contract, which includes salary, travel expenses and setting up conferences, to convince television networks to give free air time to presidential candidates. Taylor teamed up with Fouhy's old partner, former CBS anchor Walter Cronkite. Together they have successfully convinced Rupert Murdoch's Fox Television network to provide one hour of free airtime this fall. However, while candidate Bob Dole has agreed to participate,  President Clinton has not yet accepted.
       	Both through its Washington Center and directly, the Pew Charitable Trusts have contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Radio-Television News Directors Foundation for community journalism projects, to the Citizens Election Project and National Public Radio and to Soundprint Media Center for online civic journalism through the World Wide Web. Pew has provided $3.2 million over three years for the National Arts Journalism program at the University of Georgia, as well. And, as devotees of National Public Radio hear over and over, the Pew Charitable Trusts sponsor the radio network's reporting on culture, the environment and religion. 
	Once a relatively obscure charity, Pew is sending shoots and tendrils everywhere in the world of journalism. "You mean the Pew media monopoly," jokes John Dinges, NPR editorial director. "It's an interesting experiment by a foundation to get into the world of media with some definite ideas for innovation and change."
<p>
<a name="Rimel"></a>
<h3>THE RIMEL REVOLUTION</h3>
<p>
Why are the Pew Charitable Trusts so interested in this new and controversial civic journalism movement? The answer lies more with president Rebecca Rimel  than with the nine trustees who ultimately decide how to spend Pew's millions. Rimel, aged 45, is a former emergency room nurse and assistant professor of neurology at the University of Virginia, who has done much to change the direction of a foundation once known for its low profile and conservative leanings. 
	Rimel joined the Philadelphia-based Pew foundation in 1983 as manager of its health program and quickly rose as former Pew president Thomas Langfitt's protege (he is an eminent neurosurgeon) to become vice president, then president in July 1988.  Today she earns $318,213 a year. After an administrative shake-up in which nearly two-thirds of  Pew's permanent staff departed Rimel has concentrated Pew's giving in six major program areas:  culture, education, health and human services, religion, public policy _ and an interdisciplinary grab-bag including the Children's Television Workshop's production of Ghostwriter for PBS, the Center for Community Change's anti-poverty initiatives, the Global Action Plan for the Earth, Inc. and San Francisco's Tides Foundation for the Global Stewardship Initiative. Rimel favors working in partnerships with other foundations, something Pew rarely did before.
	The Pews were an old Philadelphia family whose fortunes derived from the Sun Oil Co. (now Sunoco). Joseph N. and Mary Anderson Pew had four children who set up seven separate trusts between 1948 and 1979 which are jointly administered as the Pew Charitable Trusts. Together they became a major charity, generously handing out money _ mostly to local  Philadelphia organizations which helped the neediest. They didn't call press conferences. The Pew style was to quietly, often anonymously, dole out their largess. Until 1987, there was no listing for the Pew Charitable Trusts in the Philadelphia telephone directory. This was due to a "a very deep religious conviction that one does not need recognition for their good deeds," says Rimel. 
	 It was J. Howard Pew who built the family business into a global enterprise. And he left the strongest imprint on the family trusts created in 1957 to further the free enterprise system. Under his direction, it supported such causes as open markets, lower taxes and less government regulation.When J. Howard Pew died in 1971, the philanthropy began to evolve, while it remained committed to giving in Philadelphia. The board decided in the late 1980s  that  it would seek national attention. Part of that push came from Rimel. 
	"It had been a bit of a mom and pop operation," says Rimel. "We had grown up slowly. We had a very small staff. The board gave me the directive that we want this to be a national foundation with a  local commitment." With assets of $3.8 billion, the trusts give 20 to 30 percent of their annual contributions to Philadelphia arts and human service groups. Pew also supports population control efforts and contributes to national and international organizations organizations to help meet health needs of at-risk women and children. "I guess if you had to put a tag on us," Rimel says, "we are really trying to help a lot of the organizations and institutions we work with recapture the middle ground."
       But a middle of the road approach is not what some observers see. "I call them liberal, " says Althea K. Nagai, a political scientist who has done statistical grant analyses of the Pew foundation.  "Rimel herself is not a conservative. In one piece about her, she says she was a sixties liberal and wanted to recall the spirit of the times. She says she wanted to bring that kind of spirit to the Pew. But looking at the J. Howard Pew charter, you can see that J. Howard was very much against what we would call today traditional liberalism. He was very conservative."  [see Alternatives in Philanthropy, "The Pew Charitable Trusts: Revitalizing 'the spirit of the 60s,'" November, 1995]
	But today Pew has a full-time director of communications. Its offices are housed on two floors of a swank high-rise office building at 2005 Market Street in Philadelphia's financial district. Each year, Pew receives between 5,000 and 6,000 proposals but generally awards only 500 grants, a ratio of one in ten. In 1995, Pew gave 33 grants of $1 million or over. The majority of the grants _ 35 percent _ were in the $200,000 to $499,999 range. Sixty-seven percent of the grants were distributed nationally, while 24 percent were targeted for Philadelphia-based groups and 9 percent were given to international organizations. 
	The Pew board meets in March, June, September and December to review grant proposals, which generally take up to six months to consider before a decision is made.	
       Six program officers gave $162 million in 1995 in the areas of culture (52 grants), education (43 grants), environment (58 grants), religion (26 grants), public policy (12 grants), health and human services (109 grants) and interdisciplinary (74 grants).
       *Marian A. Godfrey is director of the culture program, which supports working artists and says she wants to strengthen the role of arts and culture in Philadelphia and across the country. Pew is the home base for the Council on Foundation's "Grantmakers in the Arts" affinity group, which has championed  "arts advocacy" and funded many  groups supporting the National Endowment for the Arts in its conflicts with Congress over the use of federal funds for profanity, obscenity, blasphemy and anti-American propaganda.
	*Robert B. Schwartz is director of the education program, which funds elementary and high school education. Pew's emphasis on public school reform does not include support for vouchers, which would enable poor parents to enjoy the same freedom of choice already available to the affluent. 
	*Joshua S. Reichert is director of the environment program, which is interested in global warming, global climate change and global pollution prevention rather than challenging doomsday prophets in the manner of Dr. Julian Simon. 
	*Tamar R. Datan is program officer for the Interdisciplinary Fund, which gives money to the Pew Center for Civic Journalism and last year gave $600,000 to the Academy of Teleivsion Arts and Sciences Foundation for a two-year project to educate and train television writers about the negative effects of gratuitous TV violence, a public relations campaign along the lines of the Joyce Foundation's anti-gun efforts [for a parallel case, see vol.1 no.6, "How Does The Joyce Foundation Deal With Dissent? 'Squash It!'"].
	*Paul C. Light is director of Pew's Public Policy program, whose 1995 goals included promoting economic and political freedom abroad. Over the past six years, Pew has spent nearly $40 million in this program area giving more than 100 grants to promote democracy and market reforms in Eastern and Central Europe. 
	*Joel A. Carpenter is director of religion, a program which offers scholarships and has programs designed to make community ministries and religious leaders more effective.

One of the ways to improve civic democracy in America, Rimel believes,  is through what Pew calls civic journalism. Rimel doesn't pretend to be a media junkie. She's a self-avowed techno-peasant who grew up on a farm, and admits she'd be lost on the Internet. Pew recently started up a home page (http://www.pew-trusts.org) that Rimel will have to learn to surf. But she believes the press can be a vehicle for reaching out to citizens and getting them to care about their government and community. Rimel is careful to point out that Pew is not interested in running a newspaper or reforming or reviving a failing newspaper. It is interested in supporting "civic journalism experiments."
	Civic journalism is a theory developed by some academics and old-hand journalists such as David Broder who worry about the future of journalism and what they claim to be its growing negative effect on democracy. Some well-known figures such as Carter speechwriter and Clinton appointee James Fallows say the press' growing cyncism has infected their work and therefore poisoned how Americans view the political process.
	"Our foray into civic journalism is really via the back door," Rimel says. "I've never had any particular interest _ didn't see it as our role, still don't _ how journalism goes about its business. Except we do see it as an issue if journalism can be used as a tool, as a way to get the public reconnected, reinvigorated, recommitted to democratic values," she says. "Increasingly, we understand the power of the press. They  are extraordinarily powerful in shaping opinions and giving people information," she explains. 
	"Given that power, any way that the press might play a role in any kind of experiment in journalism to provide that information in a more effective,  efficient, user-friendly way appeals to us," Rimel says. Rimel first heard about civic journalism from former Knight-Ridder chairman  James K. Batten. As head of the country's second-largest newspaper chain, Batten (who died last year) had already pushed public journalism at some of his 32 newspapers, including the Charlotte Observer, which covered the 1992 elections as a major public journalism project.
	Batten met Rimel in January 1993 when he came to Pew seeking money to help rebuild Miami houses destroyed by Hurricane Andrew.  The subject changed into the depressing topic of how alienated American citizens were becoming from their community, their government and each other. Both were eager to find ways to get citizens more deeply involved in the democratic process. By September 1993, Pew had given television journalist Edward M. Fouhy $3.6 million to open the Pew Center for Civic Journalism in Washington, D.C.

<h3>PEW'S WASHINGTON CENTER:  ADMINISTERED BY TIDES</h3>
<p>
Federal law prohibits foundations from donating money to for-profit organizations, such as newspapers.  That's why the Pew Charitable Trusts makes its donations to the Tides Foundation, which in turn funds the Pew Center,which pays the newspapers. Tides handles all the Center's paperwork and medical benefits as well as adminstering the grant from one Pew entity to another. On March 15, 1996 the Tides Foundation staff distributed a memorandum to its board of directors denouncing the "disastrous 1994 elections" and "the urgent need for progressives to reverse the gains made by the radical right."
	On the other hand the Center's Washington director, Edward Fouhy, has solid establishment credentials. Fouhy, 61, had been CBS's Saigon bureau chief during the Vietnam war, personally ran both the CBS News and ABC News Washington bureaus.When Batten spoke glowingly of  Fouhy, Rimel sought out the TV veteran in an effort to focus amorphous talk about the media's role in "reconnecting" citizens into a plan for action. 
	Rimel had been prepared to woo Fouhy with flowers and chocolates. But it wasn't necessary. Fouhy says that he had become disgusted with how turned off the public was to the political process. He told Rimel that he thought the press held some responsibility for that.
	Pew "asked me if I could think of a strategy to deal with this growing sense of alienation which they had already sensed," Fouhy says. "It became pretty obvious that if you were going to do the kind of outreach that I recommended in a strategy paper, that you have to have some kind of base." The Pew Center for Civic Journalism was set up to underwrite media partnerships based on Fouhy's strategic recommendation that it was crucial for money be given to television, radio and newspaper partnerships, since that each medium has a particular strength which could be exploited together.   Typically, television and newspapers or radio rarely share information. But Pew-backed media partners are doing just that, co-operating rather than competing in their news coverage.
	 To help this along, Pew gave $600,000 to the Radio-Television News Directors' Foundation to foster partnerships between electronic and print media. "We have some money that we can give $5,000, $10,000, $15,000 out to projects for focus groups, surveys or town meetings,"  says Eric Swanson, director of the Radio-Television Directors' Foundation,  "Whereas the Pew Center for Civic Journalism has more money and can give out $50,000 to $100,000 grants." Swanson's foundation funded five partnerships in 1995.  "Other than the price tag, we are both up to the same goal which is to get enhanced or greater coverage of issues of concern in communities by structuring partnerships between radio, television and print. The typical makeup has been a partnership with a leading daily, a local commercial TV outlet and local radio _ typically it's public radio."
	Pew gave National Public Radio $290,000 directly for its Voter Project in which five public radio stations, tried to cover the 1994 elections in ways that would stimulate citizen interest. Pew gave the project another $250,000 for 1996. To improve election coverage, the Pew Center gave $835,000 to the 1996 Citizen's Election Project, which is run by Stan Cloud, former Time magazine Washington bureau chief. "To me the interesting thing is Pew has set up an election and civic journalism part of their operation  and they distribute their money in lots of different chunks which are kind of all operating independently," says John Dinges, NPR editorial director.  
	Sometimes too independently, it seems. This has led some to question whether Pew is properly overseeing the use of its money. Take for example, overlap between the NPR election project and Cloud's Citizens Election Project. "The strange thing is that the Citizens Election Project funded a number of my stations independent of the NPR Election Project,"says NPR's Dinges.  "I did the election project in 1994 for the '94 election. During 1995, Stan Cloud came in and funded a number of projects for the same partnerships that I set up the previous year. They did Boston, San Francisco, Seattle. All of which I had set up. Stan's projects were for early '96 to focus on the primaries. But my project continues through the election."
	A good example of duplication, says Dinges, is the Voters' Voice project with New Hampshire public radio and a statewide coalition of the Associated Press.  "We weren't able to give them as much money as Stan did," says Dinges. "It turned out it was not a very well coordinated project. Stan came in in the middle, did his thing and most of the time it worked out all right. But it could have been better. The question I would pursue is the separate funding operations. Pew could have made sure they were coordinated. If Ed Fouhy had run the whole thing it probably would have been smoother."

<h3>OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY</h3>
<p>
One of the tenets of public journalism is that reporters need to learn what people are really thinking about. The view among Washington journalists last fall was that the Republican primary would revolve around which candidate was best qualified to help House Speaker Newt Gingrich advance his "Contract with America,"  says Don MacGillis, who coordinated the Boston Globe's Pew-funded civic journalism election project, "People's Voice."  It was Washington wisdom that people outside the Beltway were eager to have the federal budget balanced and taxes cut.
	"The goals of our project were to find out if these really were the issues of concern to New Hampshire voters and then, whatever those concerns turned out to be, to get the candidates to address them," says MacGillis, who spoke at a Pew Center symposium in Washington, D.C. this spring.  Through Pew-funded polling and focus groups and getting to know the people of Derry, N.H. participants learned  residents feared  losing their jobs (even though the state has an extremely low unemployment rate). MacGillis felt vindicated when a surprised, somewhat befuddled Bob Dole announced: "I didn't realize that jobs and trade and what makes America work would become a big issue in the last days of this campaign." 
	A bemused MacGillis told guests at the Pew symposium: "If Dole had been reading the People's Voice articles or listening to the radio and TV programs of our partners, he would have known way back in the fall of 1995 that economic insecurity was a major concern, probably the major concern of New Hampshire voters." Of course, Pat Buchanan's campaign efforts helped draw attention to the pocketbook issue without Pew's subsidy.
	Pew's hope is to find a way to re-connect citizens to the election process by encouraging them to participate in candidate forums and advocating that people _ who often are too apathetic to vote _ go to the polls. The point of civic journalism, say those who practice it, is to take back control of election dialogues from political handlers and candidates.
<p>
<a name="Nobody"></a>
<h3>WHAT IF THEY GAVE A FORUM AND NOBODY CAME?</h3>
<p>
Sounds noble. But what if the candidates just don't want to listen or participate in a civic journalism experiment?  It happened to Dave Iverson,  executive producer for "Citizens '96" sponsored by the Pew-supported Voice of the People Iowa Coalition for Wisconsin Public TV, the Wisconsin State Journal in Madison, six different Iowa newspapers, the Iowa AP, Iowa Public Television, Iowa Public Radio and two commercial TV stations. 
	Their goal was to gather an audience to question the nine presidential candidates in a debate before the Iowa caucuses. About 300 Iowans were primed to ask questions. "Just one problem," says Iverson, "the candidates. Now for months we had done the candidate dance. They were in. They were out. They were in. They were out. They told us every possible version of, this looks good, without ever getting final commitments." 
	On the eve of the broadcast, Iverson had promises from five candidates. Steve Forbes, Pat Buchanan and Lamar Alexander agreed to participate if Bob Dole appeared.  "About 24 hours before the debate itself, Dole made his final decision _ he had been back and forth about it _ and said he wouldn't do it," Iverson says. "Alexander, Buchanan and Forbes who had all made those "this looks good" noises then backed out." Then Phil Gramm pulled out. Then Dick Lugar withdrew. 
	"So we were left with -- and I bet you remember this trio -- Alan Keyes, Bob Dornan and yes, Morry Taylor," says Iverson. "It wasn't a pretty prospect." Six hours before the broadcast, Lugar decided he'd made a promise to the people of Iowa and he'd come. One of the lessons Iverson shared at the civic journalism symposium in Washington, D.C. was that "no matter how sophisticated a media consortium you build, candidates will still act like candidates and make their own strategic decisions."
<p>
<a name="Threats"></a>
<h3>THREATS TO INDEPENDENCE AND INTEGRITY</h3>
<p>
Pew is undeterred by failures such as Iverson's Wisconsin debate. It is similarly resistant to criticism from skeptics such as Washington Post editor Leonard Downie, former New York Times executive editor Max Frankel, columnist Maureen Dowd [see "Why is New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd driving the White House crazy?" in Culture Watch, vol.1, no. 2] or editorial page editor Howell Raines. 
	Frankel told this reporter he has read much of the literature on public journalism and still doesn't get it.  "Some of it sounds like old fashioned reporting," says Frankel, "some of it sounds like getting in bed with the promotion department and that's unfortunate. Some of it sounds downright political."
	However, increasing numbers of journalists seem, in Fouhy's words, to "get it," which often gives critics the impression that public or civic journalism is some kind of growing religious-like movement.  It is difficult for some outsiders to grasp because there are few texts and no specific guidelines or concrete definitions of exactly what is a civic journalism project. 
	Some newspaper veterans are uncomfortable with sponsoring events that they have traditionally covered. Nonetheless, newspaper-radio-television partnerships are lining up with their hands extended for Pew Center grants. To date, the Pew Center has doled out $575,000 to 17 newspaper-radio-television partnerships for community-oriented projects in 1996. This year it will also co-sponsor four seminars on civic journalism in locations around the country.
	"The first year was all criticism," says Jan Schaffer, the Pew Center's deputy director and a former Philadelphia Inquirer business editor. "The second year there was a lot of curiosity and people trying it. The third year is, "How exactly do I do this?"  Over the past three years, the Pew Center has provided money for 34 projects in 24 cities involving partnerships among newspapers, television and radio outlets. Recipients include 22 newspapers, 24 television stations and 20 radio stations. Pew grants pay for items that would normally be outside a newsroom's normal operating budget. It is not to be used to buy newsprint or cover a reporter's salary.
	Moreover, the money comes with strings. It may only  be used for such items as polling, an expense many news outlets say they can no longer afford. The pressure for high profits, particularly at corporately-owned newspapers, has forced many newsroom managers to slash budgets to raise revenue. So Pew money fills in the gaps. Pew money is also used to hold town meetings, conduct focus groups to learn what people are thinking about _ and sometimes Pew  pays for the salary of a "newsroom coordinator," who sets up town meetings and functions much like a community organizer.
	This year's Pew grants range in size form $5,000 to $61,000. While large foundations such as Ford, Robert Wood Johnson, Knight and Kaiser have given money to the press, it is often used for seminars, press education or for fellowships to individual reporters. It is rarely given directly to newspapers or commercial electronic outlets. For example, Harvard's Nieman fellowships are given to reporters, not to the newspaper. They are stipends which replace salaries while reporters conduct their studies.
	These sorts of grants can generate controversy themselves. Two years ago a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation grant to NBC for a two-hour televised discussion on health reform aroused criticism from other members of the media _ even though that foundation, like the Pew trusts, claimed it had exercised no editorial control. "For foundations to give grants to commercial newspapers to carry out tasks or information gathering would be very unusual," says Waldemar Nielsen, a noted author on the activities of foundations and columnist for the Chronicle of Philanthropy. 
	A thirteen-member advisory board, made up mostly of journalists (many of them Fouhy's friends), decides how Pew's money should be spent. Money goes only to media partnerships _ as opposed to a single news outlet _ for projects that carry out a civic journalism project. The goal is to reach consensus about a problem and its solution.  Funds cannot  be used merely for research. Eligible  media projects might focus on education, transportation or neighborhood safety. Members of the Pew Center for Civic Journalism advisory board, made up largely of journalists, approve the topics. "I don't have any relationship with the Pew Board," says Fouhy. "If they walked in the door, I wouldn't recognize them. I've never met them. They don't know who we fund until we let them know. Independence is one of the tenets of this whole thing. We wouldn't be here if we didn't have that independence."
	Pew grantmakers hope their money will be used to start an experiment  which media outlets will continue. "A lot of papers are going to be increasingly saying:  'We ought not to take money,' " says University of Maryland journalism professor Hodding Carter III, a member of the advisory board. "Pew is not in the business of subsidizing newspapers. We are in the business of encouraging the idea" of civic journalism.
	But Roberto Suro, deputy national editor of the Washington Post,  has taken the role of resident skeptic on the Pew advisory board. Suro is concerned about the threats to the independence and integrity of reporters dependent upon Pew-funded coordinators. 
	For example, Charlene Price-Patterson handled logistics for public journalism events sponsored by the Charlotte Observer, WSOC-TV and two radio stations. Price-Patterson only worked temporarily at the paper.  She is not a reporter but a community activist. Although technically she did not work for Pew, her Observer salary did not go towards traditional news-gathering activities. Price-Patterson arranged child care, refreshments and transportation and spent some time "knocking on doors to publicize the event," she wrote in the Pew Center's newsletter.

<h3>"WE MAKE PLENTY OF MONEY"</h3>
<p>
Some journalists by nature prefer to think of themselves as lone cowboys who have the skills to go in and rope their own cattle. They don't need to hire someone else to do the job, many would say. "If I was a newspaper editor," says Suro, "I would not feel comfortable having someone in that position and particularly not in the newsroom." Price-Patterson's desk was located in the newsroom.
	Jim Walser coordinated the Observer's "Taking Back Our Neighborhoods" project which won last year's $25,000 James K. Batten  award. He says some reporters did feel uneasy about having a coordinator in the newsroom. "But from the standpoint of the editors, it worked well," he adds. "Charlene wasn't putting stories in the newspaper. She was giving us information. She knew a hell of a lot more people in the neighborhoods than any of our neighborhood reporters."
	Last year, former Philadelphia Inquirer associate editor Fran Dauth was in the market for a new job. One of the many newspapers that was interested in hiring her was the San Francisco Chronicle. In talking with Chronicle managing editor Dan Rosenheim, she asked if his paper had taken any Pew money. He told her it had for an election project. Dauth questioned why the Chronicle didn't use its own money to pay for reporting. Rosenheim cited budget constraints, although the paper was making a profit.
	"I don't know any particular evil about taking money from Pew," Dauth says.  Now an editor with New Jersey's Newark Star Ledger, she adds, "But it seems to go against the training of what we do. The newspapers are taking money from an outside source. The outside source says, "You can have this money if you do this kind of story." It also seems to me once you become dependent on an outside source to finance the project, you give up independence."
	Witness the Philadelphia Inquirer, a prestigious Knight-Ridder newspaper with a slew of Pulitzer prizes. Last year, the Inquirer found itself at the center of a media flap when it hired urban expert Neil Peirce for an editorial board project on regionalism. The Inquirer paid for the project. But Peirce had received money for expenses indirectly from the New Era Foundation. When the Wall Street Journal reported New Era was an elaborate Ponzi scheme which had ensnared dozens of charities, the Inquirer was tarred.  
	Ironically, the Inquirer had earlier applied to the Pew Center for Civic Journalism, but had been turned down. However, the paper was invited to resubmit its application after making a few changes. 
	But Inquirer Editor Maxwell E. P. King says the paper has since decided it should not take foundation money and did not reapply.  "At this point," says King, "I'd be very, very reluctant to take any funding from any foundation for a journalism project because I'd worry whether that would impinge on the independence of the newspaper. Besides, we make plenty of money. We can fund our own journalism."

<h3>MONEY AS GUILT, PHILANTHROPY AS THERAPY, AND THE LEGACY OF WEALTH</h3>
<p>
<I>by Robert Huberty</I>
<p>
	<I>The Legacy of Inherited Wealth: Interviews With Heirs</I>, edited by Barbara Blouin with Katherine Gibson and Margaret Kiersted (Trio Press, 1995, paperback, 185 pages, $14.95.  Available from The Inheritance Project, Inc., 3291 Deer Run Rd., Blacksburg, VA 24060, 540/552-8436.<P>

	Karl Marx thought capitalism would make workers so miserable and angry that they would develop a class consciousness, rise up in revolution, and overthrow their oppressors.  Marx's social theory, which disastrously misled politicians and intellectuals for a century, failed in a number of ways.  It did not forsee the astonishing productivity of the free market.  It cannot account for the enormous middle class of producers and consumers that Western society has created.  Finally, it did not anticipate that successful capitalists would apparently make their own children so miserable and angry that they would throw away their opportunities, seek therapy, and they (not the workers) would use their inherited wealth to create the collectivist society Marx wanted. 
	The editors of this volume have identified such people.  The children of the very rich are much envied but little studied. Unlike most citizens in a modern competitive marketplace, they are not compelled to make enough money to acquire goods.  Like the poor, they have been left out of our wealth-producing system.  But while the problems of poor people occasion much public policy debate, no one pays much attention to those who inherit so much money that working is purely a matter of personal choice.  The editors, themselves heirs and founders in 1992 of a group called The Inheritance Project, Inc., have remedied this neglect by interviewing seventeen adult heirs.  The Legacy of Inherited Wealth records their stories.  In their own words, they tell us what it's like to grow up rich. 
	Now for those of  us who didn't grow up rich, it is tempting to report gleefully that most heirs, as recorded in these narratives, seem pathetically unhappy.  Gifted novelists of manners have written many stories about lives like theirs, often with comic irony or as satires.  But these first person accounts of messy and misspent lives deserve sympathy.  The stories perceptively weave sad self-descriptions with compelling sagas of family life over several generations.  (The editors, who hold advanced degrees in literature, have no doubt helped here.)  One cannot help but feel pity for sons and daughters raised to be so financially secure, yet so emotionally lost and economically ignorant. 
	The legacy of inherited wealth described here is not one of personal pride in family accomplishments.  Instead, it is one of acute psychological distress over not knowing how to handle amounts of money that others can only dream of.  Confusion, self-pity and guilt permeate the tales of these heirs who have intense memories of their families, but who often seem to enjoy no personal ties to them.  The heirs' stories show how deeply affected they are by the strong wills and striking personalities of their parents and grandparents, but they describe their own lives as drifting and listless.  As each tells his own story, certain common patterns emerge.
	*Money is a crutch:  David Bowman wants a serious and creative career, but he notes how easily he falls back on the privileges of his wealth when the demands of his projects become too stressful.
	*Money is a puzzle:  Rebecca Hutchins receives regular dividends from her grandfather's trust.  She is bored and confused by financial advice and is ashamed to admit it.  But trying to actively manage her wealth would require that she overcome her passivity and deal with her difficult family.
	*Money is a trap: Rachel Halpern was taught the work ethic by her parents.  She thinks she should be paid for her work and treated no differently from her co-workers.  But she feels guilty demanding a wage from a hard-pressed employer when her trusts are worth $<br>6 million.  
	*Money is a threat:  Fred Hopgood is afraid that others will take advantage of his money.  His friendships and marriage end because of his suspicions.
	*Money is a double-edged weapon:  Several heirs choose marriage partners to spite their families and repudiate their privileged upbringing.  But then they resent writing checks to support their poor, unfashionable or reckless spouses.
	The founders of The Inheritance Project have encouraged heirs to tell their stories for reasons they provide in a project brochure.  They think that by talking about the impact of inherited wealth on their lives, heirs will "break the isolation and challenge the taboos surrounding wealth."  Heirs will also learn how others have "claimed their personal power and used it to benefit others."  And they will become familiar with "networking and educational resources to heirs and professionals who work with them."
	The Inheritance Project at first appears to be some sort of recovery group, albeit one serving a very exclusive clientele.  Heirs are invited to set up confidential appointments to share their feelings and experiences with a sympathetic listener.  But some aspects of it (evident in lists of workshops, contacts, and publications) suggest that the Project encourages yet another bizarre form of postmodern identity politics.  It is intimated that heirs _ the term "heiress," I suspect, is inadmissable _ will discover their common victimization, become empowered to reclaim their identities, and will work to overcome the forces that oppress them and separate them from others.  
	Several heirs explain in their interviews that they are doing just that.  Wendy Johnson reports that she no longer feels guilty about her wealth.  She has sold the defense stocks in her $1 million investment portfolio and invested her daughter's trust in Working Assets Mutual Funds, which screens out companies that are not socially responsible.  Chuck Collins has given away his inheritance and attends "wealth conferences" organized by the Haymarket People's Fund which is committed to funding "change, not charity."  (Collins' work with community housing loan funds and land trusts has taught him that the home mortgage interest deduction is a "mansion subsidy" for the rich.)  Deborah Frank contributes her income from seven irrevocable trusts to grassroots community development groups.  "With one stroke, I am able to help support community development and get even with my parents, too."
	But this poses a problem, in that it discourages heirs from becoming true philanthropists and helping others to escape poverty. Heirs who think they are not really entitled to their families' fortunes are not likely to support philanthropies that offer the poor the means to acquire wealth.  After all, if wealth only creates unearned privilege, then there is no nobility in encouraging others to pursue it.  Heirs who contribute instead to causes that prevent the accumulation of wealth will overcome the conditions that leave them feeling guilty.  The resulting condition leaves everyone poorer. Karl Marx, call your psychiatrist!

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>
	Regarding your recent essay about the Joyce Foundation [vol. 1, no.6, July, 1996], there are several factual errors in the few paragraphs relating to the Joyce-funded project in Indiana. As a journalist for the past 19 years, I have always found it useful to actually interview the people I write about -- no one called me. Most notably, you criticize the Indianpolis Star over its excellent series of stories about the role of money in the state legislature, "Of course, the story paid scant attention to the interests of foundations or the power of their money."
	Such a comment is flat-out wrong. The Indianapolis Star coverage disclosed and credited both the Joyce Foundation support and the Center for Public Integrity for creating a 19,000-document database from 1994 campaign records chronicling contributions to Republicans and Democrats, from individuals, labor unions, law firms, etc. If someone contributed money to the process, it was recorded at the state election commission, in the Center database, in the Indianapolis Star, and elsewhere. As you know, philanthropic foundations do not make political contributions.	
	The work in Indianapolis is a spectacular, unprecedented example of vital information about our democracy being made availabe to the public. Legislators in Indiana and other states use taxpayer money to buy themselves laptop computers, but keep information about who is bankrolling their political campaigns on less accessible "paper" records physically kept in a single location in the state.
	The project is nonpartisan, non-ideological and about something every American today supports: free and open public discourse and disclosure about our political process. Today, the citizens of Indiana know more about who funds their state legislature than they ever have. Humbly stated, we think that is important.
<p>Charles Lewis <br>
Executive Director<br>
The Center for Public Integrity<br>
Washington, DC<br>
<p>
<p>
	We did not call Charles Lewis because we had already talked to  him in person on April 14, 1996 at the Council on Foundations meeting in Atlanta after he presented the results of  the Center for Public Integrity's  "Statehouse Sellout" project -- on a panel which did not contain a single conservative or Republican representative [for more on the conference, see vol.1, no. 5, "The Council on Foundations Message To America: The Era Of Lady Bountiful Is Over"].
	Our account of the Center for Public Integrity's activies in Indiana is accurate. In fact, Lewis now confirms that his series ignored political activities of foundations such as Joyce, using the legal prohibition on philanthropic campaign contributions as a rationale. That is a legalism that has nothing to do with the question of  integrity with which his organization purports to be concerned. Many foundations classify political activities as "educational" or "outreach" in order to get around such strictures. 
	Lewis's claims to non-ideological  nonpartisanship are similarly suspect. The advisory board of the Center for Public Integrity on his letterhead lists Mother Jones contributor Molly Ivins, Carter administration State Department spokesman Hodding Carter, and Kennedy administration aide Arthur Schle-singer, Jr. on a clearly pro-liberal Democrat roster of names.
	We raised this issue of bias to Lewis in the specific case of ties between Minister Louis Farrakhan, his affiliated organizations and individuals, and the Democrats.  When we personally spoke with Lewis in Atlanta we had asked: Had his organization ever published a single investigation of ties between the Nation of Islam and the Democrats? His reply was negative. When will you do so?, we pressed. "You'll have to read our magazine," he said. We are still waiting.

<h2>Federal Funding for the CPB Is Neither Necessary Nor Deserved</h2>
<i>March 6, 1996</i>
<P>
WASHINGTON - When the 104th Congress cut federal payments to the
Corporation for Public Broadcasting in 1995, funding pledges to
CPB-funded stations increased 12.9 percent in a single month,
and total dollars pledged grew by 15.3 percent This rise in private
donations is one of two major reasons why taxpayer dollars should
no longer be used to support the CPB.
<P>
&quot;Events have shown that public broadcasting has other sources
of revenue which, if properly utilized, can more than make up
for the small fraction of the budget provided by the federal government
through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,&quot; said Laurence
Jarvik, Ph.D., <A HREF="/crc/fw">Foundation Watch</A> editor and
cultural studies fellow at Capital Research Center. <I>Foundation
Watch</I><B> </B>monitors the activities of philanthropic foundations
such as those which support the CPB and its affiliates.
<P>
In <A HREF="#testimony">testimony</A> Wednesday before the House
Appropriations Subcommittee for Labor, Health and Human Services,
and Education, Jarvik cited facts and figures proving private
donations to public broadcasting entities around the country can
more than make up for cuts in federal funding. For instance, Santa
Monica, California's National Public Radio (NPR) station, KCRW,
raised $1.09 million in a single February pledge drive, a 26 percent
rise over the previous year.
<P>
Not only does the Corporation for Public Broadcasting need no
taxpayer dollars to fund its operations, Jarvik said it doesn't
deserve them either. He listed nine examples of politically-biased
decisions from the CPB, the Public Broadcasting System and NPR,
including the rejection of Christian Coalition Executive Director
Ralph Reed's request to reply to NPR commentator Andrei Codrescru's
declaration that some basic evangelical Christian beliefs are
&quot;crap&quot; and that he hoped four million believers would
be &quot;evaporated.&quot;
<P>
&quot;In large measure CPB has not been reauthorized due to its
own failures to insure the integrity of the public broadcasting
system, maintain its balance, oversee its objectivity or guarantee
its managerial competence,&quot; Jarvik said.
<P>
Jarvik has testified before this congressional committee in the
past, and has edited three books concerning the federal government's
role in the arts: &quot;The National Endowments: A Critical Symposium&quot;;
&quot;Public Broadcasting and the Public Trust&quot;; and &quot;Masterpiece
Theatre and the Politics of Quality.&quot; He earned his doctorate
and master of fine arts in film and television from UCLA, where
he was Hugh Downs Fellow and winner of the Distinguished Scholar
Award.

<br><B>Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education</B>
<br><i>March 6, 1996</i> 
</center>
<P>

Mr. Chairman, and members of the subcommittee, thank you for inviting
me to testify today regarding the appropriation for the Corporation
for Public Broadcasting (CPB) for Fiscal Year 1999. I am Cultural
Studies Fellow at the Capital Research Center and editor of <I>Foundation
Watch</I>, a newsletter which covers the activities of philanthropic
foundations such as those which support PBS and NPR.
<P>
Last year, when I testified before this subcommittee, the Speaker
of the House had just announced that in order to help balance
the budget and reduce the federal deficit, he would &quot;zero
out&quot; the federal subsidy for public broadcasting because
it was an unnecessary Federal expenditure. The Speaker was right
then, and his statement has withstood the test of time. Events
have shown that public broadcasting has other sources of revenue
which, if properly utilized, can more than make up for the small
fraction of the budget provided by the Federal government through
the CPB. According to &quot;MediaNomics,&quot; (a publication
of Brent Bozell's Media Research Center) an analysis by editor
Tim Lamer of PBS's reported fundraising totals reveals that after
Congress cut the federal payment to PBS last year, overall revenues
to local stations from private donors <I>increased substantially</I>
more than making up for the reduction in federal spending, at
no cost to the American taxpayer.
<P>
According to Lamer, for example, Santa Monica California's NPR
station, KCRW, raised $1.09 million in a single February pledge
drive, a 26 percent rise over the previous year. Arkansas Educational
Television surpasssed its $350,000 fundraising goal while reducing
pledge breaks by 10 percent. KRMA, in Denver, Colorado, reported
a 13 percent uptick, and WETA in Washington, DC announced 62 percent
of a $1 million drive came <I>from new members</I>. KCET, Los
Angeles released a figure of $1.68 million, some $205,000 more
than in 1994. Overall, March 1995 pledges were 12.9 percent higher
than in 1994, and total dollars pledged were up by 15.3 percent.
Lamer notes private foundations also increased their contributions.
In 1994 Chicago's MacArthur Foundation gave $1,295,470. Last year
it provided $4,139,700. The Mott Foundation gave $590,000 in 1994,
$935,000 in 1995. The Pew Charitable Trusts increased its contribution
level from $2,740,000 in 1994 to $3,896,000 in 1995.
<P>
And successful private fundraising continues. Just this week,
for example, Channel 26 reported some $177,820 in pledges, including
over $35,000 from an airing of a Peter, Paul, and Mary concert
film, and what the <I>Washington Post</I> called an &quot;astounding&quot;
$94,389 from a one-night-only &quot;Les Miserables in Concert.&quot;
In New York, the same program netted $400,000 in only 3 1/2 hours.
PBS has been proud to announce a number of lucrative business
deals, most notably as $75 million agreement with <I>Reader's
Digest</I> to produce new programs for the network.
<P>
PBS program producers have also managed to make a number of new
deals, with Children's Television Workshop (CTW), producers of
<I>Sesame Street</I>, announcing the start of a children's cable
channel, for example. One might remind the subcommittee that Children's
Television Workshop continues its lucrative licensing, merchandising,
and other fundraising endeavors which result in gross sales of
almost a billion dollars a year in related merchandise, and gross
revenues to CTW of approximately $100 million annually.
<P>
Despite recent revelations about Chinese human rights violations
by activists such as Harry Wu whom I was honored to meet at a
Progress and Freedom Foundation reception &quot;Sesame Street&quot;
products can be found today on the shelves clearly marked &quot;Made
In China.&quot; China still bans political dissent, persecutes
Christians, forces women to have abortions, and operates orphanages
which are unhealthy for children. And, as AFL-CIO spokeswoman
Chyrol Graeve has noted, &quot;toy workers are paid less than
a dollar an hour.&quot; More than 250 Asian toy workers have lost
their lives in the past two years as the result of fires and other
industrial accidents. Nevertheless, Children's Television Workshop
continues to pay its top executives six figure salaries while
licensing to toy companies who manufacture in Asia. It is highly
questionable whether a reasonable case can be made that enterprises
with such manifest insensitivity to human rights violations deserve
continued federal subsidy at any level.
<P>
There can be no doubt that had Congress followed through on the
original privatization plan endorsed at the time by the entire
Congressional leadership including Appropriations Committee Chairman
Livingston and Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Pressler and
still evident in the public positions taken by the Dole and Buchanan
campaigns, for example public broadcasting might have been fully
self-sufficient today. We would not need to be spending time discussing
appropriation levels for 1999, some three years hence, for an
entity which has not been reauthorized.
<P>
In large measure CPB has not been reauthorized due to its own
failures to insure the integrity of the public broadcasting system,
maintain its balance, oversee its objectivity, or guarantee its
managerial competence. CPB's record was called &quot;contempt
of Congress&quot; in an issue of <I>Comint: A Journal About Public
Media</I> last year. Nothing has transpired to change that evaluation.
Certainly, CPB does not deserve any sort of &quot;trust fund&quot;
because it has lost its right to the public trust through its
own mismanagement.
<P>
Evidence of CPB's failure to exercise effective oversight of the
public broadcasting system has been widely reported over the last
year. Some examples of problems which CPB has failed to resolve
are:
<UL>
<LI>As I reported in the <A HREF="/crc/fw/fw-v1n1.html">premiere issue of Foundation Watch</A>,
(February, 1996) PBS's so-called &quot;Democracy Project&quot;
has been more like the Democrat project. I could not get the name
of a single Republican staffer in a decision-making job dealing
with coverage of the 1996 election at PBS from the director of
the project, who happens to be the wife of a Clinton political
appointee in the State Department. In what seems like deliberate
challenge to even the appearance of balance and objectivity as
required by law, PBS's new director of communications is the former
political director for the Clinton White House. Incredibly, PBS
does not feel the slightest obligation for even a token Republican
executive in the programming department.
<LI>PBS's so-called &quot;National Issues Convention&quot; was
rife with the appearance of conflict-of-interest and misrepresentation
of its goals and methods. Misleading at best in its claim to be
a &quot;deliberative poll&quot; former CBS polling chief Warren
Mitofsky declared it &quot;was not deliberative and not a poll&quot;
false and deceptive at worst, PBS had sponsored a &quot;pseudo-event&quot;
which wasted some $4 million dollars, approximately half of which
is reportedly straight from the PBS budget. PBS also provided
some nine hours of valuable airtime which could have produced
additional revenue streams to the network.
<LI>PBS rejected <I>The Children of Table 34</I>, a documentary
produced in cooperation with the <A HREF="http://www.frc.org">Family Research Council</A>
(FRC), about the controversy over the use of underage children
for sex research by Dr. Kinsey. The story was reported in <I>The
Washington Post </I>Style section. But PBS declined to help the
Family Research Council to bring this case before the American
public. Yet, as Robert Knight, director of Cultural Studies for
the FRC points out, PBS stations repeated <I>Tales of the City</I>,
a program many found highly offensive for its use of profanity,
glamorization of drug use, and sexual promiscuity.
<LI>PBS rejected <I>Covering Cuba</I>, and independent film by
Augustin Blazquez, which detailed the mainstream media's infatuation
with Fidel Castro since 1959. He first offered his picture in
October, 1995 and Blazquez volunteered to re-edit the film to
meet PBS standards. Despite numerous pro-Castro films on PBS,
and an obvious need for balance in this regard, Blazquez was not
given a chance to air his picture on PBS. Ironically, only a few
weeks ago, Castro's planes shot down American citizens in an incident
which confirmed Blazquez's depiction of the Cuban dictator and
his policies.
<LI>PBS has still not aired an episode of <I>The American Experience</I>
to correct &quot;Holocaust revisionism&quot; in <I>Liberators:
Fighting on Two Fronts in World War II.</I> Congressman Laughlin
of Texas has delivered a speech denouncing this hoax on the House
floor. Colonel James Moncrief, Jr. the senior surviving officer
of the Sixth Armored Division which actually liberated Buchenwald
presented written testimony to the authorizing subcommittee asking
that PBS correct the historical record. I personally met with
Congressman Joel Hefley of Colorado and Col. Moncrief right here
in the Rayburn Building to discuss this problem. Colonel Moncrief
has written numerous letters to PBS and CPB, yet the network still
refuses to air a documentary about the actual liberators of the
Nazi camps. If I could find them and I introduced Col. Moncrief
to a senior staffer on Senator Pressler's Commerce Committee as
well so could PBS. CPB has done nothing whatever in this case,
despite its legal obligation to insure the excellence and integrity
of public broadcasting, and the offer of Col. Moncrief's help.
<LI><I>Frontline</I> has aired a number of troubling documentaries
in the past year, including a show about the Speaker of the House
which included gratuitous footage of a heckler making offensive
and possibly obscene remarks about allegations of sexual indiscretions;
another program about killings at an abortion clinic in which
four-letter words were used without being bleeped, and in relation
to which a number of women came forward to allege (in a story
reported by Peter Steinfels in the <I>New York Times</I>) that
their point-of-view had been omitted by the producers as a symptom
of anti-Catholic bias; and a third program this year, about campaign
contributions, which was so unbalanced that even liberal columnist
David Broder condemned it in <I>The Washington Post </I>for presenting
a distorted portrayal of both the Clinton administration and Congress.
Neither CPB nor PBS have announced any balancing programming for
any of these cases.
</UL>

<P>
At NPR, the situation has not been any better. Some examples give
evidence of CPB failure to provide reasonable oversight:
<UL>
<LI>NPR commentator Andrei Codrescru declared that some basic
evangelical Christian beliefs were &quot;crap&quot; and that he
hoped four million believers would be &quot;evaporated.&quot;
Although after protests, did NPR issue a lame apology, Christian
Coalition executive director Ralph Reed's request for two minutes
of NPR airtime to reply to the attack was flatly refused. No editors
or executives have been publicly disciplined for permitting the
commentary on the air.
</UL>

<P>
In a letter dated February 27, 1996, Rev. Donald Wildmon of the
American Family Association wrote that &quot;it is absurd for
the government to be in the public broadcasting business...There
are more than 1300 Christian broadcasters in America. Our government
will not give them one penny. But we readily give those billions
to PBS, NPR and CPB. This is nothing more than censorship by the
government, to fund one perspective and not another...It is time
for PBS, NPR, and CPB to get off the government welfare dole and
get out and raise their money like other broadcasters do.&quot;
<UL>
<LI>NPR has not yet asked for a refund of commentary fees paid
to convicted murderer Mumia Abu-Jamal for his <I>Live from Death
Row</I>, the book based on these un-aired programs (because of
protests from critics such as Senator Dole) which is being sold
commercially.
<LI>NPR stations recently broadcast &quot;Blacklisted&quot; at
a cost of $160,00, half of which was paid by CPB itself. The three-part
series was produced by the son of screenwriter Gordon Kahn, and
portrayed his father as &quot;unjustly persecuted,&quot; by anti-Communists,
as Accuracy in Media's Reed Irvine notes, in &quot;an extreme
form of the sanitized obituary.&quot; Irvine points out that Kahn,
as a Communist Party member, was &quot;part of Stalin's secret
team in Hollywood...no more decent and honest than Hitler's favorite
movie maker, Leni Riefenstahl.&quot; According to Irvine, &quot;Communists
were trying to impose upon America and the world a system that
was at least as evil, oppressive and dangerous as the Nazism we
fought a war to defeat and destroy.&quot;
</UL>

<P>
&quot;Kahn and his comrades failed to bring about the triumph
of Communism,&quot; says Irvine. &quot;It is not they, but those
who worked to stop them that NPR should honor.&quot; As of this
date, I am not aware of any three-hour NPR series presenting Reed
Irvine's point of view, or honoring anti-Communists in Hollywood
such as former President Ronald Reagan.
<P>
Unfortunately, time does not permit mentioning all the outstanding
problems in public broadcasting. Let me just conclude with the
scandal reported in the <I>Washington Post</I> recently, where
an innocent member of the CPB board of directors who had been
concerned with questions of financial mismanagement found herself
smeared as a sex harasser after confidential personnel documents
were leaked to reporters. CPB spent an estimated $20,000 on lawyers
&quot;investigating&quot; this matter, yet never managed to get
around to asking the alleged perpetrator what had happened, nor
giving that person the right to self defense.
<P>
Yet CPB has never managed to explain precisely how the documents
got to the press, nor how management could justify the expenditure
of tax dollars <I>when no formal complaint of sexual harassment
had ever been filed. </I>This widely reported case is evidence
that there is something very wrong in public broadcasting, sufficiently
wrong that even thinking about funding for the year 1999 should
simply be postponed pending the outcome of an investigation into
how CPB treats such questions as allegations of sexual harassment,
and what efforts are made to preserve the privacy of personnel
files.
<P>
In addition, articles in the <I>Sunday Times of London</I> contained
allegations attributed to CPB officials which were later found
to be without a basis in fact against the First Lady. As of this
date, I have not been able to find out who made the charges, which
were characterized at the time by CPB board member Victor Gold
as part of a &quot;smear.&quot; Insofar as CPB is required to
maintain the integrity of news and current affairs programming
for PBS, NPR, and Pacifica, CPB should determine who was behind
this &quot;smear,&quot; and invoke appropriate sanctions. If CPB
will not do this, Congress has an obligation to investigate this
matter, which is a serious blemish on the character and trustworthiness
of public broadcasting.
<P>
Until such basic questions as those above have been fully answered
by CPB, it certainly should not receive any advanced appropriation.
There are two years for CPB to resolve these concerns by 1998,
when appropriations for 1999 are to be determined by Congress.
The intervening period should be used by Congress to fully exercise
its oversight responsibilities. I remain confident any reasonable
review will conclude that continued federal funding for the Corporation
for Public Broadcasting is unnecessary, unwise, and contrary to
the best interests of the American public and public broadcasting
itself.

<CENTER><H2>If They Only Knew Then What We Know Now About the AARP</H2></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><H3>by Terrence Scanlon</CENTER>
<CENTER>President, Capital Research Center</H3><BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
 When my parents joined the American Association of Retired Persons,
they thought like many seniors that they were getting affordable
supplemental health insurance, manageable credit card interest
rates and an attractive magazine.  But there is much more to the
AARP than most of its members know.  The AARP is a taxpayer-funded
lobbyist that actively promotes bigger government and, ultimately,
more spending on itself.<BR>
<P>
 The federal government uses tax-exempt, non-profit organizations
like AARP to run the thousands of programs that make up the welfare
state.  These groups receive, on average, about half their funding
from Uncle Sam.  These subsidies give them the clout to form a
&quot;shadow government&quot; inside the Washington Beltway to
lobby incessantly for more welfare programs, more regulation and
higher taxes.  AARP promotes rent control laws, raising the minimum
wage and increa sing the gasoline tax.  All these programs make
seniors more dependent on government.<BR>
<P>
 The AARP, the National Council of Senior Citizens (NCSC) and
dozens of lesser-known organizations that make up the seniors
lobby have become expert at using the elderly to build their own
power.<BR>
<P>
 For instance, in 1992 the federal government gave the AARP $86
million for senior employment and tax preparation programs.  Additionally,
because the AARP is a tax-exempt, non-profit organization, you
and I worked to make up the difference on the taxes the AARP did
not pay on the $191 million it earned in 1993 by selling insurance,
pharmaceuticals and auto-club services.  <BR>
<P>
 Another big recipient of federal funds is the National Council
of Senior Citizens (NCSC). In 1993, it received 96 percent of
its $76-million budget ($73 million) from the federal government.
 While this money can't legally be used for lobbying, taxpayers
still indirectly finance AARP and NCSC lobbying.  Money is &quot;fungible,&quot;
which is another way of saying that government dollars free-up
other dollars for lobbying.<BR>
<P>
 Recently, these two organizations raised their taxpayer-funded
voices loud enough to drown out reports on the coming bankruptcy
of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.  These are the three
federal programs on which the elderly rely most.  Trustees of
these programs report that America's aging population will spend
the money in their coffers faster than the smaller, working-age
population can re-fill them.  That leaves America with two alternatives
-- reduce benefits for the retired or increase taxes on workers.
<BR>
<P>
 If we raise taxes, the cost of Social Security and Medicare by
2040 will eat up an economy-busting 35-55 percent of every worker's
paycheck.  The 104th Congress decided instead to slow the rise
in Medicare benefits, proposing an increase from $4,800 per patient
in 1995 to $6,500 in 2001.  But AARP and NCSC shouted down this
attempt at true reform with bogus charges of &quot;cutting&quot;
benefits for enrollees.<BR>
<P>
 In its new book, <U>Frightening America's Elderly:  How the Age
Lobby Holds Seniors Captive</U>, Capital Research Center documents
how the seniors lobby promotes costly and inefficient government
programs, mandates and regulations while securing tax dollars
for itself.  Author Thomas diLorenzo alerts seniors that such
programs are bankrupting our country and jeopardizing their grandchildren's
futures without increasing their own security and independence.
<BR>
<P>
 The special interest lobbyists whose paychecks are tied to failed
welfare-state programs are stalling innovative reforms.  Americans,
young and old, need to know what they are doing.  <U>Frightening
America's Elderly</U> is the first step toward opening our eyes.
 I wish my parents had known then what I know now.<BR>

<center><H3>Preface<br>
by Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY)</H3></center>
<P>
<P>
<P>        Imagine for a moment a thriving business enterprise, pulling in annual revenues of hundreds 
of millions of dollars.  Imagine, too, that through a quirk in the law, this business pays none of the 
income taxes to which its competitors are subjected.  Exorbitant salaries and benefits are paid from 
this huge tax-free income, and employees work in splendor in an enormous palace complete with 
marble floors and every possible manner of technological luxury.
<P>        Let us also imagine that this business has also succeeded in becoming the most powerful 
lobbying force in Washington, completely dwarfing and dominating some of the more publicized 
groups such as the NRA, the NEA, or the Christian Coalition.  The surest measure of its success is 
the amount of federal spending which its lobbying has succeeded in persuading Washington to 
spend on its clients--in this case, the business's millions of loyal customers.  Year upon year, 
without exception, the largest increases in federal spending are awarded to those in the group, even 
to the point where the projections are that every penny of federal tax revenue will be awarded to 
them in the early 21st century.
<P>        Imagine as well that most of the customers of the business have little or no idea of what it is 
up to.  Suppose that many of the customers believe in limited government, and firmly and 
repeatedly say that they oppose continued escalations in tax rates.  Suppose that the executives 
controlling the business are aware that many of their customers either do not favor the huge 
escalation in federal spending which they are advocating, or are unaware of it.  Nonetheless, this 
influential business informs officeholders in the national government that failure to continue to 
increase spending in this manner will draw the united electoral wrath of the customers--33,000,000 
strong.
<P>        Now suppose that this business is favored each year with tens of millions of dollars in direct 
grants from the federal government.  The American taxpayer thus pays directly for the services 
purchased by the grants, activities which serve to spread the good name and reputation of our 
"hypothetical" business.
<P>        Ah, but--incredible though it may seem, there is such a business--the American Association 
of Retired Persons.  Only recently have many Americans come to understand what this group is 
really all about.  I have often referred to them as 33,000,000 people bound together by a common 
love of airline discounts--and insurance discounts--and pharmacy discounts.  Because, in my view, 
that is exactly who their members are--common, thoughtful, patriotic people who know a "pretty 
good deal" when they see one, and yet have no desire whatsoever to bankrupt the government, the 
nation, and their grandkids.
<P>        While I was serving on the President's Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax 
Reform, I was intrigued and perplexed by the testimony that the AARP presented before the 
Commission.  We showed the AARP representatives the clear and irrefutable data revealing that the 
federal government was headed towards extremities of debt, driven almost wholly by growth in 
spending on the AARP's membership (i.e., senior citizens.)  We sought the counsel of the AARP 
about just how to avoid the certainty of national ruin that resided in maintaining the status quo.  
They didn't bat an eye.  They not only defended every single penny of projected federal spending 
increases, but presented more demands for an additional trillion dollars in spending above that.  
They could just as easily have said, "Let them eat cake."
<P>        Mystified by the willful irresponsibility of this
organization, I determined to learn more about who they were and what was driving their activities. 
<P> I was intrigued to learn that most of the AARP's money did not come in the form of dues from the 
people it claimed to represent, hut rather from an enormous tax-free business empire.  I was 
absolutely flabbergasted to find that the federal government had given $86,000,000 in grants to this 
political behemoth in just the past year.
<P>        When I became Chairman of the Subcommittee on Social Security and Family Policy, I 
began to hold hearings into the nature of this beast.  A story began to unravel, of a complexity 
which I could not possibly track.  I had no special investigative staff and quickly found that there 
was no simple answer to the question, "What is the AARP?"
<P>        When asking about how it was founded and funded, we learned that its origin lay with a 
man who once had been stripped of his license to sell insurance and had hit upon this ingenious 
method of running an awesome insurance empire tax-free.  When asking about how AARP became 
hooked up with Prudential Insurance, we found that the precipitating event was a lawsuit involving 
a former AARP Executive Director who, after being sacked by the AARP, alleged various 
corruptions and illegalities in the relationship between AARP and Colonial Penn insurance, its 
previous carrier--all now well described, apparently, in sealed court records.
<P>        When we asked about AARP's advertisement of commercial products, we found that it 
repeatedly had been assessed penalties by the Postal Service for failing to pay the proper rates.  
When we asked about the purposes of federal grants to AARP, we found that the organization was 
providing "tax counseling" to senior citizens, while at the same time it was required to make a 
$135,000,000 payment in lieu of taxes to the IRS--for failure to adhere to our tax laws.  And the list 
went on, and on, and on.
<P>        I did not possess anything close to the resources necessary to get to the center of this 
labyrinth, and it is doubtful that anyone ever will.  I am told that the AARP is attempting to "turn 
over a new leaf," that it no longer wishes to be synonymous with ever-expanding government.  I 
certainly hope that is true.  During my hearings, the AARP was still claiming that its legislative 
stances were the product of careful consultation with its membership.  Yet at the same time, internal 
AARP polling data was showing us how the AARP was losing membership precisely because it 
was taking positions against balanced budgets and in favor of many massive new health care 
entitlements.  Those internal contradictions, I am told, are now being felt and fully addressed by the 
AARP itself.  In any event, let us hope that this is the case.
<P>        <I>Frightening Americas Elderly</I> provides a brief and valuable synopsis of the 
principal facts about the AARP and other seniors organizations.  As the possessor of a sizable stack 
of chaotic, random and disorganized material about the AARP, I commend Tom DiLorenzo and the 
Capital Research Center for condensing this serpentine tale into a direct and comprehensible tract.  
The reader will come away from this text knowing far more than even most AARP members do 
about the nature of that organization.
<P>        Our national motto is, "E pluribus unum"--"Out of many, one."  Our great strength as a 
nation has always been the openness and tolerance which has allowed us to transform a huge 
diversity of viewpoints into instruments of our great national interest.  But it is this forging of 
diversity into unity that is all-important.  When speaking to constituents, I am often compelled to 
remind them that "You are citizens first.  You are not Farm Bureau members first, or NEA 
members first, or journalists first, or NRA members first, or members of the AARP first.  You are 
citizens first!  Your first obligation is as a citizen of this nation, and every other membership is 
secondary."  
<P>        Too often in Washington, the voices we hear are the sum total of the special interests which 
have converged upon the nation's capital, drowning out the voice of the general interest of the 
American citizenry.  There are huge organizations devoted to protecting and defending the dollars 
being shipped to every imaginable organized constituency--and the more sympathetic the cause of 
the recipient, the easier the lobbying for it.  The elderly, the children, the middle class, the poor, the 
veterans--it seems there is no amount of money that Congress can spend on such groups that will 
grant it immunity from the charge of heartless cruelty to the downtrodden.
	We are now truly at a crossroads in American political history.  To continue to heed the hyperbolic, harsh and hyped rhetoric of one particular lobbying behemoth--the AARP--will spell mortal peril for the economic future of the nation.  The more we know 
mission, and structure, the better.  Accordingly, the descriptions that you are about to read are 
exceptionally important ones, and they provide critical knowledge relevant to any discussion about 
this country's budgetary priorities.  I trust that the gentle reader will find <I>Frightening Americas 
Elderly</I> most intriguing and informative!  Enjoy!

	If the Social Security and Medicare balance sheets were evaluated according to private-
sector accounting standards, both would be declared disastrously insolvent. -- Peter G. 
Peterson
<P>
<P>
<P>
	The "baby boomers"--the huge generation born between the late 1940s and mid-1960s--
have dominated America's commercial life for decades.  American business has long understood 
that the key to selling goods and services to this generation is to cater to its needs and preferences.  
The baby boomers have not only reshaped markets but have had a profound impact on our most 
enduring social and political institutions.
<P>        In the very near future, demographic trends will dictate that the interests and demands of 
baby boomers dominate government retirement and health policy, particularly Social Security and 
Medicare policy.  Together, Social Security and Medicare are the largest items in the federal 
budget: they account for about 34 percent of all federal expenditures and are projected to reach 39 
percent by 2005, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
<P>        Policymakers will have to face up to some unavoidable facts about the aging baby boomers 
and about the American population in general.  These realities will have a major impact on 
government retirement and health programs:
<UL>
	<LI> People are living longer.  In 1935, when the Social Security system was established, the 
average life expectancy was 61 years.  Today, it is 77 at birth and 82 if one reaches age 65.  Since 
the turn of the century, the number of Americans over 65 has increased almost elevenfold.  By 
contrast, the under-65 population only tripled during the last 100 years.  In 1900, one out of 25 
Americans was over 65; today the number is one in eight.  And the elderly population is expected 
to continue growing: a big jump will occur between 2005 and 2030 as the baby boomers reach 
retirement.  By 2025, as former U.S. Commerce Secretary Peter G. Peterson recently noted in the 
<I>Atlantic Monthly</I>, America will become "a nation of Floridas," with the proportion of all 
Americans who are elderly the same as the proportion of elderly in Florida today.
	<LI> In 1950, there were approximately 16 working-age Americans for every person over age 
65.  But by 2030, there will be just two working-age Americans for every person over 65.  Far 
fewer workers will have to support far more retirees if we continue to rely on the current Social 
Security and Medicare systems.
	<LI> The graying of America will increase demands on the health-care system, leading to much 
higher health-care costs if fundamental changes are not made to Social Security and Medicare.
	These trends, <I>Newsweek</I> recently noted, "doom Social Security and Medicare in 
their present form" because "the required tax burdens would be horrendous" and ultimately 
unacceptable to taxpayers.  With fewer taxpayers supporting more Social Security and Medicare 
recipients, either massive tax increases or significant benefit reductions will be necessary if these 
programs are left unchanged.  Peterson argues that if the system is not reformed, the cost of Social 
Security and Medicare by 2040 will take between 35 and 55 percent of every worker's paycheck 
"before we even start to pay for the rest of what government does.  Obviously, tax increases of this 
size would destroy the economy."  This kind of tax burden would also likely create 
"intergenerational warfare" as younger generations revolted against working half a year or more 
just to pay for the benefits of retirees.

<CENTER><H3>Fueling the Welfare State</H3></CENTER>
<P>
	In our book <I>Destroying Democracy: How Government Funds Partisan Politics</I>, 
economist James T. Bennett and I describe how the government uses thousands of tax-exempt 
nonprofit organizations to administer the myriad programs that comprise the welfare state.  These 
organizations receive on average about half their funding from government, and they form a 
"shadow government"--a virtual appendage of government--that lobbies incessantly for expanded 
welfare programs. Incredibly, much of this lobbying is funded either directly or indirectly with tax 
dollars.
<P>        The seniors lobby is typical of this phenomenon.  The American Association of Retired 
Persons (AARP), the National Council of Senior Citizens (NCSC), the Gray Panthers, and dozens 
of lesser-known organizations were created over the last few decades to ostensibly represent the 
concerns and interests of senior citizens.  But as this study will show, the so-called seniors lobby is, 
for the most part, a coalition of self-appointed activists favoring more government, more regulation, 
and higher taxes--all of which would increase seniors' dependence on government.  A vastly 
expanded government is not in the best interests of the elderly, but it <I>is</I> in the best financial 
and political interests of the seniors lobby.
<P>        This study describes how organizations comprising the seniors lobby promote costly and 
inefficient government programs, mandates, and regulations which they claim are the best way to 
meet the needs of seniors.  Their push for more government continues despite the worldwide 
failures of socialism and the welfare state.  Even democratic countries that have recently elected 
socialist governments--New Zealand is a notable example--are privatizing industries, cutting taxes, 
and discarding many once-sacrosanct welfare programs.  Other countries have abandoned 
government-run insurance programs and are developing creative alternatives that rely on free-
market competition and consumer choice to provide for the elderly.  Their policies, whose features 
can serve as models for U.S. reforms, are described in chapter six.
<P>        Reform-minded policymakers in the U.S. face powerful political opposition from the 
seniors lobby.  As James Bennett and I have shown in <I>Destroying Democracy</I>, entrenched 
special interests whose economic livelihood is tied to the continued expansion of failed welfare-
state programs are stalling innovative changes that are succeeding around the world.  These special 
interests have found it advantageous to organize themselves as tax-exempt, tax-deductible--and 
increasingly taxpayer-funded--nonprofit organizations.
<P>        This is the case with AARP, NCSC, and other seniors groups that have long been part of the 
Washington welfare establishment.  They devote enormous resources to fending off any efforts to 
fundamentally reform Social Security, Medicare, and other government programs.  Ignoring the 
consequences to future retirees, they seek to convince seniors and the public that these programs are 
financially sound and that any problems can be fixed by minor adjustments and tax increases.
<P>        Some of Social Security's most committed supporters have been honest enough to admit 
that it is essentially a Ponzi scheme.  They argue only that it is a darn good one!  Paul Samuelson, a 
Nobel laureate economist at MIT, argued back in 1967 that the "beauty" of Social Security is that 
"everyone who reaches retirement age is given benefit privileges that far exceed anything he has 
paid in [because] the national product is growing at compound interest and can be expected to do so 
for as far ahead as the eye cannot [<I>sic</I>] see. . . .  A <I>growing nation is the greatest Ponzi 
scheme ever contrived</I>" (emphasis added).6
<P>        Charles Ponzi, it should be recalled, was a finance and land speculator who in the 1920s 
gave investors the assurance that inexhaustible supplies of new money from future investors would 
guarantee high rates of return on earlier loans and purchases.  Of course, it all came tumbling down. 
<P> It may have appeared likely to Samuelson in 1967 that Social Security could also continue "as far 
ahead as the eye cannot see."  But America's population trends have changed everything: the annual 
report of the Social Security Trust Fund now projects that the system will be bankrupt by 2029 if it 
remains on its current path.  Medicare is on the same precarious financial course, and is projected to 
go bankrupt much earlier.
<P>        But none of this seems to matter to the seniors lobby.  Claiming that their own interests 
reflect the interests of tens of millions of seniors, organizations like AARP are quick to oppose 
policymakers who seek fundamental reform of programs for the aged.  They try to lull working-age 
Americans into complacency about the impending bankruptcy of Social Security and Medicare 
while frightening the elderly about constructive efforts to resolve the crisis.
<P>

<CENTER><H3>Outline</H3></CENTER>
<P>
	This study describes the agendas, activities, and funding of organizations that comprise the 
seniors lobby and analyzes the social and economic implications of their policy positions.  It 
focuses mostly on the activities of the larger and more established seniors groups since they are the 
most influential.
<P>        Chapter two focuses on the American Association of Retired Persons, specifically, the 
business practices of its $191,000,000-a-year money machine.  It questions whether any of AARP's 
commercial activities, from selling insurance to mutual funds, is appropriate for an organization 
that claims to be a charity.  Does Congress turn a blind eye to AARP's tax-exempt commercial 
businesses because AARP has powerful political ties and clout?
<P>        Chapter three also examines AARP, focusing on its tax-funded political agenda.  It 
describes how AARP lobbied for the failed Clinton health plan as well as for the catastrophic 
health-care plan that Congress enacted in 1989 and later repealed.  It also discusses AARP's efforts 
to dramatically raise taxes, increase government spending, and expand government programs that 
are demonstrably harmful.
<P>        Chapter four provides an overview of the activities and funding of the second most 
politically powerful seniors organization, the National Council of Senior Citizens (NCSC).  
Founded by the Democratic National Committee and AFL-CIO, NCSC received about 96 percent 
of its funding in 1993 from federal tax revenues.  It is less a seniors organization than a labor-union 
front whose political agenda mirrors that of the AFL-CIO--even when that agenda is odds with the 
best interests of most seniors.
<P>        Chapter five reviews the activities and funding of other prominent seniors organizations, 
including the National Council on the Aging, Families U.S.A., National Committee to Preserve 
Social Security and Medicare, Save Our Security Coalition, Older Women's League, and Gray 
Panthers.  These organizations share a dedication to tieing the well-being of seniors to an 
increasingly powerful federal government.
<P>        Not all seniors organizations promote welfare-state dependency for the elderly.  Chapter six 
discusses three groups--The Seniors Coalition, United Seniors Association, and the 60 Plus 
Association--that promote policies based on individual responsibility, consumer choice, free-market 
competition, and limited constitutional government as the best means for meeting the needs of 
seniors.  These organizations understand the seriousness of the financial problems facing Social 
Security and Medicare, and they are developing policy ideas that will guarantee benefits to current 
retirees while reducing the burden on younger generations.  Chapter six also examines the 
promising old-age insurance systems in Chile and Singapore and their implications for the U.S.
<P>        The graying of the baby boom generation will place unprecedented stress on both Social 
Security and Medicare.  As we stand on the threshold of the 21st century, we know that socialism 
and the welfare state have been colossal failures.  It is imperative that public policy for the aged be 
redesigned with this reality in mind.
<P>        Unfortunately, Washington, D.C.-based seniors organizations are defenders of the failed 
Great Society.  They have become a major stumbling block to reform.  If this study can persuade 
more Americans to question the failed ideologies that continue to govern public policy for the aged-
-policies that, if left unchallenged, will spoil the retirement years of the graying baby boomers--it 
will have achieved its purpose.
