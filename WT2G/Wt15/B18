<blockquote>
<i><B>Another Clinton Payback Owed</i> - Clinton Coordinated Closely
With </B>
<P>
<b>Unions During Government Shutdown</b><P>
Led by the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE),
the unions helped President Clinton develop his confrontational
strategy with Republicans over the budget, and were informed that
the shutdown, as well as a delay in increasing government's borrowing
authority, would not adversely impact government operations and
 social security,  or  other transfer payments.  At the same time,
the Treasury Dept. was telling the public exactly the opposite.
 According to an April 1, <I><B>Washington Times</B></I> story,
the AFGE did not tell members about Treasury's use of retirement
funds.  Instead it sent weekly alerts to its members warning about
the default's &quot;danger.&quot;
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>The Reich Report: Mixed Messages</B></i>
<P>
Is the U.S. economy creating high-wage or dead-end jobs?  The
answer depends on what soil Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich is
standing.
<P>
In France earlier this month, Reich defended the 8.4 million jobs
that have been created while the Clinton Administration has been
in office.  Apparently, Europeans are under the impression that
these are low-skilled and low-wage jobs.  He and the Administration
boasted that &quot;the fastest growing job categories in the U.S.
are the highest paying ones...60 percent of those new jobs are
high-wage positions in areas such as finance, telecommunications,
and other high-tech areas.&quot;
<P>
At home, Reich follows the union cue and bemoans the &quot;anxious
class&quot; fearful of dead-end jobs.  The Labor Secretary's friends
at the AFL-CIO dictate a similar message.  A union resolution
declares:  &quot;Loaded with debt... threatened with downsizing
and outsourcing, and a growing pool of low-wage, no-benefit contingent
labor, American workers are frustrated, anxious and angry.&quot;
 
<P>
Except for some unwarranted credit taking, Reich was on the ball
while in France.  The next time he speaks on the issue in the
U.S., employers hope he speaks as glowingly about American jobs
as he does overseas.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>The Corporate Campaign: USA Today, Now More Than Ever</B></i>
<P>
It's official, reading<I><B> USA Today</B></I> is now politically
incorrect.  Top union boss John Sweeney has ordered unionists
not to buy or advertise in the national newspaper because its
owner, Gannett Publishing, has refused to yield to union demands
in Detroit.  A similar &quot;Do Not Buy&quot; order went out against
<I><B>The Miami Herald</B></I>, the flagship paper of Knight-Ridder.
<P>
The much publicized union strike against the<I><B> Detroit Free
Press</B></I> and <I><B>Detroit News</B></I> is going into its
ninth month.  Undaunted by formal complaints by the government
and by legal action arising out of the strikers' campaign of violence,
the union hopes to broaden public awareness of their dispute.
 As AFL-CIO leader Richard Trumka vowed last month, &quot;We will
be moving on a rather nationwide basis to expose what Gannett
is doing to workers in Detroit.&quot;
<P>
The unions have recently gone into competition with the Detroit
papers by publishing their own &quot;Sunday Journal&quot; for
which they are soliciting advertisers.  No doubt the real Detroit
newspapers are not worried about the new weekly.  With union work
rules, featherbedding, and grievance procedures, it is highly
unlikely that the strikers' &quot;Sunday Journal&quot; will turn
a profit in this lifetime.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>Labor Chat - Spiked AFL-CIO Survey From '94 Resurfaces on the
Internet</B></i>
<P>
According to a 1994 posting on Labor Talk, an on-line newsgroup
through the Institute for Global Communications, a '94 survey
commissioned by the AFL-CIO was too embarrassing to share with
the public - or its own members for that matter.
<P>
The survey, &quot;Being Heard,&quot; included these findings:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Of the 4 out of 5 Americans living in non-union households,
only 29% have positive feelings about unions, 39% negative, and
32% neutral.
<P>
<li> Only 25% feel that unions are concerned about all working
people - 65% say that unions are concerned only about their members.
</ul>
<P>
The authors of the report, a pro-labor consulting firm, also concluded
that the unions were perceived as &quot;undemocratic institutions,&quot;
increasingly irrelevant, and &quot;outdated, old-fashioned, hidebound
guardians of the status quo.&quot;  According to the Labor Talk
article, the report was published on March 21, 1994.
<P><a name="five"></a>
<i><B>Union Money Making &quot;Fad&quot;</B></i>
<P>
Like a sponge to water, organized labor has taken to soaking money
from the U.S. Treasury.  According to the Federal Assistance Awards
Data System (FAADS), unions receive over $39 million per year
in grants through not-for-profit organizations, and the U.S. Department
of Labor.  The following unions and their affiliates were some
of the recipients during 1993-1994:
<P><pre>
AFL-CIO    				$2,038,000
<P>
AFSME       				$148,000
<P>
American Fed of Teachers     		$143,000
<P>
American Nurses Assoc.        		$965,000
<P>
Int'l Assoc of Machinists  		$1,770,000
<P>
National Education Assoc.       	$385,000
<P>
Teamsters       			$3,542,000
<P>
Service Employees Int'l Union		$137,000
<P>
United Auto Workers            		$805,000
<P>
United Brotherhood of Carpenters	$257,000

<blockquote>
<i><B>Pressure from the Pressmen</B></i>
<P>
The Clinton National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has shown its
prounion colors, judging from a recent Court of Appeals decision.
 It appears that the union-packed NLRB has forgotten the violence
that marked the 1985 strike against the <I>Chicago Tribune</I>
stirred by the hiring of replacement workers.  The strike ended
in 1986, and by May, 1989 the process of reinstating striking
workers was well on the way.  The Pressman's union has since been
seeking the names and the addresses of replacement workers who
are still employed at the <I>Tribune.</I>
<P>
The NLRB ordered the <I>Tribune</I> to furnish the names and addresses
of replacement employees to the union on the basis that the &quot;passage
of five years since the violence tilted the balance in favor of
disclosure.&quot;   A ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Seventh Circuit has however, refused to enforce the NLRB order.
 Violence against replacement workers during the strike included
tire slashing, death threats, as well as the stabbing of a delivery
driver. 
<P>
The <I>Tribune</I> offered to conduct a third party mailing to
the replacement workers, would permit communications during nonwork
times, the posting of union notices on company bulletin boards
and allow distribution of union notices in nonwork areas.  Replacement
employees could also choose to provide the union with their own
address.  This was not good enough though for the union or its
supporters on the Labor Board. The federal court disagreed with
both the NLRB and the union to ensure employee protections.
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>Whose Rights Are They Anyway? </B></i>
<P>
Employees have the right to object to union political activities,
but it is illegal for employers to tell them so.  That is the
argument behind a complaint filed by the General Counsel of the
Labor Board against nursing home operator Beverly Enterprises.
<P>
The company has been cited for breaking labor laws by notifying
employees of their rights under the Supreme Court's <U>Beck</U>
decision.  That case recognized the right to object to paying
the portion of compulsory union dues which is spent on political
causes opposed by the employee.
<P>
The Clinton NLRB recently ruled that unions are not required by
law to give their members effective notice of their <U>Beck</U>
rights.  If the Labor Board is successful in its case against
Beverly, employers will be prohibited from letting their employees
in on this secret.  That leaves to Clinton appointees the task
of spreading the word about rights the unions oppose.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>No Minority Rights</B></i>
<P>
Like all democratic institutions, union bosses are supposed to
represent the views of their constituents - the dues paying members.
 So if a large share of union members vote Republican, the elected
union officials pay heed, right?
<P>
You be the judge.  A recent Communications Workers of America
(CWA) union poll showed that its members favored President Clinton
over Bob Dole by 53% to 27%.  The union's executive council unanimously
endorsed the Clinton-Gore ticket.  CWA President Mort Bahr says
&quot;our jobs is to make sure the 53% [favoring Clinton] stays.&quot;
 Bahr is also reported to have charged his members to work for
the election of  Democrats to the U.S. House in an effort to recapture
the chamber.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>Attention Blue Light Shoppers -</B></i>
<br>
<B>Campaign Targets K-mart</B>
<P>
One of America's retail giants is experiencing a text book corporate
campaign.  The target: Kmart.  Unions are working every angle
to convert productive employees of the company into dues paying
members so they can attack every level of the company's operations.
<P>
The International Brotherhood of Teamsters and Union of Needletrades
Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE) are seeking employee
representation on the company's board of directors.  They are
also pressing for annual board elections for all directors and
the elimination of retirement plans for nonemployee directors.
 The unions believe that their representation on the board will
also improve Kmart's stock value. 
<P>
The Teamsters represent a small percentage of Kmart employees
and own 500,000 shares of the company's stock.  UNITE is currently
seeking to organize over 500 Kmart employees in Greensboro, NC.
 Last fall, the union made allegations of discriminatory employment
practices and instituted a consumer boycott - standard tactics
in corporate campaigns.
<P>
The unions are backing Stephen Hester for Kmart's board.  Hester's
speciality is  employee stock ownership programs, and he is credited
with helping unionized employees of Northwest Airlines gain stock
ownership and representation on its board of directors.
<P>
The Teamsters and UNITE blame the lack of  an  independent voice
on the board of directors for the decline in Kmart's stock value.
 They see Kmart competitor, Wal-Mart, gaining  a significant share
of the market.  No doubt when the unions decide to take on non-union
Wal-Mart, they will  conclude that Wal-Mart's competitive edge
could vastly improve with union representation.

<blockquote>
<B>Sweeney Youth to be Trained for &quot;Union Summer&quot;</B>
<P>
AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney wants to train members of the
MTV generation to be union activists.  Desperate for new dues-paying
members, he has devised a plan to recruit the children of existing
members - and other young people - into service this summer. 
Participants will promote the joys of union membership under the
guise of social justice.
<P>
The three-month boot camp, called &quot;Union Summer,&quot; will
immerse young recruits in union rhetoric, teach the the principles
of union activism and put them to work on organizing campaigns
and union projects around the country.
<P>
In a recruitment flyer for &quot;Union Summer,&quot; the AFL-CIO
asks prospects to &quot;join hundreds of workers and students
making history.  Spend three weeks in the streets and neighborhoods,
organizing for workplace rights and social justice.  Make this
a summer America will never forget!&quot;
<P>
&quot;Union Summer&quot; applications are currently being accepted.
 Applicants are asked to &quot;describe a defining moment or life
experience that relates to your desire to fight injustice.&quot;
<P><a name="two"></a>
<B>New Clinton Payback Revealed</B>
<P>
In a recent address before the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, House
Republican Conference Chairman, John Boehner (R-OH) revealed President
Clinton's latest payback to organized labor.  According to Boehner,
just two weeks before receiving big labor's endorsement, Bill
Clinton &quot;instructed the government's personnel office to
proved labor unions with the home addresses of all federal employees
in bargaining units - whether or not they are union members.&quot;
<P>
<I><B>Labor Watch</B></I> pondered the potential uses of this
data:  re-elect Clinton campaign, political literature, mailings
of related union propaganda, and personal visits to the homes
of nonmembers.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<B>Cookie Monsters: Tales from the Corporate Campaign Front</B>
<P>
The St. Louis Girl Scouts are the latest target of a union corporate
campaign.  Members of an electrical workers union local have threatened
a boycott, and are picketing two Girl Scout camps in Eastern Missouri
after a nonunion electrical contractor was awarded the work for
major renovations and construction at the camps.
<P>
Building and Construction Trades Council officials have warned
the area executive director of the detrimental impact upon her
organization over its failure to use union contractors.  She agreed
to try to change the decision.  The pickets remain camped out
while awaiting the final outcome, and plans to put the Girl Scouts
on the unions' &quot;We Do Not Patronize&quot; list were put on
hold.
<P>
The question remains as to whether union officials will issue
the ultimate boycott - a refusal to buy Girl Scout cookies.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<B>Union Backing</B>
<P>
A kindler, gentler union movement?  You decide.  Richard Trumka,
AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer, recently whipped the Pennsylvania
union conventioneers into a frenzy with this rallying cry:  &quot;Our
message is that unions are back.  Get in our way and we'll knock
you flat on your (expletive).&quot;
<P><a name="five"></a>
<B>&quot;Government Stewardship&quot; of Unions  Lousy Says Union
Members</B>
<P>
Even Teamsters complain that government can't run anything right.
 In response to petitions from 12,000 rank-and-file members of
the union, two Members of Congress are seeking a review of the
effectiveness of the Independent Review Board (IRB), which oversees
the operation of the nation's largest labor organization.
<P>
In a consent decree with the Justice Department, the IRB was formed
in 1989 to root out organized crime within the Teamsters and monitor
its financial affairs.  Reps. Michael Flanagan (R-IL) and William
Lipinski (D-IL) report that union members &quot;contend the union's
financial condition has worsened in its years under government
stewardship&quot; and have called for an investigation.
<P><a name="six"></a>
<B>Rights on the Left</B>
<P>
Some Rights are more right than others, in the union mindset.
 Beating the union drum at the March 25 AFL-CIO convention in
Washington, Vice President Gore blasted Republicans and demonstrated
the Administration's affinity with Big Labor as he declared: &quot;To
them, the right to strike is a luxury...but to us the right to
strike is a right.&quot;
<P>
The right to work, on the other hand, is considered an unsavory
concept by the AFL-CIO.  National Right to Work is high on their
hit list of proposed legislation in these days of frantic efforts
to shore up dwindling union rolls.  If workers could no longer
be forced to join unions in order to keep their jobs, the decline
in union membership might just go into freefall.

<blockquote>
<i><B>Another Clinton Payback - &quot;Prevailing Waste&quot;</B></i>

<P>
&quot;We were caught abetting fraud and incompetence, so give
us more money.&quot; That is the unmistakable message from the
Labor Department as it tries to explain a request to spend $3.75
million more to administer the Davis-Bacon Act.
<P>
Last year the Department of Labor stonewalled every effort to
expose fraud in the calculation of &quot;prevailing wages&quot;
which federal government contractors must pay under the Davis-Bacon
Act. Until pressure came to bear, the Department refused to provide
access to public documents or even to disclose the names of union
officials who submitted bogus data - data which the DOL says it
relies on to calculate wages. Without the dogged determination
of Oklahoma Commissioner of Labor, Brenda Reneau, who uncovered
the fraud, and the outrage of Reps. Cass Ballenger (R-NC) and
Pete Hoekstra (R-MI), the federal Department would have denied
any problems existed.
<P>
In an investigation by Reneau and her staff, it was found that
&quot;certain parties&quot; submitted bogus projects to the DOL
including inflated wage rates of ghost employees.
<P>
This week the DOL admits in the Clinton Budget that &quot;the
current [wage determination] system's reliance on the 'third party'
data submissions has recently exposed the vulnerability to manipulation
through submission of false or selective data, and raises serious
questions about the accuracy of some of the wage determinations
that are issued.&quot;
<P>
The Labor Department's answer to those questions: Pour about $4
million more into the black hole of Davis-Bacon. In the near future
ABC t.v. program<I> 20/20</I> will air a special report on Davis-Bacon.
Investigative reporter, John Stossel produced the segment.
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>BIG LABOR'S REAL AGENDA: </i>
<br>Clinton Appointee Fired for
Aiding a Corporate Campaign - Big Labor-Big Government Incestuous
Relationship Exposed</B> 
<P>
A top Department of Labor (DOL) appointee has been forced from
office because of his efforts to abet a union's corporate campaign.
Richard Sawyer, Labor Secretary Reich's chief representative in
the West, lost his job March 8 for contacting Hewlett-Packard
Co - threatening the company that the DOL would seize its products
- because its janitorial service, (which the Service Employees
union are attempting to organize) was &quot;going to get caught
doing bad things eventually.&quot; Mr. Sawyer is a former Service
Employees International Union (SEIU) local president.
<P>
The target of the corporate campaign was Somers Building Maintenance
in Sacramento, California. Board member for the company, Randy
Schraber, said, &quot;We were the subject of wrongdoing, and we're
pleased to see that it won't happen to another company.&quot;
<P>
Rep. Pete Hoekstra (R-MI) had investigated the incident and concluded
that Mr. Sawyer had &quot;disclosed investigative information
which was damaging to Somers,&quot; and &quot;influenced the Department
of Labor's Wage &amp; Hour Division in an attempt to intimidate
Somers into recognizing the union.&quot; After Hoekstra made Sawyer's
action public, the DOL was forced to oust the presidential appointee.
<P>
An Inspector General's (IG) report investigating the California
incident confirms allegations that Sawyer threatened Hewlett-Packard.
The report also showed that no actions had been taken against
Somers in regards to charges that they violated wage and hour
laws. Half of California's wage and hour investigators had been
assigned to the Somer's case. According to Mr. Schraber, the investigators
found that the janitorial company actually <I>overpaid</I> its
workers between $300 - $600.
<P>
SEIU has quickly come to the defense of Sawyer by mobilizing California's
unions in a lobbying effort aimed at President Clinton and Reich
on his behalf. Hoekstra's subcommittee is planning to hold hearings
on the DOL's political motivation behind the Somer's incident
and other cases. The subcommittee will also look into alleged
politicization of OSHA and the National Labor Relations Board.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>AFL-CIO TO MEET IN WASHINGTON - </B></i>
<br>
<B>CLINTON ENDORSEMENT, SWEENEY TAX LIKELY</B> 
<P>
The AFL-CIO is expecting over 500 union delegates to gather at
the Capitol Hilton in Washington, D.C. next week. The union leaders
are expected to endorse President Clinton's reelection bid, and
ratify a special assessment on each union member to help subsidize
AFL-CIO Chief Sweeney's political and organizing agenda. Central
Council leaders will hold meetings on Sunday, March 24, and state
federation delegates will meet through Tuesday, March 26.
<P>
A key agenda item is the 15 cents monthly fee that each union
member will be charged, adding $2 million per month to union coffers.
The funds will go to pay for a $35 million dollar &quot;grassroots
campaign&quot; to heavily promote unions, as well as subsidize
an ongoing series of political ads targeting freshman Republican
members of Congress for elimination in this fall's elections.
The funds will also be used to step up the use of corporate campaigns.
Unions hope that the campaign will rally support for their political
agenda and establish a permanent pool of 100 union grassroots
activists in each Congressional district.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>Time Out for Teamsters</B> </i>
<P>
Grand theft is a felony which carries hefty prison terms and loss
of voting rights for life; but for Teamsters bosses, it brings
a one-year suspension. That is the penalty imposed by Teamsters
President Ron Carey against three Minnesota Teamsters officials
who were guilty of embezzling funds from their local.
<P>
In addition to their suspension, the three will be barred from
holding any Teamster office for two years. A fourth official was
permanently barred from membership or holding office, and all
must share in fines totalling $189,000.
<P>
An internal report by a court-appointed Independent Review Board
found numerous questionable practices, including selling union
cars at markedly discounted rates, and charging members fees to
attend their own union meetings.

<i><B>The Reich Report</B></i>
<P>
Labor Secretary Robert Reich touts &quot;corporate responsibility&quot;
on the speaking circuit, but it appears he has been a little more
than irresponsible with taxpayer dollars.  According to a <I>Wall
Street Journal</I> article, the Joint Committee on Printing (JCP)
contends that  Reich sidestepped federal guidelines by rushing
a printing job to an all-night copying service without &quot;prior
approval.&quot;  The JCP has rejected Reich's request to pay Kinko's
of Washington for the unapproved printing job.  Labor officials
finished President Clinton's &quot;Middle-Class Bill of Rights&quot;
too late they say to have the Government Printing Office (GPO)
do the job - the document was ready for printing late in the evening
on the eve of the State of the Union address last year.  The 18-page
document will reportedly cost taxpayers $31,380 - if Kinko's ever
gets paid - compared to the GPO price of $500.  Rep. Pete Hoekstra,
chairman of the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation
is apparently outraged by the waste.  The Labor Department contends
that the incident is turning into &quot;something political.&quot;
 
<P>
Perhaps the &quot;Middle-Class Bill of Rights&quot; should have
included a section on the responsible use of tax dollars by government
officials who portend to represent the hard-working middle class.

<i><B>BIG LABOR'S REAL AGENDA:</i><br>CORPORATE CAMPAIGN TARGET FIGHTS BACK
- VICTORIOUS OVER SEIU MILITANT TACTICS</B>
<P>
A Washington, D.C. jury may have stopped  a local Justice for
Janitors &quot;in-your-face&quot; campaign in its tracks.  The
decision may have an effect on similar cases nationwide according
to the winning attorney.
<P>
On October 21, 1993, Justice for Janitors invaded the headquarters
of United States Service Industries, Inc. (USSI), a janitorial
company that cleans office buildings in the D.C. area.  The nationwide
Janitors' campaign is the brainchild of former Service Employees
International Union (SEIU) leader John Sweeney who now heads the
AFL-CIO.  
<P>
According to a press statement released by USSI, Justice for Janitors
assaulted an officer of the corporation, and kept employees imprisoned
for several hours preventing them from leaving the building. 
<P>
Three USSI employees sued.  The Union settled with one employee,
and the other two went to trial.  A jury found there was an assault
and battery, as well as false imprisonment of both employees.
 One employee was awarded $1,000, and the other $2,000 in compensatory
damages by a jury verdict on March 11, 1996.  In addition, $30,000
in punitive damages were awarded on March 13, 1996, as a result
of clear and convincing evidence that the union demonstrators
were motivated by ill-will and willful disregard for the rights
of others.
<P>
USSI attorney, Joel Keiler, believes that future activities of
this kind could result in much larger punitive awards.  Keiler
also believes that individuals and companies nationwide will use
this verdict in their impending lawsuits, as will many of those
who were trapped by demonstrating SEIU &quot;Janitors&quot; who
blocked traffic on the 14th Street Bridge and the Roosevelt Bridge
in Washington, D.C.  last year.

<i> <B>NLRB's Gould Continues Campaign For Single-Site Rule</B></i>
<P>
Earlier this week in Tampa, Fla., National  Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) Chairman William Gould continued pushing for his proposed
single-site facility rule - a rule designed to help unions more
easily organize small businesses, and single units of multifacility
businesses such as fast-food restaurant chains.
<P>
The single-site rule would be a boon for AFL-CIO chief John Sweeney,
who wants to make good on his promise to more aggressively and
successfully organize the largely non-union service sector.  The
single-site rule applies one-size-fits-all standards to organizing,
applying illegitimate union organizing preferences over legitimate
market and business issues.  Opposition from the Republican Congress
and the business community has been fierce on the issue, but Gould
predicted that the NLRB would prevail.

<b><i>How</i> NOT <i>to Win Friends and Influence People</B></i>
<P>
Hoping to unionize thousands of Kaiser Permanente workers in North
Carolina, organized labor in that state has joined regulators
in denouncing the quality of care provided by the big HMO.  Criticizing
the product a company manufacturers may work in the case of bluejeans,
but a fatal flaw exists in the union's strategy  of attacking
the delivery of health care.  The unions are criticizing  the
very people they hope to organize - the HMO health care workers.
<P>
Of course, a &quot;fair&quot; contract is the cure prescribed
by the labor bosses.  They also hope it will undue any public
relations damage caused by the unions' smear campaign against
Kaiser Permanente workers.

<i><B>Minimum Wage Campaigns Take Off in the States</B></i>
<P>
As part of their multi-faceted election-year strategy to galvanize
union members to the polls, labor unions and allied groups are
aggressively attempting to put minimum wage increase initiatives
on the ballot in the upcoming November elections.  The AFL-CIO
is leading the signature gathering charge in most states with
the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN)
lending a hand.  Signature drives are up and running in Arizona,
California, Idaho, Missouri, Montana, and Oregon - with other
states targeted for activity soon.
<P>
On March 25, the AFL-CIO will hold a special meeting in Washington,
DC to kick-off their &quot;America Needs a Raise&quot; road show
(while at the same time increasing their own rank-and-file union
membership dues.)  The 29-city tour will promote the minimum wage
issue.  States that are currently considering starting wage increases
in state legislatures are also targeted for a campaign stop. 
For a complete listing of efforts to increase the starting wage
at the state and local level, contact Ren&eacute;e Stikes at 202-785-0238.
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>Old Salt</B></i>
<P>
The career of the new chief organizer for the AFL-CIO, Richard
Bensinger, proves that unions are doing nothing new.  They're
just more blatant about it.
<P>
In the 1970's, while working as a paid union organizer, Bensinger
went undercover at a nonunion apparel plant in Colorado.  He was
quickly promoted into management, and was able to feed the union
valuable information on the company's response strategy to an
organizing campaign.
<P>
Today's unions, particularly those in the construction industry,
forego undercover work and opt instead to smother nonunion competition.
 The so-called &quot;salting campaign&quot; orders union members
to (1) apply for work at the target company, (2) make clear their
union affiliation, (3) organize other workers, if hired, (4) file
NLRB charges if not hired, (5) lure away good employees to work
for union contractors, and (6) generally create bedlam and other
problems on the job site - all at the direction of the union.
<P>
Bensinger is now directing the salting scheme nationwide that
he perfected in Colorado 20 years ago.  He serves as Deputy Director
of the AFL-CIO Organizing Institute.
<P>
Bensinger was quoted recently as saying: &quot;We're not crazy
radicals out to destroy a company; we're into cooperating with
a company...&quot;
<P>
The Electrical Workers are a little more honest about the real
purpose of salting campaigns: &quot;to threaten or actually apply
the economic pressure necessary to  cause the employers to...raise
his prices to recoup additional costs, scale back his business
activities, leave the union jurisdiction, go out of business,
and so on.<I> (IBEW Union Organizer Manual) </I>
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>BIG LABOR'S REAL AGENDA: Palming Off Jobs </B></i>
<P>
<B> An Update From the Corporate Campaign Front</B>
<P>
Anywhere but in labor relations, barely mustering a support rate
of 14% is considered an abysmal failure.  But the Palm Restaurant
of Boston knuckled under to &quot;public pressure&quot; when 27
of 200 local celebrities refused to let their caricatures be hung
on the eatery's walls due to union complaints.
<P>
<I>Labor Watch</I> readers may recall this latest corporate campaign
which discovered this  particular victim's unique charm and sought
to destroy it.  The restaurant's well-known &quot;wall of fame&quot;
honors local notables as its feature attraction.  Construction
unions waged their anti-caricature campaign because they were
offended that the restaurant selected an open shop contractor
who bid 38% below the union competition.
<P>
Of the 200 celebrities offered spots on the restaurant walls,
only 27 - or less than 14%  - sided with the union and refused
to participate.  One of those sympathizers, Boston Mayor, Thomas
Merino, negotiated a deal that requires the restaurant to rebid
up to $100,000 of work using union workers.  All future work is
slated to go to union firms.  Even as the country approaches the
21st century, organized labor continues to demonstrate that an
aggressive minority - 15% union membership in the work force,
14% of celebrities - can overcome market and economic logic.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>Sweeny Predicts</B></i>
<P>
&quot;If Affirmative Action goes down, Davis-Bacon, the Service
Contract Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act and the minimum wage
bill will all follow,&quot; said AFL-CIO boss John Sweeney to
Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition.  Now those fighting labor's
agenda know where to start.
<P><a name="five"></a>
<i><B>The Check is Not in the Mail</B></i>
<P>
What is it about the Post Office that promotes antisocial behavior?
 Postal union presidents are lambasting Postmaster General Marvin
Runyon in the harshest of terms for &quot;stingily, crassly, and
greedily&quot; postponing a cost of living increase for two weeks.
 The amount withheld from employee paychecks?  Four dollars.
<P>
Postal worker unions typically tie up the legal system by filing
petty complaints - amounting to 7% of the National Labor Relation
Board's entire case load. Forget the rain, sleet, and dark of
night ... a national grievance over a delayed increase of $4.00
is now worth halting mail delivery. 
<P><a name="six"></a>
<i><B>AP Study Finds Unions Abuse OSHA</B></i>
<P>
Employee complaints to OSHA increase during labor unrest, according
to an extensive Associated Press (AP) analysis.  Over a third
of job site inspections prompted by complaints at unionized facilities
turn up no violations at all, says the AP study.  Complaints filed
by nonunion workers are more likely to lead to real safety problems
the study concludes.

<blockquote>
<i><B>Another Clinton Payback - When Even 99% Is Not Enough</B></i>
<P>
The AFL-CIO is complaining about a recent decision by the Clinton
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) which went 99% of the way
to gutting important employee protections from union abuses. 
Eight years after the Supreme Court ruled that workers <U>cannot
be forced </U>to pay for the political activities of unions, the
Board issued its first interpretation of the so-called <U>Beck</U>
decision.  Except in the clearest form of political bankrolling,
according to the NLRB, unions are free to spread out their costs
among all members.
<P>
What has the unions so upset is the one part of the case that
went against them.  As AFL-CIO attorney Jon Hiatt said: &quot;Perhaps
the most significant - and distressing - aspect of the decision
is the holding that unions have a legal obligation to affirmatively
tell employees that they do not have to become union members.&quot;
 
<P>
<B>The unions are outraged that employees must be informed that
union membership is a choice, not a mandate.</B>
<P>
National Right-to-Work Committee spokesman Tom McCorville had
these comments regarding the real victims of the case:
<P>
&quot;A string of Supreme Court precedents have been ignored.
 Instead, the Clinton-appointed NLRB has genuflected to Big Labor
in an election year - when employees are most in need of protection
against forced dues politicking.  As far as Big Labor's forced-dues
funded political activities goes, it's business as usual.&quot;
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>The High Price of a Sweeney Presidency</B></i>
<P>
AFL-CIO head John Sweeney promised to spend $35 million on political
activity this year to reportedly &quot;defeat Republicans,&quot;
but he never said where the money was going to come from.  It
now appears that Sweeney's &quot;American Needs a Raise&quot;
campaign will probably come out of the pockets of the rank-and-file
membership.
<P>
The high price of Sweeney's new campaign is in need of a new &quot;spending
stream.&quot; Consequently, a special convention has been called
for in late March to approve a new &quot;assessment&quot; on each
union member to subsidize Sweeney's political action agenda. 
The new &quot;Sweeney Tax&quot; is expected to cost members 15
cents per month (generating $20 million).  Each affiliated union
is expected to kick in a contribution as well.
<P>
Sweeney promised to recruit hundreds of thousands of new members
to invigorate the labor movement.  But it looks like he's going
back to the trough to further milk the rank-and-file membership
in order to subsidize an uninspiring union agenda.  
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>BIG LABOR'S Real Agenda: Creating Some Havoc</B></i>
<P>
<B>Tales from the Corporate Campaign Front</B>
<P>
The following is the first installment in a case study on how
unions today try to crush those companies that fail to cave in
to their demands.  The case - the seven month old Detroit newspaper
strike.
<P>
Until now, the strike against the <I>Detroit Free Press</I> and
the <I>Detroit News</I> has utilized anticipated tactics:  replacement
workers have been terrorized, advertisers have been intimidated,
and NLRB charges have flowed.  The unions have proudly declared
that the newspaper companies have lost substantial amounts of
money, fostered bad will in the community, and the loss of newspaper
circulation will take a long time to rebuild.
<P>
The unions are now exploring ways to &quot;create some havoc -
to find leverage...,&quot; says Teamsters boss Ron Carey. Lately,
activists have been distributing propaganda at the headquarters
of <I>Detroit Free Press</I> parent Knight-Ridder, and its own
flagship paper, <I>The Miami Herald</I>.  Actions against <I>Detroit
News</I> owner Gannett are being promised at its <I>USA Today</I>
headquarters in suburban Washington.  As AFL-CIO leader Rich Trumka
vowed, &quot;We will be moving on a rather nationwide basis to
expose what Gannett is doing to workers in Detroit.&quot; 
<P>
What those moves will be is an indication of how far organized
labor will go in the 1990s to preserve featherbedding and other
rampant union abuses.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>Achy Breaky Kneecaps</B></i>
<P>
Billy Ray Cryus' dad is living his own version of the country
singer's smash hit, &quot;Achy Breaky Heart.&quot;  Ron Cyrus
has a number of jobs.  The senior Cyrus is the head of the Kentucky
AFL-CIO, a state Representative for Flatwoods, and Chairman of
the Labor &amp; Industry Committee in the state legislature.
<P>
Ron's latest opus is a bill to prohibit employers from hiring
permanent replacements during strikes in the strike-happy state.
 Billy Ray may make his fans swoon, but Dad appears satisfied
with bringing companies to their knees.
<P><a name="five"></a>
 <i><B>Command and Control Corporate Welfare</B></i>
<P>
Senate Democrats unleashed a set of proposals this week to appease
every ally of their party, while providing a boost to themes echoed
by Labor Secretary Robert Reich and - not surprisingly - principles
found within Labor's &quot;America Needs a Raise&quot; campaign.
<P>
The plan, called &quot;Building Allies for America's Working Families,&quot;
links business tax cuts and de-regulation to liberal, anti-business
precepts of class warfare, and statist ideals of  &quot;corporate
social responsibility.&quot;  Of course, the program is saturated
with union promotion.
<P>
In order to qualify for a tax cut, a company must limit CEO pay,
participate in a collectively bargained (union) pension plan utilizing
an employee trustee, invest in employee training on an ongoing
basis, and meet other standards that (for the most part) give
unions and the government control of participating businesses.
 The &quot;Building Allies&quot; program not only echoes AFL-CIO
themes, but is an integral part of the union's rebuilding effort.
 That is why &quot;Building Allies,&quot; in the name of economic
policy to help the struggling middle-class, also calls for treble
damages and debarment against businesses that violate labor laws.
<P>
As one commentator remarked, &quot;'Building Allies' is simply
more public relations gloss on the &quot;Unions Need a Boost&quot;
campaign by the new AFL-CIO leadership.

The AFL-CIO has set March 25th for its vote on whether to endorse
President Clinton for reelection.
<P><a name="two"></a>
 <B>A Dose of Democracy - Send in the U.N.?</B>
<P>
The Laborers International Union has a rich history of corruption.
 The Justice Department thinks it can change that with a healthy
dose of democracy.  The union has agreed to its first rank-and-file
election of officers, scheduled for September.
<P>
The Laborers leadership agreed to reforms in order to rid the
union of its tainted past of corruption and links to organized
crime, and to avoid a government takeover of its operations. 
The old system was so fraught with cronyism and fraud that a federal
overseer must now spend months devising election rules, teach
union members how to exercise rights they did not previously enjoy,
and monitor 500 local meetings where convention delegates are
selected.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>BIG LABOR'S Real Agenda:</B></i>
<P>
<B>Corporate Campaign Exposed</B>
<P>
Apparently organized labor's concerted effort to bring corporate
America to its knees devolves to the downright petty.  Construction
unions in Boston are trying to shame the Palm Restaurant into
paying prix fixe when a la carte makes more sense.
<P>
The unions are not picketing the site of the new restaurant. 
They are not attacking the company's building permits or filing
frivolous lawsuits.  They are not even trying to block financing
for the project by threatening local bankers.  Rather, <I>The
Wall Street Journal</I> reports that the building trades unions
are threatening the decor of the restaurant to force the Palm
to fire a non-union contractor and submit to build on the union's
terms (at a 38% premium).
<P>
Hoping to decimate the collection of celebrity caricatures which
adorn the walls of each Palm location, the unions are begging
local notables to pull their faces from the walls of the Palm.
 Several have acquiesced  - Sens. Ted Kennedy and John Kerry,
<I>Atlantic Monthly </I>editor Jack Beatty, and legal beagle Alan
Dershowitz.  Some, less sympathetic types, might consider this
urban renewal.
<P><a name="four"></a>
<i><B>Letter Carriers Are Big Winners in Oregon Vote-by-Mail Election</B></i>
<P>
According to a <I>Washington Times</I>  mention entitled &quot;Delivering
the Vote,&quot; the labor unions were quite pleased (in more ways
than one) with Oregon's recent special election.  The newspaper
notes:
<P>
&quot;The National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC), AFL-CIO
carried two headlines in its newsletter concerning Ron Wyden's
recent election to the Senate.  &quot;Letter Carriers Major Factor
in Wyden Oregon Senate Win,&quot; the NALC bulletin said.  &quot;Vote-by-Mail
Balloting Receives Praise.&quot;   
<P><a name="five"></a>
<i><B>AFL-CIO Charged with Crossing the Line in Campaign Activity</B></i>
<P>
The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) filed a
complaint last week with the Federal Election Commission (FEC)
charging that &quot;PROJECT '95&quot; - an AFL-CIO special campaign
 - violated the law because its goals were to defeat House Republicans
using union members' dues.  The NRCC charges that the AFL-CIO
was engrossed in &quot;active electioneering&quot; in Federal
campaigns.  House Republicans on the PROJECT '95 target list were
saturated with radio and television advertising, and other outreach
activities in their congressional districts.  According to the
NRCC though, PROJECT '95 was coordinated with the Democratic Party
- the list of targeted House Republicans was distributed at a
key meeting of assembled House Democrats.
<P>
&quot;The AFL-CIO's PROJECT '95...misused the dues paid by the
hard-working men and women who belong to the member unions,&quot;
states a NRCC press release.  The NRCC also charges that AFL-CIO
chief John Sweeny's proclamation that the union will use $35 million
of its treasury to defeat Republicans in 1996 also violates federal
election law.

<blockquote>
<i><B>Another Clinton Payback - Fox in the Henhouse</B></i>
<P>
The name Sarah Fox is soon to become synonymous with the most
cynical form of union power grab.
<P>
Under attack for three years for politicizing the National Labor
Relations Board, the Administration pushed the envelope further
by naming Ted Kennedy's chief labor strategist to a recess appointment.
 Acting in the dead of night with questionable legal authority,
President Clinton installed the legislative specialist in the
role of labor law judge for a &quot;temporary&quot; appointment
for up to two years.
<P>
Control of the Labor Board gives the unions an opportunity to
revitalize their agenda.  Through selective enforcement of the
labor laws, complicity in union harassment campaigns and abolition
of long-standing employer protections, the pro-union NLRB will
seek to shift the balance of power clearly in favor of labor.
 Not to mention the fact that the Board rules on allegations of
unlawful union conduct as well.
<P><a name="two"></a>
<i><B>Reich Rhetoric</B></i>
<P>
The key solution to &quot;our greatest remaining challenge&quot;
is a strong union movement.  That is the declaration of Labor
Secretary Robert B. Reich in an official publication from his
Department.
<P>
Citing a host of newly discovered evils in the economy, Reich
declares, &quot;Closing the gap between paychecks and profits
is our greatest remaining challenge.&quot;  In addition to the
usual liberal solutions of raising the minimum wage and spending
more on training, Reich offers these telling steps:  <B>Enforcing
the Nation's labor laws</B> (against employers) and <B>Maintaining
a strong labor union movement.</B>
<P>
He states, &quot;Building strength through numbers is perhaps
the most important way workers can boost their bargaining power
in order to earn a family wage.&quot;  <I><B>Translation:  </B></I>Pandering
to union leaders in official Labor Department documents is perhaps
the most important way for Bill Clinton to secure labor's endorsement.
<P><a name="three"></a>
<i><B>Big Labor's Real Agenda:</B></i>
<P>
<B> Corporate Campaigns . . . Extortion by any other name</B>
<P>
Anywhere else but under the labor laws, actions to disrupt work,
run up costs and intentionally drive the company out of business
would be considered both criminal and tortuous.  But because unions
are considered &quot;special,&quot; the rules of law do not apply
to their so-called corporate campaigns.
<P>
The Electrical Workers describe their goal as follows:  &quot;to
threaten or actually apply the economic pressure necessary to
cause the employer to...raise his prices to recoup additional
costs, scale back his business activities, leave the union's jurisdiction,
go out of business, and so on.&quot;  (<I>IBEW Union Organizing
Manual)</I>
<P>
Again...extortion by any other name. 
<P><a name="four"></a>
<I><B>Two Wrongs Make a Filibuster</B></I>
<P>
Remember the scene in &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot;
in which Jimmy Stewart filibusters for hours <U>against </U>corruption
and wrong.  On behalf of the unions, Democrats are filibustering
the Labor Department funding bill in <U>support</U> of wrongdoing.
<P>
That bill in the Senate has a provision that would block enforcement
of President Clinton's Executive Order prohibiting federal contractors
from hiring permanent replacements for strikers.  The Order was
recently ruled <U>illegal </U>by a federal court - but organized
labor's friends keep filibustering.
<P><a name="five"></a>
<i><B>Unions Decline Further, </B></i>
<P>
<B>Except When Government is There</B>
<P>
Union membership continues to decline, this time by 300,000 workers
in 1994 to below 15% of the work force.  Where do unions remain
strongest? In industries with the closest relationship to government.
<P>
Federal, state and local governments employ about 6.9 million
union members, or about 37.8% of public employment.  In the private
sector, heavily regulated industries such as transportation and
public utilities had the highest level of unionization at 27%.
 Construction followed with 18%, helped in large part by the Davis-Bacon
Act and other laws which inflate public construction costs and
protect unions from competition.
<P>
Labor's former stronghold, manufacturing, continued its rapid
decline, suffering fully one-fourth of the overall loss in union
members for the year.  Not surprisingly, manufacturing in recent
years has moved further away from cohabitation with government
toward free competition.

<h2>
 Clinton probably won't be a TEAM player<BR>
</h2>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen kerrigan</a>

<P>
<blockquote>
<hr>
August 1996 -- By far, the most effective and beneficial trend
in recent decades has been the empowerment of workers through
participation in quality circles, safety committees and other
&quot;teams.&quot;  While hundreds of businesses use the team
approach -- which allows managment and employees to confer over
issues of mutual concern and interest -- recent rulings by the
National Labor Relations Board have many employers concerned that
teams violate existing labor laws.
<P>
To correct the bias of the Depression-era law, both Houses of
Congress passed the TEAM, or Teamwork for Employees and Managers
Act -- legislation that creates a safe harbor for workers and
management to confer over issues of shared interest.
<P>
Section 8(a)(2) of the National Labor Relations Act makes it an
unfair labor practice for an employer to &quot;dominate or interfere
with the formation or administration of any labor organization
or contribute financial or other support to it...&quot;  The purpose
of the law then, was to outlaw sham unions created by a company
to avoid true unionization of the employer's workplace.
<P>
In the ensuing six decades since the law was written, the workplace
has experience tremendous changes, thus making the Depression-era
law outdated and restrictive.  In 1992, the NLRB ruled that many
cooperative teams are illegal in nonunion settings.  Critics claim
that the board ignored the fact that teams are established to
address important business concerns such as quality or production.
 Worker-management cooperative teams that took up topics such
as wages, hours and working conditions, traditionally the domain
of labor unions, were treated under the law in the same manner
as if managment had created a full-blown company union.  Numerous
other decisions have further narrowed the usefulness of teams.
<P>
Organized labor opposes the TEAM Act, claiming it allows for the
formation of company-sponsored unions while hindering union organizing.
 Supports of the act vehemently disagree.  They say it provides
an outlet for employees to express their concerns and offer opinions
when no union is on the scene.  And, with only 11 percent of the
private work force represented by unions, the number of workers
who could participate in the team concept is considerable.
<P>
David Thompson, Workplace Counsel for the Washington-based Business
Leadership Council, says passage of the TEAM Act by the Congress
represents a clear turning point in workplace policy.
<P>
&quot;We are glad to see that the House and Senate both rejected
the charge of union leaders that company efforts to solve problems
through consensus were part of a vicious plot to institute company
unions,&quot; says Thompson.
<P>
According to Thompson, labor leaders will oppose any effort to
modernize the law because it weakens their political influence
and sends them down the road to irrelevancy.
<P>
&quot;Workers and management understand the need for companies
to prosper in order to stay competitive in this highly-competitive
global economy.  That is why workplace cooperatio through the
team approach is so popular,&quot; adds Thompson.
<P>
Sen. Christopher &quot;Kit&quot; Bond, Rmo., chairman of the Senate
Small Business Committee, hailed the passage of the TEAM Act by
the Senate as a major victory for small business.
<P>
&quot;This is a common-sense measure that provides those 90 percent
of employees in America who do not belong to labor unions a stronger
voice in their workplace,&quot; he noted.
<P>
The TEAM Act will make its way to the White House, but President
Clinton has promised union leaders that he will veto the bill.
 The business community has responded that the veto would represent
more political pandering to labor leaders in exchange for the
exorbitant sums of money they are putting into key congressional
races to defeat Republicans.
<P>
Thompson of the BLC says it's a sad commentary on the state of
political affairs when the president of the United States would
hold back the growth, productivity and competitiveness of American
business in order to appease special interests.
<P>
Bond agrees and adds that President Clinton's failure to sign
the TEAM Act into law would prove beyond any doubt that he is
no friend of the small-business entrepreneur.

 Business Would Suffer Under Chemical Weapons<BR>
</h2>
<p>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a>
</center>
<P>
<blockquote>
<hr>
August 1996 -- On or before September 14, 1996, the U.S. Senate
will vote to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) -- a
treaty with lofty goals to rid the world of chemical weapons.
 Meanwhile, thousands of American businesses are still unaware
that they will be forced to help end the production and stockpiling
of these treacherous weapons.  
<P>
For the first time in U.S. history, businesses using chemicals
for legitimate commercial purposes would be subject to international
inspections conducted by an agency falling under the umbrella
of the United Nations.
<P>
Opponents of the CWC are not only concerned that thousands of
small and medium-sized businesses would have to comply with extra-stringent
reporting requirements, but also question whether the treaty would
stop the proliferation, use and stockpiling of chemical weapons.
<P>
It is not only the big chemical companies that fall under the
treaty's new regulatory requirements, but small and medium-sized
ones that will be required to fill out burdensome paperwork and
host international bureaucrats through on-site inspections.
<P>
 Paint manufacturers, distilleries, automotive, biotechnology,
pharmaceutical, textiles, food processing and cosmetic companies
for example, could fall under the CWCW as a result of the chemicals
they use for legitimate manufacturing purposes.
<P>
According to information supplies to the Senate by the Arms Central
and Disarmament Agency, between 3,000 and 8,000 companies will
be affected by the treaty.
<P>
While several government agencies reviewing CWC document the cost
of the new treaty at $200 million per year, many experts conclude
that the costs will be much higher.  
<P>
Baker Spring of the Heritage Foundation suggest that the indirect
costs to businesses, such as those stemming from the loss of confidential
information are difficult to estimate, but &quot;billions in losses
are not out of the question.&quot;
<P>
Businesses covered by the CWC treaty would have to submit reports
to a new U.N. body called the Organization for the Prohibition
of Chemical Weapons on each chemical they use.  It is estimated
that the paperwork will take a firm about nine hours for each
&quot;Schedule 1&quot; chemical its production process uses, 7.2
hours for each &quot;Schedule 2&quot; chemical, and 2.5 hours
for each Schedule 3 chemical it uses.  
<P>
Many businesses both large and small use hundreds if not thousands
of chemicals in their manufacturing process.  Under the CWC, affected
businesses will be subjected to two types of inspection -- routine
and challenge.  The Defense Department estimates that large companies
could incur costs as high as $500,000 per inspection and small
firms may incur costs between $10,000 - $20,000.  Each business
inspected also must pick up the tab for the inspectors meals and
lodging.  
<P>
The inspectors would represent various countries signing the CWC,
but not the United States. 
<P>
 Besides sharing proprietary business information with international
inspectors, inspections may also involve production shutdown.
 Private businesses just learning of CWC implications are concerned
that such visits may compromise confidential business information
and produce significant costs.  
<P>
One medium-size company alerted the Senate that they use over
5,000 different chemicals in their production process of household
products and that the reporting system would impose a significant
administrative burden.  
<P>
Most disconcerting, though, is the claim by foreign policy experts
that rogue countries that harbor chemical weapons are not planning
to sign the treaty.  As non-signatories to the treaty, countries
such as Egypt, Iraq, North Korea, Syria and the Republic of China
will not be bound by CWC's provisions. 
<P>
 At the same time, American businesses will pay a huge price and
suffer real losses for a treaty whose goals cannot be met because
rogue countries will continue to stockpile and produce chemical
weapons.

Will You Be Required to File Electronically?<BR>
</h2>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a>
</center>
<P>
<blockquote>
<hr>
The one thing that annoys business owners about Washington, D.C.
is the fact that they often find out about a new rule or regulation
well after it has been signed into law.  Most recently, thousands
of small and medium-sized businesses have been receiving notices
from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) about a new law passed
under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) which requires
more businesses to start filing their payroll taxes electronically
by January 1, 1997.<BR>

<P>
An unrelated provision to the 1993 NAFTA legislation required
that the federal government build a nationwide Electronic Federal
Tax Payment System (EFTPS) in order to receive federal depository
taxes electronically.  The new program began with 800 of the largest
U.S. businessses on January 1, 1995, and 800 more were added to
the mandated system at the beginning of 1996.  On January 1, 1997,
1.2 million more businesses were slated to become mandated electronic
filers.  That deadline has been extended to July 1, 1997 due to
the efforts of Senator Kit Bond (R-MO), Chairman of the Senate
Small Business Committee, and other business allies on Capitol
Hill.<BR>

<P>
According to phase-in requirements of the IRS' EFTPS, businesses
whose aggregate federal payroll tax deposits exceding $50,000
must begin depositing these taxes electronically.  The IRS began
informing small companies of the requirement with the following
notice: &quot;YOU MUST ENROLL AND DEPOSIT ELECTRONICALLY.&quot;
 To all the recipients of the IRS mailing, the notice came from
out of the blue.<BR>

<P>
When small businesses started complaining to members of Congress
about the surprise notices, Senator Bond and others stepped in
to help those targeted by the fast approaching deadline.  In a
July 24 letter sent to Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and IRS
Commissioner Margaret Richardson, Sen. Bond wrote that many small
busineses did not understand what the IRS notice meant in practical
terms.  Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-AK), ranking minority member of the
committee, co-signed the letter.<BR>

<P>
Senator Bond said that some small businesses in response to the
notices thought that the IRS would start &quot;debiting bank accounts
without taxpayer permission, while others believe that they must
invest in new computer and telephone systems in order to conduct
the transfers.&quot;<BR>

<P>
In another letter to Senator William Roth (R-DE), Chairman of
the Senate Committee on Finance, over thirty business organizations
-- including the American Payroll Association -- expressed concern
that the EFTPS system will not be prepared to handle over 1.3
million new electronic filers.  In addition, the business groups
assert that the IRS is not adequately education those obligated
to electronically file.<BR>

<P>
For example, the letter points out that in a recent meeting of
over 600 Certified Public Accountants held in Boston, not one
of the attendees knew of the mandate.  In addition, a survey city
by the letter confirms that most of the businesses falling under
the next phase-in are unaware of the new filing commitment --
over 70% of &quot;soon-to-be mandated taxpayers are not aware
of these requirements.&quot;  Also, spot calls of IRS district
offices have revealed that the tax-collecting agency's employees
are not even aware of the new requirements.<BR>

<P>
According to Sen. Bond, the need for the IRS to communicate more
effectively with small business taxpayers falls under the Small
Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) which became
law in March.  Under SBREFA, federal agencies are supposed to
publish regulations in &quot;Plain English&quot; so that small
businesses can comply with the law.<BR>

<P>
Following the various letter writing campaigns to the IRS and
key committee chairman, the IRS published a Legislative Fact Sheet
on July 29.  In that four page summary, the IRS provides an overview
of the EFTPS in a question &amp; answer format.<BR>

<P>
Even so, for some business groups and others opposed to the phase-in
requirement, the new mandate will create a major new cost burden
that will disrupt many businesses.  Also, of the two options offered
by the IRS for electronic payment -- Automated Clearing House
&quot;Credit&quot; or &quot;Debit&quot; -- many small businesses
may not be able to select the credit option because local and
rural banks are not equipped to offer it.<BR>

<P>
Most problematic however is the fact the IRS and the Treasury
Department will not test the system first to determine if it will
properly work.  The business organizations writing to Congress
estimate that about 2 million businesses will be required to enroll
in the system, which means that financial agents will be processing
16,600 enrollments per day.  And if each taxpayer has two questions,
the IRS will be answering about 33,000 inquiries per day.<BR>

<P>
Under the new Small Business Jobs Protections Act passed early
August (the bill that hiked the minimum wage), the January 1997
deadline has been extended to July 1, 1997 so that businesses
can more fully understand how to comply with the new electronic
filing law.  The extension also gives the IRS more time to fully
educated small business, banks, payroll processors, and accountants
about the procedure.<BR>

<P>
Those businesses with less than $50,000 in payroll taxes may want
to take this opportunity to find out more about the requirements
-- 1999 the requirement drops to $20,000.<BR>

<P>
Is the IRS capable of answering questions that hundreds of thousands
of businesses will have about filing electronically, and will
they be prepared to fully implement the program on July 1, 1997?
 According to question #14 on their recent Legislative Update,
if a taxpayer does not understand the enrollment process, form
or instructions, they can call 1-800-555-4477 or 1-800-945-8400.

<h2>Chairman of House Small Business Committee A True
Champion<BR>
</h2>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<P>
<hr>
<br>
 Recently I had the opportunity to talk with the
Chairman of the House Small Business Committee. The topic was
the accomplishments of the 104th Congress regarding small business
issues.  Chairman Jan Meyers (R-KS) was proud of the record of
the 104th Congress, but expressed frustration with President Clinton
as many of the small business initiatives fell victim to his veto
pen.<BR>
<P>
The frustration stems from the fact that key tax
and regulatory reforms had &quot;enough support to pass both Houses
of Congress.&quot;  In addition, all of the reforms were priorities
that were recommended by the White House Conference on Small Business
-- an event called for by the President.  For example, legislation
to cut capital gains taxes, tort reform, increased expensing for
small businesses, and estate-tax reform, were passed by the House
and Senate (some by large margins with bipartisan majorities)
but rejected by the President.<BR>
<P>
 Meyers identified several reasons why more ground
wasn't won on behalf of small business.  For one, the Republicans
lost the media battle on key issues.  Also, the President portrayed
small business legislation as dangerous and unfair.  &quot;It's
difficult for us to respond to his type of bullypulpit,&quot;
stated Meyers.<BR>
<P>
 Many members of Congress feel that both the press
and the President successfully depicted Republican-led reforms
as &quot;extreme.&quot;  The multi-million dollar ad campaigns
sponsored by organized labor and environmental groups echoed this
theme.<BR>
<P>
 &quot;The tax issue is especially easy to demagogue,&quot;
says Meyers.  The Chairman refers to the fact that it is easy
to communicate in a ten-second sound bite that something &quot;benefits
the rich&quot;  According to Meyers its more difficult to quickly
articulate how cutting capital gains taxes provides job-creating
small businesses with access to capital to help start or grow
their enterprises.<BR>
<P>
Despite some of the criticism that Meyers has for
the President, she's more upbeat than critical and feels that
the Congress has indeed advanced the small business agenda on
Capitol Hill.  For one, she has changed the focus of the Small
Business Committee to actually focus on small business issues.
 The Committee's agenda is not random or personal, but one driven
by the needs of small businesses.<BR>
<P>
 &quot;We went to the small business community to
see what is important to them -- then we went after these issues,&quot;
says Meyers.<BR>
<P>
 Small business owners and various groups in Washington
representing the small business community feel welcome in Rayburn
2359 -- the committee hearing room where all the action takes
place.  Scores of small business owners and entrepreneurs have
been invited to testify before the Committee to deliver their
personal accounts of how they have been impacted by regulation
and taxes, or how they would benefit or possibly be hurt by legislation
before the Congress.<BR>
<P>
 And Meyers is proud that some pieces of legislation
originating in her Committee were signed into law by the President.
 For one, the Regulatory Flexibility Act has been strengthened
to protect small businesses from burdensome regulations.  The
strengthening of the Act will make, &quot;regulatory agencies
look more closely at rules and regulations and their impact on
small businesses before they put them out,&quot; states Meyers.
<BR>
<P>
 Under the leadership of Meyers, the health care
tax credit given to small businesses was increased from 25% to
30% and made permanent.  &quot;It was wrong for small businesses
to come to Congress each year and beg to have this credit extended.
 They couldn't plan for the future,&quot; she says.<BR>
<P>
 The Paperwork Reduction Act was also signed into
law requiring that the federal government reduce the paperwork
burden on Americans by 10% in its first year, and 5% annually
thereafter.<BR>
<P>
 The Committee has jurisdiction over the Small Business
Administration (SBA), and Meyers reports that they have been able
to trim the size of the agency &quot;without taking away a single
program of vital importance to small business.&quot;  The SBA's
budget was trimmed from $800 million to $500 million with its
popular loan programs intact.  The Chairman's goal was to provide
diligent oversight of the SBA loan program to ensure it remains
sound with a relatively low loss rate.<BR>
<P>
 Meyers has served on the Committee since 1985, and
admits that their are tough challenges ahead both for the Congress
and small business.  Earlier this year, she announced her retirement
from Congress and hopes to tackle one more issue before her departure..
 That issue is the SBA's 8(a) program -- a program that awards
contracts to minority-owned business noncompetitively.  Meyers
feels the program is riddled with fraud and abuse, and directly
contradicts the recent <U><I>Adarand</I></U> decision by the Supreme
Court.<BR>
<P>
 Meyers believes that the program began with good
intentions, but is now out of control.  According to Meyers, of
the $4.37 billion awarded in 8(a) contracts, only 9% are awarded
competitively.  The government can save taxpayers over $1 billion
if these contracts were competitively bid.  The Government Accounting
Office (GAO) reports that the 8(a) program has failed to foster
self-sufficiency for its small business participants.  According
to a GAO report, &quot;SBA's success in helping disadvantaged
firms to become self-sufficient and competitive was minimal...many
firms relied on 8(a) contracts and viewed the program an end in
itself.&quot;<BR>
<P>
 Meyers admits that because she has decided to tackle
this issue -- her preference is to abolish the 8(a) program --
she may leave Congress on a controversial note.  But Meyers feels
she has an obligation to address the issue.  &quot; I don't feel
comfortable leaving Congress without addressing this costly problem&quot;
she says.<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Whatever note she happens to leave on, the small
business community in Washington is unanimous that Chairman Meyers
has been a champion of small business during the 104th Congress.

<H2>Cost Of Government Makes July 3 A Special Day</H2><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr><p>
<blockquote>
On July 4, the United States celebrates its independence from Britain. On the same day, a Washington-based group says, Americans can celebrate their independence from having just paid their share of the cost of government.
<p>
Americans for Tax Reform, a government watchdog and taxpayer advocacy organization, figures that Americans spend more than half the calendar year working for the government. Cost of Government Day according to ATR, "is the date of the calendar year on which the average American has earned enough gross income to pay off all his or her direct and hidden taxes" - hidden taxes being the cost of regulation.
<p>
AU federal, state and local outlays (taxes plus borrowing) are included in Cost of Government Day. Although much of the public has become familiar with Tax Freedom Day - calculated by the Tax Foundation as the date when the average American's  earnings cover her tax bill - ATR believes it is important to include regulatory costs as well.
<p>
Cost of Government Day is calculated to help people understand the combined cost of the tax and regulatory burden. "The extra money and human resources businesses must spend to comply with regulations is just as much a financial burden on consumers as direct taxes. Regulations are essentially hidden taxes," says ATR President Grover Norquist.
<p>
According to the group, regulations are passed on to the consumer in the  of higher prices. Also, most economists acknowledge that regulatory costs are passed along from employers to employees in the  of lower wages while constraining a business's ability to invest and grow.
<p>
ATR has calculated the cost of government in 1996 at $3.38 trillion. That breaks down to $13,000 for every man, woman and child in America. Of that total, nearly $1 trillion results from federal and state regulation. The federal government alone accounts for more than $739 billion in hidden regulatory costs (more than $2,800 for every man, woman and child in America).
<p>
According to ATR, the total cost of state and local regulations is vastly underestimated because no quantifiable data has been assembled to account for all costs. For example, the costs associated with state and local environmental protection, worker safety and consumer protection are not included.
<p>
The cost of federal regulations, however, has been calculated by Rochester Institute of Technology Professor Thomas D. Hopkins, a leading authority on regulatory costs. Recently Hopkins conducted a study for the U.S. Small Business Administration documenting the impact of regulations on smaller companies. Hopkins found that the average federal regulatory cost per worker in smaller firms is three-quarters higher than for larger businesses.
<p>
And when businesses are surveyed, they consistently bemoan the burdensome nature of regulations. For example:
<ul>
<li>In March, the Center for the Study of American Business at Washington University in St. Louis reported that 52 percent of midsize companies surveyed said government regulation is their biggest challenge.
<li>In a recent survey of small manufacturers conducted by the National Association of Manufacturers, nearly half reported that regulations had prevented their hiring new workers.
<li>The SBA says that small-business owners spend 1 billion hours each year filling out government forms at a cost of $100 billion.
</ul>
Although most surveys have found that Americans believe federal regulations do more harm than good, this sentiment has not translated into a major regulatory overhaul in the federal government.
<p>
In fact, just the opposite has occurred. The Clinton administration's regulatory budget has
grown much faster than federal spending. And between 1989 and 1992 - during the Bush administration - the government burden on small business increased more than 34 percent, according to the House Joint Economic Committee.
<p>
Not only are businesses saddled with higher costs due to increased regulations, but county governments will be forced to spend almost $3 billion by 1998 to comply with mandates imposed by the Americans with Disabilities Act, according to estimates by the National Association of Counties.
<p>
Still, the ATR's Norquist believes Cost of Government Day will eventually roll backward instead of forward.
<p>
"While the new Congress has been attacked by defenders of the status quo for wanting to reform regulations and cut taxes for working families and small businesses, ATR believes we have only seen the beginning of the debate to overhaul the tax system, trim the size of government, and relieve Americans of burdensome regulations."
<p>
The 1996 elections will be a referendum on the size and scope of government, he believes.
<p>
While most Americans will be observing the country's independence on the Fourth of July, ATR hopes they also will observe what the government has cost them on July 3. According to Norquist, being informed is the first step to helping his group move Cost of government Day several days backward each year.

<H2>How Much Do You Pay Uncle Sam Each Week?</H2><br>

<blockquote>
What government costs taxpayers has been well-documented by many groups. And it's beginning to get even more attention.
<p>
According to the Washington-based Tax Foundation, "Tax Freedom Day" fell on May 7 this Year. That date marks the point at which the average American's earnings covered his or her tax bill for the year. "Cost of Government Day," a day calculated by Americans for Tax Reform, goes further by including taxes, regulations and total government spending. According to that group, the average person has not finished paying the government until July 3. Now, a Michigan-based group wants to remind workers how much government costs each pay period by including the information on payroll stubs. The Mackinac Center for Public Policy has developed "The Right to Know Payroll Form" to show workers the cost of government and how these costs translate into less take-home pay.
<p>
For years, watchdog groups have warned that increased regulation and taxation mean employers must pass costs on to employees through lower wages and fewer benefits. The right-to-know form shows how these mandates quickly add up to sizable amounts for each employee.
<p>
"Many workers don't realize the actual cost that government imposes through its spending and regulations. The Right to Know Payroll Form helps citizens become better able to participate in the democratic process because it makes them better informed," said Mackinac Vice President Joseph Overton.
<p>
Beyond the usual pay-stub information of state and federal income tax and Social Security payments, the Right to Know Payroll Form includes:
<ul>
<li>The employer's share of Social Security and Medicare taxes.
<li>The employer's unemployment insurance and workers' compensation costs.
<li>The costs of administering the taxes.
<li>The costs of complying with state and federal personnel-related mandates, such as the Americans With Disabilities Act and Family and Medical Leave Act.
</ul>
Employers are hit with additional regulations from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, the Environmental Protection Agency and other government agencies. So, for most businesses, the right-to-know effort hits only the tip of the regulatory iceberg.
<p>
The business community has responded positively to the Mackinac project. According to Mackinac spokesperson Joseph Lehman, "dozens of private businesses are working to implement the.system right now."
<p>
The center launched their effort on Tax Freedom Day and continues to recruit employers to use the system.
<p>
In addition to employers in the private sector, Mackinac has found an unlikely partner - the state of Michigan. Starting in July, more than 60,000 state employees will receive revised pay stubs documenting how much money it takes to keep them on the payroll.
<p>
The new payroll stubs will include how much the state pays for the employee's share of Social Security and Medicare taxes and the state-paid portion of health insurance and other benefits.
<p>
According to the center, developing the data for a right-to-know form is simple. Beyond the standard payroll deductions shown on the typical pay stub, the form lists all the employer's costs. Such items as the employer's share of payroll taxes per employee, easily quantifiable government mandates and the administrative cost of compliance are included.
<p>
The employer's costs are itemized and deducted from the Estimated Payroll Allocation to produce gross pay. The withholding tax is subtracted from gross pay to produce net pay, just as most payroll forms do now.
<p>
According to the center's brochure promoting the right-to-know program; both employers and employees benefit. 
<p>
Workers understand better how government-imposed mandates affect job creation and growth. Employers understand better how mandates and taxes impact workers' pay.
<p>
For small companies, this is especially critical because they feel more harshly the effects of mandates and taxes.

The amount that government costs taxpayers has been well-documented by a variety of groups.
<p>
According to the Washington, D.C.-based Tax Foundation, "Tax Freedom Day" fell on May 7 this year. That date marks the point at which the average American's year-to-date earnings covers his tax bill for the year. "Cost of Government Day," a day calculated by Americans for Tax Reform, goes further by including taxes, regulations and total government spending. According to that group, the average person works for the government until July 3.
<p>
Now, a Michigan-based group, wants to remind workers how much government costs them each pay period by including this information on employee payroll stubs. The Mackinac Center for Public Policy has developed "The Right to Know Payroll Form" to show workers the cost of government and how these costs translate into less take-home pay.
<p>
The Mackinac Center says that workers will benefit from the new pay stub because it shows employees the cost of government programs and mandates.
<p>
For years, watchdog groups lamenting the size and scope of government have warned the public that increased regulation and taxation mean that employers have to pass these costs on to employees through lower wages and fewer benefits. The Right to Know Form breaks down those costs by showing how these mandates quickly add up to sizable amounts per employee.
<p>
"Many workers don't realize the actual cost that government imposes through its spending and regulations. The Right to Know Payroll Form helps citizens become better able to participate in the democratic process because it makes them better informed," said Mackinac Vice President Joseph Overton.
<p>
Although pay stubs already show the employee's share of state and federal income tax and Social Security payments, the Right to Know Payroll Form includes other costs. These unseen costs include the employer's share of Social Security and Medicare taxes; the employer's unemployment insurance and workers' compensation costs; the costs of administering such taxes; and the costs of complying with state and federal, personnel-related mandates, such as the Americans With Disabilities Act and Family and Medical Leave Act.
<p>
Employers are hit with additional regulations from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, the Environmental Protection Agency and other government agencies. So for most businesses, the right to know effort only hits the tip of the regulatory iceberg.
<p>
The business community's response to the Mackinac project has been positive. According to Mackinac spokesperson Joseph Lehman, "dozens of private businesses are working to
implement the system right now."
<p>
The Mackinac Center launched the effort on Tax Freedom Day and is actively recruiting employers. Although many employers in the private sector have called the center to pledge their adoption of the payroll form, Mackinac has found an unlikely partner - the state of Michigan.
<p>
Starting in July, more than 60,000 employees of the state will receive revised pay stubs, which will document how much is paid to keep them on the payroll. While Michigan did not include all Right to Know Payroll Form recommendations, the new payroll stubs will include how much the state pays for the employee's share of Social Security and Medicare taxes, and the state-paid portion of health insurance and other benefits.
<p>
According to the center, developing the cost data to use for a firm's own right-to-know form is simple. Beyond the standard payroll deductions that are shown on the typical pay stub, the Right to Know form extends payroll accounting to include all the employer's costs. Such items as the employer's share of payroll taxes per employee, easily quantifiable government mandates and the administrative burden of complying with such costs are included.
<p>
Firms participating in the program have used accountants and tax and benefits managers to calculate these costs to determine the average cost per employee. Once the costs are estimated, they are added to the gross pay to produce an Estimated Payroll Allocation.
<p>
On the form, the employer's costs are itemized and deducted from the Estimated Payroll Allocation to produce gross pay. The withholding tax is subtracted from gross pay to produce net pay, just as most payroll forms do now.
<p>
According to the center's brochure promoting the Right to Know program, both employers and employees benefit. Workers will better understand how government-imposed mandates impact job creation and growth.
<p>
Also, employees will better understand how mandates and taxes impact workers' pay. For small firms, this is especially critical as mandates and taxes are more harshly felt by this sector of the economy.

<H2>Wage Hike Won't Help The Poor But Will Hurt Business</H2><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<blockquote>
Who would have thought our nation's small businesses would be facing a mandated increase in their labor costs under a Republican-controlled Congress? President Clinton had the opportunity to push through a minimum-wage increase during his first two years in office, but chose not to.
<p>
But the politics of an election year are shifting into high gear, and each party is looking for ways to shore up its base of support. For the Democrats, an increase in the minimum wage is the perfect way to show the American public that they care about the working class. It also ensures that the labor unions will continue to support the Democrats' campaign to win back control of Congress.
<p>
Increasing the minimum wage will do little to help the working poor in America, but the emotional appeal of the issue obviously benefits the party that is pushing it. To that extent, the Republicans don't want to appear uncaring, so they're working to craft a package they feel will more adequately respond to the needs of the working poor.
<p>
But first, some of the facts regarding who benefits from an increase in the minimum wage:
<ul>
<li> According to the Democratic Leadership Council, a moderate group of Democrats that Clinton once headed, more than 70 percent of minimum-wage workers are in families that are well above the poverty level. Nearly 40 percent of the workers are in families with incomes in the top half of the income distribution.
<li>Of the 1.96 million workers who earned the minimum wage in 1995, 59 percent were 24 years old or younger, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
<li>Analyzing the 12 million workers who make between $4.25 and $5.15 an hour (the proposed new wage), the Employment Policy Institute found that only 9 percent of these workers are married and their families' sole wage earner. Only 3 percent are single parents.
<li> Also, according to Employment Policy Institute, the average wage of minimum-wage workers increases from $4.25 to $6.08 an hour within a year.
</ul>
Wage-hike proponents say that the minimum wage is at a 40-year low. But this declaration, made often by Labor Secretary Robert Reich, compares apples to oranges. Forty years ago, the minimum wage applied mostly to skilled jobs in manufacturing and transportation - restaurant and retail jobs were exempt. Reich and his fellow wage-hike crusaders are essentially comparing the pay of skilled workers yesterday to unskilled workers today.
<p>
Of course, the small-business lobby in Washington is not surprised that it must continue to fight wage-hike proposals. According to an industry representative fighting against the wage increase, "The American public continue to support an increase in the starting wage because it's a feel-good proposal. Unfortunately, most Americans do not understand the harmful effects of artificial wage hikes - they cost jobs and cause price increases for the working poor."
<p>
The Democratic Leadership Council appears to agree. In a recent position paper on the wage increase, the council asserts that "the costs of an increase ... would be borne disproportionately by lower-income families" because they would be forced to pay higher prices. The council calls this a "regressive transfer, making most poor people a little worse off in order to improve the lives, at least for a time, of a group of people that is predominately nonpoor."
<p>
Recognizing this dynamic, one Republican freshman has come up with a creative idea to allow minimum-wage workers to keep more of their pay rather than allowing the government to eat away at their wages.
<p>
Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., proposes allowing minimum-wage earners to keep the payroll taxes that are currently withheld from their paychecks. McIntosh is calling his increase proposal the Minimum Wage Tax Cut. According to the freshman member, the proposal would increase the take-home pay of those earning the minimum wage without causing the job losses that a government-mandated wage hike would produce. It's estimated that an increase in the minimum wage would cost the economy 300,000 to 500,000 jobs.
<p>
McIntosh's proposal would cut federal taxes for workers earning between $4.25 and $5.25 an hour by allowing them to keep federal income, Social Security and Medicare taxes - now deducted from their paychecks. The proposal would raise workers' net hourly rate to $4.57, compared with the current $3.76 when federal withholdings are deducted.
<p>
"What proponents of raising the minimum wage to $5.15 don't tell you is that after federal taxes are deducted, workers will only take home $4.56 an hour," McIntosh said. "By avoiding government-mandated wages, taxes can be cut for minimum-wage earners and their weekly paychecks will increase," he added.
<p>
Early estimates of the McIntosh proposal by the Congressional Budget Office show that it could cost $8 billion to $10 billion annually. To make up the difference, McIntosh proposed cutting federal welfare by 10 percent, amounting to $9 billion. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the 90-cent wage increase will cost businesses about $12.5 billion over five years.
<p>
But whatever the wage hike will cost the business community, most of the evidence proves that the real losers would be lower-skilled workers who become priced out of the labor market.

<H2>Small Businesses Fighting For Medical Accounts</H2><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>
Another health-care reform battle is brewing on Capitol Hill. But rather than fighting against employer mandates, small-business organizations and their allies are fighting to include medical savings accounts in health-care legislation this year.
<p>
What is an MSA? An employer takes a portion of funds currently spent on health insurance and deposits it into an MSA - up to $2,000 for an individual or $4,000 for a family.
<p>
The money can be used to pay for out-of-pocket medical expenses. Some can be used to purchase a catastrophic policy covering all medical expenses after a deductible is met. And, at the end of the year, the insured can keep any unused MSA funds.
<p>
This provides an incentive for the insured to shop around for healthcare needs - injecting much-needed competition into an industry in which the third-party payment system has left the consumer with no incentive to spend less.
<p>
Under the Health Coverage Availability and Affordability Act of 1996 passed by the House of Representatives, individuals and the self-employed could deduct from their federal taxes 100 percent of the funds deposited in their MSAs. This would be in addition to the 35 percent of a catastrophic policy premium they are already allowed to deduct.
<p>
This feature, say MSA advocates, would make individual taxes fairer in comparison to what corporations pay. And tax equity, combined with the portability feature, would help
solve the "job-lock" problem experienced by so many Americans who want to change jobs.
<p>
The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill in the Senate does not include an MSA provision. Key Democrats have said MSAs were too controversial to include, and they are aggressively working to make sure that MSAs are kept out.
<p>
MSAs have long been supported by small business. At the White House Conference on Small Business in June 1995, the adoption of MSAs was a key recommendation delegates sent to the president and Congress. In fact, it's estimated that nearly 3,000 businesses - mostly small and medium - are currently using an MSA prototype.
<p>
Evidence reveals that MSAs help reduce health-insurance costs for businesses, while giving employees greater physician choice and control over health-care spending.
<p>
That's why MSA supporters are baffled at flip flops-taken by politicians who have been long-time supporters. In particular, minority leaders Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., in the House and Tom Daschle, D-S.D., in the Senate are leading the charge against MSAs, despite the fact that both were champions of MSAs in the previous Congress.
<p>
Less than two years ago, when asked about the prospect of MSAs being included in health-care reform, Gephardt responded, "Absolutely. This is an idea the Ways and Means Committee has worked-on for three or four years. It's very popular . . . I think it's a great option."
<p>
In fact, MSAs unanimously passed the Ways and Means Committee in the last Congress. Every member of the committee, with the exception of one Democrat, voted for them. In the current Congress MSAs were included in the bipartisan balanced-budget package sent to President Clinton, which he subsequently vetoed.
<p>
Just recently, Sen. Daschle referred to MSAs as the "Dr. Kevorkians of health reform, but in the last Congress he cosponsored the Medical Cost Containment Act of 1992, which according to the legislation, "would allow employers to provide their employees with an annual allowance in a Medical Care Savings Account to pay for routine health-care needs."
<p>
MSA advocates say the flip-flops exhibited by Daschle and Gephardt smack more of partisan politics than a newfound skepticism of MSAs.
<p>
"This is what the American people hate about Washington," said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, a longtime advocate of MSAs.
<p>
"Because some Democrats view this as a simple case of Republicans getting credit for a popular reform, they are stonewalling with the hope of receiving some sort of partisan gain," Norquist added.
<p>
With recent reports showing that proposals like Kennedy-Kassebaum have been an abysmal failure in states that have enacted similar reforms - such as the total collapse of the health-insurance system in Washington state - antics on Capitol Hill to kill MSAs may backfire.
<p>
According to MSA advocates, a grassroots revolution is brewing in favor of the reform, especially among small businesses and the self-employed. Indeed, President Clinton is attempting to reach out to constituencies that he has not been too popular with in the past. The support of MSAs may be one of those issues he finally embraces.

<H2>'A-Corps' Plan Would Hobble Small Business</H2><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<blockquote>
Democrats and Republicans are both marketing themselves as job creators and wage boosters, placing American business at the center of their policy prescriptions. Their proposed solutions, though, are ideological opposites.
<p>
To Republicans, the key to robust economic growth, higher wages and more jobs lies in providing businesses with significant tax and regulatory relief.
<p>
Their solutions also include giving individuals the widest options available for obtaining financial security, education and training, and benefits such as health care through the equalization of tax benefits.
<p>
Democrats believe American business won't help workers on its own and that the federal government must provide the incentives to encourage business to do so.
<p>
According to Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, "If we want companies to do things which do not necessarily improve the returns to shareholders, but which are beneficial for the economy and society as a whole . . . we have to give business an economic reason to do so."
<P>
But rather than provide all businesses with across-the-board tax and regulatory relief, proposals being offered by Reich and Democratic leaders in the House and Senate would reduce taxes and regulations only for companies that achieve "certain minimum requirements."
<p>
Democratic Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, chairman of the Senate Task Force on High Wage Jobs, recently released a package of proposals aimed at alleviating economic insecurity and wage stagnation.
<p>
The report, titled "Scrambling to Pay the Bills: Building Allies for American Working Families," would provide businesses with favorable tax and regulatory treatment if they meet certain tests established by the federal government.
<p>
"A-Corps" businesses would be required, for example, to meet some of the following standards: 
<ul>
<li>Contribute an amount equal to at least 3 percent of payroll to pension plans.
<li>Commit an amount equal to at least 2 percent of payroll for employee training.
<li>Offer all U.S. employees a health-care plan approved by the government. Employers would have to pay at least 50 percent of the plan's cost.
<li>Give employees the option of participating in a profit-sharing, stock option or stock ownership plan. An employee-elected trustee would manage the plan.
<li>Place caps on compensation for the chief executive officer and other employees.
<li>Make sure at least 90 percent of plant and equipment purchases, and employment costs resulting from product and service production, delivery and consumption in the United States occurred in the United States.
<li>Meet or exceed all occupational, safety and environmental standards.
<li>Pay dues and belong to an industry association approved by the Department of Commerce.
</ul>
Businesses meeting the criteria would be given a favorable tax rate, their current corporate income tax replaced with a "business activities tax." Under a BAT plan, payments companies make to other businesses, including the purchase of new equipment and plant construction, are subtracted from taxable income. Only imports would be taxed.
<p>
A-Corps participants would receive a lower tax rate than nonparticipating businesses, though the proposal doesn't specify what those rates might be. However, under the BAT system, small businesses with gross annual receipts of $100,000 would be exempted from the tax.
<p>
In terms of regulatory relief for A-Corps participants, businesses would still be required to meet all federal laws, but could get quicker review and decision-making from federal agencies; participate in voluntary compliance programs; and take advantage of safe-harbor provisions from certain regulatory requirements.
<p>
Qualified A-Corps companies would also be given special treatment in bidding on government contracts.
<p>
Critics of Bingaman and Reich's approach charge that the "most-favored" corporate method is flawed in that businesses could not possibly participate in the A-Corps program without giving up control to the federal government.
<p>
In addition, they say, the proposal assumes businesses do not value workers - a predisposition that runs counter to reality. An economic policy update issued recently by the Senate Joint Economic Committee contends the "corporate responsibility" proposals would "make workers more dependent on their current employers at a time when public policy should be encouraging individual responsibility through upward mobility and portable benefits."
<p>
In addition, the IEC report argues that these policies would discriminate against small businesses and the self-employed.
<p>
According to the report, "because [small businesses] need to invest in building the business, they're less likely to have the free cash to spend on 'corporate responsibility.'
<p>
Also, says the study, a more prudent course would focus tax benefits on individuals, whether or not they receive health insurance, pension plans and worker training from their employers or elsewhere in the marketplace.
<p>
The best way to help the economy and individuals would be to expand individual retirement accounts, make pensions truly portable by allowing individuals the same tax benefits as company-sponsored plans, enact medical savings accounts and lower the marginal tax rates for all.
<p>
As Democrats and Republicans on the campaign trail and in Washington struggle to articulate their competing messages to the American people, small businesses already know what needs to be done to allow their businesses to grow and succeed. Entrepreneurs need help competing against global competitors.

<H2>Finally, Congress Moves To Limit Tax Increases</H2><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
Most analysts agree that reviving tax cuts is a political nonstarter this year. Congress approved a balanced-budget package coupled with tax cuts for small business, but it stopped short at President Clinton's desk.
<p>
With April 15 fast approaching millions of small business owners and taxpayers look at the annual ritual with anger and frustration. But certain members of Congress are banding together to make sure that raising taxes will be just as difficult as cutting them.
<p>
On April 15, the House of Representatives will vote on a Tax Limitation Amendment to the Constitution that would require a two-thirds majority vote of each house of Congress to increase taxes. The effort is being led by Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, along with a bipartisan group of House members including Pete Geren, D-Texas; Ralph Hall, D-Texas; and John Shadegg, R-Ariz.
<p>
On the same day, the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Federalism and Property Rights will hold hearings on a companion resolution to the tax-limiting amendment, introduced by Sen. Jon Kyle, R-Ariz.
<p>
Proponents of the amendment contend a constitutional requirement is absolutely necessary to protect taxpayers from the unending tax increases that followed the adoption of the 16th Amendment in 1913. Before the 16th Amendment was enacted, no income tax was allowed. Since then, federal tax collections have climbed more than 175,000 percent.
<p>
Tax-limitation amendments are not untested. Already, 28 states have some form. Ten have adopted the majority legislative vote to approve higher taxes, and one-third of states require more than a majority, according to Americans for Tax Reform.
<p>
Studies have shown clearly the effect of higher taxes on economic growth. A 1993 study by the Joint Economic Committee of Congress tracking state economies during 1989 to 1993 found:
<ul>
<li>The top 10 income tax-increasing states lost nearly 200,000 jobs from 1989 to 1993. The top 10 income tax-reducing states created nearly 1 million.
<li>Unemployment rose by 2.3 percent in the states that increased taxes the most, but only by .3 percent in the income tax-cutting states.
<li>Income per family of four fell by an average of $600 in the tax-increasing states, and rose $150 in the top 10 tax-cutting states.
</ul>
Tax increases are especially hard for the small-business, entrepreneurial sector, which the United States depends on for creating jobs.
<p>
The 1993 tax hike, for example, was sold as a plan to soak the rich but the majority of those affected were small businesses. A 1994 Small Business Survival Committee survey found that 28 percent of respondents raised prices, 26 percent postponed expansion plans, 14 percent terminated one employee, and 9 percent were forced to take two of the actions.
<p>
Tax-limiting proponents say the 1993 tax hike never would have made it into the history books if the two-thirds majority requirement had been in place. The increase passed by only one vote in the House and Senate.
<p>
According to Americans for Tax Reform four of the last five tax increases were passed with less than a two-thirds majority. They added $666 billion to the tax bill of American taxpayers.
<p>
Does a tax limitation requirement have the support of the public? In 1992, a National Taxpayer's Union Foundation survey found that 78 percent of respondents favored "a constitutional amendment that would- limit the growth of federal taxes."
<p>
More recently, delegates to the 1995 White House Conference on Small Business recommended to the president and Congress that a two-thirds majority requirement be adopted.
<p>
Taxpayers may want to tune into C-SPAN April 15 to see which members of Congress argue to limit increases and which members argue for unlimited power to dig deeper into their pockets.

<H2>Immigration Reform Taking Center Stage</H2><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
If anyone forgot that the immigration issue is emotionally charged, Republican presidential hopeful Pat Buchanan is aggressively reminding America about the issue's volatility.
<p>
Among other measures, Buchanan proposes to erect some type of stronghold along the southern border of the United States and impose a five-year moratorium on legal immigration.
<p>
Congress, meanwhile, is prepared to take action on immigration reform legislation, and the business lobby in Washington is gearing up to oppose provisions that would put employers at the center of enforcing the nation's immigration laws.
<p>
American Business for Legal Immigration - which was formed to protect legal employment immigration - recently held a press conference in Washington to announce its opposition to Wyoming Republican Sen. Alan Simpson's immigration proposal, the Immigration Reform Act of 1995. Simpson's legislation calls for the following:
<ul>
<li>A 35 percent cut in business-related immigration each year, equating to a reduction of 50,000 employment-based visas (from 140,000 to 90,000);
<li>requiring employers who hire legal immigrants to subsidize training programs for U.S. workers;
<li>new taxes - each employer would be required to pay either $10,000 or 10 percent of the foreign worker's annual compensation package (whichever is higher) to the U.S. government;
<li>more regulations, restrictions and paperwork.
</ul>
Simpson's bill attempts to tackle both illegal and legal immigration reform in one sweeping measure. But ABLI contends that it is misguided to combine the two issues, blurring the distinction between the value that skilled legal immigrants bring to the U.S. economy versus a different set of concerns Americans have with illegal immigration.
<p>
"Although Simpson's proposal does seek to address the issue of illegal immigration in the U.S., it confuses legal and illegal immigration and unreasonably threatens the competitiveness of American business in today's global marketplace," says ABLI Director Jennifer Eisen. ABLI strongly supports differentiating between the problems posed by illegal immigration and the benefits of legal immigration.
<p>
ABLI members defend their need to search for and hire skilled talent where they can find it to boost U.S. competitiveness. The coalition also contends that in a highly competitive global economy, it is unrealistic for U.S. policy leaders to attempt to hinder and micromanage employer personnel decisions on top of the current requirements in the legal immigration system.
<p>
According to Kirby Dyess, corporate vice president of Intel Corp., his company already wades through six inches of government forms to comply with regulations and paperwork for each foreign professional it hires. The cost per employee is approximately $7,000 to $10,000. "We don't go through all of this time and expense to displace U.S. workers," Dyess says.
<p>
Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of America, agrees with Dyess. Miller explains that the overhead costs associated with hiring a foreign worker today are sufficient to make it the last resort for most employers. As a result, the current ceiling for business visas is not being reached. ABLI says that employers use about 93,000 of the 140,000 employment-based visas available.
<p>
ABLI also asserts that legal immigrants stimulate domestic job growth by bringing much-needed expertise, technological skill and patented concepts to the nation's industries and economy. Innovations by legal immigrants have propelled American companies to new successes and have allowed these companies to capitalize on new product inventions and technologies.
<p>
ABLl and its members agree that illegal immigration is a problem that must be addressed. Although efforts to split the legislation to address legal and illegal immigration may win out, the business lobby is also concerned about provisions that attempt to stop illegal immigration.
<p>
For example, both House and Senate legislation include proposals to put into place a centralized employment verification system operated by the federal government. Employers would be required to call a government toll-free number to identify the worker as eligible and give the prospective employee's Social Security number.
<p>
During this big political year, politicians and U.S. presidential hopefuls are reacting to hot emotional issues. But quick and rash policy prescriptions for the nation's illegal immigration problem could end up hurting the U.S. economy more than it will help if both legal and illegal immigration are "reformed" in one sweeping measure.

<H2>OSHA Reforms Winding Through Congress</H2>
<p><br>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<blockquote>
Despite the first session of the 104th Congress marking a historic change in the direction of the federal government, far-reaching legislative initiatives have been stalled by the ideological and procedural differences in the House and Senate.
<p>
The House can successfully boast of many tax, regulatory and fiscal reforms it passed in 1995. But without-similar action in the Senate, Congress can't claim a long list of legislative accomplishments, which provide the conventional yardstick by which the media and public measure a productive Congress.
<p>
As Congress-bashers contend that a "do nothing" Congress is the best kind, political analysts predict that President Clinton may exploit Congress' record and pull a page out of campaign history books in his attempts to secure a second term in the White House.
<p>
Just as Harry Truman ran successfully against a "do-nothing" Congress in 1948, President Clinton is considering that strategy in 1996. The "do-nothing" label is something Congress will try to avoid, so congressional leaders are taking a second look at their unfinished 1995 agenda.
<p>
Plenty of opportunities exist to pass meaningful tax and regulatory reforms without stirring up too much of a special-interest hornets' nest. The re-evaluation, say observers, will match targeted legislative opportunities with 1996 political realities.
<p>
OSHA reform is one such area where Congress may accept modest legislative gains. The President and Congress agree that the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) needs to be reformed. Differences arise, of course, when the degree of reform is discussed.
<p>
Republican Rep. Cass Ballenger of North Carolina proposed an OSHA reform bill last year in the House, and it appears that the Senate may soon act on a lighter version of his bill.
<p>
Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas is resurrecting the reform effort in the Senate, with Sens. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., and Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., taking lead roles through co-sponsorship of S.R. 1423, the Occupational Safety and Health Reform and Reinvention Act.
<p>
"Since OSHA was created 25 years ago, the agency has expanded its authority far beyond the original intent of Congress," Hutchison said. "As a result, companies must worry about compliance with standards and regulations that have little or nothing to do with real safety issues."
<p>
S.R. 1423 strives to address real safety issues instead of penalizing business owners for paperwork violations and minor infractions.
<p>
The costs of these so called violations can add up to big fines, as one small roofing company in Houston learned.
<p>
The company was fined 23 times for a total of $13,000 for the following violations: A cut in the insulation of an extension cord that was no longer in use, a bent rung on the bottom of a ladder and a splintered handle on a discarded shovel.
<p>
The Senate reform bill redirects OSHA's energy to consultation programs and voluntary compliance. The bill would codify the Voluntary Protection Program, which exempts employers from general inspections if they have excellent safety and health records.
<p>
There would also be a reduction in penalties for nonserious violations (for example, nonserious hazard citations would be lowered from $7,000 to $100), and penalties waived for nonsignificant violations. Warnings would be issued in lieu of citations, and OSHA inspector quotas would be prohibited.
<p>
Employees would be encouraged (not required) to complain to their employer before they call OSHA. Employee involvement in safety committees is also encouraged through federal labor law modifications.
<p>
Most critically for business, the bill recommends that the employer should not be held responsible if a trained employee disregards health and safety rules.
<p>
OSHA itself has recognized the need to change.
<p>
If there is general agreement on basic principles, is it possible that an OSHA reform bill could move through both houses of Congress and on to the president for his signature?
<p>
Perhaps, but organized labor could deal a blow to even minor reform efforts. Labor unions are opposed to OSHA tinkering, which puts the president in a pickle if a reform bill makes its way through both chambers of Congress. The president is dependent on labor's support and big money for the '96 election.
<p>
Signing an OSHA reform bill backed by the majority of Congress could prove to the electorate and small businesses that the president indeed is governing like a "New Democrat." There's a good chance, though, that election-year friends like the "Old Democrat" much better.

<p>
If you ask most small-business owners, every politician talks a good game of making our
nation's tax system less burdensome. The immense task of overhauling the system, though, keeps most politicians talking. Tax reform is again taking center stage, and perhaps in the near future, tax system overhaul may actually become a reality.
<p>
Many small businesses agree with Republican presidential hopeful Steve Forbes when he says we need to "drive a stake" through the current tax system.
<p>
The small-business sector - responsible for most of the dynamic growth in the economy - fares the worst under the current system. Not only do high taxes inhibit small business growth and job creation, but compliance costs can be financially draining.
<p>
According to a 1991 Tax Foundation report, small companies spent at least $382 in compliance costs for every $100 paid in taxes.
<p>
In addition, it's estimated that businesses squander 3.4 billion hours in tax-related paperwork. And the cost of compliance is big business; more than $200 billion is spent on complying with tax laws.
<p>
Forbes advocates a "pure" flat tax, while . Dole's vision of reform is a "fairer and simpler" type of system.
<p>
Bold tax reform efforts received a big boost from an economic soul mate of Forbes. Jack Kemp, chairman of the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform, released a long-awaited report whose aim is to help guide and shape the debate to overhaul the system. With such high-profile attention given to the issue, tax reform is destined to become a major election-year issue.
<p>
Kemp's Tax Reform Commission begins the report by recommending to Congress and the president "that the current Internal Revenue Service Code be repealed in its entirety."
<p>
No mincing of words there. The principles guiding the new tax code would have to stand up to the TRC "tax test:"
<p><ul>
<li>Economic growth through incentives to work, save and invest;
<li> fairness for all taxpayers;
<li> neutrality that lets people and not government make choices;
<li> visibility to let people know the cost of government;
<li> stability so people can plan for the future.
</ul>
The TRC advocates that the "failed system" be replaced with a single low rate, taxing income only once with a generous personal exemption and full deductibility of the payroll tax.
<p>
The TRC stops short of advancing one type of tax system over another and does not suggest what the single low tax rate might be. (Forbes suggests a 17 percent rate starting at income above $36,800 for a family of four - below that income level, no taxes would be owed.)
<p>
To end the current tax code bias of rewarding consumption over saving and investing, the report says that the tax system "either must let savers deduct their saving or exclude the returns on the saving from their taxable income. It must also end double-taxation of businesses and their owners and permit expensing of investment outlays."
<p>
The report also recommends that capital gains taxes be abolished. Although the commission recognizes that estate and gift taxes make "little sense," it does not call for the elimination of such taxes, which prove particularly burdensome for family owned businesses.
<p>
The commission strongly endorses full deductibility of payroll taxes for employers and employees. If federal payroll taxes are tax-deductible, taxes would be determined on a worker's real net income.
<p>
Once a tax rate is set into place, the commission recommends that a two-thirds majority vote in Congress be required to raise taxes. For most tax reform advocates, this is critically important. As the law now stands, it only takes a majority vote in Congress to raise taxes and a supermajority to lower them.
<p>
Although many business organizations cheered the results of the TRC recommendations, most concluded that the real work lies ahead. The commission's report is not long on details, and the political realities of implementing such reforms depend on whether those in public office in 1997 will defend the current tax system by tinkering around the edges or totally dismantling it.

by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<P>
<hr><P>



What happened to the year of small business?  In 1995, the 104th Congress 
championed a legislative agenda to foster entrepreneurship and small-business growth.  But 
advancing small-business legislation proved to be more difficult than most Washington observers 
expected.  Many of the issues that were priorities of the small business lobby were labeled by the 
Clinton administration as giveaways to the rich or special breaks for big business.<p>
For example, efforts to reduce capital gains and estate taxes have been decried as 
benefitting a special few.<p>
And legislation that would have made federal government regulators more accountable to 
small business has been portrayed as a legislative license for big corporations to pollute the 
environment.<p>
Even when Congress and President Clinton eventually sign off on a budget agreement, 
incentives that were specifically targeted for small business will be vastly watered down or 
tossed aside in the name of compromise.<p>
What can small businesses and entrepreneurs expect from Congress and the Clinton 
administration in 1996?<p>
Election years tend to produce a stale legislative environment so the answer may very 
well be "not that much."  On the other hand, the president may attempt to solidify his traditional 
base of support during the election year by offering proposals that translate into votes at the 
ballot box in November.<p>
For example, the president's inclusion of a federal minimum wage increase in his budget 
plan represents an olive branch to labor unions, which view the administration's stand on labor 
issues as weak.<p>
In Congress, business proponents  --  mostly Republicans  --  will continue to advance 
issues popular with the small business community.  Important matters to small businesses, such 
as overhauling the nation's tax system as well as tax and regulatory reform in general, will 
continue to generate scores of congressional hearings and legislative proposals in Capitol Hill.<p>
When push comes to shove, though, will small business see substantive reforms?<p>
The Small Business Survival Foundation recently revisited the agenda set forth by nearly 
1,800 small business delegates at the June 1995 White House Conference on Small Business.  
The following is an update on the top five recommendations that came out of that conference:<p>
<b>Issue No 1:</b> Independent Contractor Clarification.  Most small businesses believe the 
IRS's 20-factor test to determine the employment status of independent contractors is too 
subjective.<p>
  Republican Jon Christensen of Nebraska introduced legislation to clarify the definition 
of independent contractors and streamline the current 20-factor test to only three criteria.<p>To date, the House Ways and Means Committee has not acted on the legislation, and the 
administration has opposed efforts to simplify the 20-factor test.  However, Christensen's efforts 
are expected to receive a hearing by the powerful tax-writing committee in the near future.<p>
<b>Issues No 2:</b> Meal and Entertainment Deduction. Conference delegates called upon 
Congress and the president to enact legislation allowing a 100 percent tax deduction for meals 
and entertainment.  Recent tax laws reduced the deduction to 50 percent.  Although the 100 
percent deduction may be a priority of small  business, it ranks low as an action item in 
Congress.  Politically, the issue would be a ripe target for opponents, who will label it as just 
another perk for the wealthy.<p>
<b>Issue No 3:</b> Regulatory Flexibility Act/Regulatory Reform.  Small business wants federal 
regulatory agencies to determine the costs of their proposed rules and regulations on the small 
business sector.  Amending the Regulatory Flexibility Act, as recommended by conference 
delegates, would increase the likelihood that cost-impact studies are done by regulators.<p>
The act, combined with a host of other regulatory reforms, passed the House but has 
stalled in the Senate.  Most observers believe all efforts to reform the regulatory system are dead 
for 1996.  Clinton has called the House measures, and similar legislation in the Senate, "too 
extreme."<p>
<b>Issue No 4:</b> Repeal the Federal Estate Tax. Family owned businesses are especially hard 
hit by high estate and gift taxes.  Many businesses fail to make it to the next generation due to the 
burdensome nature of such taxes.  Conference delegates overwhelmingly voted to repeal these 
taxes.  The estate-tax issue has become political fodder for class-warfare rhetoric. Even minor 
efforts to increase the estate-tax exemption from $600,000 to $750,000 have been vastly watered 
down.  The Clinton administration opposes abolishing estate and gift taxes but some estate tax 
relief will probably make it to a final budget deal.<p>
<b>Issue No 5 (tie): </b>Superfund Reform and Health-Care Reform: Many small businesses get 
trapped in what is known as the Superfund web, held liable for expensive government 
environmental cleanup schemes when their actions were legal at the time they disposed of waste.  <p>
Republican Mike Oxley of Ohio has introduced legislation to reform Superfund, but the 
bill does not repeal retroactive liability before 1987  --  a key component sought by reform 
proponents.  Even if a weak bill makes it to the president, he would likely veto the legislation.  <p>
The No. 1 reform on the health-care wish list was the adoption of tax-deductible medical 
savings accounts.  MSAs are included in the budget plan passed by Congress but are opposed by 
the Clinton administration.  Supporters believe that MSAs will probably be part of a final budget 
agreement. <p>
Conference delegates also called for the 100 percent tax deductibility of health care costs.  Small businesses will most likely see an increase to 50 percent phased in over a seven-
year period.<p>
On an optimistic note, at least small businesses won't have to ward off major proposals 
that increase their taxes or regulatory burden.  The only redflag is the President's proposal to 
raise the minimum wage.  A threat perhaps, but the small business lobby has become too 
powerful to allow this to happen.

<h2>Rhetoric throttles aid for small businesses</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>
</center>
<hr><P>
While some people would have you believe otherwise,
the small-business provisions within the Contract With America
amounted to only minor changes.  Now, even the small-scale tax
and regulatory reforms proposed within the contract have been
watered down.
<P>
Many of the contract's key provisions, such as regulatory relief
and legal reform, have either died in the Senate or have been
put on the back burner until after the protracted budget battle.
<P>
Special-interest groups opposed to tax and budget cuts, as well
as reforms that would make bureaucrats more accountable, have
painted the contract as extreme.  Labor unions alone have pumped
more than $2 million into media ads to decry proposals that &quot;drastically
cut&quot; Medicare and pare back safeguards that protect worker
safety and the environment.
<P>
Medicare reform is a perfect example of how the public has swallowed
distorted ad campaigns without checking the facts.  According
to a recent survey by Public Opinion Strategies, most Americans
are woefully misinformed about the basic facts regarding Medicare
reform proposals.
<P>
Under the GOP plan, Medicare's budget would undergo a slower rate
of growth in spending than under current law.  In fact, if Medicare
reform were left up to the 1,000 Americans who responded to the
Public Opinion Strategies survey, reform opponents would have
had a severe problem on their hands.
<P>
For example, when it was explained that the GOP plan would increase
spending for Medicare by 45 percent over the next seven years
--- twice the projected rate of inflation --- 80 percent of those
polled believed the increase was too high.
<P>
The GOP plan increases spending per recipient from $4,800 to $7,100
over the next seven years.  But when asked what they thought the
GOP plan would do, 27 percent said that the plan would cut spending
below $4,000; 24 percent said spending would remain the same;
and only 22 percent most accurately portrayed the plan --- that
it would increase spending per recipient.
<P>
The problem, according to Medicare reform supporters, is that
the American public has been consistently exposed to misleading
ads and political rhetoric.
<P>
According to Pam Bailey, president of the Healthcare Leadership
Council and co-chair of the Coalition to Save Medicare, President
Clinton's plan was not very different from the GOP's.  Under the
plan approved by Congress, the government would spend $1.65 trillion
on Medicare over seven years.  Under the president's plan, it
would spend $1.682 trillion.
<P>
Political rhetoric can be blamed for the demise of many tax and
regulatory changes that would have benefited millions of small
businesses.   Interest groups supportive of the status quo were
quick to distort Republican proposals, which were supported by
many Democrats as well, as giveaways to big business.
<P>
Sure, big companies would have marginally benefited from the changes
proposed by Republicans.  But small businesses would have been
the main beneficiaries.
<P>
Small businesses will see <I>some</I> tax relief and incentives
soon, but according to most small-business groups, the results
are a big disappointment compared with original expectations.
 Small businesses can probably expect a $25,000 expensing provision,
a capital gains tax reduction and targeted estate tax relief for
family-owned businesses.  The final agreement, however, will mandate
that the tax provisions be phased in over seven years.
<P>
Home office users can say goodbye to efforts this year to clarify
the home-office deduction.  But on a more positive note, the self-employed
will see an increase from 30 percent to 50 percent in the amount
they can deduct for health-care expenses (phased in over seven
years).
<P>
Distortion and political rhetoric may help guardians of the status
quo avoid passing reforms that put the country back on a track
of fiscal stability, while helping millions of small business
owners and entrepreneurs create jobs.  But for these millions
of small business owners, the truth is generally reflected in
their bottom lines, which the government plays a big part in helping
or hindering.

<title>Kerrigan:  Balanced budget means bottom-line gains -- SBSC

<h2>Balanced budget means bottom-line gains</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>
</center>
<hr><P>
 &quot;Balanced budget means bottom-line gains&quot;
Will balancing the federal budget have a real
impact on our economy, or is it merely a populist issue that picks
up votes at the ballot box?
<P>
As Congress and President Clinton bicker over the details of a
seven-year plan to balance the budget, recent public opinion figures
still show widespread support for the effort.
<P>
An early November survey conducted by Alexandria-based Public
Opinion Strategies showed 83 percent of 1,000 registered voters
said it was important to balance the federal budget in the next
seven years.
<P>
At the same time, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin was predicting
wholesale chaos in the financial markets if Congress didn't increase
the federal debt limit.  But 69 percent of those surveyed said
the debt limit should not be increased without a balanced budget
in place.
<P>
Of course, the November deadline passed, Congress and the White
House reached a temporary agreement to re-open government after
a brief shutdown, the country's debt obligations are being paid
and the financial markets appear robust as ever.
<P>
In the end, you may ask:  Does a balanced budget really matter?
 And more importantly, how will a balanced federal budget affect
the livelihood of American families, businesses and individuals?
<P>
A recent crop of economic reports has concluded that balancing
the federal budget will have broad economic benefits and tangible
bottom-line gains for families, individuals and almost all sectors
of the American economy.
<P>
Economists at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank
in Washington, conclude that GOP plan to balance the budget --
with tax cuts -- will lead to greater business investment, higher
earnings per hour and faster economic growth than under current
law.
<P>
Heritage economists found the following would occur  with a balanced
budget in place:
<UL>
<LI>Gross Domestic Product would grow by $10.8 billion more than
under current law in the year 2002;
<LI>there would be an additional $32.1 billion in real disposable
income from 1995 through 2002;
<LI>there would be an additional $66.2 billion in consumption
expenditures from 1995 through 2002;
<LI>there would be an additional $88.2 billion in real non-residential
fixed investment from 1995 through 2002;
<LI>there would be and additional 104,000 housing starts from
1995 through 2002;
<LI>there would be a decrease of .4 percent in the conventional
mortgage rate --- meaning that a homeowner would save about $10,000
over the life of a $100,000, 30-year mortgage;
<LI>auto sales would increase by 600,000 units over the next seven
years --- that's $10 billion worth of cars.
</UL>


<P>
Another report has more good news.
<P>
With the government taking a smaller bite out of the economy,
interest rates should fall dramatically, according to the Senate
Joint Economic Committee.
<P>
A report from the Committee showed that a typical American family
could save nearly $1,800 a year in loan payments if the Republican
plan to balance the budget passes.
<P>
For example, a family with a $75,000 mortgage, a $15,000 auto
loan and an $11,000 student loan could save $1,800 a year if interest
rates drop just one percentage point.
<P>
The national debt of all consumer borrowing for home mortgages
and auto debt is $4.8 trillion --- a 1 percentage point drop in
interest rates would save more than $48 billion per year.
<P>
&quot;Clearly, the benefits of a balanced budget would extent
to all Americans,&quot; says Grover Norquist, president of Americans
for Tax Reform.  With the public still on the side of balancing
the budget, observers believe that the President will accept most
elements of the Republican plan.

<title>Kerrigan:  Are union leader's tactics too divisive? -- SBSC
</title>
</HEAD>

<hr>
<h2>Are union leader's tactics too divisive?</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>

</center><hr><P>
The power wielded by labor unions has deteriorated
in recent years.  Even labor officials admit their political clout
is not what it used to be.
<P>
Lower membership combined with labor officials' inability to aggressively
advance their agenda has caused severe rifts within the labor
movement.  These same factors led to the unprecedented election
of a new AFL-CIO president and probably will lead to more aggressive
organizing strategies.
<P>
On Oct. 25, John Sweeney - then president of the Service Employees
International Union (SEIU) --- defeated acting federation leader
Thomas Donahue for the AFL-CIO presidency.
<P>
Sweeney's win marked a historic moment for the AFL-CIO; his run
for the presidency was the only contested election in the federation's
40-year history.
<P>
As head of the SEIU, Sweeney increased its membership by 37 per
cent.  The SEIU under Sweeney also enjoyed a reputation for effective
organizing and activism --- points labor sees as critical to rebuilding
its political clout.
<P>
While Sweeney's performance at SEIU was striking in comparison
to other unions' activity, the methods used to bolster both its
membership and effectiveness have been questioned not only by
those who were the target of its tactics, but fellow union heads
as well.
<P>
During and after his election, Sweeney forcefully stated that
he will embrace civil disobedience and militancy &quot;if necessary.&quot;
 Sweeney found it necessary to use such tactics at the SEIU and,
based on his past success using such methods, is expected to employ
militant activism at the AFL-CIO.  Sweeney will also have a bigger
budget to work with.
<P>
While most unions spend about 5 percent of their budget on organizing
activities, the SEIU spends five times that amount.  Sweeney promised
to do the same at the AFL-CIO and committed $20 million of its
budget to union organizing efforts.
<P>
In addition to a strategy of funneling money directly to local
unions, Sweeney's goal is to train 1,000 union organizers over
the next two years to assist AFL-CIO members nationwide.
<P>
Metropolitan areas already have a taste for Sweeney's brand of
activism, and union watchers warn that businesses, as well as
local governments, should prepare for this larger campaign of
&quot;in your face&quot; activity.
<P>
For example, the SEIU and its local unions have tried to disrupt
businesses and local governments in the following manner:
<UL>
<LI>To protest cuts in Washington's budget, Justice for Janitors
(a campaign arm of the SEIU) blocked three main highways during
morning rush hour, delaying commuters for two hours.  Other cities
have also experienced this traffic tactic.
<LI>A Detroit SEIU Local protested the popular North American
International Auto Show because it &quot;portrays life in Detroit
as better than it actually is.&quot;
<LI>Noted real estate developers in major cities, including Atlanta
and Washington, have been targeted by the SEIU's Justice for Janitors
because their agenda demands they pay more of their &quot;fair
share&quot; of taxes.
</UL>

<P>
Sweeney has promised to use the &quot;corporate campaign&quot;
with greater frequency to get concessions at the collective bargaining
table that ordinarily would not be forthcoming without outside
pressure.
<P>
The strategies used by unions in corporate campaigns include targeting
a business with intense media pressure --- both earned media and
paid advertising; thwarting critical business plans by organizing
coalitions around their defeat; filing frivolous charges against
a business with government agencies (local, state and federal);
and helping to pass stock-holder resolutions that promote union
crusades.
<P>
The AFL-CIO and Sweeney can also count on the support of the Clinton
Administration and U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich to aid the
AFL-CIO's resuscitation and agenda.
<P>
Clearly, President Clinton must rebuild bridges with labor and
will show a marked interest in its agenda during the upcoming
election year.  Sweeney has promised to punish all elected officials
-- including Democrats -- who do not support labor's objectives.
<P>
Whether Sweeney will succeed in his new role is questionable at
best.  His grand promises to win labor back the political clout
it once had, while simultaneously adding 250,00 workers to its
membership rolls, appear to be a tough road indeed.
<P>
More importantly:  How much is Sweeney willing to alienate labor
from the general public through the use of militant tactics to
achieve short-term objectives?  Not all of labor's rank and file
agree with Sweeney's tactics.
<P>
As former AFL-CIO president Donahue stated in his keynote address
at the convention where he lost the election:  &quot;We must worry
less about building bridges to the rest of society.  We must enlist
the support of the public, not inconvenience as many as possible.&quot;
<P>
The acceleration of unions' decline could indeed quicken under
the AFL-CIO leadership of Sweeney if he chooses the opposite course.

<title>Kerrigan: Superfund Program Needs Its Own Cleanup -- SBSC</title>
</HEAD>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<i>November 1995</i>
<hr>
<h2>Superfund Program Needs Its Own Cleanup</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>
</center>
<hr><P>
 
With broad-based regulatory relief probably on
hold for this year, members of Congress are selecting the most
egregious agencies and programs to reform.
<P>
Superfund  --  a super wast according to its critics  --  is one
such program that has been particularly troublesome to small businesses.
<P>
In its 15-year history, and despite tens of billions of dollars
of both private and public expenditures, only a fraction of the
waste sites targeted by the Environmental Protection Agency under
Superfund have actually been cleaned up.
<P>
The federal government has spent $10 billion on Superfund and
forced private parties to kick in another $80 billion.  According
to a 1994 report in BusinessWeek, only 49 out of 1270 waste sites
&quot;have been completely cleaned up.&quot;
<P>
In theory, the Superfund can be used to clean up a site on the
EPA's National Priority List.  The EPA then tracks down &quot;potentially
responsible parties&quot; and assigns responsibility for waste
site cleanups.
<P>
Often, though, the EPA forces parties to undertake the cleanup
from the start.  Noncompliance without &quot;sufficient cause&quot;
results in a fine of at least $25,000 per day.
<P>
Who are these responsible parties?  Superfund extends the liability
for cleanup to practically any entity that may have a disposed
of waste in the specified EPA site.
<P>
They include large and medium-sized companies.  But they also
include dry cleaners, automobile dealers, butcher shops, pizza
parlors and more.  Nonprofit groups and public entities have also
been caught in the Superfund web -- hospitals, schools and local
governments have been casts as polluters.
<P>
Here are a couple examples of small businesses put under the gun
by the EPA's Superfund program:
<P>
&#183; Formal Ware Rental Services of Tulsa, Okla., was notified
by the EPA that it would be held responsible for the cleanup of
a local Superfund site because it paid someone $14 in 1972 to
haul trash to the site.
<P>
&#183; Bob Novak, owner of the Jolly Butcher Shop, had to fork
over $11,000 originally destined for store improvements, because
the glue from cardboard boxes that he shipped to Ludlow Sanitary
Landfill in New York was deemed hazardous.
<P>
The current liability scheme remains the root of the problem,
according to critics who want to overhaul Superfund.  In determining
liability, the EPA uses illogical criteria.
<P>
Superfund, for example, allows for strict liability that holds
parties accountable regardless of intent or negligence.  The liability
is also retroactive, meaning actions taken before the law was
enacted still apply.  Even if firms were in full compliance of
the law prior to 1980, Superfund still exposes them to liability.
<P>
Joint and several liability also applies under Superfund.  Therefore,
the EPA can require that one business pay for the entire cleanup,
without regard to the degree of its own contribution to the waste
site and without total consideration tot the total number of contributors.
<P>
No concept of fair share exists under Superfund.  A business targeted
 by the EPA for cleanup naturally files lawsuits against other
businesses connected to the waste site.  All parties then tend
to turn to their insurance companies for reimbursement.
<P>
In addition, the type of waste disposed of by a firm is not factored
into the liability scheme.  A firm depositing fairly innocuous
materials may still be held liable.
<P>
Lawyers benefit handsomely from the Superfund quagmire.  It's
claimed that as much as one-third of Superfund money pays for
legal fees alone.  
<P>
Several congressional committees, including the House Small Business
Committee, are starting their hearings on Superfund reform.
<P>
The &quot;Superfund Liability Equity and Acceleration Act,&quot;
which repeals the law's retroactive liability provisions and replaces
the joint and several liability standard, was recently introduced.
 Parties will be held liable for the amount they contributed and
no more.
<P>
Small businesses and taxpayers may begin to rest easier at night
knowing that the weekly task of putting out the garbage may be
less of a liability with forthcoming congressional action.  Perhaps
the environment will actually get cleaned up as well.

<title>Kerrigan:  Capital Gains Tax Cut Needs Inflation Hedge -- SBSC</title>
</HEAD>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<i>October 1995</i>
<hr>
<h2> Capital Gains Tax Cut Needs Inflation Hedge</h2>
by Karen Kerrigan
<P>
</center>
<hr><P>
A cut in the capital gains tax is almost assured
this year.  Both the House and Senate are committed to the reduction,
and despite President Clinton's &quot;tax cuts for the rich&quot;
rhetoric, even he has hinted at supporting a capital gains tax
cut.  The House has passed legislation reducing the capital gains
tax from its current top level of 28 percent to 19.8 percent and
indexing the rate for inflation.  The measure calls for prospective
indexing (calculated from Jan. 1, 1995) on assets held for at
least three years.
<P>
It's expected that the Senate will pass a similar bill calling
for a 50 percent exclusion on capital gains income.  However,
it's unknown whether the Senate's version will allow taxpayers
to index for inflation.
<P>
According to investment experts and economists who favor cutting
(and eliminating) capital gains taxes, a huge expanse exists between
non-indexed and indexed capital gains tax rates.
<P>
Inflations can be a tax in itself by eroding purchasing power,
savings and investments.  The current nominal capital gains tax
rate is 28 percent.  However, when inflation is factored into
the capital gains equation, the real capital gains tax rate rises
substantially.
<P>
For example, on an investment with a one-year return of 10 percent,
assuming a 3 percent inflation rate, the non-indexed 28 percent
capital gains tax rate jumps to an inflation-adjusted rate of
40 percent.
<P>
Even with the proposed non-indexed rate of 19.8 percent, the real
rate on such an investment leaps to 28.3 percent.  And if inflation
reaches 5 percent, the rate doubles from 19.8 percent to 39.6
percent.
<P>
&quot;Lower rates of return and/or higher rates of inflation will
translate into even higher real capital gains tax rates,&quot;
says Ray Keating, chief economist of the Small Business Survival
Foundation.  &quot;These real capital gains tax rates act as severe
disincentives to investment and entrepreneurship,&quot; Keating
adds.
<P>
Without indexation, the government ends up taxing illusory profits.
 In fact, some individuals can wind up paying taxes on real capital
losses.  That is, after factoring for inflation, a nominal profit
on a transaction can turn out to be a real loss, yet the investor
still pays taxes on the nominal gain.
<P>
An investor's willingness to invest is substantially hindered
by taxing capital gains.  According to Keating and other economists,
indexation would eliminate inflation as a factor in capital gains
determination  --  equalizing stated and real capital gains tax
rate.
<P>
The lower real rate would reduce uncertainty and generate investment,
economic growth and job creation.
<P>
If non-indexation is so unfair, they why isn't its passage guaranteed
as part of a capital gains tax reduction?  The apparent roadblocks
are money and complexity.
<P>
Although history has shown that reducing capital gains tax rates
actually yields higher revenue for the U.S. Treasury, budget leaders
in the Senate are advocating an agenda of &quot;revenue neutrality&quot;
 -- meaning that for every dollar of tax cuts, a dollar of spending
cuts must be enacted in order to balance the budget by 2002.
<P>
Accordingly, indexing capital gains tax rates for inflation will
cost the government more money, meaning political leaders will
have to cut spending more deeply.
<P>
Opponents also claim that indexing is too complicated for taxpayers
to figure out.  In reality, indexation would require merely one
additional step of multiplication for taxpayers.
<P>
&quot;If taxpayers in Great Britain and Australia can deal with
indexing, I'm sure U.S. taxpayers can as well,&quot; responds
Keating.  Keating adds that if the complexity of indexation is
so troubling to our elected officials, then the most simple reform
is still available -- elimination of the capital gains tax.
<P>
Since late last year, investors have been counting on the capital
gains tax proposal offered by the House.  According to investment
experts, the failure to deliver on the tax cut would be a blow
to capital markets.
<P>
Keating points out that start-up and high-growth companies would
particularly be hurt, noting that the potential returns on high-risk
investments would be lower --- therefore, so would equity prices.
 Trillions of dollars of locked-up capital would not be available
for investment opportunities.
<P>
Venture capital, whether raised from one's family and friends
or from professional investors, remains a critical source of funding
for entrepreneurial  enterprises.
<P>
More often than not, small-business funding comes from someone
the entrepreneur knows.
<P>
Although lowering capital gains tax rates provides an additional
incentive to investors in prospective high-risk ventures, inflation
still remains a silent force working against an entrepreneurial
boom.
<P>
With a new majority in Congress advocating &quot;tax fairness,&quot;
indexing capital gains for inflation is not only fair, but good
for economic growth as well.

<title>SBB:  Spectrum Auctions Could Help Lower Deficit</title>

<h2>Spectrum Auctions Could Help Lower Deficit</h2>
                                                     </center>
<hr>

October 1995 --  The communications revolution has played a pivotal role in how America does business and impacts the personal lives of most Americans.  As Congress looks for ways to reduce the federal deficit, a debate has surfaced over the use of our nation's airwaves -- otherwise known as the "spectrum." 
<P>
Only twenty years ago, the average person could probably only identify a few uses of the spectrum -- namely broadcast television and  radio.  With technological advancements, though, have come more uses of the spectrum.  For example satellite TV, wireless computer networks and cellular phones all utilize the nation's airwaves.  And, the technological boom has caused the spectrum to jump in value.
<P>
Recognizing a handsome revenue source for the federal government, Congress in 1993 mandated that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auction all licenses for new spectrum uses.   Recent auctions for the Personal Communications Services spectrum have raised more than $8 billion.  And, as budgetary pressures continue to bear down on the 104th Congress, spectrum auctions are being closely examined because of their revenue potential.
<P>
House and Senate Commerce Committees in the 104th Congress have been charged with raising $14 billion to help balance the budget by 2002.  Over the past several weeks, congressional hearings have revealed several areas that can be targeted to meet these tight revenue requirements.
<P>
A controversial but lucrative target for auctions are the airwaves now set-a-side for television broadcasters to develop high-definition television (HDTV).  In 1991, the FCC allocated six megahertz of extra spectrum for the broadcasters to make the transition to HDTV.  
<P>
After the switch, the broadcasters would then hand back their current channel, now used for analog TV transmission.  	But technology and the market outsmarted bureaucrats in Washington.  With technological gains, broadcasters can now provide digital (but not high definition) television utilizing a fraction of the airwaves.  In other words, rather than providing just one channel of HDTV, the broadcasters have the capability for multiple channels of digital television, while leaving space for other lucrative services.      
    
<P>
While the broadcasters still maintain that they will continue to develop HDTV with the allocated airwaves, they have also asked for "spectrum flexibility."
<P>
The flexibility will allow them to use the extra airwaves for any number of telecommunications services:  Six new channels of television, or 72 compact-disc quality radio signals, or cellular phone services, or interactive data services, or they can mix and match.
<P>
This proposal, however, does not sit well with telecommunication companies that have been required to purchase airwaves through auctions.  They view spectrum flexibility for broadcasters as a special government giveaway.
<P>
In a recent letter to Congress, the president of Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA), Thomas A. Wheeler, expressed "shock and dismay as the broadcasters seek to ram through the Congress a special deal" that allows them to obtain new spectrum for free, while the wireless industry has had to pay $8 billion.
<P>
Like the broadcasters, members of CTIA did receive their initial spectrum allocation for free, but all subsequent wireless telecommunications spectrum has been acquired through auctions.    The broadcasters claim that they have been singled out, and the government has plenty of warehoused spectrum that should be auctioned off first before the broadcasting industry is disrupted.
<P>
The broadcasters also weigh in with their public-service responsibilities as an argument to exempt them from auctions.  And, they claim financial hardship in competing with other telecommunication industry players.
<P>
"If the spectrum earmarked for the transition to digital is auctioned, it will destroy the ability of local television stations to stay in business as the communications market moves to digital technology," Robert Wright, CEO of NBC, told the Senate Commerce Committee.     
<P>
Faye Anderson, Executive Director of the Council of 100, a national network of African-American Republicans, questions the broadcasters' claim of financial hardship, and the assertion that the government is sitting on a valuable reserve of spectrum.
<P>
Anderson points to the multi-billion dollar deals involving Disney's purchase of ABC/Cap Cities, and Westinghouse's bid for CBS to counter the argument that the broadcasters will not be able to compete in spectrum auctions because of a lack of capital.
<P>
Just how much money can be raised from the sale of the HDTV airwaves?    According to John Reidy, a managing director at the brokerage firm Smith Barney, Inc., who testified before the Senate Commerce Committee, $30 billion could go to the U.S. Treasury from the auctions.  Other experts say $30 billion is conservative.
<P>
With other important matters budgetary matters before Congress (such Medicare and welfare reform), industry observers and advocacy organizations are carefully following the spectrum issue as a barometer for "true change" in the Congress.

<title>SBB: Maximum Opposition to Minimum Wage Increase </title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><center><h2> Maximum Opposition to Minimum Wage Increase </h2>                                                     </center><hr>



September 1995 - Almost three years ago, then presidential candidate Bill Clinton stated that increasing the minimum wage is "the wrong way to raise the incomes of low-wage earners."  The wrong way back then, but the right way now as increasing the minimum wage is viewed as a politically popular strategy to reconnect with the Democrat's traditional base of working class Americans.
<P>
While most economists agree that minimum wage increases do more economic harm than good (both for workers and the economy), President Clinton has proposed a 21 percent increase from $4.25 to $5.15 an hour.
<P>
Democratic party leaders in the Congress are also working feverishly to include a minimum wage hike into welfare reform proposals, presumably to be acted upon this fall.
<P>
Studies conducted over the past 25 years have consistently concluded that with each 10 percent increase in the minimum wage, a corresponding 1 percent to 2 percent decline in entry-level employment results.  The General Accounting Office, the Brookings Institution, the Employment Policies Institute Foundation, the Congressional Budget Office and various Presidential Commission's have all reached this universal conclusion.
<P>
Even the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), the "New Democrat" organization once led by the President, declared that "the minimum wage can be allowed to fade into history."
    <P>
As minimum wage hike proponents pose the issue as improving the living wage of lower-income workers, most businesses and their workers view minimum wage jobs as entry-level positions -- by which the majority of workers gain skills to move onto higher-paying work.
<P>
An independent study in 1992 demonstrated that within a 12 month period, 63 percent of American workers at the minimum wage earned higher wages.   Not surprisingly, about half of minimum wage employees were either young adults under the age of 21, or teenagers.
<P>
According to a study by The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank in Washington, D.C., raising the minimum wage emotionally appeals to most Americans, but doing it would be a mistake.
<P>
According to the foundation study:
<P><ul>
<li>Raising the minimum wage will harm the nonworking poor by raising prices and destroying entry-level job opportunities.
<li>Raising the minimum wage does not generally help low-income households -- the increased income from minimum wage jobs would mostly go to families far above the poverty level, not to poor minimum wage workers.
<li>Employers will respond to a minimum wage increase by cutbacks in hiring, reducing workers' hours, or lowering pay and benefits and skipping pay raises -- responses that hurt, not help, workers.
<li>A $5.15 increase in the minimum wage will result in approximately 400,000 lost entry-level jobs.  A wage increase may result in more skilled workers being enticed into the job market, but fewer unskilled job opportunities (entry-level jobs) would be available.</ul>         
<P>
Grant Maloy, a small business operator from Orlando, Fl., testified earlier in the year before the Joint Economic Committee on the President's proposal to raise the minimum wage.  As the owner of a wholesale foliage nursery, Maloy stated that his industry pays $5.24 for entry-level work, well above the minimum wage.
<P>
"Wages have increased because of pressure both within the industry and from other industries, as well as the need to keep quality employees.  How is it possible that one central government can know what millions of businesses can afford to pay?  The answer is they can't," says Maloy.
<P>
According to Maloy, minimum wage policy is insincere.  While the government expects a business owner to pay a minimum wage, the owner himself may be making much less.  Maloy estimated that he was making about $2.00 an hour when he started his business.
<P>
Surveys of the American public continue to show widespread support for increasing the minimum wage, and in 1989 Congress overwhelmingly backed the last minimum wage increase -- more than 90 percent voted in favor of the hike.
<P>
Political experts agree that if a proposal to increase the minimum wage makes its way to the House or Senate floor for a vote, it may pass.  No member in Congress wants to be labeled as "anti-worker" despite the widespread research showing the negative effects of increasing the minimum wage on those it purportedly is supposed to help.
<P>
On the other hand, the public's dissatisfaction with Washington and misguided government attempts to solve every problem may indeed resonate with the minimum wage issue as well.
<P>
More importantly however, is how the public will view the President's proposal.  Is the President proposing to raise the minimum wage to truly help the working poor?  Or will the public perceive his proposal as a political ploy to gain votes in 1996.
<P>
What remains certain though, is the growing universal belief that the minimum wage does little for increasing job opportunities for those who need it most.

<title>SBB:  FDA's Stubborn Inefficiency is Killing Business and Jobs                                                                                                </title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><center>
<h2>FDA's Stubborn Inefficiency is Killing Business and Jobs</h2>                                                 </center>
<HR>
September 1995 -- The 104th Congress is leaving no stone unturned in terms of its examination of federal government agencies.  OSHA, EPA, IRS, FBI, ATF, EEOC, and other agencies are being probed for inefficiency and counterproductive impact on American business.
<P>
Included in this review is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -- long held in high regard by the American public.
<P>
The FDA has squandered its goodwill with the industries it regulates, as well as with patient groups and politicians from Democratic and Republican camps for its growing inefficiency and unaccountability.  One major criticism, concerns FDA's severe shortcomings in approving new drugs and medical devices.
<P>
Breakthrough medical devices, for example, face lengthy approval times.  Although FDA guidelines maintain that the approval process is supposed to be completed within 180 days, independent studies have revealed that actual approval periods take anywhere from 437 to 840 days.
<P>
In testimony before the House Joint Economic Committee in 1994, Robert DeHaven of the American Electronics Association (AEA) testified that the FDA's "inordinately slow" regulatory process was threatening "the global competitiveness" of the medical device industry -- a $70 billion industry with more than 11,000 companies.
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the AEA found that 40 percent of medical device firms reduced their number of U.S. employees because of FDA delays, 29 percent boosted investment in foreign operations, and 22 percent moved U.S. jobs out of the country.
<P>
Robert Higgs, in a report for the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), notes that medical technology firms invested about $321-$333 million abroad annually from 1989 to 1991.  In 1992, though, "when the FDA abruptly made its enforcement and approval policies more onerous, capital outflow jumped more than 200 percent to $993 million."  
<P>
Along with the export of capital to international shores goes American innovation, entrepreneurship, high-paying jobs and our best growth industries say critics.
<P>
"The FDA seems more intent on exporting American ingenuity and entrepreneurship, rather than encouraging the production of U.S.-made drugs and medical devices," says Raymond Keating, chief economist with the Small Business Survival Committee.
<P>
U.S. pharmaceutical companies also face the same regulatory maze and bureaucratic gridlock as medical device companies.  Although established drug companies have learned how to deal with the FDA's red tape, longer approval periods mean higher development costs, which translate into higher drug prices for consumers.
<P>
Between 1986 and 1993, the median approval time for generic drug applications increased from 12 months to 38 months.  These time periods exclude FDA requirements placed on firms that extend development time.
<P>
In a study conducted by researchers at Tufts University for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America,  drugs originating here often are available in foreign markets many years before becoming availability in the U.S.  For example, of all drugs approved in the U.S., 12 percent had been available in foreign markets for six to 10 years, and another 9 percent for more than a decade.
<P>
Despite the drug approval lag, safety does not appear to be enhanced in the U.S.  According to the Tufts study, although Great Britain gets drugs to market quicker that the U.S., safety discontinuations as a percentage of total new drug introductions are similar in each country -- 4 percent in Great Britain and 3 percent in the U.S.
<P>
As reports and criticism mount against the FDA, its staff and defenders contend that the agency is in dire need of more funds to keep up with its workload.  A look at the FDA's budget growth over the years shows that from 1989 to 1994, real FDA budget authority increased by 52.6 percent -- or by an average annual real rate of more than 10.5 percent.  FDA's 1994 budget was just more than $900 million.
<P>
During those same years, the number  of employees grew by a substantial 25.3 percent, totaling more than 9,000.   Critics claim American taxpayers are paying more to get less.
<P>
Of course, a multitude of other industries are impacted by FDA regulation:  food, cosmetic, restaurant, retail druggist, manufacturers of medical devices and now the tobacco  industry has its own gripes about the FDA's heavy-handedness.
<P>
The key for Congress is balancing the concerns of the American public that the FDA preserve and protect the public health, with the concerns of business that the FDA's inefficiency has gone to far -- costing Americans jobs, as well as access to breakthrough drugs and medical devices.
<P>
Critics claim that FDA Commissioner Dr. David Kessler has spent too much time on aggressive enforcement and investigation of businesses rather than cooperating with the industries he regulates to move the approval process along in a timely manner.
<P>
Former FDA officials also cite Commissioner Kessler's obsession with regulating tobacco at the expense of other agency responsibilities.   A former chief FDA investigator sent a letter to the U.S. House Commerce Committee stating that, for example, the FDA's foreign inspection program was a "disaster waiting to happen."
<P>
According to a Washington, D.C. newspaper, the same official said that he attempted to meet with and contact Kessler several times on important matters " and was told by his secretary that if my topic was anything other than cigarettes, the commissioner would have no time for me."        
<P>
    With the FDA under attack from industry, Congress and patients groups who want faster approval times for life-saving drugs and medical devices, the agency may begin to change course and reinvent itself.   However, under mounting criticism from these constituencies, Congress itself may devise an FDA reform bill that forces  Kessler and his staff to put their time and resources into more productive efforts that save lives, American jobs and entire industries.

<title>Time to cut the fat out of Davis-Bacon Act</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center>
<h2>Time to cut the fat out of Davis-Bacon Act</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
August 1995 - Early this summer, the National Policy Forum, a Washington-based
Republican think tank, released its Agenda for Small Business  --- a seven-point plan to ensurethe vitality and prosperity of the small-business, entrepreneurial sector.  The plan includes tax and regulatory relief, capital access measures, tort reform and several other proposals near and dear to small business.<p>
Item No. 7 on NPF's agenda is a very specific reform aimed at helping small businesses compete for federally funded construction projects.  It calls for the elimination of the Davis-Bacon Act.<p>
The Davis-Bacon Act mandates that a "prevailing wage" be paid to all workers on
federally funded construction projects in excess of $2,000.  The U.S. Department of Labor sets these wage rates for thousands of job classifications in scores of regions across the country.<p>
The Coalition to Repeal Davis-Bacon, a coalition of nearly 70 organizations ranging from the National School Boards Association to Citizens Against Government Waste, claims that prevailing wage rates are vastly inflated and generally reflect union rates.<p>
And the Congressional Budget Office estimated in 1995 that the Davis-Bacon act raises construction costs by at least $2.7 billion over five years.<p>
What's more, according to David Thompson, a Washington attorney specializing in labor law, Davis-Bacon creates an artificial market in which only large companies can compete.<p>
"Excessive paperwork requirements, arbitrary work rules and classifications and bloatedpay scales block access for small companies.  The law creates an unrealistic environment in which small local companies cannot afford to participate," says Thompson.<p>
Union leaders say wage rates set by the Labor Department do reflect market wage rates.  However, an investigative report done by the state of Oklahoma suggests that the wage surveying process itself may be corrupt.<p>
The report concludes that fraudulent wage data was submitted to the U.S. Department of Labor to "influence the outcome of U.S. Department of Labor wage surveys and, consequently, to take advantage of the taxpayers."<p>
In the voluntary wage-surveying process, any group or individual can submit completed
projects to help the Labor Department make its wage decisions.  In one example of fraud, asurvey claimed that 20 employees, compensated at $21.05 per hour, worked on a $2 million underground storage tank.  The investigation found that tank was never built.<p>
According to Oklahoma officials, if this type of fraudulent practice is occurring in one
place, it's probably occurring in others.<p>
"The prevailing wage law is premised on the false assumption that the government can
accurately determine what wage is prevailing.  There's no reasonable way to obtain true
prevailing wage information and therefore the entire system must be scrapped," says Ike Casey, executive vice president of Independent Electrical Contractors Inc.<p>
Members of Congress who support repealing Davis-Bacon contend that the market is the best determinant of wage rates.  That's why efforts for repeal are quickly moving through the House and Senate.  Senator Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.) has pushed a repeal bill through the Labor and Human Resources Committee, while legislation moving through the House is on an identical track.<p>
Repealing the Davis-Bacon will not be easy.  Labor unions and other beneficiaries of
Davis-Bacon will aggressively lobby Congress with a very effective argument  --- a vote to repeal Davis-Bacon is a vote to "cut our wages."<p>
Labor unions believe keeping Davis-Bacon is in all workers' interest, while supporters of
repeal feel it protects a privileged few at the expense of taxpayers.<p>

<title>A New Test For Independent Contractors</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center>
<h2>A New Test For Independent Contractors</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
August 1995 - There is plenty about the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that raises the ire of small business owners and entrepreneurs.  The 20-factor test utilized by the IRS to delineate between independent contractors and employees is one such issue causing both confusion and agitation.<p>
Clarifying the status of independent contractors has long been a concern for small
businesses and the self-employed.  The need for the IRS to provide a more concise, objective standard for independent contractors was the priority issue voted on by thousands of delegates at The White House Conference on Small Business earlier this summer.<p>
Rep. Linda Smith (R-Wash.), chairman of the Subcommittee on Taxation and Finance of the Small Business Committee, recently held hearings on the complexity of the issue as well as proposed legislation to amend the criteria used by the IRS.<p>
"For too long, the IRS has been retarding job growth and business expansion because of fear it will re-classify independent contractors as employees," said Smith in announcing her hearings.<p>
Rep. Jon Christensen (R-Neb.) agrees with Rep. Smith, and testified on legislation he
sponsored, the Independent Contractor Tax Simplification Act -- a bill to modify and simplify the 20-factor test.<p>
"Almost everyone will agree that the 20-factor test is unclear and far too subjective.  It is quite possible to take two seemingly identical situations and find employee status in one, and independent contractor in another.  Nevertheless, in recent years the IRS has bludgeoned small businesses over the head with the 20-factor test," said Christensen.<p>

     Indeed many individuals who prefer to work as independent contractors have had their status challenged by the IRS.  Even though it may be an individual's choice to work autonomously, the test used by the IRS may re-classify them as an employee, causing back-taxes and penalties for the business contracting with the individual.<p> 
According to one recent study, the IRS has reclassified 439,000 independent workers
since the mid-1980s, resulting in the collection of $678 million in taxes and fines.  The IRS simply states that it is only doing a very tough job -- it attributes about $2 billion in lost revenues to employers who wrongly misclassify workers.<p>
Christensen's bill would not eliminate the 20-factor test, but simply provides an
alternative for those who comply with all income reporting requirements.  Rather than attempting to determine who is an employee, Christensen's legislation defines who is not an employee.<p>
"It establishes distinct, clear and objective criteria for those seeking to perform services as an independent contractor," says Christensen.<p>
The three-part test established by Christensen requires that an independent contractor
demonstrate independence, investment in his or her business, and a written agreement between the parties.<p>
While Part Three of the test, Contract, is easy to establish, demonstrating independence and investment each have several sub-tests.  The independent contractor is required to meet only one criterion of the sub-tests to satisfy that portion of the test. <p>  
For example, Part One of the three-part test is Investment.  The individual would have to satisfy one of the following sub-tests to satisfy Part One.  Does the individual:<p>
(1)  have a significant investment in training or assets; or<br>
(2)  incur significant unreimbursed expenses; or<br>
(3)  agree to work for a specific time or complete a specific result, and is liable for<br>
damages for failure to perform; or<br>
(4)  receive compensation primarily on a commission basis; or<br>
(5)  purchase a product for resale?<p>     
Under Part Two of the test, the independent contractor would also be required to meet 
one of several subtests to satisfy his or her independence.  <p>
If, however, the independent contractor and the business for whom services are being
provided do not comply with income reporting rules, the 20-factor test would apply to their business relationship.<p>
Acknowledging problems with worker classification, the IRS has developed reforms of
its own to deal with the controversial issue.  On August 2, it released a set of initiatives.<p>
"I've spent a lot of time talking with small businesses who believe this is a big
problem...We can do better, and will do better in handling worker classification issues," said IRS Commissioner Margaret Richardson in a statement.<p>
In order to improve the administration of worker classification, the IRS would provide
greater training for their auditors, consolidate the review process when employers challenge the status of worker determinations, and better coordinate national enforcement to ensure consistency of worker classification by industry and region.  Anything else, says the IRS, can only be implemented through legislation.<p>
Critics contend the IRS initiatives are weak and meaningless.<p>
"I'm very concerned that the administrative programs the IRS may wish to strengthen, are actually part of the problem because there are still no clear rules for implementing them," said Chairman Smith.<p>
As technology and corporate downsizing continue to shape the independent workforce, the IRS will eventually be forced to simplify and clarify the status of independent contractors.  If the IRS doesn't, it will literally take an act of Congress to change the bias against independent contractors.  That change, is well under way.<p>

<title>OSHA Has Forgotten its Original Purpose</title>

<h2>OSHA Has Forgotten its Original Purpose</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
July 1995 - Business owners who've experienced an OSHA inspection get very emotional when talking about the government agency whose job it is to ensure that America's workplaces are safe and hazard-free.  According to many of these businesses, inspectors create a no-win situation by playing a "gothcha-game," with OSHA finding fault no matter how safe the work environment.<p>
Critics of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) claim that the agency has
completely turned away from advising on, and promoting workplace safety and health.  OSHA, claims business, is a complete adversary of business.<p>
According to Rep. Cass Ballenger (R-NC), Chairman of the Workforce Protections
Committee of the U.S. House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities, OSHA's mission is enforcement driven -- find violations and issue penalties.<p>  
"In my view, nothing illustrates how OSHA has gone off the track more clearly than the
fact that today few, if any, employers would ever call OSHA and ask for assistance or advice on workplace safety or health," said Ballenger when introducing H.R. 1834, an OSHA reform bill. <p>
Called the "Safety and Health Improvement and Regulatory Act of 1995," Ballenger
thoroughly aims to change the way OSHA operates.<p>
A key reform of H.R. 1834 allows businesses to correct violations found by OSHA,
without paying a penalty when the citation is issued.  If a business fails to take corrective action, only then will a fine result -- not the situation today.<p>   
"It does not matter whether the violation is not threatening to any employees.  Nor does it matter whether the employer knew of the regulation -- he or she is presumed to know all of what is printed in the Federal Register, and the unending "compliance directives" from Washington," said Ballenger.<p>
Many businesses hire OSHA consultants in preparation for an inspection.  Even so,
inspectors generally find something wrong and a monetary fine is usually issued.  This is unfair according to Ballenger, and under his plan OSHA will work with employers to identify and correct hazards.<p>
Ballenger's subcommittee recently began holding hearings on OSHA reform, and heard from both supporters and detractors of  H.R. 1834.  Business organizations were extremely supportive of the measure, while representatives from organized labor were not pleased.<p>
Thomas Donahue, Secretary-Treasurer of the AFL-CIO ripped apart the measure by
calling it a "cruel and regressive measure that puts workers' lives in danger."<p>
"It [H.R. 1834] presumes that employers will act responsibly on their own, without
government oversight or intervention, in the best interest of workers, despite a long history demonstrating this not be the case for many employers," testified Donahue.<p>
Ballenger's bill does not remove enforcement, but shifts the balance 50-50 with non-enforcement efforts to be phased-in over three years.<p>
Expansion of non-enforcement programs in H.R. 1834 include:<p>
<ul>
<li>State consultation grant programs for on-site assistance to small businesses in high hazard industries.
<li>Increasing OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP)  -- which recognizes employers with exemplary safety programs and records, and grants exemptions from enforcement inspections.
<li>An emphasis on training and education to promote safe work practices for both
employers and employees.
<li>A new certification program to allow individuals to conduct workplace inspections.  A
business would not be inspected by OSHA as long as the business remained 
accident-free and had no employee complaints.<p></ul>
The Clinton Administration has also heard an earful from both employers and members
of Congress regarding OSHA's heavy hand.  In response to political pressure, and criticism from the business community, OSHA lowered financial penalty rates that were vastly increased by Labor Secretary Robert Reich.  OSHA assistant secretary Joseph Dear will not pursue controversial ergonomic rules which the agency has been preparing for years.<p>  
And, the Administration has put forward its own reform initiative that would "reinvent"
OSHA.  While recognizing the need for changes in OSHA, President Clinton believes
Republican plans go way beyond reform. <p>
"They're [Republicans] not trying to reform the system of worker protection as we are,
but instead to dismantle it," said Clinton.<p>
The Congress is scheduled to have more hearings on OSHA reform -- not soon enough for business groups who must deal with sometimes silly and outrageous regulations. <p>
The National Roofing Contractors Association (NRCA), for example, has its own top-ten list of "favorite" roofing regulations.  Eight out of ten are OSHA inflicted.  For example, OSHA's rules:<p>
<ul>
<li>Prohibits gum chewing while roofing. 
<li>Require the posting of signs saying respirators are required even when they are not. 
<li>Require employers to train employees on hazards of exposure to deadly materials like chalk, lumber and dishwashing detergent.
<li>Fines employer if a roofer smokes on the job. <p></ul>
...and the list continues.<p>
According to Washington business leaders, the time has come to reform OSHA.  Craig
Brightup, Vice President of Government Relations at NRCA, says changes are long overdue.<p>
"Over the past 20 years, the very foundation of OSHA has held business completely in
the pejorative. They believe business cannot be trusted to implement meaningful health and safety programs themselves, and this is simply not true," says Brightup.<p>   
According to Brightup, H.R. 1834 is designed to reward and support businesses who
make a good faith effort, which most employers do.
While everyone, except organized labor, believe OSHA must be reformed, the question
remains as to how far the President will go to make the agency less burdensome.  With the '96 election cycle moving quickly upon us, the Administration needs the support of labor at the ballot box making business groups wary of the President's intentions.<p>

<title>Is It Time to Eliminate the Commerce Department?</title>
</head>
<center>
<h2>Is it Time to Eliminate the Commerce Department?</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
July 1995 - Former Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher recently referred to his old Department as "nothing more than a hall closet where you throw in everything that you don't know what to do with."  Presumably, Washington budget-cutters agree and have decided that its time to clean out the Department of Commerce's closet. <p>
The U.S. House and Senate recently passed balance budget resolutions that would erase the deficit in seven years.   The budget-cutting ax has been broadly wielded, cutting and eliminating many government programs and agencies which have traditionally  benefitted American business.  The Department of Commerce is one such program targeted for elimination by both the House and Senate budget plans.<p>
The Commerce Department has long been a target of conservative budget cutters who see the department as wasteful, inefficient and duplicative of other programs.<p>
The government's own watchdog agency, the Government Accounting Office (GAO),
uncharitably describes Commerce as well.  GAO reports that the department "faces the most complex web of divided authorities" sharing its "mission with at least 71 federal department, agencies and offices."  More than 60 percent of its budget is allotted to programs entirely unrelated to its mission.<p>
Legislation proposed in the House and Senate would eliminate most  of Commerce, while transferring, consolidating and privatizing its useful functions.  Rep. Dick Chrysler (R-Mich.) recently introduced "The Department of Commerce Dismantling Act of 1995" in the House, while Sens. Spencer Abraham (R-Mich.) and Lauch Faircloth (R-NC) introduced a companion bill in the Senate.<p>
"This is not just a reckless effort to slash programs for the sake of cutting government," said Chrysler.  Chrysler chaired a three month effort in the House to study and examine the Commerce Department.<p>
"If we found that a program was duplicative, we consolidated it.  If a program was better performed by the private sector, we privatized it.  If it was beneficial, we streamlined it," added Chrysler.<p>
In addition, programs found wasteful were eliminated.  The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that both Senate and House Commerce Department elimination measures would save taxpayers more than $7.765 billion over five years.<p>
What parts of Commerce would be eliminated, while others salvaged under the
Department of Commerce Dismantling Act of 1995?  Highlights include:<p>
<ul>
<li>Administrative functions of Commerce and the Office of the Secretary, General Counsel and Inspector General -- eliminated.  <b>Estimated savings -- $250 million.</b>
<li>Minority Business Development Agency -- eliminated.  Found to be duplicative of the functions of the Small Business Administration and private sector.<b>  Estimated savings -- $1.139 billion.</b>
<li>United States Travel and Tourism Administration -- eliminated.  Promotional activities already considered performed by the private sector, states, localities and public sector organizations.<b>  Estimated savings -- $75 million.</b>
<li>Technology Administration.  Gone are programs that specifically fund applied research  programs, and invest taxpayer dollars in new technology promotion.  The National Technical Information Service is privatized while the weights and measure functions of the National Institutes for Standards and Technology is transferred to the National Science Foundation.<b> Estimated Savings -- $1.872 billion.</b>
<li>Patent and Trade Office.  Transferred to Justice Department and supported through fees.<b>Estimated Savings -- $375 million.</b>
<li>Economic and Statistics Administration.  Bureau of Census transferred to Justice.  Bureau of Economic Analysis transferred to the Federal Reserve System. <b> Estimated Savings: $827 million.</b>
<li>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which accounts for more than 40 percent of Commerce's budget, would have its various functions privatized and
transferred to more appropriate agencies. <b> Estimated savings:  $2.338 billion.</b>
<li>Export and Trade Administration functions would largely be transferred to the Office of Trade Representative while other miscellaneous duties eliminated.  <b>Estimated savings -- $385 million.</b></ul><p>                   
The threat of closing Commerce's door has not brought with it a firestorm of protest from the Washington business lobby.  While some business leaders see the elimination of Commerce as the price to pay for a more fiscally sound government, others have remained silent on the prospects of its closure. <p>
A recent private survey conducted by Business Week magazine, however, found that 69 percent of  business CEO's  it polled favored eliminating the department.<p>
Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown remains the biggest advocate of preserving the
department.  In his efforts to save Commerce, Brown contends that the department is crucial to business and U.S. competitiveness.  Brown also believes that eliminating Commerce would leave a void for business in the Administration.<p>
"These plans to cut Commerce would eliminate business' voice at the Cabinet table just when we have created the most successful public-private partnership relationship in history," remarked Brown.<p>
Critics of  the Clinton Administration do not view Brown's presence during Cabinet
meetings as having been beneficial for business.<p>
Richard Rahn, Chairman of the Business Leadership Council remarked that "It's a sad commentary on the Clinton Administration when only one cabinet member thinks he represents the interests of business.   Secretary Brown is a spokesman for only a fraction of the business community.  All Cabinet members should have a shared agenda of economic growth and job creation through policies that include lower taxes and reduced regulations, a real pro-business agenda -- an agenda we have not seen from Mr. Brown or the Clinton Administration." <p>
With hardly a whimper from the business community to keep the doors of Commerce open, elimination may happen.  But President Clinton and Secretary Brown have made several political friends through Commerce Department activities (such as private trade missions abroad) and may ask those who benefitted to turn up the heat on Congress to stop its door from shutting for good.<p>

<title>SBB:  Worker Database Could Cost Businesses Billions</title>
</head>

<h2>Worker Database Could Cost Businesses Billions</h2>
<p>
</center>

<hr>
<p>
<b>Washington, D.C.</b> -- Nearly 4 million illegal aliens are living permanently in the United States. In response to a growing problem, momentum is building in Congress to create a national worker database which would verify the employment eligibility of all U.S. citizens and eligible immigrants.<p>

	Critics of the proposed system have voiced concern that a worker registry would cost taxpayers billions while adding an expensive regulatory condition on U.S. businesses.<p>

	At a time when elected officials are aiming to lift regulatory burdens on U.S. business, the critics say a worker registry would create more paperwork, cause more delays interfere with hiring decisions and spawn legal concerns because of unchartered civil rights issues.<p>

	The national worker registry was recommended by the Commission on Immigration Reform -- more widely known as the Jordan Commission -- chaired by former Rep. Barbara Jordan. The worker registry would be created by merging the databases of the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).<p>

	Legislation proposed by Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY), Chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, would require employers to call the worker registry system to verify that an applicant is legally authorized to work.<p>

	A forthcoming proposal in the House by Lamar Smith (R-TX) is expected to call for the establishment of a national worker identity card. The ID system would consist of a single tamper-proof card modeled after the social security card.<p>

	The Clinton administration has favored such an approach, as well as the national computer registry. In his proposed 1996 budget, President Clinton included $28 million to start integrating various government databases so the work registry can be developed.<p>

	The administration has also been testing its own program, the Telephone Verification System (TVS). With this system, businesses would be required to purchase special equipment to comply with worker verification.<p>

	For two years, nine companies have participated in the TVS project. The companies call
the INS to verify that non-citizens who apply for work are eligible for employment. A review of this project found that the INS could not accurately rely on the computer information 28 percent of the time and had to perform a manual search of its records.<p>

	According to a special report by the Justice Department, which evaluated the TVS project, secondary verifications were very burdensome to employers. Businesses, which already complain about the burdensome nature of the current employee verification system (the I-9 form), would have more forms to complete as part of the hiring process with a national computer registry. Employers would have to maintain authorization receipts on each employee they check through the new system. Employees subject to secondary verification will require yet another form.<p>

	Of serious concern to business groups and those involved with civil liberty issues, is the federal government's ability to competently manage the immense database. Accuracy of data will be critical to making the registry work, and both the INS and SSA have been widely criticized for inaccuracy in record keeping.<p>

	In California, for example, the INS admitted it lost 60,000 green-card applicant files. And the INS has experienced error rates as high as 30 percent. SSA has estimated that cleaning up its database would initially cost $122 million, and each year thereafter $30 million to maintain.<p>

	According to a 1988 General Accounting Office report, of about 210 million Social Security numbers active "at least 75 percent issued without proof of the individual's identity or citizenship."<p>

	With 65 million Americans changing jobs or entering the job market each year, even a 1 percent failure rate could be problematic -- 650,000 workers could be affected by even minimal errors.<p>

	In addition, those concerned about privacy have speculated that a centralized system would spur the government to include more information about individuals.<p>

	A key feature of the proposed is a monitoring system that tracks which companies access the system. The government would then have the ability to track business's hiring practices, as well as the individual employment history of every American.<p>

	With other major issues before the Congress such as deficit reduction and tax cuts, the proposed national worker registry has received little attention from the news media or the Congressional leadership in either the House and Senate. However, as such legislation makes it way through committees in both chambers, more Members of Congress are beginning to pay attention to the ramifications of a centralized worker registry.<p>

	Will Congress enact a data system affecting 100 percent of the population to combat the problem of 1.5 percent who live in the United States illegally.<p>

	Given the momentum to limit the size and scope of the federal government, the worker registry will indeed be put through a rigorous examination process in Congress. As more business groups learn about the proposed system, the debate will become even more rigorous.<p>

	Karen Kerrigan is president of the Small Business Survival Foundation in Washington. Her column appears twice monthly.<p>

<title>SBB: The Consumers Added to the Equation of Health Care Reform </title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><center><h2> The Consumers Added to the Equation of Health Care Reform </h2>                                                     </center><hr>



 June 1995 - This time last year, small business organizations were fighting against President and Mrs. Clinton's plan to radically overhaul our nation's health care system. The employer mandate, the centerpiece of the failed proposal, did not sit well with small businesses.  The "crisis" rhetoric seems to have toned down, but high health care costs along with the inability of many businesses to provide health care for their employees still remains a priority issue for our  nation's smaller employers.
<P>
The magnitude of the problem was recently confirmed at the White House Conference on Small Business where nearly two thousands elected delegates from all corners of the country gathered in Washington from June 12-15 to develop a national small business agenda for the Clinton Administration and Congress.  The dominant health care issue was tax equity.  Small businesses and the self-employed only want what corporations already have -- the ability to deduct 100 percent of their health care insurance expenses.
<P>
Is health care reform dead under the leadership of the new Republican controlled Congress?  The answer is no.  But rather than big government schemes and mandates, health care proposals are emerging from the new Congress that are more market-based.  One idea, that has been tried and tested in the private sector is tax free Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs).  The concept has taken Capitol Hill by storm, and it seems that all serious proposals to reform our nation's health care cost problem include an MSA provision.

<P><b>Health Care's "Sick" Underlying Structure</b><P>
   The MSA, say its supporters, will re-establish the buyer-seller relationship between consumers and suppliers of health care services.  Under the predominant third-party system of payments, neither consumers nor providers have an incentive to be concerned about costs.  Therefore, costs naturally rise.
<P>
The two veins to the third party system, government involvement in the health care market (especially since the inception of Medicaid and Medicare) and an expanded definition of "insurance," have perverted health care costs while shielding the health care industry from real market forces that produce competition.   By definition, insurance is supposed to cover catastrophic and unforeseen events.  Today, health insurance plans cover small and predicable expenses.
<P>
Such an expansion of the definition of health insurance, says Small Business Survival Foundation Chief Economist Raymond Keating, "would be the equivalent of extending one's home-owners insurance to cover the costs of mowing the lawn, trimming bushes and painting the house."
<P>
Third-party payments have drastically increased over the past three decades.  In 1950, for example, government financed 25.3 percent of health care expenditures, private insurance 15.8 percent, and 58.9 percent was covered out of pocket.  According to the <i>Statistical Abstract of the United States</I>, by 1991, government financed expenditures equalled 43.9 percent, private insurance and other private sources 36.9 percent, and only 19.2 percent was out of pocket.  
The effect of the usurpation of the buyer-seller relationship has been steadily rising costs.  For example, per capita U.S. health care expenditure between 1965 and 1991 increased by 1,306 percent, versus a rise in the consumer index of 332 percent.

<P><b>Medical Savings Accounts</b><P>	The most common MSA scenario would shift standard health care plans to a split system of an MSA combined with a catastrophic plan.  A standard plan costing $5,000, for example, could be replaced with $3,000 going into an employee's MSA and $2,000 covering a catastrophic plan with a $3,000 deductible.
<P>
The employee withdraws funds from the MSA, penalty free, to pay out-of-pocket medical expenses.  Since the employee now has an established "budget" and is able to keep what he or she does not use by year-end, the employee has an incentive to comparison shop for health care purchases and needs.  As consumers become more concerned with costs, MSA supporters contend that health care providers are forced to be more cost sensitive in pricing health care services -- in other words real competition will be injected into the health care market.
<P>
According to Dan Perrin, Executive Director of the Business Coalition for Affordable Health Care, a 1.6 million member coalition of business organizations that support MSAs, lower income individuals would especially benefit from the reform.  "Under the current system, most people must shell out money until they reach their $500 deductible.  With an MSA, employees have immediate access to funds, easing financial concerns which makes them more happy," says Perrin.
<P>
The MSA account is also owned by the employee, and therefore portable.  Individuals can also build savings in their MSA accounts, which in turn helps offset health care costs in case the employee loses their job.

<P><b>MSA Legislation</b><P>
On June 13, Reps. Bill Archer (R-TX) and Andy Jacobs (D-IN) introduced the Family Medical Savings and Investment Act.  The centerpiece of the legislation includes the creation of MSAs.   At a time when the new Congress is working to be more budget conscious, detractors of MSAs contend that the bill will "cost" taxpayers too much.
<P>
However, Perrin claims that whatever the bill will cost (according to some Capitol Hill sources estimates have been placed at $1.18 billion over five years), it is as close to revenue neutral as you will get, but with dramatic results for our nation's health care system in terms of making health care more affordable for all Americans.  Businesses, too, will benefit from MSAs as administrative costs are reduced according to Perrin.  Forbes, Inc., using an MSA plan since 1991, has reduced its insurance premium costs by 27 percent.  
<P>
Perrin predicts that MSA legislation will be enacted by early fall.  According to other supporters, the current Republican leadership in Congress is anxious to address the health care reform issue, and believes that MSAs will empower individuals while providing incentives to save for expenses not covered in their health plans.  Businesses will be given an opportunity to participate or shift to a system that is more consumer-oriented and puts employees directly in control of their health care purchases.
<P>
The new Congress may not immediately give small businesses and the self-employed the equal tax treatment they are looking for, but perhaps they are giving Americans the opportunity to be consumers once again in the health care market.<P>

<h2>Small Business and the Flat Tax</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
May 1995 - While a hot, mid-summer debate is expected between the U.S. House and
Senate regarding the size and scope of tax cuts (if any at all), both chambers are moving full speed ahead on hearings to study a complete overhaul of our nation's tax system. <p> 
Committees in the House and Senate have already held hearings on the "flat tax"  -- a
simplified postcard system popularized by Republican Majority Leader Dick Armey.  The House Ways and Means Committee will hold a three-day marathon session from June 6-8 on all leading alternative tax systems.   The main plans for replacing the current income tax system include a flat tax, a national sales tax, a consumed-income" tax, or a value-added tax (VAT).  <p>
Hearings on the flat tax and its impact on the small business and entrepreneurial sector were held by the Subcommittee on Taxation and Finance of the House Small Business Committee.  Chairman, Linda Smith (R-WA), a freshman who operated a tax consulting business, is particularly interested in determining the effects of the flat tax on small business.<p>  
"We are placing them [small businesses] at the forefront of the debate on revamping the federal tax system to ensure their voice is heard," said Smith.   <p>
The Subcommittee heard from a diverse group of economists and business organizations, as well as Majority Leader Dick Armey and Senator Arlen Specter (R-Penn) who testified on their respective flat tax proposals.  The Armey Flat Tax plan includes the following elements (after being fully phased in over a three year period):<p>
<ul>
<li>all wages, salaries, and pensions would be taxed at a flat 17 percent rate (begins at 19 percent);
<li>capital gains, earnings from savings, and dividends would not be subject to taxation.
<li>a personal exemption of $13,000 would be permitted for a single person, $17,200 for a single head of household, and $26,200 for a married couple filing jointly, and $5,300 for each dependent.  Exemptions would be indexed for inflation.
<li>business owners would pay a 17 percent rate on the difference between revenues and  expenses, assuming of course that revenues exceed expenses.  The tax would be levied on gross revenue minus purchases of goods and services, capital equipment, structures, land and wages paid to employees.  Deductions would not be allowed for fringe benefits, interest, or payments to owners.<p></ul>
Concerns of members of the subcommittee ranged from transitional issues -- eg: how will small businesses be impacted as the federal government moves from the current tax system to the flat tax? -- to questions about what deductions small businesses may lose under the flat tax scenario.  Economists as well as business leaders agreed that transitional issues are important because business owners have made long-term business decisions based on the current U.S. tax code.<p>
In terms of the impact on business deductions, economist Alvin Rabushka (author of the notable book The Flat Tax) stated that all costs associated with operating a business are fully deductible as business expenses.  According to Rabushka, home offices, advertising costs, and business meals, for example, are qualified business expenses.<p>    
Raymond Keating, chief economist of the Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC)
outlined his criteria for members of Congress to consider upon designing a tax system:<p>
<ul>
<li>Low Flat Tax Rate to Promote Economic Growth
<li>No Taxation of Capital
<li>The Inflation Factor (its effects should be factored into a system's design)
<li>Clarity
<li>Simplicity
<li>Limited Bureaucracy and Intrusiveness
<li>Minimum Incentives For Tax Avoidance
<li>No Additional Boost to Government Spending<p>
</ul>
In his overall assessment of the flat tax before the subcommittee, Keating stated that the flat tax scores high as measured against these standards.  The main downside according to the SBSC economist was that the flat tax was still an income tax which historically has been "high-octane fuel for government spending." <p>
While most small businesses agree that the current tax code is a convoluted mess, the race is still on to convince them that elected officials can design a more fair, less-taxing system.  But as recent surveys show, the flat tax is becoming more popular with business owners and entrepreneurs.  In a recent nationwide survey of 500 small business owners sponsored by SBSC, 56 percent of respondents supported the Armey flat tax proposal.<p>
Powerful interest groups lay waiting in the wings, however, firmly convinced that they
will be severely impacted by the flat tax.  The housing industry, realtors, bankers, accountants and tax attorneys feel they have much to lose under a flat tax system.   Under the Armey flat tax plan, the home mortgage interest deduction would be abolished.  Specter's flat tax (a 20 percent rate) retains the home loan benefit up to $100,000.<p>
To some Washington observers, overhauling the nation's tax system will be politically
impossible.  To others, just being in a political environment where hearings are actually
occurring is a miracle in itself.  Still yet to come is the bottom-line analysis of how the various tax proposals impact the engines of economic growth -- the nation's small businesses.<p>

<title>The Capital Gains Tax Cut Good for Business?</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<h2><a href="http://www.accf.org">The Capital Gains Tax Cut Good for Business?</a></h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
May 1995 - The debate of the 1980's is back, and it is focused on a cut in the capital
gains tax and who benefits from it.  Opponents say it's a big tax cut for the wealthy and will drain the U.S. Treasury.   Supporters contend the cut will benefit everyone by increasing investment, savings, the availability of capital, and tax revenues for the government while decreasing the cost of capital for business investment.<p>
The Republican's Contract With America proposes a reduction in the capital gains tax rate from 28 percent to 19.8 percent by providing for a 50 percent exclusion on capital gains income, and indexing the rate for inflation.  For corporations, there would be an alternative tax rate of 25 percent on capital gains.  The capital gains tax cut in all likelihood will pass the U.S. House of Representatives, but is expected to meet stiff resistance in the Senate.<p>
Partisan sparks flew on the first day of  the Ways and Means Committee tax bill mark-up in the House of Representatives setting the stage for a series of heated and lively debates when the bill hits the floor for a vote.  Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-MO) warned that "the Republican tax cuts amount to a massive perk for the privileged, while hard-working middle-class families barely benefit at all."  <p>
Responding to Gephardt, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer (R-TX) said that the Minority Leader was conducting a "misinformation campaign."  The capital gains tax cut measure, included within a $188 billion tax cut proposal for families and businesses, passed the powerful tax writing committee by a 21-14 party-line vote.<p>
What do the experts say about the capital gains tax?  Is it really a tax cut for the rich? 
And, even if it is, does that mean that every one else loses?<p>
<center><b>Economic and U.S. Job Growth</b><p></center>
The U.S. is heavily dependent on its entrepreneurial and small business sector for new job creation.  Over 80 percent of the new jobs in 1993, according to Duns and Bradstreet, were created by small businesses.  But many business owners and entrepreneurs still face a major obstacle to start-up, growth and expansion -- the daunting task of raising capital.  The business advocacy groups in Washington, D.C. favor a capital gains tax cut because it will encourage investment in the small business and entreprenuerial sector. <p>
According to the American Council for Capital Formation (ACCF) Center for Policy
Research, the favorable tax treatment of capital gains is critical to start-up businesses which tend to be riskier investments.  The ACCF Center, in a special report entitled Questions and Answers on Capital Gains, states that most start-up money comes from the family and friends of entrepreneurs.  Lower capital gains taxes encourages these potential investors to risk their savings due to a return in appreciated stock.<p>
High capital gains tax rates significantly cut into potential returns thereby diminishing
incentives to invest.  In the real world of risk-and-reward tradeoffs, the opportunity for high returns must be present in order to entice investment in high-risk ventures, even in new and existing businesses of families and friends.<p>
A examination of venture capital investment in the United States over the past decade has shown a deep decline.  Venture capital was on the rise up to 1986 as the U.S. capital gains tax rate declined; followed by a dramatic downturn as the rate was hiked from 20 percent to 28 percent in 1987 (see chart).  Supporters of reducing and eliminating capital gains tax rates claim that capital would be unlocked, and more capital access to budding and expanding businesses with lower rates.<p>
Critics of  lowering the capital gains tax rate say it will do little for the market,  and
doubts the cut will "free up" capital for investment.  In a paper entitled Another Tax Break for the Wealthy, Dean Baker of the Economic Policy Institute writes that lower tax rates create incentives to hide other income in tax shelters.  Rather than increasing investment in business, a reduction would only add to the tax shelter industry.<p>
<center><b>Capital Gains Tax Spectrum</b><p></center>
A review of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) individual income tax returns show that
capital gains tend to be spread across a wider income spectrum than many believe, or what is reported.  According to 1992 federal income tax returns, 56 percent of returns claiming capital gains were from incomes $50,000 or less, including the capital gain.  Total incomes of $100,000 or less claimed 83 percent of returns with capital gains.<p>

<title>'Contract' Reforms Lift Business Burdens</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center>
<h2>'Contract' Reforms Lift Business Burdens</h2>  
</center>                                 
<hr>
<br>
April 1995 - Many newly-elected members of the 104th Congress campaigned on a pro-business agenda.  These mostly Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives, many of whom are small business owners themselves, used the Contract With America as the centerpiece of their campaigns.  What's in store for the business community according to the new Republican majority?  A less-meddlesome, less-regulating, less-taxing federal government.<p>
Already the U.S. House has enacted many of the "Contract" reforms they promised. 
Quite remarkably, most of the legislation to date has easily sailed through the House with the solid support of pro-business Democrats.  But, the most contentious parts of the "Contract" remain, as the House turns to a comprehensive tax relief and spending cuts package.  U.S. Senate passage of many "Contract" provisions also remain in doubt, as Senate leaders say they have their own agenda and timetable for legislation. <p>
Special interests opposed to the "Contract," such as environmental groups, consumer
organizations and the trial lawyers to name a few, have largely focused their lobbying efforts and resources on the upcoming battle in the Senate.<p>
<center><b>Regulatory Relief</b></center><p>   
A comprehensive regulatory reform package,  and a year-long moratorium, or "time-out," on newly proposed regulations easily swept through the House.  Nearly 4,500 new regulations proposed by the Clinton Administration are subject to the moratorium.  The Senate's version of the legislation gives President Clinton the authority to exempt regulations he views as needed to prevent an "imminent" threat to the health and safety of the public.  The Clinton Administration opposes the moratorium. <p>
     Highlights of regulatory reform legislation enacted by the House include:
<ul>
<li>Cost-benefit analysis and risk-assessment standards to be applied to proposed regulations.
<li>The paperwork burden on businesses to be reduced by 10% annually.
<li>Stepped up protection and compensation for private property owners when government regulations reduce the value and use of property.
<li>The Regulatory Flexibility Act, a law already on the books to protect small businesses from excessive regulation, to be strengthened to give small businesses the right to take legal action against the government to enforce the law.
</ul><p>
At a press conference celebrating the passage of reform in the House, regulatory pointman, Majority Whip Tom Delay (R-TX), said the legislation is "the first step toward freedom for millions of individual Americans and hundreds of thousands of job-creating businesses and industries."  <p>
<center><b>Legal Reform</b></center><p>
It seems that if your business involves any risk (which inherently it does) it's not a matter  of when you'll get slapped with a lawsuit, but how much it will cost.  Business interests in Washington played a key role in passing the Common-Sense Legal Reform Act in the House.  The goal behind the legislation, say its supporters,  is to stem the tide of  frivolous law suits, and give business more freedom to do business and pursue innovation.<p>  
Major components of the legislation include:<p>
<ul>
<li>A "loser-pays" rule whereby the losing party in the law suit pays the attorney's fees of the winner.  The amount, however, is limited to the total cost of the loser's own legal fees.
<li>Product Liability:  joint liability for noneconomic damages are abolished under the Act, and a $250,000 cap on punitive damages. 
<li>Lawyer accountability strengthened and "junk-science" testimony disallowed.
<li>Greater protection for growth companies against class-action shareholder law suits.
<li>Written notice must be given to the defendant at least thirty days before a plaintiff can bring suit.  
</ul><p>
<center><b>Tax Relief? What's on the Line for Your Bottom-line</center></b><p>
Remaining "Contract" items of direct consequence to the business and entrepreneurial
sector include a comprehensive tax relief package, coupled with deep spending cuts.  It is shaping up to be the most contentious battle to date in the House.  What's on the line?  Tax cuts for business include:<p>

<center><b>Capital Gains Tax Cut</b></center><p> 
Supporters of the 50 percent cut in, and indexation of the capital gains tax say it will spur economic growth, reduce the cost (while increasing the amount) of capital for investment in small business, and bring in more tax revenues to the federal treasury.  For corporations, there would be an alternative tax rate of 25 percent on capital gains.  Detractors say its a tax cut for the rich, and will drain the treasury.  With class warfare heating up, and widespread support for reducing the deficit, a cut in the capital gains rate may squeak by the House, but looks dimmer every day for passage in the Senate.<p>

<center><b>Home-Office Deduction</b></center><p>  
The tax laws concerning home offices are contradictory and confusing according to many home-office users.  The "Contract" proposal clarifies the deduction for home-offices.  A business owner will qualify if the office is essential to the user's business, is used on an exclusive and regular basis and when tasks in the office cannot be performed elsewhere. <p>

<center><b>Business Expensing</b></center><p>  
The amount small businesses can deduct for equipment purchased in its first year would double to $35,000.  The proposal includes competitive depreciation rules for all businesses under the Neutral Cost Recovery System.  The top-tax writer in the House, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer (R-CA), also determined that the alternative minimum tax should be repealed on a phased-in basis.<p>
<center><b>Estate Tax Exemption</b></center><p>  
The proposal calls for an increase in the exemption from $600,000 to $750,000 to help small businesses pass on a family-owned enterprise to the next generation.  Quite often, the heirs to the family business are forced to sell the business to pay estate taxes under current law. <p>   
<center><b>Paying for the Cuts</center></b><p>
While business likes what it sees on the tax relief and regulatory reform end of the deal,
Republican leaders are bracing for an onslaught of direct lobbying when the spending cuts program is unveiled.    Federal government subsidies to large corporations and industries, as well as the Small Business Administration and other government agencies, are on the chopping block to "pay for" the tax cuts package. <p>
With the public calling for fiscal accountability in government, and many business
owners irked that they have to balance their books to stay in business, lawmakers in  Washington, they contend, should be forced to do the same.  The questions remains as to whether the majority of members in the 104th Congress believe they can reduce the deficit, while providing Americans and businesses with much needed relief.<p>

<P>
Dear Senator ____________:<BR>

<P>
As a small business owner heavily burdened by taxes, I am writing
to urge your support of Senator John Kyl's efforts to eliminate
the federal estate, gift and generation&#173;skipping taxes. 
His &quot;Family Heritage Preservation Act&quot; is long overdue.
 Death taxes must be abolished, nothing less will suffice.<BR>

<P>
I work hard for my family and my employees.  Along the way, I
seem to pay almost every tax imaginable, including income, payroll,
sales and property taxes, not to mention a wide range of fees.
 Naturally, these taxes make it very difficult for me to build
up savings and make additional investment in my business.<BR>

<P>
On top of all this, the government imposes various death taxes.
 It is incomprehensible to me that after paying taxes all my life
&#173;&#173; both personal and business &#173;&#173; the government
could take up to 55% of my buinsess and personal assets.  <BR>

<P>
Please tell me what kind of an incentive I have to continue investing
in and expanding my business?  Indeed, as I get older, why should
I continue in business at all?<BR>

<P>
It is my hope that the business I built will continue on after
I'm gone, hopefully under the guidance of one of my children or
grandchildren.  The federal government's death taxes make this
dream less likely.  It is my understanding that 60% of businesses
fail to make it to a second generation, and 90% don't survive
to a third.  No doubt taxes are a major cause for this dismal
survival rate.  <BR>

<P>
In addition, for all the trouble caused, federal death taxes apparently
count for only 1 percent of federal revenues.  It seems to me
that the government would be far better off getting rid of these
taxes, and thereby encouraging more investment.<BR>

<P>
Again, I urge you to support the &quot;Family Heritage Preservation
Act.&quot;  I don't think it is fair to pay taxes all your life,
and then have the government ask for even more at death.  I believe
that the inherent unfairness of the tax is something reasonable
members of both parties can agree on.  I urge you to repeal this
punitive job-killing tax.<BR>

<htmL><HEAD><title>SBSC Issues:  Davis-Bacon Repeal</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><center><h2>Davis-Bacon Repeal</h2><p><hr size="4" width="45%"></center>
<P>SBSC has fought hard for the repeal of the notorious Davis-Bacon Act.  This Act was enacted six decades ago in an effort to reduce the influx of black southern workers into northern federal construction projects.  The Act grants the federal government power to determine an area's "prevailing wage."  This anti-market provision has resulted in driving the costs of construction up, thereby increasing costs to taxpayers, while simultaneously creating a large paperwork burden.  Davis-Bacon has prevented small construction firms, who cannot afford to pay the inflated prevailing wages, from competing for federal construction projects.  Davis-Bacon has also prevented many contractors from hiring minority and unskilled workers, who are denied employment opportunity due to hiring preferences resulting from Davis-Bacon.
<P>
Davis-Bacon repeal was recently taken out of the Republican budget bill, and some members of Congress wish to strengthen Davis-Bacon (which they mistakingly call "reform") by applying it to off-site construction. The Department of Labor recently imposed Davis-Bacon wage and paperwork requirements on those who build ships for the federal government.  Obviously, it is important that we step up the fight for Davis-Bacon repeal.

<html><head><title>SBSC Issues:  Immigration Reform</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center><h3> Immigration Reform Act of 1995, S. 1394
<P>
Immigration in the National Interest Act, H.R. 2202</h3><hr width="45%" size="4"><P>
</center>
In the name of immigration reform, the House immigration subcommittee
recently passed H.R. 2202 sponsored by Representative Lamar Smith
(R. TX).  Contrary to the smaller-government principles espoused
by the Republican Congress, H.R. 2202 and similar Senate proposals
(S.269 and S. 1394), increase federal government spending, expand
governmental control over businesses, and will ultimately weaken
the United States' economy.  
<P>
The latest statistical report from the Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS) noted a drop in United States legal immigration
for the fiscal year 1994.  Ironically, our nation's legislators
and presidential hopefuls believe that illegal immigration and
legal immigration are pressing national problems requiring immediate
and drastic measures.  
<P>
The Senate immigration subcommittee will soon begin markup of
Senator Alan Simpson's (R. WY) legal immigration proposal, S.
1394.  Unfortunately, Senator Simpson's legal immigration legislation
intensifies the restrictive measures of H.R. 2202.
<P>
Senator Simpson seeks a 25% tax on businesses that hire foreign
workers.  Under S. 1394, companies hiring foreign help would have
to pay a tax equal to one-quarter of the employee's annual compensation
including wages and benefits.  In addition, employers would be
forced to pay that employee 105% of the prevailing wage (an expansion
of the job-killing Davis-Bacon Act).
<P>
  Moreover, H.R. 2202 and S. 269 (a similar Senate <I>illegal
</I>immigration proposal authored by Senator Simpson) mandate
another costly regulation on businesses -- employment verification
system.  Analysts estimate that this latest government-imposed
absurdity, will costs U.S. businesses approximately $4.4 billion
dollars.  And analysts predict the system will do nothing to halt
illegal immigration.
<P>
Furthermore, economists predict U.S. businesses will feel the
force of the mandate at least three times: first, when taxes are
raised to pay for the creation of the database; second, when employers
are required to purchase the machinery to operate the verification
system; and third, when employers are denied eligible employees
because of flawed data. 
<P>
The Clinton Administration and sponsors of the immigration reform
measures are expanding big government to unimaginable levels.
<P>
 Unfortunately, the majority of persons who will get caught in
the system will be American citizens, whose right to work should
never be hindered, and the employer, whose right to employ should
never be relinquished to a government entity.
<P>
For more information on the telephone verification system, see
Karen Kerrigan's Small Business Briefing article Worker Database
Could Cost Businesses Billions.

<html><head><title>SBSC Issues:  Independent Contractors</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<center><h2>Independent Contractors</h2><hr width="45%" size="4"><P>
</center>
On June 30, 1995, Representative Jon Christensen (R-NE) introduced
H.R. 1972, the &quot;Independent Contractor Tax Simplification
Act of 1995.&quot;  This piece of legislation seeks to establish
clear criteria for defining the tax status for the self-employed
as independent contractor.  Currently, the IRS subjects numerous
individuals who work autonomously to an infamous 20-factor test.
<P>
 This test challenges the tax status of many of those who choose
to work independently.  Additionally, the ambiguous, subjective
20-factor test may reclassify independent contractors as employees,
causing back-taxes and penalties for the business contracting
with the individual.
<P>
Rep. Christensen's bill would clearly state who is not an employee,
and it allows independent contractors to avoid the 20-factor test.
<P>
 Currently H.R. 1972 is in the House Ways and Means Committee.
<P>
Despite large support from the small business community and many
legislators, this bill requires a continuous effort to ensure
passage.  For more information, see Karen Kerrigan's article &quot;IRS
should revise contract-worker tests.&quot;
<P>

<center><h2>Minimum Wage</h2><hr width="45%" size="4">
<p></center>
Congress is once again considering a minimum wage hike.  The Senate recently approved a procedural motion that will bring a minimum wage increase vote within the next several months. The minimum wage, which is politically popular, is most harmful to small businesses.  Most employers pay above the minimum wage, and many determine wages according to the minimum wage.  Thus an increase in the minimum wage will have a ripple effect on the wages paid by businesses - many small firms simply cannot absorb such a budget impact.

<h3>
Time to Overhaul Labor Laws and the NLRB<BR>
</h3>
<P>
<b>
by Raymond J. Keating
<br>
Chief Economist
<br>
Small Business Survival Committee
</b>
<hr>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
Since its creation in the midst of the Great Depression and the
New Deal, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has been a
source of great controversy.  Depending upon which political party
controlled the White House, therefore controlling the appointment
of the NLRB's five board members, accusations would fly regarding
the NLRB leaning too far in favor of either the rights of workers
or management.  <BR>
<P>
Unfortunately, the controversy created by the NLRB perpetuates
the outmoded notion that business managers/employers and their
employees must always be in conflict.  Under its current modus
operandi, the NLRB hurts both workers and businesses &#173;&#173;
and therefore, the economy in general.<BR>
<P>
The Unfair Labor Practices Controversy.  The NLRB was established
under the National Labor Relations Act (the Wagner Act) of 1935.
 The Board is empowered to conduct and certify elections to determine
if employees desire to be represented by a union, and to prevent
unfair labor practices by both employers and unions or their agents.
 <BR>
<P>
While the Wagner Act and other pieces of federal labor legislation
over the years are usually portrayed as benefitting employees,
in a very real sense, such legislation takes away the individual's
right to contract.  In congressional testimony on February 7,
1996, Richard L. Trumka, Secretary&#173;Treasurer of the AFL&#173;CIO,
asked: &quot;Are we still committed to the right of working men
and women to associate freely?&quot;  Unfortunately, the answer
to this question is &quot;no,&quot; and has been &quot;no&quot;
for decades.  Labor laws &#173;&#173; supported by Mr. Trumka
and his union &#173;&#173; require individuals to join unions
and/or pay union dues, who otherwise would not choose to do so.
 The interests of labor's leaders win out over the interests of
non&#173;union workers and individuals who have no interest in
joining a union.<BR>
<P>
More prominent controversies arise related to the NLRB function
of preventing unfair labor practices.  As James Bovard puts it
in his book Lost Rights: The Destruction of American Liberty:
&quot;In reality, an 'unfair labor practice' is whatever displeases
a majority of the five political appointees to the National Labor
Relations Board.&quot;  Not surprisingly, a body carrying the
title the &quot;National Labor Relations Board&quot; carries an
inherent bias in favor of labor unions.  A cursory examination
of NLRB decisions reveals just such a bias:<BR>
<P>
<ul>
<li> Earlier this year, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals
reversed an NLRB decision which created, according to the Court,
the &quot;imprimatur of industrial anarchy.&quot;  In the Earle
Industries case, the NLRB sanctioned an employer who had disciplined
an employee for escorting a trespasser, activist Jesse Jackson,
through the plant during a union organizing campaign.  The Court
ruled that the employee's interest in unionizing could not override
the employer's interest in protecting its property.1  <BR>
<P>
<li> Again in Lost Rights, James Bovard notes stark differences
in how the NLRB treats employer and union actions: &quot;NLRB
officials have a very expansive concept of coercion when it comes
to management behavior; companies have been found guilty of 'unfair
labor practices' for merely criticizing unions or for offering
raises to their workers before the workers vote on whether to
join a union. ...  Yet the NLRB ruled in July 1993 that a Teamsters
union local affiliate's filing of a $20 million class&#173;action
lawsuit against an employer just before an election was not objectionable
conduct or an unfair labor practice.&quot;  In addition, Bovard
outlines various cases of union violence and the lack of response
by the NLRB.  Bovard concludes:<BR>
</ul>
<P>
&quot;Picketing routinely degenerates into a simple economic blockade
&#173;&#173; an effort to cutoff entrances and exits of the picketed
site.  Thus, it is surprising that the NLRB finds excuses or pretexts
to discount the reality of picket&#173;line violence.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Indeed in certain ways, the NLRB has become a means for perpetuating
union violence and threats.  For example, as reported in SBS Foundation's
Labor Watch (Issue 8), the NLRB apparently forgot the violence
associated with the 1985 strike against the Chicago Tribune stirred
by the hiring of replacement workers.  The strike came to a close
in 1986, and by May 1989, the process of reinstating striking
workers was well under way.  The Pressman's union has since been
seeking the names and addresses of replacement workers still employed
at the Tribune.  The NLRB ordered the Tribune to hand over the
information.  Fortunately, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit ensured employee protections and refused to enforce the
NLRB order.  Violence against replacement workers during the strike
included tire slashing, death threats, as well as the stabbing
of a delivery driver.<BR>
<P>
The Clinton NLRB.  President Clinton's NLRB has exhibited overt
favoritism toward the labor union agenda.  Indeed, the NLRB now
has crossed the line from a largely judicial body into the realm
of public&#173;policy advocacy and politics.<BR>
<P>
For example, NLRB Chairman William B. Gould IV has publicly declared
his support for banning the employer's right to hire striker replacements.
 Gould also has denounced the TEAM Act, which would allow employers
and employees to form committees to work together on workplace
issues &#173;&#173; a simple act of teamwork and cooperation that
the NLRB deems in many cases as illegal under the Wagner Act.
<BR>
<P>
Also, the NLRB has proposed implementing a single&#173;site rule,
which carries huge potential benefits for labor unions.  The rule
presumes that a single facility of an employer is the appropriate
bargaining unit under most circumstances.  This makes union organizing
efforts far easier for smaller entities such as restaurant franchises.
 <BR>
<P>
Other recent pro&#173;union NLRB decisions include:
<P>
<ul>
<li> In Manganaro, the NLRB legalized anti&#173;dual shop clauses
which could allow unions to shut down non&#173;union subsidiaries
or impose union membership on non&#173;union workers without a
secret vote.<BR>
<P>
<li> In California Saw, the NLRB virtually neutered employee
Beck rights by letting the unions themselves to decide what are
and are not union political expenses.<BR>
<P>
<li> In Elliott Turbomachinery, the Board gutted property and
ownership rights by ignoring contract language granting an employer
exclusive discretion in relocating its facilities.<BR>
<P>
<li> In Shepard Convention Services, the Board ruled against
its own regulations and ordered a mail ballot election, and then
certified a union even though it was endorsed by only 9 percent
of eligible voters.  This decision was reversed upon appeal, however.
</ul>
<BR>
<P>
In addition, President Clinton made clear the political nature
of the NLRB.  Late last year, the President formally nominated
Senate staffer Sarah M. Fox (Sen. Ted Kennedy's chief labor counsel
on the Labor and Human Resources Committee) to the Board.  Ms.
Fox's pro&#173;union credentials are quite formidable.  She has
been a union lawyer and a key strategist for pro&#173;labor union
legislation.  Knowing this appointment was in grave danger, the
President added Ms. Fox to the Board through a recess appointment
in January.<BR>
<P>
The President reportedly now seeks two Republican appointees to
bring the Board to full complement.  Though, the strong union
ties of the three current Democrat members are no way in doubt.
<BR>
<P>
Reform Measures.  Labor law and the NLRB are in desperate need
of reform in order to protect the rights of individual workers
and business owners.  Ideally, the federal government should extract
itself from involvement in labor issues altogether.  However,
chances of repealing federal labor laws and leaving matters to
the states are currently quite remote, to say the least.  Therefore,
the following principles should lie at the center of labor reform
efforts:<BR>
<P>
<ul>
<li> No individual's right to contract should be subjugated
to other individuals' desires for union representation.  A National
Right to Work law stating that no one should be required to join
a union, nor be forced to pay dues to a union, needs to be passed.
<BR>
<P>
<li> Severe consequences should result from union violence.
 Some argue that the pro&#173;union labor laws of the early half
of this century were implemented in response to employer violence
against union organizers.  In the second half of the twentieth
century, union violence against non&#173;union workers and employers
calls for clear and severe penalties against unions and their
members who participate in and promote violence.  Clearly, the
NLRB should not establish acceptable levels of violence permitted
on picket lines before action is taken (as the Board currently
does).  No degree of violence is acceptable.  The law should be
unequivocal, including decertification of unions involved and
jail time.<BR>
<P>
<li> The NLRB has been reluctant to put an end to union &quot;salting&quot;
campaigns, whereby union organizers apply for jobs at non&#173;union
sites with the intent of either bringing discrimination charges
against the employer to the NLRB, disrupting the workplace, or
running up employer costs.  Such individuals do not seek legitimate
employment, but instead seek to organize and inflict economic
damage.  Clear laws against salting are needed.  <BR>
</ul>
<P>
Put an End to Activist Regulators.  The NLRB is an example of
judicial activism taken to the extreme.  Politically appointed
&quot;judges&quot; have a documented history of making decisions
based on their own views of the world, rather than according to
laws.  The NLRB also exemplifies the general problem with Congress
and the White House delegating powers to regulators and rule&#173;making
bodies.  Indeed, the time has come for our elected officials to
take direct responsibility for the federal regulatory apparatus,
including the NLRB.  The powers of regulators should be clear
and limited, and all rules, regulations, and fines approved by
Congress and the President.<BR>
<P>
In the end, as for the NLRB, its blatantly political and activist
decisions call into question its very existence.  If the federal
government is to remain intertwined in labor issues, then oversight
of elections and initial prevention of unfair labor practices
are reasonable duties that can be carried out with some degree
of objectivity.  However, Congress should give serious consideration
to allowing disputes arising from this process to go directly
to federal courts and eliminating the NLRB's judicial role altogether.

<h3>Costs of Another FDA War:Economic Fallout from Reduced Advertising and Promotional Expenditures</h3><b>by Raymond J. Keating<br>Chief Economist<br>Small Business Survival Committee</b></center><p><hr><p>
Under the generalship of Commissioner David Kessler, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has declared war on a host of businesses and industries.  Recent FDA battles include raids on vitamin clinics and orange juice producers, a pseudo-science attack on silicone breast implants, and a bureaucratic assault on the nation's health and economic vitality through long delays in drug and medical device approvals.1  By outflanking its original mission, now the FDA adds an attack on the tobacco industry to this seemingly ever-growing list.  A question remains: Is this a "just" regulatory war?<p>Considering that tobacco products always have been legally produced and sold in this country and that individual freedom and choice is rightfully cherished in a land of liberty, clearly makes this new FDA regulatory war just as unjust as the battles listed above.  Simply because a handful of elected officials and federal government bureaucrats do not like certain products does not give them the right to rage a regulatory jihad in response.<p>In addition, any just war theory calls for no direct attacks on or injuries or fatalities to non-combatants.  Hence, during wartime, attacks on civilian targets usually generate moral outrage.  In regulatory wars, noncombatants of the economic type always suffer.  The FDA's move against tobacco will have a real and significant impact on noncombatants -- lending even greater weight to the charge of the FDA waging an unjust regulatory war.  Numerous among these noncombatants will be a host of small businesses, including convenience and grocery stores, advertising companies, a variety of manufacturers, print shops -- the list goes on and on.  <p>FDA's Proposed Tobacco Regulations.  According to the Federal Register, the FDA proposed tobacco regulations include prohibiting cigarette vending machines, free samples, mail-order sales, and self-service displays; limiting advertising and labeling "which children and adolescents are exposed to" to black-and-white, text-only formats; no advertis
ing within 1,000 feet of a school or playground; banning the sale or distribution of branded non-tobacco items such as hats and t-shirts; and restrict sponsorship of events to the corporate name only, not the tobacco product brand name.  Also, the proposed regulations would federalize 18 years as the legal age for purchasing tobacco products and require that manufacturers fund anti-smoking educational campaigns.  <p>Specifically, the FDA's stated goal is to cut youth smoking by half within seven years, and if not achieved, then taking unspecified, additional steps.  Of course, the impact of these measures would reach well beyond any youth market and raises worrisome questions about the FDA's long-term goals relating to the tobacco industry.  After all, an August 1995 report by the FDA declared "that nicotine in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products is a drug, and that these products are drug delivery devices within the meaning of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act."  If true, the criminalization of tobacco products production and distribution must be a real possibility.  One has to wonder: Is the FDA seeking prohibition with all its commensurate woes?<p>For the short term, though, this FDA effort is essentially based on the highly questionable notion that advertising has a significant impact on youth decisions to smoke -- much more so than the more likely influences of peer pressure and family life.  The FDA also assumes that the federal government should, and can, direct the personal tastes and habits of Americans.  As in other cases where the nanny state runs amok, real and significant economic costs are incurred.<p>
<b>FDA Faulty Estimates</b>  According to an economic analysis performed for the Small Business Survival (SBS) Foundation by the American Economics Group, Inc.2,  the FDA's projections of potential job losses due to these regulatory proposals are grossly underestimated.  The FDA asserts that approximately 1,000 jobs annually would be lost in the tobacco warehouse, manufacturer, grower, and wholesaler sectors for about 10 years.  While a ten-year total of 10,000 jobs lost is nothing to gloss over, the American Economics Group report notes that this amounts falls far short of the actual numbers: "Incredibly, the FDA does not include a job loss estimate for the sectors that would be most vulnerable to its regulations -- the advertising, manufacturing and retail industries."<p>Substantive Cost Estimates.  The American Economics Group study for SBS Foundation examined the sales, employment, and wage impact of promotional and advertising expenditures by tobacco firms and found the following:<p>
<ul>
<li> Based on 1993 numbers, direct spending on advertising and promotion by tobacco companies employs an estimated 78,836 workers in the United States, and by the time you factor in the additional activity generated by these individuals, "the cycle of buying, all begun by tobacco advertising and promotion, continues until ... 209,112 persons are employed as a result."<p><li> Direct advertising and promotion purchases by tobacco firms amounted to more than $6.1 billion in 1993, with total generated purchases topping $17.9 billion.  Direct wages and salaries amounted to more than $1.9 billion, and "subsequent activity" generated more than $3.2 billion for a total of over $5.2 billion in wages and salaries in 1993.<p>
<li> Direct advertising and 
promotion expenditures by tobacco firms fall into 11 major industry categories -- food products and tobacco, apparel, printing and publishing, rubber and leather products, instruments and related products, miscellaneous manufacturing industries, transportation, wholesale trade, retail trade, business services, and miscellaneous services.  Subsequent derived expenditures impact 37 different industry groups.<p>
<li> The proposed FDA tobacco 
regulations place much of these advertising and promotional expenditures at risk, and therefore, the businesses -- many small, entrepreneurial firms -- tied into such activity as well.  <p>
<li> In terms of lost jobs, the report concludes that about 45,000 full and part time direct jobs and at least 65,000 derived jobs could be lost over a three to five year period.  This job loss estimate is 11 times the FDA's estimate.  And it should be remembered that these American Economics Group estimates only count jobs related to a decline in advertising and promotional expenditures by tobacco firms due to the proposed regulations, and not additional job losses due to any kind of decline in the purchase of tobacco products.  <p>
</ul><b>Excess Regulation Hurts the Economy</b><p>
  If a federal government agency is going to declare war on any industry with increased oversight and regulation, then a full accounting of the potential damage should be undertaken.  Increased federal regulation is not a costless endeavor.  Regulations have the same impact as taxes -- raising the costs of investing, risk taking, and generally "doing business."  These costs translate into less investing and entrepreneurship, lower profitability, increased chances of business failure (especially for smaller firms operating on a razor's edge), and less employment.  Therefore, federal agencies like the FDA have a responsibility to realistically examine the costs and benefits of their regulatory initiatives.
  <p>Unfortunately, when 
undertaking a regulatory jihad, FDA officials fail to even concern themselves with proper jurisdiction -- tobacco regulation has never fallen within the FDA's regulatory domain -- never mind real costs.  Orange juice producers, vitamin clinics, medical device firms, drug companies, and now tobacco-related businesses -- more and more industries are being sucked into the FDA's unjust regulatory wars.

<h3>Costs of Another FDA War:Attack on Vending Machines, An Attack on Jobs and Small Business</h3><b>by Raymond J. Keating<br>Chief Economist<br>Small Business Survival Committee</b></center><p><hr><p>

In the <a href="/sbsc/rw-fdaw1.html">first installment</a> in this three-part series, it was noted that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) proposed tobacco regulations could cost the economy -- at minimum -- an estimated 110,000 jobs over a three to five year period.1  This far outpaces the FDA's own estimate of 10,000 jobs over ten years.  The FDA failed to account for the full cost of its proposed legislation.
<P>One industry hit particularly hard by the proposed regulations is vending services.  Under the proposed FDA tobacco regulations, the sale of cigarettes through vending machines would be completely banned.  
<P>In a recent Wall Street Journal article ("If Cigarette Industry Coughs, Remote Areas Expect to Catch Cold," October 26, 1995), Mark Stomel, the owner of a vending machine company, noted who would be hurt by such a ban: "The man that fills the vending machines, the mechanic that fixes them, the people who do the maintenance of the vehicles. ... It spreads like wildfire."  He also reported that 25 percent of Stomel Vending Co.'s sales would be wiped out.
<P>The National Automatic Merchandising Association (NAMA) reports that cigarettes and tobacco sales represent 7.1 percent of sales by automatic merchandise machine operators, and a ban on these sales would mean thousands of lost jobs.
<P>The FDA claims that it has undertaken this regulatory assault on tobacco in order to cut youth smoking in half in seven years.  The FDA assumes that an end to cigarette distribution through vending machines will greatly assist this effort.  However, NAMA's numbers tell a different story.  <P>
<ul>
<LI> Cigarette purchasing habits of individuals ages 13 through 17:<P>				Convenience stores		43%				Gas stations			29%				Grocery stores			11%				Vending machines		  9%				Drug stores			  6%<P>

<LI> Location of vending 
machines:<P>		Locales rarely frequented by minors		77.5%			Bars, cocktail lounges		31%			Industrial plants		27%			Offices				12%			Hotels/Motels			  4%			Universities/Colleges		  3.5%		
Other Locales					22.5%			Restaurants			13%			Terminals, Rec - Bowling Centers, misc.	  9.5%			   <P>These numbers raise serious questions regarding the FDA's efforts.  Meanwhile, such a highly questionable undertaking presents real risks to an industry completely dominated by small businesses.  Vending Times reports that 26 percent of vending service providers are one-person (or family-only) establishments; 15 percent have only one part-time employee; another 28 percent claim 1-3 full-time employees; and 10 percent have 3.5-5 full-time employees.  In total, an incredible 90 percent of all vending firms employ less than 20 employees.  The survival of many of these firms is placed in jeopardy due to the proposed ban of cigarette sales through vending machines by the FDA.  </ul>
<P>While the FDA should not be involved in tobacco regulation at all, the aforementioned numbers addressing the purchasing habits of young smokers and the location of vending machines, show that little, if anything, would be gained on the youth smoking front by banning vending machines and throwing small businesses into turmoil.  The job of stopping youth smoking -- a goal worth supporting -- falls to parents, not federal government bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.  Governmental social engineering always fails -- and at great cost to the taxpayer, business, and the economy.<P><hr><P><center><b>End Notes</b></center><P>

<h3>FDA Facts: Exporting Entrepreneurship</h3><b>by Raymond J. Keating<br>Chief Economist<br>Small Business Survival Committee</b></center><p><hr><p>

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has become the model of a plodding, costly, and even deadly government bureaucracy.  The agency remains infamous for its ability to throw monkey wrenches into the machinations of some of the most dynamic industries of the late twentieth century, such as medical devices and pharmaceuticals.  Indeed, the FDA is slowing medical progress, hampering entrepreneurial enterprises, and destroying jobs due to regulatory obstacles and bureaucratic gridlock.	The FDA seems more intent on exporting American ingenuity and entrepreneurship, rather than encouraging the production of U.S.-made drugs and medical devices.	
<p>
FDA Responsibilities.  The FDA carries a long list of responsibilities, summarized as: regulating drug, food, cosmetics, biological product, and medical device labeling; approving new drugs, biological products, and medical devices; setting drug, biological product and medical device manufacturing guidelines; and establishing safety and effectiveness standards for drugs, biological products, and medical devices.	
<p>
To implement this ambitious agenda, the FDA staff totaled 9,217 in 1994, up from 1,678 in 1960 -- an increase of 449 percent.1  In 1994, the FDA's gross budget authority equaled $935.7 million.2	
<p>
<b>FDA vs. Entrepreneurs</b>
<p>
  As is the case with most regulatory agencies, the FDA seemed like a good idea at first, but it has grown into a massive, misguided undertaking.  The FDA has placed enormous burdens on the food, pharmaceutical, and medical device industries -- discouraging investment and risk taking in some of America's leading industries.	Examples of the havoc being wrought by the FDA abound:<p>
<ul>
<li> In the August/September 1995 issue of Reason magazine, Rick Henderson reported that "the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health takes more than three times longer to approve a Class III or 'substantial risk' medical device (such life-saving products as heart valves or CAT scanners) than do the agency's counterparts in Europe."  The impact of such delays?  "In the past 10 months, reports a survey published in June by the Health Industry Manufacturers Association, 50 percent of the more than 500 device makers surveyed had moved some clinical trials of new medical devices overseas; 56 percent refused to test new devices on Medicare patients; and 75 percent planned to move their trials to Europe."	
<p>
Henderson also noted, "The average time it takes a drug company to develop and gain approval of a new drug has almost doubled over the past 30 years -- from 8.1 years in the 1960s to 14.5 years today.  And, reports the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America ... more than 60 percent of new drugs and biologics (genetically engineered pharmaceuticals) approved here in the 1990s were first approved in another country."<p>

<li> Thomas G. Donlan noted industry trends driven by the FDA's regulatory maze in the July 3, 1995 issue of Barron's: "The failure of U.S. regulation can ... be seen in the scrambles that have roiled the industry to put research and manufacturing offshore, to make partnerships with foreign drug firms and to merge and merge and merge again in an attempt to create firms that are large enough to weather all the risks of regulation."	Of course, market-driven mergers in an industry are by no means worrisome.  However, substantial industry changes being driven by regulatory costs should cause regulators and their supposed overseers -- i.e., elected officials -- to re-evaluate their regulatory activities.<p>

<li> Robert Higgs, in a report for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, noted the hurdles companies face even when making improvements in already existing products or in their manufacturing processes: "Changes in the product or the manufacturing process, no matter how small, might cause the product to be consigned to an indefinite stay in preapproval purgatory.  FDA failed to differentiate between new devices and manufacturing changes for existing devices.  Manufacturers therefore had a reduced incentive to make the minor improvements that, cumulating over time, could greatly improve the performance of their products and the efficiency of their manufacturing operations."<p>

<li> Higgs also reported that FDA policies and conduct have boosted costs for medical device firms considerably -- perhaps adding $10 million to $20 million to a firm's budget, as well as several additional years before a new device gets to the market.  Such costs greatly reduce venture capital investment in new and expanding enterprises making medical devices.  One can only speculate as to the total number of potentially life-saving innovations and inventions that fail to reach consumers because regulatory costs reduce potential returns to such an extent that capital simply dries up.	In addition, Higgs noted that from 1989 to 1991, U.S. medical technology firms invested roughly the same amount abroad annually -- $321 million-$333 million.  "Then in 1992, when FDA abruptly made its enforcement and approval policies more onerous, capital outflow jumped more than 200 percent to $993 million."<p>

<li> One also has to wonder whether large firms feel the FDA's battering as severely as smaller and start-up enterprises.  Rick Henderson asserts in Reason that large, established pharmaceutical companies have benefited from the FDA's regulatory maze.  New, smaller firms lack the resources, expertise, and patience to surf the FDA's regulatory tidal wave.  Hence, entrepreneurs wipe out -- the system results in fewer competitors for established firms.<p>

<li> A 1993 report from the House Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee acknowledged the woes tied to the FDA's approval process for medical devices: "The situation is intolerable.  The backlog for pending device applications exceeds 1,100. ... The FDA's enforcement practices have demoralized and perplexed much of the medical device industry."3  <p>

<li> In testimony before the House Joint Economic Committee Hearing on Technical Innovations in Health Care on June 24, 1994, Robert C. DeHaven of the American Electronics Association declared that the FDA's "inordinately slow" regulatory process was threatening "the global competitiveness" of the medical device industry -- a $70 billion industry with more than 11,000 companies.<p>

<li> A recent American Electronics Association survey reportedly found that 40 percent of medical device firms reduced their number of U.S. employees because of FDA delays, 29 percent boosted investment in foreign operations, and 22 percent moved U.S. jobs out of the country.4  <p>

<li> FDA approval times have mounted.  For example, in 1988, it took an average of 78 days for the FDA to approve a product change (i.e., a 510-K application); by 1992, approval time had grown to an average of 126 days.5  This number further ballooned to 173 to 213 days by 1994.6   These applications are supposed to be approved within 90 days, according to FDA guidelines.  		Approvals of new devices take anywhere from 437 to 840 days.7  New device approvals, however, are supposed to be completed within 180 days.	Meanwhile, the median approval time for generic drug applications stretched out from 12 months to 38 months between 1986 and 1993.8  Of course, all of these numbers exclude FDA requirements placed on firms that extend development time.<p>

<li> The chief executive of the Minnesota-based Minntech Corp., Louis Cosentino, best summed up the effect of the FDA on entrepreneurs and the U.S. economy: "The attitude of the FDA is so antibusiness and so negative at this point that any prudent CEO has to be looking outside the U.S. as a safe haven."  Minntech laid off 50 Minnesota employees while expanding in Europe.9  <p>	

Meanwhile, the so-called benefits for consumers from all these added delays and costs remain difficult to detect.  In fact, bureaucratic delays by the FDA apparently cost tens of thousands of lives annually, as products and treatments are being denied to American consumers.	Export Restrictions.  Adding insult to injury, the FDA erects barriers to the export of U.S. medical products as well.  Even if a product has been approved for use in a foreign country, the FDA generally does not allow for exportation to that nation if the product has not received FDA approval.  Again, in the case of medical devices, a lengthy FDA approval process is needed in order to export.10  	

The CEO of a medical device company was denied permission to export by the FDA -- so he moved the company from the U.S. to Switzerland.  The CEO observed: "The FDA denied us permission to export. ... So we had to export our manufacturing plant."11  	
</ul>
<P>
<b>Entrepreneurs in the Regulatory Process?</b>
<P>
  One can at least be somewhat encouraged by the fact that the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives recognizes the many woes of the FDA.  In fact, Speaker Newt Gingrich went so far as to refer to the FDA as a "Stalinistic" agency and the "leading job killer" in the nation.12  Under the FDA's yoke, entrepreneurs and businesses possess every incentive to cease research and development, shift operations and jobs out of the country, or close down operations altogether.	
<p>
Congress needs to take bold steps.  Reports about FDA incompetence, abrasiveness, gridlock, intrusions, and costs are so numerous that they lead one to believe that more than mere reform is required.  Former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan pointed in the right direction when he wrote in the June 27, 1995 Washington Times: "Instead of making yet another effort to reform a system that seems incapable of reform, we should begin thinking about the design of a new system.  In my view, such a system would require considerable decentralization, perhaps along the lines of the European systems, where non-government institutions play a much greater role in the process of reviewing and approving new medical products."	
<p>
According to economist James Bovard writing in the December 8, 1994 
Wall Street Journal: "Rep. Gingrich favors replacing the FDA with an agency staffed with medical entrepreneurs, with strict limits on their time in government."  While one has to wonder why entrepreneurs would be willing to staff a government agency, the sentiment is correct.  In addition, this addresses a nagging question regarding the FDA: Can regulators ever be qualified enough to register sound judgments regarding such dynamic industries as biomedical companies?  Tapping medical entrepreneurs is a good idea, but would be better achieved by allowing private firms to undertake FDA safety approvals.  Meanwhile, efficacy should be left to the marketplace.	
<p>
>b>Global Competition</b>
<P>
  The FDA is taking a heavy toll on the U.S. economy in terms of lost entrepreneurship, investment, jobs, and international competitiveness.  In a world where both capital and labor can move with increasing ease and freedom, the U.S. regulatory regime is operating within an increasingly competitive global environment.  An agency that delays the approvals of beneficial drugs and medical devices to the degree that the FDA does ensures that U.S.-based firms operate at a severe disadvantage.  Of course, not only does this mean less investment, slower economic growth, and fewer jobs, but it also means that U.S. consumers often are denied access to life-saving  devices and treatments.  	
<p>
Competition can do wonders.  The U.S. regulatory regime acts as a severe drag on our economy.  Congress must act to make the U.S. food and drug regulatory environment more competitive on the world stage, or continue to lose cutting-edge firms and high-paying jobs to other nations.

<h3>FDA Facts: Strong-Arming American Business</h3><b>by Raymond J. Keating<br>Chief Economist<br>Small Business Survival Committee<p></b></center><hr>
<p>		
In the previous Small Business Reg Watch 1995, "FDA Facts: Exporting Entrepreneurship," the Small Business Survival Committee examined many of the costs and delays that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) imposes on firms in the medical device and pharmaceutical industries.  As a result, enterprises have either cut back on research and development, moved operations out of the country, or simply closed their doors.	However, the FDA does not stop at mere incompetence and bureaucratic gridlock.  In the 1990s, under the guidance of FDA Commissioner David Kessler, the FDA's enforcement efforts have become increasingly aggressive and intrusive.  One might say that the FDA has been strong-arming U.S. businesses.	FDA Intrusions.  Reports abound of the FDA's move to more aggressive and confrontational methods under Dr. Kessler's reign.  For example:<p>
<ul>
<li> In the May 1995 issue of Reason magazine, analyst Alexander Volokh reported: "Since 1990, when David Kessler took over as FDA commissioner, enforcement has been one of the FDA's top priorities.  In his first two months, Kessler added 100 new criminal investigators to his enforcement staff, many of them formerly with the Secret Service and Drug Enforcement Administration.  Armed raids on alternative health clinics and dietary supplement dealers followed, as well as increased warning letters, product seizures, and criminal prosecutions in the drug and device industries."<p>

<li> In the January 1995 issue of The American Spectator ("Double-Crossing to Safety"), James Bovard reported on the FDA's raid on Proctor & Gamble's "Citrus Hill Fresh Choice" orange juice.  The FDA disputed the use of the word "fresh" on the label, saying it was misleading.  Proctor & Gamble noted a survey showing that consumers knew that "Fresh Choice" did not mean fresh squeezed, and besides, "Made from Concentrate" was also on the label.  Bovard reports: "Kessler ... took sweeping action: He ordered U.S. marshalls to seize the juice -- 12,000 gallons, as it turned out -- and destroy it.  Federal law declares that a 'misbranded' or 'mislabeled' product is automatically unsafe, and provides FDA with the authority to confiscate the merchandise."<p>	

Naturally, the orange juice was perfectly safe, not to mention healthy.  Dr. Kessler action was meant to send a message to American businesses that the FDA was calling the shots.<p>

<li> Bovard noted another, similar raid.  This time it wasn't orange juice, but vitamins the FDA was after: "On May 6, 1992, a platoon of sixteen FDA inspectors and local police in flak jackets carried out a no-knock raid, smashing in the door of the Tahoma Clinic in Kent, Washington.  They held the staff at gunpoint, ostensibly so that nobody could try to hide the vitamins.  The raiders seized more than $100,000 in products and office supplies -- including address books and diaries -- and spent 14 hours cleaning out the office; they even tore the phones out of the wall.  FDA agents were supposedly concerned about the clinic's use of injected B-vitamins, which have been widely used in Germany with no adverse health problems."<p>

<li> Commissioner Kessler was appointed by President George Bush.  Refusing to resign from his post under a directive given to all presidential appointees during a normal transition to a new administration, Kessler worked hard to ingratiate himself with the president-to-be with a list of aggressive regulatory actions.  On December 8, 1992, during the White House transition, Kessler offered his view of the FDA in remarks before the Food and Drug Law Institute's 36th Annual Educational Conference.  His emphasis on re-regulation and more aggressive enforcement was clear, as noted by the following excerpts:<p>"We needed to send out a message that, ultimately, it was in no one's interest to deregulate a public health regulatory agency."<p>"We're paying more attention to our field these days.  We've become once again an FDA that vigorously enforces the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and not just an agency that approves products and educates consumers and the industry."<P>"Our enforcement people have fewer hoops to jump through, fewer boxes that must be checked off."<p>"We rely much less on voluntary agreements and much more on court-enforceable consent decrees."<p>"To complement the regular FDA field force we've created an Office of Criminal Investigations, not to be confused with the new Office of Investigations.  Thirty new special agents began intense training last week at a federal law enforcement training 	center in Georgia."<p>"In just over a year we've cleared the deck of uncompleted and abandoned regulatory proposals; we're getting new regulations out faster than ever before ..."<p>	Commissioner Kessler, of course,  kept his job.<p>

<li> This time writing in The Wall Street Journal (December 8, 1994), James Bovard observed another FDA tactic: "FDA employees are also sowing fear with a deluge of official Warning Letters (up more than 300% since Dr. Kessler took office).  Once the FDA issues a Warning Letter, it can seize a company's products or get a court injunction to paralyze its operations.  The FDA has refused to establish clear guidelines or rules for issuing its letters.  As a result, manufacturers can find themselves in a nightmare at the whim of a mid-level FDA employee."<p>

<li> In a letter to The American Spectator (April 1995), Dennis Plank, Editor-Publisher of the FDA Hotline, writes on how well federal regulatory agencies work together when it comes to regulatory crack downs: "A frightening current trend is how successful the FDA has become in pushing the buttons at other federal agencies to attack vitamin, supplement, and herbal manufacturers and suppliers.  We have reported on stepped-up enforcement actions by OSHA, FTC, Customs, Postal Service, and the DEA.  The Federal Trade Commission has now become the FDA's bully boy with no less than twenty cases pending against vitamin and natural product manufacturers."<p>

<li> One of the FDA's most aggressive moves just occurred.  It did not involve a physical raid on a company's facilities.  Instead, it amounts to the beginnings of a power raid on an entire American industry.  According to published reports, on Wednesday, July 12, 1995, the FDA declared nicotine to be a drug, linking this conclusion to concern over tobacco products being sold to minors.  	

<p>Of course, it is currently illegal to sell tobacco products to minors.  In reality, the FDA's declaration of nicotine as a drug lays the ground work for extensive control over the manufacturing and distribution of tobacco products by the FDA.  	Most recognize that smoking is bad for your health, as are so many other undertakings.  Tobacco, like other things, is a legally grown, packaged, and sold product in the United States.  What happens now that the FDA is calling nicotine a drug?  Are tobacco farmers and convenience store owners to become outlaws, part of organized crime, or perhaps pharmacists?  Are the FDA's enforcement tactics, as described above, to be extended to tobacco farms and convenience stores?  What about smokers?  The effect of the FDA calling nicotine a drug goes well beyond concern over youth smoking -- it is an issue of extending the control of the nanny state.	

<p>Indeed, why stop at nicotine?  What about other habit forming substances?  I'm overweight and enjoy drinking caffeine-laden beverages.  Will the FDA soon classify cheeseburgers, caffeine, and sugar as drugs -- how about hot dogs?<p>	

As government agencies often do, the FDA has proven to be both hypocritical and incompetent.  If Dr. Kessler and the FDA truly cared about the public's health, they would improve the efficiency of their medical device and drug approval processes.  Unfortunately, Dr. Kessler's reign seems more about control.<p>	
</ul><P>

<b>A Return to Safety Approvals and Education</b>
<P>
  The list of FDA abuses continues.  The time has come to rein in what has become largely a personal crusade. Much to the chagrin of FDA Commissioner Kessler, the FDA indeed should be "just an agency that approves products and educates consumers and the industry."  In the regulatory environment, anything more seems to breed hostility, often insurmountable costs, over-zealousness, arrogance, and massive intrusions on the part of regulators -- such as seizures of orange juice and armed raids on vitamin clinics.  The FDA's philosophy should not be one of making an example of a company in order to send a signal to other firms.  Instead, it should be one of cooperation with some of America's most dynamic and crucial industries.  	

<p>In light of potential litigation costs, lost profits, and the possibility of going out of business, firms in the medical device, food, and drug industries possess every incentive to produce safe products.  As usual, the market offers its own system of checks and balances.	

<p>Entrepreneurs in the medical device, pharmaceutical, and food industries are meeting the most essential human needs -- food and medical care.  The costs and risks of improving upon and/or creating new products in such areas remain substantial.  Unfortunately, the FDA has managed to significantly add to these costs -- not only through delays and additional regulatory requirements, but through unpredictable, intrusive actions, as touched upon in this paper.    Entrepreneurs are not the enemy; they are the driving force behind society's great leaps in technology, new products and services -- not the FDA.  	

<p>Former U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan was correct when he recently observed in The Washington Times (June 27, 1995) that the FDA "seems incapable of reform."  The FDA needs to be scrapped in favor of a smaller agency geared toward safety and education, with  a food, medical device, and pharmaceutical safety approval process largely contracted out to private-sector firms.<hr>

<h3>FDA Facts: Spending More to Get Less</h3><b>by Raymond J. Keating<br>Chief Economist<br>Small Business Survival Committee</b></center><p><hr><p>

Delays in  medical device and drug approvals by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have become infamous.  As noted in the <a href="rw-fda1.html">first installment</a> in this short series, for example, new device approvals now take anywhere from 437 days to 840 days, and approvals for mere changes in existing products take an average of 173 days to 213 days.  These periods compare with the required approval times of 180 days and 90 days, respectively.  Median time for approving new drugs tops three years -- 38 months in 1993 vs. 12 months in 1986 -- with the average time stretching out even farther.  Meanwhile, the total time to develop and gain FDA approval of a new drug has risen from an average of 8.1 years in the 1960s to 14.5 years today.	When confronted with such a dismal and costly performance record, FDA defenders will say that the agency is in need of more resources.  A quick look at FDA budget and employment levels tells quite a different story.	FDA Budget.  Figure 1 provides a glimpse at the FDA's budget authority for select years since 1955 in inflation-adjusted 1994 dollars.  To say the least, budget growth at the FDA has been robust.  For example:<p>
<ul>
<li> Just from 1989 to 1994, real FDA budget authority increased by 
52.6 percent -- or by an average annual real rate of more than 10.5 percent.
<P>
<li> Between 1970 and 1994, real FDA budget authority increased by 221.1 percent.
<P>
<li> And between 1955 and 1994, the FDA's real budget authority rose by 2,978 percent.  Though the FDA's powers were enhanced considerably in the early 1960s, an average annual boost in real FDA budget dollars since 1955 of more than 76 percent cannot be justified.<p>
</ul><P>

<b>FDA Employees</b>
Figure 2 illustrates the growth in employment at the FDA.  Again, a shortage of manpower does not seem to plague the agency.  For example:<p>
<ul>
<li> Between 1989 and 1994, FDA full-time employees grew by a substantial 25.3 percent.
<P>
<li> Between 1970 and 1994, FDA full-time employees increased by 115.7 percent.
<P>
<li> And between 1955 and 1994, full-time employees at the FDA increased by 933.4 percent.	
</ul><P>

<b>Incentives Problem</b>
<P>
 Considering the great leaps in real budget authority and employment at the FDA, it would seem quite a stretch of the imagination to believe that the FDA lacks sufficient resources.  Instead, what the FDA lacks are proper incentives -- as is the case with most government undertakings.  Costs and performance in government -- unlike the private sector -- take a back seat to concerns over expanding power, budgets, and employment.   Also, given the fact that the FDA suffers when an approved product fails, but garners little attention for the woes brought on by its own delays, the agency's incentives to prolong its approval process remain clear.   Taxpayers and consumers are spending more to get less from the FDA.  FDA delays, added costs, export restrictions, narrow-minded regulations, bigger budgets, and overly aggressive regulators are costing the United States in terms of lost businesses, jobs, and even lives.  Real reform means reduced costs and improved performance.  Such an outcome can only materialize if private-sector involvement in the safety of U.S. food, drugs, and medical devices is enhanced.<p><hr><P>

<h2>Repeal the Davis-Bacon Act</h2>
<h3>by Raymond J. Keating</h3>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
"By imposing high wages and restrictive work practices on nearly any federally funded construction project, the Davis-Bacon Act costs taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in excess construction fees every year -- and freezes tens of thousands of unskilled workers out of jobs."<p>
 
--Eugene H. Methvin, "<i>A Scandalous Law That's Costing Taxpayers Millions</i>," Reader's Digest,  December 1994
<p>
"Davis-Bacon increases costs to such an extent on federally-funded construction contracts that most small businesses are effectively precluded from bidding -- limiting competition and further raising costs for taxpayers."<p>
  --Karen Kerrigan, President, SBSC<p>
<hr>
<p>
Should the United States Congress and President Clinton repeal a regulatory act that denies opportunity to lower-income workers; panders to special interests; claims some racist origins; increases costs to taxpayers and the economy; and hurts small business?  Of course, the answer should be a resounding "yes."  The Davis-Bacon Act of 1931 does all of the above, and therefore, should be repealed.<p>
The Davis-Bacon Act requires that contractors on federally-funded construction contracts in excess of $2,000 pay workers what is termed "prevailing wage" in the region.  Supporters claim that Davis-Bacon was passed to ensure that local labor standards prevailed and local wages were not driven lower.  Most others tell another story.<p>
 
<h3>Pandering to Organized Labor and Racism</h3>

In a December 1994 Reader's Digest article, Eugene H. Methvin writes that Davis-Bacon was a "cruel relic of the Jim Crow era."  He points out that Davis-Bacon "was born in the Great	Depression year of 1931, after an Alabama contractor had submitted the low bid to build a veterans hospital on New York's Long Island and hired black laborers who had been largely shut out of the higher-wage construction unions."  New York Representative Robert L. Bacon and Pennsylvania Senator James J. Davis introduced the bill to block lower wages, and President Herbert Hoover signed it -- limiting the benefits of competition, while pandering to organized labor and racism.<p>
Just as was the case in the 1930s, low-income earners, limiting competition especially inner-city minorities, continue to be hurt by the Davis-Bacon Act.  Less-skilled, generally non-union workers are denied economic opportunity as Davis-Bacon inflates wages beyond the point where it makes economic sense for contractors to employ such inndividuals.<p>

<h3>Damaging Small Business</h3>

Small businesses are particularly hurt by the Davis-Bacon Act.  Government-determined "prevailing wages" often well exceed the actual prevailing wages in an area.  In an effort that even central planners in the former Soviet Union might have shied away from, the Department of Labor makes tens of thousands of wage determinations annually to guide Davis-Bacon contracts.  Of course, these estimates tend to be arbitrary, dated, and/or rely solely on union rates.  Many small businesses cannot afford to pay these government-imposed higher wage rates.  In particular, small businesses in inner-cities, who are willing to provide critical experience to less-skilled workers, are denied that opportunity due to government wage rates that do not reflect economic reality.<p>

In addition, the paperwork requirements associated with Davis-Bacon take a particularly heavy toll on small contractors.  In 1934, the Copeland Act was passed requiring employers on Davis-Bacon contracts to submit payroll records to the Department of Labor or contracting agency on a weekly basis.  This requirement forces many small contractors to higher additional clerical employees, invest in additional equipment, and/or alter their payroll schedules.  The result: higher costs that discourage small contractors from bidding on Davis-Bacon contracts.<p>

As these higher costs exclude many small businesses from bidding on Davis-Bacon contracts, costs to taxpayers are pushed even higher due to limited competition.<p>


<h3>Costs to Taxpayers and the Economy</h3>

This lack of competition, increased paperwork, and inflated wages, of course, translate into higher costs for taxpayers and the economy.  Various estimates of the increase in total construction costs due to the Davis-Bacon Act have been made, including:<a href="#foot1">1</a><p>
<ul>
<li>According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in 1993, if Davis-Bacon were repealed and Copeland Act requirements lifted, federal taxpayers would have saved $3 billion over the following five years.                                                         
<li>The Department of Defense estimated in the mid-1980s that Davis-Bacon induced an added cost premium of 5 percent.
<li>In 1979, the General Accounting Office (GAO) estimated an average cost inflation of 3 percent to 10 percent tied to Davis-Bacon.
<li>Some local officials have estimated that Davis-Bacon increased the cost of various community development projects by 20 percent to 50 percent.  Also, an Oregon State University study estimated cost inflation on federally-funded construction contracts in rural areas of 26 percent to 38 percent due to the Davis-Bacon Act.
<li>The GAO and CBO estimates do not include the costs of foregone competition -- raising the total cost of Davis-Bacon even higher.
</ul>

In addition, part of the Davis-Bacon rationale was to protect local workers from contractors outside the region.  Yet, as noted in a 1986 study by Armand J. Thieblot for the Wharton School, local contractors have gained a larger share of private contracts than they do Davis-Bacon contracts.<p>

Also, the Davis-Bacon Act spawned numerous state-level imitators -- placing similar requirements on state and local government contracts.  Just as does the federal Davis-Bacon Act, these state acts raise costs for taxpayers, deny economic opportunity to many less-skilled workers, and damage small business.<p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

Wages are best determined in a competitive marketplace, not according to the unrealistic estimates from Department of Labor bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.  The market allows wages and costs to adjust according to a host of criteria, including competition, skill levels and productivity, demand, supply, capital investment, et al.  The Davis-Bacon Act's wage criteria distorts the marketplace -- artificially favoring large businesses over small, entrepreneurial firms; and higher-skilled and paid workers over less-experienced, lower-skilled workers independent of job criteria.  Costs rise; the entrepreneur suffers; unemployment increases; and taxpayers foot the bill.<p>

The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) supports the straightforward remedy proposed by U.S. Representative Tom Delay (R-Tx.) to the many problems created by the Davis-Bacon Act.  Rep. Delay's bill simply reads: "Davis-Bacon of March 3, 1931 (known as the Davis-Bacon Act) is repealed."<p>

Raymond J. Keating serves as economics advisor to the Small Business Survival Committee, and is the co-author of D.C. By The Numbers: A State of Failure (University Press of America, 1995)<p>

<center><h3><I>Small Business</I> Budget Watch</h3> 
<i>November 1995</i> 
<P>
<I><B>Talking Points on H.R. 2472 (Davis-Bacon Expansion)</B></I>
<hr size="3" width="45%"></center>
<UL>
<LI>H.R. 2472 expands the coverage of Davis-Bacon off-site. This
bill applies inflated Davis-Bacon wage rates to <I>&quot;laborers
and mechanics employed by the contractor or subcontractor to work
directly upon the site of the work, including work at fabrication
plants, batch plants, tool yards, rock pits, or similar facilities

... that are not located on the project site, but the principal
purpose is to provide construction materials for the project;
and laborers and mechanics employed by a contractor or subcontractor

... to transport debris, materials, supplies, and equipment to
or from the site of the work...&quot;</I> 
<P>Obviously, this will
dramatically increase the cost of federal construction as other
industries are drawn into the Davis-Bacon wage trap. This bill
also would apply Davis-Bacon to all federally-assisted construction
(presently, Davis-Bacon applies only to contracts entered into
by the federal government or through related acts). Small firms
which materially support and transport material to/from federal
projects and those who perform work on federally assisted projects
would be severely burdened by the expansion of this harmful law.
<P>
<LI>While this bill would raise the Davis-Bacon threshold to $100,000,
it fails to produce any real cost savings. Although roughly two-thirds
of the total number of federal contracts will be eliminated from
Davis-Bacon requirements, less than 4% of the dollar volume of
federal contracts will be eliminated, resulting in minuscule savings
for the taxpayer. The renovation and repair threshold, which would
apply to <I>&quot;repair, rehabilitation, reconstruction, or alteration,
including painting and decorating, of public buildings or public
works of the United States...&quot;</I> is set at $25,000 -- this
creates a bifurcated threshold, which will increase legal and
administrative burdens.
<P><LI>This bill would allow any &quot;laborer, mechanic, or organization&quot;
to petition the Secretary of Labor in order to determine the applicability
of Davis-Bacon. This provision would increase the likelihood of
legal squabbles. Many small firms cannot absorb such litigation
costs.
<P><LI>This &quot;reform&quot; does not even significantly reduce
the Davis-Bacon paperwork requirements imposed on contractors.
</UL>

<P>
This bill is not reform, it's a ploy to increase the applicability
of the Davis-Bacon Act. Actually, Davis-Bacon is not reformable
-- it has no place in American government. This law, which has
cost taxpayers billions of dollars and denied opportunity to small
firms and minority workers, can prove useful only if eliminated.
Reports of fraud indicate that as long as Davis-Bacon exists,
it will continue to impose unjust, wasteful costs on taxpayers.
Time is running out on the Davis-Bacon Act, as Congress and the
public are beginning to realize it is beyond repair.

"With high taxes and a burdensome tax system impeding the
growth and survival of small businesses, taxes will be a priority
for each and every small business person who votes on November
5," said Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) President
Karen Kerrigan.
<P>
Kerrigan made her remarks on Capitol Hill  at a press conference
supporting the <I><B>Taxpayer Protection Pledge</B></I> -- an
effort sponsored by Americans for Tax Reform (ATR), a 60,000 member
national taxpayer organization.
<P>
"In 1992 Bill Clinton promised a middle-class tax cut, instead
middle-class small business owners got hit with the biggest tax
increase in history.  President Clinton made a campaign promise
to cut taxes, instead he raised them.  The <I><B>Pledge</B></I>
separates the true friend of the taxpayer from the big tax-and-spenders,"
said Kerrigan.
<P>
There are 2 versions of the <I>Taxpayer Protection Pledge</I>:
state and federal.  Signers of the state pledge promise to oppose
and vote against <U>any and all</U> efforts to increase taxes
while federal pledge signers promise to oppose increases in marginal
income tax rates and reductions or elimination of deductions and
credit.
<P>
 To date, GOP Presidential candidate Bob Dole, Libertarian Presidential
candidate Harry Browne, 210 U.S. House of Representatives, 35
U.S. Senators, and over 700 candidates or incumbents for state
legislators have signed the pledge.  
<P>

First, a quick thank you for those of you who weighed in to help
us defeat the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), and the Employment
Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA).  As you know, both would have placed
new regulatory burdens on business.<BR>
<P>
<B>CWC</B> -- In the end, the Senate did not have enough votes
to pass the CWC so supporters decided to pull it from consideration
for ratification.  What this means is that our CWC victory is
temporary.  The bad news is that the CWC will probably rear its
ugly head next year.<BR>
<P>
<B>ENDA</B> -- The same can be said for ENDA.  While ENDA was
defeated in the Senate by only one vote, the legislation will
continue to come before the Congress as long as Ted Kennedy remains
a member of the United States Senate.  Stay tuned and prepared.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Immigration </B>-- Legislation to curb illegal immigration
will be voted on soon.  We remain strongly opposed to the voluntary
employee verification program due to the burden it will place
on employers and employees alike.  The &quot;voluntary&quot; system
will most definitely become mandatory in the future.  SBSC believes
that the new system is flawed in that it will be riddled with
errors thus delaying the hiring process.  Please call SBSC to
receive more information so you can contact your member of Congress
with your concerns.

<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>On Wednesday, September 25, SBSC joined a
coalition of taxpayer, consumer and senior organizations to express
their thanks to the 104th Congress.  The &quot;Salute to the 104th
Congress&quot; was held on Capitol Hill, and SBSC President Karen
Kerrigan had the opportunity to thank members of Congress -- both
individually and collectively -- for their bold steps to help
protect entrepreneurs and encourage small business start-ups.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>&quot;Looking back at the last two years,
the 104th Congress passed historic measures to help small business
and promote entrepreneurship,&quot; said Kerrigan.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Kerrigan presented a special award to Speaker
Newt Gingrich at the ceremony, and 60 members of Congress who
scored 80% or higher on SBSC's ratings received a special tribute
and photo-op with the Speaker's award.  Over 600 people attended
the event.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>SBSC praised Republican-led reforms signed
by the President.  SBSC also thanked Congress for passing broad,
comprehensive tax and regulatory reforms supported by small business,
but vetoed by the President.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>&quot;While we are pleased that President
Clinton signed several of the initiatives target to help small
businesses, unfortunately he vetoed or stood in the way of other
reform priorities recommended by his own White House Conference
on Small Business,&quot; added Kerrigan.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>SBSC applauded the Congress for its passage
of health insurance reforms to help small business including the
phasing-in of deductibility to 80%, and passing Medical Savings
Accounts.  In addition, regulators are now more accountable to
small businesses because Congress put teeth into Regulatory Flexibility.
 Regulators must also publish their rules and regulations in &quot;Plain
English&quot; and Congress can now conduct a final review of regulations
and vote to reject them.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>President  Clinton vetoed the following small
business initiatives:  capital gains tax reduction, estate tax
reform, legal reform, the TEAM Act and a balanced budget.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>&quot;Most importantly, the 104th Congress
began to chip away at the old status quo through its cuts in wasteful
government spending to balance the budget,&quot; said Kerrigan.</FONT>

CALL TO ACTION: Chemical Weapons Treaty Nears Scheduled Vote
</b>
<P>
 September  6, 1996<p>
 Issue No. 20<BR>
<hr>
<P>
 The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)<BR>
</center>
<P>
The United States' Senate has scheduled a  ratification vote of
the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) before September 14, 1996.
 
<P>
Ratification of the CWC - a treaty to supposedly end the production
and stockpiling of chemical weapons - would risk the United States'
national security,  expose U.S. private industry to international
industrial espionage, and cost U.S. private firms billions in
regulatory costs associated with treaty compliance.
<P>
The treaty risks United States' national security because rogue
nations like Iraq, Syria, Libya, and North Korea have not signed
the treaty and thus are not bound by the CWC's provisions.  For
other countries such as Russia and China who are signatories,
their ratification of CWC is uncertain.
<P>
Secondly, treaty compliance would be difficult to ascertain. 
Former Central Intelligence Agency James Woolsey, stated before
the Foreign Relations Committee in June 1994 that &quot;The chemical
weapons problem is so difficult from an intelligence perspective
that I cannot state that we have high confidence in our ability
to detect noncompliance, especially on a small scale.&quot;  
<P>
<U>The CWC is a nonverifiable, nonenforceable treaty.</U>  The
United States would set a dangerous precedence ratifying the CWC
given that the treaty's provisions would strip the United States
of its ability to protect itself,  while allowing nations  hostile
to U.S. forces the ability to continue their production of chemical
weapons unabated.  
<P>
 In order to detect the production of chemical weapons, the treaty
institutes <U>a time-consuming verification program that is applicable
to a wide range of U.S. companies, that use certain chemicals
in the manufacturing process including - pharmaceutical companies,
textile mills,  paint manufacturers, food processing companies,
breweries, and distilleries.  </U>  The verification system  assigns
regulated chemicals  to &quot;schedules&quot; based upon what
is believed to be their relative usefulness for chemical weapons
production.  Each schedule has reporting requirements which include
copious amount of paperworks for each chemical and inspection
liabilities for the producing and consuming firms.  The U.S. Department
of Commerce estimates that filling out the paperwork will take
anywhere from 2.5 - 9 hours for <B>each</B> chemical depending
on its schedule classification.  
<P>
Instead of committing precious hours to operating a profitable
firm, business owners - many of whom are small business owners
- would be required to spend countless hours filling out paperwork
to prove that a chemical regulated by the treaty is used for their
legitimate business purposes.   
<P>
The CWC would be the first treaty in U.S. history to subject U.S.
industry to international authority.  
<P>
There would be 2 kinds of inspection: routine and challenge. 
Routine inspections would be directed at sites producing chemicals
that are perceived to present the greatest risk of diversion to
weapons use.  A firm could be subject to up to 20 routine inspections
per year.    Challenge inspections would be conducted when requested
and can take place within a 12 hour notification period.  There
is no limit on the number of challenge inspections a firm can
be subjected to.  
<P>
Inspectors would be permitted to interview site personnel, inspect
records, photograph on-site apparatus, take samples, record equipment
readings and use instruments to monitor processes.  <U>The company
 would be expected to comply completely with the inspectors' demands.
 The company is  also responsible for bearing the full cost of
the inspection - including  meals and lodging of the inspectors,
as part of the &quot;cost of doing business&quot; in chemicals.
 The Defense Department estimates that U.S. private industry would
pay anywhere from $10,000 to $500,000 for &quot;hosting&quot;
each inspection.  </U>
<P>
The figures given are just an estimate, but the cost to business
could be substantial given the costs associated with the loss
of confidential, proprietary information.  Furthermore, distinct
possibilities exist that due process rights could be violated
in relation to warrantless searches and personnel being compelled
to answer questions, and provide information and access.  
<P>
SBSC President Karen Kerrigan asserted, &quot;By all accounts,
the treaty is flawed, and we strongly urge the U.S. Senate to
take a sober look at the CWC.  We believe an honest assessment
of the treaty will reveal that the costs to U.S. businesses, the
loss of our economic freedom, and the compromising of rights protected
by the United States Constitution do not justify ratification
- especially since the treaty will threaten United States' national
security.&quot; 
<P>
<B>Please call or write your Senators immediately and urge them
to oppose ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention.  </B>A
sample letter follows:  <BR>
<P>
<I>Dear Senator:<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>I urge you to oppose ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention
(CWC) when it is considered by the Senate in September.</I>
<P>
<I>Chemical weapons can be inexpensively and secretly manufactured
and no treaty is going to change that fact.</I>
<P>
<I>What this treaty will do is make it significantly harder for
thousands of Americans to operate their businesses.  Small businesses
- unable to afford the thousands of dollars involved in new paperwork
- will be especially hard hit by the CWC's regulatory and administrative
requirements. The loss of trade secrets will add countless loses
to business operations.  Our economy will suffer irreparable harm.</I>
<P>
<I>Please vote to spare American businesses this unjustifiable
burden by defeating the Chemical Weapons Convention</I>.

<P>
1994 saw a record number of entrepreneurs and successful small
business people elected to Congress.  
<P>
 With 32 of 86 Congressional freshman former (or current) small
business owners heralding the economic advantages of small business
growth, the 104th Congress shifted from an anti-business to a
pro-entrepreneur agenda.   See Congress Becoming More Friendly
to Small Business.
<P>
Small-business Congress members have helped lawmakers focus on
fiscal and tax policies that aid small businesses in creating
new job opportunities for Americans.   
<P>
According to a 1995 March U.S. News &amp; World Report, there
are now 191 representatives who used to work in business-related
occupations, compared with 170 who worked in law.  
<P>
 This week <I>Small Business Hill Alert </I>highlights a speech
by small business woman, Sue Wittig, a candidate for New York's
 26th congressional district.   Ms. Wittig's speech typifies SBSC's
freemarket, limited government ideology. 
<P>
Sue Wittig's address was delivered to GOP delegates at the Republican
convention on August 12th, 1996.  <BR>
<P>
<I>My name is Sue Wittig, and I'm running for Congress.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>I'm a small business woman from Saugerties, New York.  Along
with my husband, I run a paint and wallpaper store, a family business
that was started by my Dad over thirty years ago...<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>Together with my Mom, [my Dad] built a business - and a family.
 And [he] taught me the value of both.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>We need representatives who understand the value of families...
<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>We need representatives who understand the marketplace.  It
is the small businesses of Newburgh, Kingston, Ithaca, and Owego
who are creating tomorrow's jobs.<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>We need representatives who understand limited government.
 Congress was designed to be a citizen Legislature, for people

<P>
The Small Business Survival (SBS) Foundation released a new <I><B>Small
Business Reg Watch</B></I>  documenting the bias of the National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and its interpretation of labor law.
 The report also outlines reform measures to move  labor law and
the NLRB into the 21st century.
<P>
According to the study entitled &quot;Time to Overhaul Labor Law
and the NLRB,&quot; the NLRB has taken judicial activism to the
extreme - blatant political NLRB decisions have been consistently
reversed by the courts who hear such cases.  In addition, current
NLRB Chairman William Gould has publicly stated his support or
opposition to various pieces of legislation before Congress -
an act that is unprecedented for what is supposed to be an impartial
arbritor of labor law.

<P>
The 104th Congress has improved markedly over the previous Congress
in terms of its votes on legislation to help small business and
enhance entrepreneurship. 
<P>
 &quot;Especially during its first term, the 104th Congress was
enthusiastically pro-entrepreneur.  Tax and regulatory relief
legislation, combined with proposals to cut the size and scope
of government all comprise the small business agenda,&quot; said
SBSC President Karen Kerrigan.
<P>
Kerrigan continued, &quot;The change in Congress marked a tremendous
shift in the direction of the small business agenda on Capitol
Hill.  Rather than small business being on the defensive, we were
able to consistently support legislation being considered on the
floor of both Houses.&quot;
<P>
 However, while Congress passed an unprecedented level of legislation
supported by small businesses and entrepreneurs, these measures
were largely vetoed by President Clinton.
<P>
&quot;Unfortunately, the bulk of legislation aimed towards the
growth and survival of small business was rejected by the President,&quot;
Kerrigan noted.
<P>
At the time of the release of SBSC's <I>Ratings of the 104th Congress</I>,
Congress was preparing to send the minimum wage hike amendment
to the President's desk for approval. 
<P>
The ratings were completed prior to the wage hike vote.  Its consideration
would have proven damaging for many members ratings.
<P>
For a copy of the ratings, contact SBSC at 800-223-7526.

<B> The Dole Economic Plan and the Entrepreneur</b>
<p>
August 19, 1996<p>
Issue No. 18<BR>
<hr>
<P>
<B> The Dole Economic Plan and the Entrepreneur<BR>
</B>
</center>
<P>
With the announcement of the Dole economic plan, tax cuts are
back on the front burner of the nation's public policy debate.
 And though one can find all sorts of opinions on whether this
is a good or bad thing, from the perspective of small business,
entrepreneurship, and economic growth, the major proposals put
forth in the Dole plan make for sound economic policy.<BR>
<P>
<ul>
<li> <U>Cutting the capital gains tax.</U>  The Dole plan calls
for a 50 percent cut in the top capital gains tax rate on individuals
from 28 percent to 14 percent.  <BR>
</ul>
<P>
Barring a complete tax overhaul, there is no tax cut that will
do more to spur entrepreneurship, investment,economic growth,
and job creation than a sharp reduction in the capital gains tax
rate.  The great hurdle to starting up and/or expanding a business
remains access to capital.  Investing and entrepreneurship are
high&#173;risk endeavors.  High risks require the opportunity
for substantial returns.  Slash the capital gains tax in half
and you enhance the potential returns from risk&#173;taking.<BR>
<P>
A 50 percent reduction in the capital gains tax rate would provide
a major boost to small business, entrepreneurship, and the economy.
<BR>
<P>
<ul>
<li> <U>Across&#173;the&#173;board cut in personal income taxes.</U>
 A 15 percent across&#173;the&#173;board cut in personal income
tax rates works favorably for small business and the economy in
three key ways:<BR>
<ul>
<P>
1) Boosts incentives for individuals to work, save, invest, and
take risks.  Again, this is a straightforward relative price argument
&#173;&#173;as the old saying goes, the less you tax something,
the more of it you get.<BR>
<P>
2) Resources are shifted from the unproductive sphere of government
to the productive private sector.  Or another way to put it, individuals
operating in the private marketplace spend and invest their money
far more efficiently and wisely than do government bureaucrats.
<BR>
<P>
3) Since about 79 percent of all business tax returns are either
sole proprietorships or partnerships (the other 21 percent being
corporations), then an across&#173;the&#173;board personal income
tax cut directly impacts the bottom line of millions of U.S. businesses.
 Lower taxes mean more funds available for capital investment,
additional employees, et al. <BR>
</ul>
<P>
<li> <U>Additional measures.</U>  The Dole plan calls for other
tax cuts and reforms impacting small businesses and entrepreneurs,
including: <BR>
<ul>
<P>
&#173;<I>Unrestricted tax&#173;free medical savings accounts (MSAs)
and 100 percent deductibility for health insurance for the self&#173;employed.</I>
 MSAs inject choice and accountability into the health&#173;care
system, and 100 percent deductibility places all businesses on
an equal plain in terms of the tax treatment of health care expenses.
<BR>
<P>
&#173;<I>Estate tax reductions</I>.  The estate tax amount to
nothing more than a government hostile takeover of family businesses.
 All cuts in the estate tax are welcome, hopefully on the path
to complete repeal of the estate tax.<BR>
<P>
&#173;<I>Repeal of the 1993 tax increase on Social Security beneficiaries.</I>
 Again, this will boost incentives to work and keep resources
in the private sector.<BR>
<P>
&#173;<I>Expanded IRAs and institution of spousal IRAs</I>.  Such
measures will boost incentives to save and expand loanable funds
available to business.<BR>
<P>
&#173;<I>Regulatory reform.</I>  Requiring peer&#173;reviewed,
science&#173;based risk assessment and cost benefit analysis for
new regulations, regulatory review of all new regulations every
four years, and a task force to review and recommend sunsetting
ineffective and costly regulations, all point toward gaining some
much&#173;needed control over a federal regulatory apparatus strangling
businesses, investment, and entrepreneurship.<BR>
<P>
&#173;<I>Legal reform.</I>  Measures such as limiting punitive
damages in most cases, abolishing joint and several liability
for non&#173;economic damages in civil cases, and curbing contingency
fee abuses, all amount to a good start at alleviating many of
the burdensome costs of our legal system that damage or destroy
countless businesses and the jobs they create.<BR>
</ul>
</ul>
<P>
U.S. businesses and entrepreneurs need tax cuts, regulatory relief,
and legal reform.  The cost of government is massive, inhibiting
new business formation, economic growth, and job creation.  Once
fully implemented, the proposals in the Dole economic plan would:
<BR>
<P>
<ul>
<li> Increase incentives for working, saving, investing, and
entrepreneurship.<BR>
<P>
<li> Boost rates of economic growth and job creation.<BR>
<P>
<li> Help both equity and bond markets, as incentives for investment
are enhanced and faster economic growth eases inflation threats
(assuming sound monetary policy).  After all, inflation results
from too much money chasing too few goods &#173;&#173;faster growth
means more goods and services.<BR>
</ul>
<P>
<B>The bottom line is: Tax cuts help small businesses and entrepreneurs.
<BR>

<h3>An Action Alert to Advance the Small Business Agenda on Capitol Hill</h3><p>
<i>July  29, 1996 <p>
Issue No. 17</i><p></center><p>
<i><center> Call to Action : Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC),  Institute for Justice Study Participation</i></center>

<hr>
 <center><h2>Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)</center></h2><p>

<u><b>On or before, September 14</u></b>, the Senate will consider ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), a treaty that is supposed to ban the stockpiling and production of chemical weapons.   <p>
Grave  concerns about  the treaty's effectiveness, and its cost  to  national security and business have been raised by defense and policy experts.  <p>
<b>One of the biggest concerns regarding ratification of the CWC is the threat to national security.</b>  Few countries possessing chemical weapons are likely to cease buildup of their chemical weapons program because of the treaty.  In fact, six of fourteen countries suspected by the U.S. of possessing chemical weapons have not signed the treaty.  <p>
Rogue nations like Libya, North Korea, Iraq, and Syria continue production of chemical weapons unabated while China and Russia  - countries with the largest chemical weapons arsenal in the world - provide inconsistent and contradictory data on their chemical weapons program.  <p>
CWC poses a threat to national security because noncompliance can not be easily detected.  Since the CWC allows ample time for inspected facilities to conceal their activities,  noncompliance  would be impossible to detect.   Former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), James Woolsey, testified that the CIA lacks high confidence in our ability to detect noncompliance, especially on a small scale.  Noncompliance is therefore unverifiable.  <p>
Signing and ratifying a treaty which is unverifiable sets a dangerous precedent for future arms control agreements and threatens the United States national security.  <p>
<u><b>Another major concern regarding CWC ratification is the direct and indirect cost to U.S. industry.</u></b>   Under the treaty, U.S. private industry would be subject to foreign inspection, thus exposing American businesses to the real threat of international industrial espionage.  Long-held trade secrets and other proprietary information could be compromised in a matter of seconds.  International inspectors  located in the Hague, Netherlands would be responsible for carrying out inspections of U.S. companies.<p>
In addition, American firms - such as distilleries,  breweries, and insecticide, pharmaceutical, ceramic, nylon, paint, textile, soap, detergent, and electronic manufacturers  -  which produce or use a scheduled chemical  would be required to fill out additional paperwork under a new four-tiered process.  (The additional regulatory burden is estimated to take administrators 9 hours for every Schedule 1 chemical, 7.2 hours for every Schedule 2 chemical, 5.3 hours for each Organic Chemical and 2.5 hours for every Schedule 3 chemicals.) <p>
It is estimated that roughly 8,000 businesses currently do not have compliance mechanisms in place.  These businesses and smaller businesses will be hardest hit by the increased regulatory burdens treaty ratification will bring.  (Past studies have shown that the per employee cost of federal regulations is 50% higher for firms with fewer than 500 employees.)  Right now it is estimated that the cost of hosting an inspection is $10,000.  If the inspection is challenged, the cost could be $200,000 - $500,000.   
The CWC is riddled with problems that should concern all Americans.  It will be voted on by mid-September.  Please call or write your United States Senators immediately and tell them not to ratify the CWC in its current form. A sample letter follows:<p>

<i>The Honorable ______<br>
United States Senate<br>
Washington, D.C.  20510<p>

Dear Senator _______:<p>

I am writing to express my serious concerns with the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).  The CWC, in its current form, will seriously damage United States national security and impose a massive, new regulatory burden upon thousands of U.S. businesses.<p>
The CWC will do nothing to reduce the chemical weapon arsenals of terrorist countries and other nations hostile to the United States.  In fact several countries of most concern to the United States have not signed or ratified the treaty.  <p>
I am also concerned with the treaty because it  is unverifiable. Former Central Intelligence Agency Director, James Woolsey, testified that noncompliance of the treaty will be virtually impossible to detect.  
And finally, ratification of the treaty will create another bureaucracy costing U.S. taxpayers millions of dollars and imposing costly regulatory burdens on thousands of U.S. companies.<p>
I urge you to preserve our national security and protect U.S. businesses by voting against ratification of the CWC.<p>

For more information on the CWC, please call SBSC at 800-223-7526.<p>

<h3>The Small Business Survival Committee - July 1996</h3></center>

<hr>



<b>Davis Bacon Update<p></b>

Recently, the Coalition to Repeal Davis-
Bacon met privately with Oklahoma 
Department of Labor Commissioner, Brenda 
Renau.  At issue were cases of fraud and 
abuse that she and her team of investigators 
have discovered.  Because of the U.S. 
Department of Labor's unwillingness to 
cooperate in reform, it is likely that more 
cases of abuse are entrenched throughout the 
U.S.  The Congressional Budget Office 
estimates that $7.3 billion in government 
funds could be save in just five years 
without the act which establishes "prevailing 
wages"that employers must pay, usually at 
much higher-than-market prices.  Call 
Representative William F. Clinger, Jr., chair 
     of the House Oversight Committee at     
202-225-5074 to voice your concern.<p>

<b>Starting Wage Hike<p></b>

As you now, both the House and Senate 
recently voted to mandate an increase in the 
starting wage by $.90.  The Senate measure 
is strikingly similar to its House counterpart 
but includes a number of tax breaks for 
small businesses, among them: an increase 
in the spending limit of small businesses 
under Section 179 from $17,500 to $25,000; 
a simplified pension plan for small business 
employers; and deductible contributions to 
individual retirement accounts by non-
working spouses.  Since the bill is not in its 
final stage however, Sen Kennedy and 
others anti-business congressmen are still 
threats.  An amendment offered by Sen. 
Kennedy that would have shortened the 
duration of the subminimum wage ($4.25) 
from 90 days to 30 days failed.  Call your 
Senator or Representative to express your 
strong desire that the small business tax 
credits stay in the bill despite any last 
minute deals by Sen. Kennedy and the like.  
We must remain vigilant if we are to prevail. <p>

<b><a href="http://politicsusa.com/cvc">CAFE Standards</a></b><p>

The CAFE standards will prove to be a hot topic 
on the Hill later this summer.  If President 
Clinton has his way and the standards are 
increased, small business owners could see a 
dramatic increase in the cost of doing business.  
Please write or call President Clinton to express 
your support for the current CAFE standards.  
The following is a sample letter to serve you as 
a guide.<p>

Sample Letter to the White House<br>
Small Business Owner<p>
Sample #1<p>

President William J. Clinton<br>
The White House<br>
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW<br>
Washington, D.C.  20500<p>

Dear President Clinton:<p>

In the last election, voters sent a message to 
Washington:  "Cut excessive Government 
regulation."  As a small business owner, I can 
tell you how important that is.<p>

Several recent news articles blamed the owners 
of light trucks for recent gas price increases.  
They also suggested the answer was increased 
governmental regulation of motor vehicle fuel 
economy.  I disagree.<p>

Higher gas mileage standards would hurt small 
business owners in two ways.  First, the price of 
the larger pickups and vans like we use would 
probably go up to encourage sales of smaller 
vehicles.  Or the manufacturers would have to 
reduce the size and weight of those vehicles-- 
which means I'd have to buy an even bigger, 
more expensive vehicle than I need to support 
my business.<p>

President Clinton, don't let that happen.  We 
need less regulation, not more.  Say that you 
will leave vehicle fuel economy standards right 
where they are.<p>

Sincerely,<p>
<p><br>

At the June 5 press conference, SBSC President Karen Kerrigan
stated, &quot;The President has been given ample opportunity to
support the small business agenda...it is clear that he continues
to embrace an economic model that puts government at the center
of the economy, rather than the entrepreneur.&quot;<BR>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Study Looks at Entrepreneur Climate Across the United

</B></CENTER>
<P>
Marking the start of National Small Business Week, the Small Business
Survival Foundation formally released a report that provides a
measure of government-related costs affecting the business decisions
of investors, entrepreneurs, and businesses across the United
States.  The report, the <B>Small Business Survival Index</B>,
combines nine major costs (whether rates, ratios, or indexes)
levied on small businesses and entrepreneurs into one comparative
index number.  <BR>
<P>

</B></CENTER>
<P>
 All businesses <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT> including
small businesses <FONT FACE="Typographic Ext">,</FONT> face additional
regulations through the proposed adoption of the employment verification
measure.  It passed in both the House and Senate versions of the
immigration proposals. San Diego employers currently using a toll-free
verification system similar to House measure report that the system
can take up to &quot;three calls, several minutes, and sometimes
several days to verify a Social Security number...&quot;  At this
point, the verification system will be voluntary, but SBSC believes
it will eventually become mandatory.
<P>
SBSC's position:  The verification system does not recognize the
administrative and regulatory burdens associated with operating
a business.  Illegal immigrants who show remarkable deftness at
skirting U.S. laws will continue to do so even under the system.
 Hence, the law-abiding employer using the proposed system (and
American citizens) will be the only persons &quot;caught&quot;
by this intrusive system.
<P>
       <B> Time still exists to make your voices heard</B>.  Call
your Representatives and Senators, tell them to say no to additional
regulations  -- &quot;voluntary&quot; or not.<BR>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Starting Wage Proposal in the Senate <BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
The Senate will soon offer their version of the starting wage
bill.  It is expected to closely parallel the House proposal and
increase the starting wage by $0.90 by 1997.  The following provisions
have been added: (1) tipped employees would have the federal cash
wage frozen at $2.13 per hour, instead of 50 percent of the current
federal starting wage and (2) new hires would be paid an &quot;opportunity
wage&quot; during their first 90 calendar days of employment.
 
<P>
It is probable that Senator Kennedy will offer an amendment to
strip these provisions - thereby attempting to force a straight
starting wage bill with the $0.90 increase.  
<P>
<B>Small business owners still have time to weigh-in with the
Senators.   </B>Let them know that you oppose any increase in
the starting wage, but if an increase is unavoidable, then include
the small-business provisions passed by the House.  <U>Most importantly,
tell your Senators not to support any amendment that strips the
tip credit or the opportunity wage language.<BR>

<B>The Budget That Won't Go Away, Tax System Overhaul Gets Another Boost</B></center>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<b>Backed Into a Corner?</b>
<P>
If the budget negotiations were to be decided by who has 
compromised more, the Republicans would be victorious.  
The GOP Congress has compromised $68.5 billion more 
than President Clinton since the beginning of budget talks, 
as the chart below outlines.  (Budget figures are the most 
recent offers of 1/9/96 in billions of dollars.)
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<PRE>
	GOP Compromise		Clinton Compromise

Medicare	+ $58		- $27

Medicaid	+ $48		- $22

Welfare		+$3.5		- $3

EITC		+ $12		- $3

Tax Cuts	- $51		+ $20

Discretionary	+ $60		- $89
---------------------------------------------------<P>
$232.5 toward the Pres.		$164 toward Congress
</pre>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
The Republicans have compromised more than the  
President in every disputed area with the exception of 
discretionary spending.  The President's latest tax cut 
proposal, which does not provide for a cut in capital gains 
taxes, shows that he has moved less than half than the GOP 
in the area of tax reduction.
<P>
Recent reports suggest that a capital gains tax cut is likely to 
be included in a budget deal.  The Clinton Administration 
may formally propose a 7.5% cut in the cap gains rate for 
individuals with a 17.5% cut for Americans in the lowest tax 
bracket.  Separately, Congressional Democrats have 
continued to rail against a cap gains tax cut, and Vice 
President Gore reportedly has said that opposition to cuts in 
cap gains taxes was "a theological issue" for Democrats.
<P>
Language within the first continuing resolution (CR) to fund 
parts of the government allowed for "protecting our 
priorities" -- which may well mean increased spending 
levels for those politically sensitive areas the President does 
not want to cut.  That vague language has come back to 
haunt the GOP and other proponents of meaningful spending 
and tax reduction.  And, it appears that the compromises by 
the GOP have gone unnoticed.  Republican leaders have 
suspended the budget negotiations, denying them airtime to 
advance their position on the negotiations.  Pres. Clinton 
will use the State of the Union address on January 23 to try 
to bolster his.  Republicans may attempt to move forward by 
enlisting the help of conservative and moderate Democrats, 
though some GOP leaders (including Newt Gingrich) doubt 
that a budget agreement can be reached this year.
<P>
<b>Kemp Commission Points the Way to Tax Reform</b>
<P>
Citing the current tax code's "oppressiveness," "complexity," 
and "intrusiveness," the National Commission on Economic 
Growth and Tax Reform - chaired by former Congressman 
and HUD Secretary Jack Kemp - recommended scrapping 
the entire code.  The Commission advocated a new 
beginning for the American tax code, and laid out a set of 
principles to advance strong economic growth, small 
business expansion, and job creation.  House Speaker Newt 
Gingrich (R-GA) and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-
KS) voiced support for the findings of the Commission.
<P>
Despite a lack of specificity in its final report, the 
Commission has established a strong, meaningful start for 
tax reform.  The Commission called for a flat, fair tax rate 
that embraces simplicity and stability.  The 
recommendations pointed toward abolishment of capital 
gains taxes, full deductibility of the federal payroll tax, an 
end to double taxation, a two-thirds majority to raise the flat 
rate, and expensing of investment outlays.
<P>
The crux of the Commission's report is that the tax code 
should be submissive to the public, particularly small 
business owners.  An unruly IRS is no longer tolerable.  
There is little doubt that the findings of the Commission 
fulfill promises of tax system overhaul, and SBSC supports 
the general guiding principles of the Commission.  As noted 
in an SBSC press statement, however, the report: "is not 
long on details.  Now comes the heavy lifting of making 
detailed, principled tax overhaul a reality."
<P>
Although the Commission recommended including a 
generous personal exemption in tax reform proposals, critics 
attacked the report's embracing of a fair flat tax rate as a 
giveaway to the rich (surprise, surprise).
<p>
The Commission's report is expected to have an  impact on 
current tax reform proposals in Congress.  One leading 
Republican, House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer 
(R-TX), was critical of the Kemp Commission's findings.  
Archer supports a tax based solely on consumption and felt 
the report said nothing new.

<B>Budget Politics, the Numbers Game, and Minimum Wage Follies</B>
<P>
<U><B>&quot;Serious&quot; Budget Talks to Get Underway</B></U>
</center>
<P><hr>
<P>
<I>The New York Times</I> has reported that budget officials expect
to strike a deal by Friday (December 22).  The budget negotiations
began late November, and since that time little progress has been
made in deciding our country's fiscal fate for the next seven
years.  Unfortunately, it has been &quot;politics-as-usual&quot;
at the negotiation table, particularly for the Clinton Administration.
 As the federal debt approaches a massive $5 trillion dollars
with annual deficits of $192 billion (and as anemic economic growth
continues), you would think circumstances would dictate substantive
spending cuts.  Instead, secretive budget negotiations have us
asking whether Santa will bring us a seven-year balanced budget
with pro-growth tax cuts.  Bah Humbug.
<P>
<B>CBO: How Many Billions Can We Spare?</B>
<P>
Recently, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its revised
economic projections - the result of a compromise between President
Clinton and Republican Congressional leaders.  The latest CBO
numbers paint a more positive forecast for the U.S. economy, and
the CBO projects that under the Republican plan, an additional
$135 billion in revenues will be available by 2002.  Washington
insiders rejoiced at this news.  The Administration budget negotiating
team felt that the additional $135 billion would bring Congressional
Republicans closer to the President's spending demands.  Economic
forecasts have failed to live up to expectations in the past.
 While CBO numbers are the most accurate, SBSC was disappointed
that the &quot;expected&quot; additional revenues will be sacrificed
on the negotiating table instead of applied to spending cuts --
which means tax cuts will more than likely be sacrificed as well.
<P>
The more Republicans negotiate behind closed doors with the Clinton
Administration, the more we are likely to see the President's
type of &quot;investments&quot; emerge- a code word for more spending.
 The gross federal debt is over 70% of the Gross Domestic Product
($4.96 trillion).
<P>
<B>MESSAGE TO CONGRESS: Invest in the Future By Cutting Spending
Now and Giving America $245 Billion in Tax Cuts.</B>
<P>
<B>The Minimum Wage Hike Returns</B>
<P>
President Clinton included a minimum wage hike in his recently
proposed budget.  The President proposes to raise the minimum
wage to $5.15 (a 21% increase) by July 1, 1997, with an interim
increase to $4.70 in July, 1996.  President Clinton's proposal
is driven by  politics  rather than economics.  As one of his
officials said earlier this year: &quot;There are few of us who
actually think it is good economic policy, but more than a few
think it might be good politics.&quot;
<P>
An increase to the minimum wage is definitely not 'good economic
policy.'  Numerous studies and sources, including the General
Accounting Office  and Brookings Institution, have concluded that
a 10% increase in the minimum wage results in a 1%-2% decline
in overall entry-level employment.  <I>President Clinton's proposal
is  projected to cost 400,000 jobs.</I>
<P>
Only 4.7% of the workforce earns the minimum wage.  Minimum wage
workers are four times more likely to be young, single, and inexperienced
when compared to other hourly employees.  Economists estimate
that only about 11% of minimum wage increases go to individuals
at or below the level of poverty.
<P>
The President's proposal should be treated for what it is - an
unfunded mandate for America's small business owners.  Considering
63% of minimum wage workers get a raise within twelve months (with
an average wage increase of 20%), wage rates would be better left
to small business owners - rather than the President.
<P>
<B>MESSAGE TO CONGRESS: No More Unfunded Mandates Like Minimum
Wage Hikes- Cut Regulations and Taxes For the Best Pay Increase.</B>

<B>Public Voices Support for Seven-Year, Tax-Cutting Balanced
Budget &amp; The Case for Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs)</B>
<P>
<B>Poll Indicates Voter Support for a Seven-Year Balanced Budget
with Tax Relief</B></center>
<P><hr>
<P>
After hearing some of the provisions of the Republicans' seven-year
balanced budget, 57% of those polled said that they had a very
positive/somewhat positive impression of the plan, according to
a poll commissioned by The Coalition for America's Future and
Coalition for a Balanced Budget: 7,200 voters were surveyed between
Nov. 29-Dec. 2.  86% said that the Congress and President Clinton
should deal with the federal budget issue this year: 47% percent
of those surveyed support a balanced budget with spending cuts
<i>and tax relief</i> compared to 39% who support a balanced budget
without tax relief.
<P>
<B>Financial Officers, Greenspan Point to the Need for a Balanced
Budget</B>
<P>
A poll of chief financial officers by the Financial Executives
Institute (FEI) found strong support for a balanced federal budget.
 FEI stated that a balanced federal budget this year will prevent
increased interest rates, falling stock prices, reduced sales,
and higher unemployment.  77% of the financial chiefs said the
economy would take a downturn if there is a failure to reach a
budget agreement this year.
<P>
Similarly, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Capitol
Hill that the recent fall in interest rates, which lowers mortgage
rates and boosts housing and automobile sales, was caused by the
market's anticipation of an agreement between the president and
Congress to balance the budget over a determined period of time.
<P>
<B>ACTION ITEM: Continue to Contact your Member of Congress in
Support of a Seven-Year Balanced Budget with Tax Cuts.</B>
<P>
<B>Medical Savings Accounts - Good for Small Business and Health
Care</B>
<P>
Tax-free medical savings accounts (MSAs), which have been praised
by the many businesses that have adopted them as the health care
vehicle for employees, are included in the GOP's Balanced Budget
Act.  MSAs end burdensome paperwork requirements for consumers,
doctors and insurance companies.  And MSAs are portable - each
MSA plan belongs to the employee.  The market dynamics of MSAs
inject cost-consciousness into the health care system.  Thus,
MSAs directly benefit small businesses constantly faced with spiraling
health care costs.
<P>
The congressional budget plan allows MSA tax-free savings of up
to $2,000 for an individual and $4,000 for a family.  The accumulated
interest is not taxed under the Balanced Budget Act.  There is
a 10 percent penalty for non-medical withdrawals to MSAs.  (Please
call SBSC for more information on MSAs and how they work.)
<P>
<I>Concord Management, a real estate management firm which employs
nine people, uses MSAs as a health plan.  One Concord employee,
Richard Norton, suffers from asthma.  After obtaining his MSA,
Norton shopped around for the cheapest asthma medication.  Consequently,
he now pays one-fourth the amount of the medication provided by
his employer under Blue Cross and Blue Shield coverage.  At the
end of the year, Norton received a check for $750 -- the unspent
balance in his $1,500 MSA.</I>
<P>
The GOP budget plan includes medical savings accounts.  The president's
plan, offered on Wednesday, does not.
<P>
<B>ACTION ITEM: Write or Call (202-456-1111) President Clinton
to Include MSAs in the Budget Package. (fax: 202-456-2461, e-mail:

<P>
<B>The Congress' Balanced Budget Act Addresses the Security of
Family-Owned Businesses and Spiraling Growth of Entitlement Programs</B><P>
<B>Why We Must Cut Estate Taxes</B></center>
<P><hr>
<P>
One of the biggest obstacles to the generational transfer of family-owned
businesses is the estate or inheritance tax.  Approximately 60
percent of family-owned businesses fail to make it to the second
generation, and 90 percent do not make it to the third generation.
 Are estate taxes the cause?  They are a major contributor.  Nine
out of ten successors to a family-owned business cited trouble
paying estate taxes according to a 1993 survey.  Family-owned
businesses generate about 60 percent of our GDP, and during the
1980s they were essential to the increase of more than 20 million
private sector jobs.
<P>
The Republican budget would &quot;phase-up&quot; the estate tax
exemption from $600,000 to $750,000 each year from 1996-2001.
 The Budget Act would begin factoring in inflation after 2000,
and provide for a total amount of exclusion per decedent for qualified
family-owned business interests equal to $1.75 million.  Although
the modifications stop short of a repeal of the estate tax, SBSC
was pleased to have seen the Congress take steps to turn back
the harmful effects of the inheritance tax.
<P>
It is ludicrous that government claims under the estate tax up
to 55 percent (or any percent) of an individual's assets upon
death, considering that individual had established a business,
worked hard, and paid taxes over a lifetime.  What is even more
ludicrous is the fact that this act of class envy is a big money
loser for the government!  In 1994, estate and gift taxes accounted
for a mere 1.2% of total federal receipts ($15.2 billion).  At
least 75% of that revenue is eaten up by compliance and litigation
costs of the IRS and Treasury.
<P>
A cut in the estate tax, besides being morally correct, is good
for the economy.  A 1993 study estimated that without an estate
tax by the year 2000, the GDP would be $79.2 billion higher, 228,000
more jobs would be created, and $630 billion more in savings and
capital would accumulate.
<P>
<B>MESSAGE TO CONGRESS: Don't Give in to Class Warfare Rhetoric!
 Stand by the pro-job, pro-growth Estate Tax Cuts</B>
<P>
Capitol Hill Switchboard 202-225-3121
<P>
<B>&quot;Cutting&quot; Medicare and Medicaid</B>
<P>
Unless the President and Congress tame Medicare and Medicaid spending,
the two programs will eventually consume all federal revenues
and/or collapse.  If left on present course, entitlements and
interest on the debt will devour all federal revenues by 2012.
 Medicare and Medicaid are the fastest growing entitlement programs.
<P>
The Republican plan proposes to cut the <i>growth</i> of Medicare
and Medicaid, not the actual programs.  Yet this fact has been
deafened by shear political demagoguery.  The plan would hold
the growth of Medicaid to 5.2% and the growth of Medicare to 7.2%.
 The programs would still experience a major funding increase
between now and 2002.  Medicare outlays would increase from $158
billion to $244 billion.  The chart below illustrates the growth
differences between the Republican plan and the status quo. (CBO
estimates)<HR>

<P>
If left untouched, payroll taxes would have to be hiked to 4.23%
(from 2.9%) in order to preserve Medicare over the next 25 years.
 Cuts in the growth of these two entitlement programs are necessary
if we intend to restore America's fiscal security.  Politics should
not get in the way of reforming these programs.
<P>
<B>MESSAGE TO CONGRESS: Medicare and Medicaid Spending are out
of Control - Americans Know the Difference between a Real Cut
and a Cut in the Growth - Keep Cutting!</B>

<B>Economic Growth Through Tax Cuts and a Balanced Budget are
Truly at Stake</B></center>
<P><hr>
As President Clinton and Republican congressional leaders reconcile
their budget differences, it is important to reiterate your support
to your Senators and U.S. Representatives for a seven-year balanced
budget using Congressional Budget Office (CBO) numbers.  While
the president signed an agreement saying he supports a seven-year
balanced plan, already he is backing down from his word.
<P>
<B>ISSUE #1 - A Balanced Budget</B>
<P>
A balanced budget with tax cuts means we will keep more of what
we earn and spend it the way we see fit, rather than government
bureaucrats and politicians.  Will  a balanced budget translate
to a stronger U.S. economy where everyone wins?  Numerous economic
studies say yes.
<UL>
<LI>According to the Joint Economic Committee, a balanced budget
will lead to the creation of 6.1 million more jobs in 10 years,
and will boost real per-capita income 16.1%.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>A balanced budget means lower interest rates on home mortgages,
car loans, and student loans.  This, coupled with the tax credit,
could mean a &quot;balanced-budget bonus&quot; of up to $2800
a year for a family of four.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>According to a Heritage Foundation simulation, moving to a
balanced budget between 1996 and 2002 will result in the additional
construction of 104,000 homes and additional sales of 600,000
automobiles over the next seven years. <B>The simulation showed
an additional $32.1 billion in real disposable income through
2002.</B>
</UL>

<P>

<P>
It is obvious that a balanced budget within the next seven years
will have tremendous economic benefits for our economy and American
families.  But it is important that the president stick to the
seven-year agreement and use what he said were the most truthful
figures - CBO numbers.
<P>
MESSAGE TO CONGRESS: Pass a 7 Year Balanced Budget Using CBO Numbers
<P>

<P>
<B>ISSUE #2 - Capital Gains Tax Cuts</B>
<P>
Despite class warfare rhetoric from congressional Democrats and
President Clinton, capital gains tax cuts will benefit all Americans,
not just the rich.  According to SBSC Chief Economist Ray Keating,
the Republican proposal for a 50% exclusion on capital gains income
is the most &quot;pro-growth&quot; step Congress can take this
year.  Firms will pay a top rate of 28%.
<UL>
<LI>A recent study by DRI/McGraw-Hill found that a top capital
gains tax rate of 25% coupled with indexation of cap-gains taxes
for inflation and retroactivity of the cuts to Jan. 1, 1995 would
reduce the cost of capital by 12% and increase the GDP by 1.7%
from 1996-2005.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>According to the Joint Economic Committee, 83.7% of the returns
claiming capital gains came from families with incomes less than
$100,000.  The remaining 16.3% of claims were from families with
incomes over $100,000.  The largest segment of the population
claiming cap-gains (56.9%) have incomes below $50,000 -- the so-called
&quot;rich.&quot;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>According to Economist and SBSC Board Member Richard Rahn,
&quot;The capital gains tax is a direct levy on investment and
entrepreneurship...the lifeblood of a vibrant economy...the current,
non-indexed federal tax rate of 28 percent on cap-gains remains
a formidable obstacle to economic expansion...and small business
growth.&quot;
</UL>

<P>

<P>
President Clinton says he wants a capital gains  tax cut as long
as &quot;it creates jobs and promotes economic growth.&quot; 
The Republican proposal meets that criteria.
<P>
Please make your voice heard and support capital gains tax reduction.
<P>
MESSAGE TO CONGRESS: A Broad-Based Cut in Capital Gains Taxes Benefits All Americans, Not Just the So-Called &quot;Rich.&quot;

<i>November 1995</i>
<P>
<B>The Reconciliation Bill -- What Does it Mean for Small Business
Owners?</B></center>
<P><hr>
<P>
The House and Senate are finishing work on an enormous budget
package which includes many provisions helpful to small business
owners.  Though the budget plan doest not reduce spending and
taxes as much as SBSC had hoped, we believe the plan is a significant
and necessary step toward fiscal security.  This seven-year balanced
budget proposal faces an imminent veto upon reaching the President's
desk.  Despite strong support for the package within both chambers
of Congress, many lawmakers are feeling the heat from the special
interests.  <B>We encourage all interested small business owners
to contact their elected officials, including President Clinton,
and voice their support for a seven-year balanced budget.</B>
 Some of the pro-small business elements of the package are outlined
below.  Your representative or Senator may be reached at 202-225-3121.
<P>
<B>Capital Gains Tax Cuts -</B> The budget bill would cut taxes
on capital gains (profits from the sale of stock, property or
other assets) $35.7 billion.
<P>
The proposed maximum capital gains tax rate is 19.8% for individuals
and 28% for corporations.  The proposal would make these cuts
retroactive to January 1, 1995.
<P>
The indexation of capital gains to inflation will take effect
in 2001.  Both individuals and corporations would have reduced
capital gains tax rates for investment in qualified small business
stock.
<P>
SBSC feels these measures are a step in the right direction as
we fight for elimination of the highly regressive tax on capital
gains.
<P>
<B>Expensing</B> - The expensing amount would be raised for small
businesses.  The amount, currently $17,500, would be increased
gradually to $25,000 by 2002.
<P>
<B>Medical Savings Accounts</B> - Medical savings accounts (MSAs)
are included in the congressional plan.  Under the plan, individuals
would be allowed to make tax-deductible contributions to an MSA.
 Earnings would be tax free and distributions would also be tax-free.
 Maximum tax-favored contributions for individuals would be $2000,
for families the maximum would be $4000.
<P>
<B>Family Tax Relief</B> - The plan grants a $500 tax credit for
children under age 18 ($125 in 1995) for families earning less
than $110,000, reduces the marriage penalty, and allows for breaks
for those who adopt children or provide custodial care for the
elderly.
<P>
<B>Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)</B> - The plan would
expand eligibility for traditional deductible IRAs, while also
creating a new IRA in which contributions would be taxable but
earnings would be tax-free.  Also, the plan allows for penalty-free
withdrawals from deductible IRAs.
<P>
<B>Estate and Gift Taxes</B> - An estate tax relief proposal was
included in the package.  The unified credit would be phased up
to $750,000 and a portion of small business assets would be excluded
from the estate tax.
<P>
<B>Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction</B> - The bill would
raise the health insurance deduction of America's self-employed
to 50% by 2002.
<P>
While not perfect, the congressional package of tax cuts and debt
reduction is a fine way to approach fiscal security for America's
future generations.  The Small Business Survival Committee encourages
its members to congratulate Congress on a job well done and to
urge their representatives to stand by the proposal's tax-cutting,
spending reduction measures.

<h3>SETTING THE EAGLE FREE</h3><br>
<HR>

<P>
<B>INTRODUCTION</B>
</center><p><blockquote><blockquote>
<I>&quot;In short, it is a paradoxical truth
that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low,
and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is
to cut the rates now...The purpose of cutting taxes now is not
to incur a budget deficit, but to achieve the more prosperous,
expanding economy which can bring a budget surplus.&quot;</I>
<P>
John F. Kennedy<BR>
Economic Club of New York<BR>
December 14, 1962</blockquote>
<P>
These words of President Kennedy were a great inspiration to me as the tax reform movement was 
launched in the early 1980s with the Kemp/Roth tax cut.  Kennedy's vision and
courage can serve as examples for all Americans as we struggle
to make this nation better for our children and grandchildren.
 His remarks from the Economic Club of New York ring as true today
as they did in 1962. 
<p>
 At the first meeting of our commission back in June, I held up a blank sheet of paper and said, &quot;This
is what we start with.&quot;  That was our charge: Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich appointed the
National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform to study
the current tax code, listen to the suggestions and ideas of people
from around the country, and submit to Congress our recommendations
for comprehensive reform.  
<P>
A very diverse and dedicated group of 14 people, with the help of an invaluable, overworked, and
underpaid staff, set out to design an entirely new tax system
for America's 21st century; one which would promise a booming
economy, promote job creation, and ensure the greatest possible
opportunity for all Americans to work, save, invest, and reach
their potential.  We operated under the premise that an economic
growth rate of 2.5% is unacceptable to the American people.
<p>
This commission was empowered not merely to offer superficial reforms,
to trim a rate here and close a loophole there, but to begin with
a <I>tabula rasa</I> and map out a totally new tax structure for
America's next century.  We also wanted to help inform the whole
world, particularly the emerging democracies, that the goal of
tax policy is raising revenue, not redistribution of wealth. 
<p>
Our nation has arrived at a unique moment in history.  With the
passing of the Cold War, we are standing at the edge of a new
millennium with extraordinary possibilities.  Our country is poised
to help lead the world into a new era of economic growth fueled
by an information-age technological revolution that can yield
unparalleled expansion in jobs, productivity, innovation, and
prosperity.  We must embrace this opportunity and challenge. 
However, such an embrace will prove difficult, perhaps impossible,
if we remain saddled with our current tax code.  The current system
is indefensible: it is riddled with special interest tax breaks,
and it overtaxes both labor and capital.  We must construct a
tax system that reflects our highest values and unleashes our
greatest potential.
<p>
  The comments and concerns we heard from the
American people over the last several months, coupled with a systematic
review of the current tax code, helped us establish certain principles
to guide us to our conclusions.  Surely, a tax code which is simple
and fair must generate sufficient revenue so that the federal
government may carry out its legitimate tasks.  Second, it must
not place a tax burden on those members of society least able
to bear one.  And, perhaps most important of all, it must not
restrict the innovative and entrepreneurial capacities of Americans
upon which rising living standards and our general prosperity
so greatly depend.  Our proposals are in keeping with these principles.
<p>
Wildly excessive and unjust taxes have locked away access to capital
and credit necessary for lower-income Americans to launch the
next generation of entrepreneurship.  Today, sadly, we see the
American people's sense of dynamism and hope, their ability to
strive and compete diminished by a tax code which penalizes success,
retards investment, and sends capital fleeing overseas.  The commission
is united in the belief that only a pro-growth tax code can restore
America's confidence at home and her greatness abroad.  We want
a tax code and an overall economy that will liberate the American
dream and remove the barriers to upward social and economic mobility.
 The American ethos of entrepreneurship and optimism made America
great once before.  We believe these proposals will bolster that
ethos again and help restore integrity and honesty to our system.
<p>
The author John Gardner has observed that there are many contributing
factors to the rise of civilization - accidents of resources,
geography, and military power.  But whatever other ingredients
comprise the greatness of nations, he writes, &quot;There occurs
at breathtaking moments in history an exhilarating burst of energy
and motivation, of hope and zest and imagination, and a severing
of the bonds that normally hold in check the full release of human
possibilities.  A door is opened, and the caged eagle soars.&quot;
 That eagle, the symbol of our nation, represents the creative
spirit, talents, and aspirations of the American people.  The
charge of this commission and the intent of our recommendations
is to open the door and help set that eagle in all of us free.

<p>Ive admired over the years the fine work that the Foundation has done, in terms of its college campus work... its support of student activities, these national conferences during the summer, and the many other things that they do to bring conservatives to campuses, providing an opportunity to balance the debate.  On most of our campuses you dont always have the opportunity to have conservative speakers as readily as people representing other points of view.  What the Foundation does to balance that out, even it up, is certainly a very important thing.</p>

<h2>Regional Confrence Galvanizes Activists</h2>
<h4>Over 400 Eager Students Hear North, Evans, Robinson</h4>

<img alt="Students.gif" src="students.gif">
<hr><i>Egar Texas students turn out in force for Young America's Foundation regional confrence in Dallas.  Over 400 students came to hear from <b>Ollie North, Michael Williams, Stan Evans, Ron Robinson, Senator Steve Symms, Floyd Brown</b> and others during the two-day event.</i>
<hr>

Taking its campus road trip to the heart of Texas, <b>Young America's Foundation</b> headed to Dallas for a conference with over 400 college students in attendance on February 17 and 18.<p>

<b>Colonel Oliver North</b> kicked off the event Friday night with a rousing speech to students about the future of the conservative movement. He said that while conservatives had a great victory in Novernber, they need to stay true to their principles and keep their word to the American people. He called the Contract with America "something unique in American political experience." This is the first time government has established a "set of parameters" on which to govern and by which individuslc will be judged. Colonel North encouraged his primarily student audience to get involved in public policy
and make a difference.<p>

<img alt="Ollie North" src="north.gif"><br>
<hr>
<i><b>Ollie North</b> joins students during the cofrence, urging them to be active on their campuses and to make a difference.</i><hr>

Saturday began with a lecture by former <b>Senator Steve Symms</b>, president of Freedom Alliance, on the ability of young people to have a voice in policy making. He cited his career in politics which began at
age 34, when as a virtual unknown in the political world, he ran for and won a seat in the United States
House of Representatives.<p>

<b>Michael Williams</b>, assistant secretary for civil rights for the Department of Education during the Bush Administration, followed with a lively discussion on political correctness and racial issues on campuses. He encouraged students to seek support in the black student community. He said, "You will put out your hand and they will slap it; that will happen again and again. But if you persist, you will reach them."<p>

Foundation President <b>Ron Robinson</b> and Director of Program Development <b>Kate Obenshain Griffin</b> talked to students about the urgency and opportunities of campus activism, saying now that conservatives have taken over Congress, liberals are turning their attention to the campuses and the next generation with renewed vigor. In order to challenge their leftist professors, Mr. Robinson urged students to take the initiative in educating themselves about conservative ideals by reading conservative journals and books. He told student activists to surround themselves with supportive people who would work with them in promoting conservatism on campus. And he encouraged students to "be enthusiastic about your ideas and convictions. Only then will you capture the interest and imagination of your fellow students whom you are trying to reach."<p>

Mr. Robinson warned students to remember as they seek to reach other students that a perfect audience is never assembled and that they need to reach out to a broad audience. And finally, citing the examples of <b>William Buckley</b> and <b>Rush Limbaugh</b>, Mr. Robinson told students, "Start your own organization if your conservative voice is not being heard through existing ones." Instead of working for the <i>New Yorker</i> magazine and the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, Mr. Buckley started up his own publication, <i>National Review</i>. Similarly, instead of working his way up with ABC and CBS news Limbaugh started his own radio show.<p>

Following an introduction by Foundation board member and Texas native <b>Wayne Thorburn</b>, <b>M. Stanton Evans</b> delivered the luncheon address, discussing his book, <b>The Theme Is Freedom</b>.

Conservative students from across the region have the chance to get together with one another and find out how students are coping with different situations. And we get to hear from more great conservative speakers in one day than most would hear from in four years at school."<p>

Each year, Young America's Foundation hosts regional student conferences in several states around the country.<p><p>

<title>"Intellectual Scandal" Uncovered By Evans</title>

<h2>"Intellectual Scandal" Uncovered By Evans</h2>
<h4>Salvatori Speaker Urges Understanding of Our Founding</h4>

Before a packed house of 400 college students from across the country, <b>M. Stanton Evans</b> urged students to remember the religious roots of our liberty as understood by America's Founding Fathers. The student event was sponsored by Young America's Foundation and the Fund for American Studies at  the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, D.C on February 18. Mr. Evans is the Henry  Salvatori Distinguished Lecturer for 1994-1995, and will be sponsored by Young America's Foundation to  speak before twelve college audiences during the current academic year.<p>

Refuting what he calls "the liberal history lesson, " Mr. Evans said his latest book, <b>The Theme is Freedom</b>, deals with the origins of freedom in the United States and the role faith and religion played in establishing that freedom.<p>

<img alt="Mr. Evans" src="evans1.gif"><hr>
<i>Mr. Evans signs his book, <b>The Theme is Freedom</b>, for students following his speech.</i>
<hr>

Specifically, he dealt with three interrelated issues: first, where our freedom comes from; second, why we have freedom in America; and finally, how we sustain freedom.<p>

The issue of the role of faith in our founding has implications for modern political dilemmas such as prayer in school, abortion, and the so-called Religious Right.<p>

Liberals argue that faith and freedom are in conflict and that if we want freedom, we must keep religion out  of the public sphere. That line of reasoning, Mr. Evans said, is the premise for recent court decisions  banning prayer in school and forbidding any form of religious observance from public settings.<p>

According to Mr. Evans, such rulings, as well as the theory that faith and freedom are at odds, "are products of the way we are taught political and intellectual history-that is, through what I call the liberal 
history lesson."<p>

The liberal history lesson posits that freedom, philosophy, drama and other worthy practices existed in the ancient world, prior to Christianity. Mr. Evans said we are taught that in the early 5th century, the fall of classical antiquity "was followed by 1000 years of nothingness.... The Christian church ruled in an era of oppression and dictatorship."<p>

During the Renaissance, the liberals teach, classical antiquity was rediscovered, the institution of the 
church was rejected and there emerged what became the modern era's secular, rational basis for democracy,  freedom and the nation-state. Our Constitution, and the resulting rationalistic free system, is a product of the Enlightenment, according to the Left.<p>

"This is the framework," said Mr. Evans, "in which most of us, for decades, have learned our intellectual history." American history is being taught, for the most part, as a "subset" of the larger world history lesson.<p>

That lesson, according to Mr. Evans, is a "complete misstatement of the facts and of the record. It is an effort to impose secular liberal concepts on our system."<p>

There is no validity to the argument that faith and freedom are in conflict, and in reality, "They must go together, both conceptually and as a matter of history."<p>

Conceptually, Mr. Evans said, liberals argue that relativism, or the belief that there are no absolute standards, is necessary for a tolerant and just society-that a society can only be free when judgment is suspended. If that were the case, according to Mr. Evans, and there were no moral absolutes, no right or wrong, then a society could not pass judgment on Adolph Hitler. "How does one condemn any atrocity?" he asked. "All totalitarian regimes were relativist."<p>

<img alt="Mr. Evans" src="evans.gif"><hr>
<i>As part of the Henry Salvatori Distinguished Lecture Series, <b>M. Stanton Evans</b> speaks during a student luncheon, hosted by Young America's Foundation, at the Conservative Political Action Confrence.  Mr. Evans said the modern interpretation that prayer has no place in the public sphere is a travesty.  "it is an intellectual scandal and it's unconstitutional."</i><hr>

Faith and freedom must go together according to historical fact as well. In the Declaration of Independence, for instance, Thomas Jefferson wrote that it is  "self evident" that human beings are created equal. But Mr. Evans said, "If it was so evident to Jefferson, and to us, why wasn't it self evident to Aristotle, arguably the smartest man who ever lived? " Aristotle believed that some are born to be slaves and that all citizens belong to the state.<p>

According to Mr. Evans, the notion of limits on governmental power that stems from the Bible did not exist in Aristotle's time. Our Founding Fathers derived the notion that people should seek freedom rather than the bondage of a king from the Book of Samuel.<p>

Mr. Evans notes that both the Magna Carta and the Mayflower Compact are religious documents which were fundamental in the formation of our free form of government. Revisionists often say that the pilgrims who wrote the Mayflower Compact in 1620 found their inspiration for the document in John Lockerather than the Bible. Locke, however, was not born until 1632. The document is based purely on covenental theology, and subsequently, had a major impact on all of our governmental institutions with which we are familiar today.<p>

The First Amendment, Mr. Evans said, has suffered most grossly the inaccuracies of liberal revisionism. Modern history lessons, and in turn, the Supreme Court, now declare that the First Amendment was intended "to banish relizion from the public order."

According to Mr. Evans, that notion is "Orwellian and a complete inversion and falsification of our history."<p>

At the time the First Amendment was written, states established churches and even imposed religious requirements for holding pub- | lic office. We are told that Congress adopted the First Amendment in order to prohibit tax-supported prayer. Yet on September 25, 1789, one day after Congress passed the First Amendment, it passed a resolution calling on the president to declare a day of prayer and thanksgiving, which President Washington did.<p>

The modern interpretation of the Constitution, which states that prayer has no place in the public sphere, is a "travesty," according to Mr. Evans. "It is an intellectual scandal and it's unconstitutional."<p>

Mr. Evans said it is up to conservatives to recover the true history of our nation. While liberals have embraced revisionist history, conservatives must "get the basics right about the principles from which our freedoms developed."<p>

As part of the Henry Salvatori Distinguished Lecture Series, Mr. Evans' campus appearances have included, among others, <b>Canisius College</b> in New York on February 23, <b>Regent College</b> in Virginia on March 23, <b>Fordham University</b> in New York on April 5, and <b>Princeton University</b> on April 18.<p><p>

<img src="cartoon.gif"><hr>
<i>In February, Young America's Foundation President <b>Ron Robinson</b> called on Rutgers University President <b>Francis Lawrence</b> to resign.  After enacting a speech code which threatened students with expulsion or suspension if they made a statement likely "to cause annoymance ... even if communicative in nature," Mr. Lawrence violated it.  Students were outraged when he stated that minorities don't "have the genetic, hereditary background to have a higher [SAT] average."  While Young America's Foundation is unalterably opposed to speech codes designed to restrict the free flow of ideas, Mr. Robinson said that college administrators who impose these regulations should abide by them.</i><hr>

<title>Campus Crisis</title>
</head>

<body background="/yaf/ground2.gif">

<h2>Campus Crisis</h2>

<h4>Deceiving Donors</h4>

Having misled alumnus <b>Lee M. Bass</b> on its plans to develop a program on Western Civilization, Yale University has agreed to return Mr. Bass' $20 million gift to the school. While the program was scheduled to begin in the fall of 1993, it was not until the spring of 1995 that Yale informed Mr. Bass that they were prepared to go ahead with the program. In the intervening years, however, Yale had scrapped the original implementation plan for the Western Civ program and appointed a new advisory committee to develop a scheme more acceptable to leftist critics. This shift occurred unbeknownst to Mr. Bass, who had been assured by Yale President <b>Richard Levin</b> that he would be kept abreast of the program's development. A skeptical Mr. Bass, aware of Yale's move toward a more multicultural approach to teaching history, asked to approve the professors scheduled to teach the course. Yale refused and has agreed to return the gift. Student <b>Pat Collins</b> said, "I'm disappointed that the university wasn't able to conduct itself in a  trustworthy way to allay the concerns of the donor."<p>

<h4>PC Strikes Again</h4>

Ironically, one week before the Supreme Court was set to hear the case of <i>Wide Awake</i>, a University of Virginia publication denied funding due to its Christian perspective, UVa struck again. This time the Student Council defunded the conservative student magazine, the <i>Virginia Advocate</i>. According to Student Council, the <i>Advocate</i> represented a "political activity." Student Council appropriates funds to leftist political organizations such as the National Organization for Women, Gay and Straight for Equality, and the Lesbian, Bisexual and Gay Student Union. UVa also funds decidedly liberal student newspapers such as the <i>University Journal</i> the <i>Declaration and Pride</i>. Student editors of the Virginia Advocate are appealing the decision to defund the paper and plan to take their case to court if necessary.<p>

<h4>Objections Raised To Communist Chair</h4>

<b>Angela Davis</b>, tenured professor of the history of consciousness at the University of California at Santa Cruz, has been named to the prestigious Presidential Chair by Jack W. Peltason, president of the university system. Her appointment has raised objections by California state senators who are concerned about Ms. Davis' "reputation for racism, violence and Communism."  As chair, Ms. Davis will have an additional $30,000 a year at her disposal, which she plans to use to develop an ethnic studies program.<p>

<h4>Strange Course Requirements</h4>

At Virginia's Tidewater Community College students taking a course in human sexuality have the option of reading five books other than their textbook or they may undertake one of the following: watch an X-rated movie, visit an adult bookstore, go to a gay bar, visit a family-planning center or an STD clinic, or speak to a member of the clergy concerning the church's philosophy regarding sexuality issues.  When a student objected to the activities the course was encouraging, the state's associate director of the State Council for Higher Education said the course sounded "perfectly legitimate" and said, "I can't imagine any student has the right to complain."<p><p>

<title>Conservative Black Speakers Hit the Campus</title>
</head>

<body background="/yaf/ground2.gif">

<h2>Conservative Black Speakers Hit the Campus</h2>

<h4>Foundation Program Countering Black Racist Speakers on Campus</h4>

In response to the overwhelmingly leftist bent of Black History Month on campuses, Young America's 
Foundation initiated the Alternative Black Speakers Program. The program enables Young America's Foundation to send conservative black speakers to college campuses across the country, giving students an alternative to the often radical and irresponsible message of black lecturers appearing on campuses as part of official university programs.<p>

Young America's Foundation is offering the Alternative Black Speakers Program to students who are 
disappointed in the liberal, divisive message being promoted by their schools during Black History Month. Radicals such as <b>Joycelyn Elders</b>, former surgeon general under <b>President Clinton</b>, who recently stated that students should be taught about masturbation at an early age, and <b>Anita Hill</b> are frequent speakers on college campuses. Rap musician, <b>Ice T</b>, who sings about killing police, brought his message to Radford University in Virginia. During a lecture at West Chester University in Pennsylvania, <b>Khalid Muhammad</b> told students, "Now is the time to stand up and fight back.... There are no good crackers [white people], and if you find one, kill him before he changes. " At the University of Pennsylvania, <b>Louis Farrakhan</b> accused Jews of -"using God as a shield for [their] dirty religion.<p>

<img alt="William Allen" src="allen.gif"><hr>
<i><b>William Allen</b> talks candidly with students at Young America's Foundation's 1994 Summer Confrence.</i><hr>

<b>Stokely Carmichael</b> called for a complete revolution during a speech at the University of California at Irvine. He urged African Americans to overthrow the American capitalist society. Mr. Carmichael said, "No human advances are possible without the shedding of blood.... Student movements must have a strong wational base," he said. "They must be clear and precise. One must be willing to kill and die for it."<p>

The Foundation's experience with the Alternative Black Speakers Program has shown that there is great demand for conservative black speakers, and, while the project is entering its second year, that demand continues unabated. Young America's Foundation receives calls daily requesting information on this program.<p>

Young America's Foundation has sponsored twentyfour speeches by black conservative :-speakers. Speakers include <b>Walter Williams</b>, an economics professor at George Mason University, who speaks on free market issues; <b>Star Parker</b>, a former welfare recipient who broke free of dependency and became highly successful in business; and <b>Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas</b>, who will speak at two schools in the fall.<p>

<img alt="Star Parker" src="parker.gif"><hr>
<i><b>Star Parker</b> talks with a student at Florida State University following her remarks during Black History Month.</i><hr>

Young America's Foundation's Alternative Black Speakers Program has provided thousands of students with an opportunity to hear conservative speakers during Black History Month and throughout the year. Star Parker's appearance at Swarthmore College in December was highly successful. and
students were able to obtain cosponsorship with the "Women of Color" organization on their campus. During the speech, Ms. Parker said, "Capitalism is opportunity, it gives people vision, structure,
absolutes and order.... The American dream does not involve socialism, it involves capitalism." She 
explored the pitfalls and disincentives of the welfare state, saying, "Where else can you go that you get 
$500 a month for getting pregnant? "<p>

Florida State University conservative student activists also hosted Ms. Parker during Black History
Month. Young America's Foundation activist and FSU student, <b>Stephen Slivinski</b> said, "Star Parker was bright and articulate -- a glittering personality. She spoke with the conviction and compassion that liberals claim conservatives don't have. The audience was diverse in ideology as well as race-something that would make the affirmative action proponents proud, save for the fact that the audience showed up to be enlightened and challenged, not by dint of some governmental program."<p>

Walter Williams spoke to 650  students at Texas A&~~M University during the College Republican "Rush Week." He addressed the role of government in a free society, saying, "Expanding government is not the answer; the free market should determine where the dollars go." His address was featured an the front page of the school newspaper.<p>

Over 350 students turned out at the University of Arkansas to hear Dr. Williams, who said that the nation is headed toward more totalitarianism and governmental control. Our problems as a nation, according to Dr. Williams, are caused by "a significant departure from the principles of individual freedom that made us a rich nation to begin with Dr. Williams said that this diagnosis could carry us part of the way toward solving our national problems. "One good thing about Americans is that they never do the wrong thing for a long time." He said he is expecting the American people to change their present economic course.
At what students called the best attended lecture in years, over 400 students at Penn State University heard Dr. Williams speak. He has also spoken at Iowa State University and the University of 
Wisconsin - Milwaukee.<p>

Through the Alternative Black Speakers Program, Young America's Foundation has identified dynamic black speakers who are eager to bring a conservative message to the campuses for years to come. While 
colleges and universities instinctively bring liberal speakers to their school, Young America's Foundation is 
working daily with students to offer an alternative, conservative message from black speakers.<p><p>

<h2>Don't Brake for Big Government</h2>
<b>by Tyce Palmaffy</b>
</center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
        <font size="+1">I</font>n 1974, in the wake of the OPEC oil embargo, the federal government imposed the 55 mile-per-hour "National Maximum Speed Limit" (NMSL) on American motorists to conserve gas. But long after the fuel crisis had abated, the federal speed limit remained, backed by advocates who touted its supposed safety benefits. Even as these benefits were soon cast into doubt and drivers' compliance with the law began to erode, its supporters continued to lobby for the federal maximum. And for more than 20 years, Congress followed their lead. The Democratic leadership of the Congress blocked all efforts to overturn the national speed limit.
<p>
<table>
<tr width=80>
<td><hr width=75><h3><font size="+3">C</font>ongress has finally repealed a law that defied popular will and common sense - the federal speed limit</h3><hr width=75></td>
<td hspace=5> 
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Then last year, with their robust commitment to limiting government, the newly elected House and Senate freshmen pushed for a repeal of the federal speed limit. In the fall of 1995, despite the resistance of old-guard Republicans Bud Shuster and John Chafee, chairmen of the key committees in the House and Senate, legislation repealing the national speed limit passed both chambers by chasmic margins -- 419-7 in the House, by voice vote in the Senate. On November 28, 1995, President Clinton reluctantly signed the legislation. The endurance of this anachronism is but one sign of Washington's bureaucratic paternalism; its demise, however, may augur a new era of limits on federal authority. </td></tr></table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The federal maximum was not, technically, mandatory. It was enforced through the power of the purse -- federal highway funds were withheld from states refusing to post the new limit. Naturally, every state capitulated. Building on legislation in 1987 and 1991 that allowed states to raise the limit to 65 m.p.h. on rural interstates and freeways designed for high speeds, the repeal removes the threat of reduced funding, freeing all states to set their own speed limits.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Since the repeal, more than 20 states have raised their limits, including seven within a week of the effective date of the repeal. Four of those states -- Oklahoma, Wyoming, Nevada, and Arizona -- posted a top speed of 75 m.p.h., while Montana eliminated its daytime speed limit for passenger vehicles, reverting to its pre-1974 law requiring drivers to maintain a "reasonable and prudent speed." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Once liberated, state legislatures ushered in these increases by lopsided margins. Missouri's House and Senate, for example, voted by 122-34 and 28-2, respectively, to raise the maximum limit to 70 m.p.h. Idaho's lower and upper chambers voted to increase limits by 56-12 and 28-7, respectively. Higher speed limits were voted down in Ohio, Connecticut, Kentucky, Virginia, and Louisiana. That's the beauty of a federal system. States can now set their own speed limits after assessing local conditions; some will increase their limits and some will not.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The swift actions of these legislators were bolstered by the support of motorist advocates. "We believe that the states will do as good a job, or even a better job, at setting and enforcing the limits," says Bill Jackman, a spokesman for the <a href="http://www.aaa.com">American Automobile Association</a>. "In many states the federal limits were really disdained. . . . All of the state departments of transportation are responsible institutions with respectable people working in them. We trust them to do their jobs well." With 39 million members nationwide, AAA represents the interests of almost a quarter of all licensed drivers.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	State traffic engineers and highway patrolmen, whose reputations depend on drivers' safety, added their applause. "Putting the decision up to the individual states was a good idea," says Ken Howes of the Florida Highway Patrol. "Our Florida Department of Transportation has done excellent research on what speeds are appropriate. We are very comfortable in Florida if a speed is raised, because we know it is not done haphazardly." Adds P.D. Kiser, the chief traffic engineer at the Nevada Department of Transportation: "The repeal was way overdue; the 55 m.p.h. speed limit was an experiment that failed miserably."<p><b>Easy Riding</b>	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Patrolmen and engineers supported the repeal because it permits states to set more reasonable and safe speed limits. According to traffic engineers, the proper method of determining speed limits is to measure the speed of traffic under ideal conditions. The limit should be posted at the speed at or below which 85 percent of traffic is traveling. In effect, <i>drivers</i> set the speed limit. What engineers call "the 85th percentile speed" --  the proper speed limit -- is the safest speed to travel. "People who drive at the 85th percentile speed are least likely to be in motor vehicle crashes," explains engineer Tom Hicks, of the Maryland State Highway Administration. "It's the people who drive much slower or faster who are most at risk."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Unreasonably low speed limits exacerbate the risk posed by these slower and faster drivers. Says Alan Soltani, the chief traffic engineer at the Oklahoma DOT, "When the 85th percentile speed was at 75 and the speed limit was set at 55, drivers weren't comfortable-some drove at 55, some at 65, some at 75. There was so much variance that accidents increased." When the limit is raised to its proper level, the evidence shows, these dangerous variances in speed start to disappear. Hicks reports that ever since Maryland increased the limit on some roads to 65 m.p.h., "We're seeing more tightening of speeds; the slower drivers are catching up while the faster drivers are slowing down."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	On many highways, the federally mandated 55 and 65 m.p.h. speed limits were unreasonably low -- often 5 or 10, and sometimes 15 m.p.h. below the 85th percentile speed. In Minnesota, engineers report, the 85th percentile speeds were 73 m.p.h. on rural interstates and 69 m.p.h. on urban interstates. In <a href="http://www.mt.gov/">Montana</a>, the 85th percentile speed was 72 m.p.h. In Oklahoma, it was 75. Drivers in essence voted for repeal with their feet -- by pressing down on the accelerator.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Such rampant disregard for the law made the situation even <i>more</i> dangerous. Says Maryland's Hicks, "There are many traffic engineers, myself included, who think that the 55 m.p.h. speed limit caused a degradation of respect for traffic laws and contributed to what we call aggressive driving. For the last five years, everybody has been going 15 to 20 m.p.h. over the speed limit, including the police. It's terribly harmful to have a law and not enforce it."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Efforts to enforce unreasonably low speed limits also unduly influence the effectiveness of police. In 1978, Congress started requiring the states to certify drivers' compliance with the 55 m.p.h. limit or face cuts in their federal highway funds. So highway patrolmen were told to enforce a law that the majority of motorists were breaking and that threatened rather than improved safety. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Indeed, in a 1984 study of the effects of the 55 m.p.h. speed limit, the National Research Council found that 29 percent of highway patrol hours were devoted to rural interstates, where only 9 percent of traffic fatalities occurred. This means more dangerous roads -- undivided country highways, high-speed two-lane roads, and highways running through congested commercial areas -- received less attention. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Charles Lave, an economist at the University of California at Irvine specializing in traffic issues, says that researchers must take into account these changes in police and driver behavior by studying overall fatality rates instead of just rates on the interstates. In his 1992 study, "Did the 65 m.p.h. Speed Limit Save Lives?" he found that the stepped-up enforcement of the 55 m.p.h. speed limit did reduce fatalities on interstates after the national limit was enacted. But, he says, the reduction was illusory. To avoid the extra policing of the interstates, drivers switched to the scenic but more dangerous country roads, thus decreasing both traffic and fatalities on interstates.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	So by requiring states to prove they were enforcing the 55 m.p.h. speed limit, the federal legislation effectively reduced patrol presence on non-interstates while increasing the traffic on these roadways. This substantially endangered safety. Says Jackman of AAA, "People move off and onto interstates depending on the speed; if the speed limit is only 55 or 65, they will move onto a country road that will get them there just as fast. The problem there is that the fatality rate is three times higher when you get off the interstates. Interstates are the safest highways we have." Now that the federal limit has been repealed, states can post more realistic limits that will attract drivers to the safer interstates.<p><b>Straw Men</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The repeal of the federal mandate encourages better use of police resources, greater respect for the law, and safer roads. If one adds overwhelming support from motorists, the state legislatures, the highway patrol, and state departments of transportation, the case for repeal seems airtight. So why the opposition?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"Well, they're wrong," scoffs Judie Stone, the president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, an organization funded by insurance companies. "I am not an engineer, but it is just common sense. . . . It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that if you raise speed limits, speeds go up." Higher speeds, Stone contends, mean greater chances of crashing.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"Changes like these that increase the severity of injuries mean higher health-care costs, more expensive insurance claims, and higher premiums for everyone," adds Richard Retting, the senior transportation engineer at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	These arguments held sway in Congress for 20 years. Safety advocates also often point to statistics that indicate fatalities rose 30 percent in 1987 on roads where the speed limit was increased to 65 m.p.h. This proves, they say, that raising the speed limit costs lives. But Lave's study concluded otherwise. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	By concentrating solely on the number of interstate fatalities, Lave says, opponents of repeal fail to account for the safety benefits of setting more reasonable speed limits: police allocate their resources more efficiently and drivers switch to the less dangerous interstates. These benefits can only be accounted for by studying overall fatality rates. Lave calculated that from 1986-88, overall statewide fatality rates actually <i>fell</i> by 3.4 to 5.1 percent in the 40 states that adopted the new 65 m.p.h. maximum.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Moreover, engineering studies by Samuel Tignor, Davey Warren, and Martin Parker for the Federal Highway Administration show that average speeds increase negligibly when highway speed limits are raised. Indeed, Tignor and Warren write, "Raising the speed limit by various amounts up to 15 m.p.h. has little or no effect on speeds over a broad range of road types and speed levels."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This would seem to indicate, as traffic engineers like to say, that motorists tend to ignore posted limits, instead picking a speed at which they feel comfortable. But advocates like Retting and Stone see it differently. "If you let drivers set a speed that is reasonable and prudent, as Montana has," Retting says, "they can't do it." Adds Stone, "Yes, it's true that people were exceeding 55 before, but at least they were staying below 65. Now, with states raising limits to 70 and 75 m.p.h., the percentage of drivers exceeding 70 is going up, average speeds are going up. In Kansas and Missouri, fatalities have gone up."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	True, April 1996 traffic fatalities in Kansas and Missouri <i>did</i> increase 20 and 28 percent, respectively, from the same period last year. But in Missouri, fatalities in May <i>dropped</i> by one from last year. And in Kansas, fatalities rose from 25 in April 1995 (before repeal) to 30 in April 1996 -- but in April 1994, Kansas highways claimed 37 lives under the former speed limit. Since the repeal of the federal limit, troopers and engineers in California, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Texas report that average speeds have not increased significantly -- 1 to 2 m.p.h. in most states -- and fatalities have actually decreased in some states. Says Kiser of the Nevada DOT: "I think the only thing that really changed out there was the numbers on the signs."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	To drivers, though, the changes are far more significant. Under the old federal limits, drivers seldom knew how far over the speed limit they could travel without receiving a ticket. Now, report many patrolmen, the limit is higher but enforcement is stricter. Says Howes of the Florida Highway Patrol, "70 is 70 is 70." Patrolmen can concentrate on ticketing the dangerous drivers -- those traveling over the highway's design speed -- and law-abiding citizens can relax and drive.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"[The police and I] are not adversarial anymore," says Raymond Kasicki, an independent truck owner-operator in Ohio. "Before you looked at them as someone who was out to get you. Now we're both looking for the same thing: people who are driving dangerously."<P><b>The Bureaucratic Disposition</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It is easy to dismiss the repeal of the federal speed limit as token legislation, more of a statement of principle than legislation that improves our standard of living. The benefits, however, are palpable. In the Western states, motorists may drive hundreds of miles on flat roads with no other cars in sight. Why shouldn't they be allowed to pick a speed at which they feel comfortable? Why shouldn't the police be allowed to distribute their resources as they see fit? Why shouldn't state departments of transportation, working with the highway patrol, be allowed to set the speed limit according to local conditions? The repeal allows all of this to happen.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	More importantly, the repeal of the national speed limit may signal new attitudes in Washington. The law was a typical Washingtonian notion: a one-size-fits-all rule that usurped state responsibility. Restoring the states' authority on this issue means trusting them to form safe and responsible policies. Says Soltani of Oklahoma, "I strongly believe that there is no relationship between higher speed limits and higher fatalities. If I did not believe that, I would not have recommended [speed limit increases] to the legislature." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	And if we can trust the states in this area, why not others? The repeal recognizes two principles at the core of any argument for limiting the federal government: that federal legislation can be extremely inflexible, and that states will seek to protect their citizens. This renewed faith in local officials and doubts about the wisdom of federal solutions may be a bellwether of further devolution.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Using distressing stories of laid-off workers, decreasing paychecks, and increasing income inequality, some politicians and journalists have been painting a picture of economic gloom and doom in America. At the same time, the economy exhibits increasing employment, low inflation, and growth. Still, while the economy appears to be doing well, many Americans see themselves as struggling to make ends meet and feel they are worse off than their parents were a generation ago. This raises the obvious question: Are middle-income and low-income workers falling farther behind, or is the standard of living increasing for most Americans?
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What has really been happening to wages, profits, and incomes in recent decades?
<p><ul>
<li>There has been a decline in average real cash wages since 1973, but this does not mean a decrease in the American standard of living. In fact, most workers are better off today because their real compensation and real per capita income continue to increase. Moreover, a broad array of measures indicates that the standard of living for most Americans continues to rise.
<p>
<li>There is no evidence to support the popular argument that rising corporate profits have come at the expense of workers. Corporate profits and labor compensation generally rise and fall together. Whether corporate profits are falling or rising as a share of national income, the employees' share of a growing economy remains fairly constant.
<p>
<li>The slow growth in take-home pay is not the result of "corporate greed."  It is the result of a slowdown in the growth of productivity, caused in part by the growth of government taxes and regulations on business and investment. Higher taxes also are taking an ever-larger bite out of personal income, leaving a smaller and smaller share for individuals to spend, save, and invest.
<p>
<li>Although the income difference between high-wage and low-wage workers has increased, a majority of men and women have seen their real earnings increase. Studies suggest the increasing divergence in the earnings of high-wage and low-wage workers is due primarily to an acceleration in the rate of technological change favoring those with higher skills, changes in the composition of the workforce, and a substantial shift in demand for the products of different industries. Increased trade and the number of low-skilled immigrants, however, have had only a small effect on wage patterns.
<p>
<li>The dynamic U.S. economy is characterized by an extraordinary degree of income mobility which has been all but ignored in the controversy over wage differences. The notion that low-income or high-income groups are composed of the same people, stuck in the same jobs over time, is an illusion. Data on income mobility reveal that most workers' incomes increase over time. In America, the upward movement of workers in the lowest, second-lowest, and middle-income groups is much larger than the downward movement.
</ul> <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The conventional wisdom is that wages are falling, the middle class is moving down instead of up, and corporate profits are rising at the expense of workers. But like so many other examples of conventional wisdom, it is wrong. The truth is that most workers are better off today because their real earnings are increasing and their standard of living continues to rise. Both corporate profits and labor compensation are growing, and although the difference between high-wage and low-wage workers has increased, the U.S. economy remains dynamic and productive enough to enable most Americans to work their way up the economic ladder.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To the extent that real wages are falling for some workers, the solution is not higher taxes, more mandates and government programs, or job-killing increases in the minimum wage. Instead, what is needed are policies that focus on the primary problems: high taxes and excessive regulation. Removing these obstacles will increase productivity, job opportunities, and real wage growth for all Americans.
<p>

<b>HOW COMPENSATION INCREASES WHILE WAGE GROWTH STAGNATES</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There has been a decline in average real cash wages since 1973, but this does not mean a decrease in the American standard of living.<sup>1</sup>  In fact, most workers are better off today because their real compensation and real per capita income continue to increase.<sup>2</sup>  The reason for this is that workers are taking home more of their pay in the form of tax-free benefits than ever before.<sup>3</sup>  Hourly wages do not account for the increasing tendency of employees to receive their "pay" in the form of untaxed fringe benefits.<sup>4</sup>  Moreover, hourly wage data are limited as to the types of employees they cover, further understating actual wage growth.<sup>5</sup>  Real compensation thus is a more accurate measure of the "pay" American workers receive because it includes benefits, such as health care and pension payments, as well as cash.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As <a href="fyi97c1.gif">Chart 1</a> illustrates, total compensation has increased even when average wages have declined. From 1959 to 1973, real hourly compensation increased by an average of 2.8 percent per year.<sup>6</sup>  Between 1973 and 1994, real hourly compensation increased an average of 0.4 percent per year. The problem is not that the average cash wage has declined, but that total "pay" has grown more slowly since 1973. The reason: a slowdown in the growth of productivity caused in part by the proliferation of government regulations, mandates, and higher taxes, all of which reduce the net value of a worker's output, which leads in turn to a slowdown in compensation.<sup>7</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Most of the growth in real compensation since 1986 can be attributed to the fact that benefits have increased faster than cash wages (see <a href="fyi97c2.gif">Chart 2</a>). Although real wage growth as measured by the Employment Cost Index has stagnated since 1986, sharply rising benefits have increased total compensation by 1.9 percent.<sup>8</sup>  Between 1981 and 1995, real employee benefits have increased 26.8 percent as workers have continued to demand more of their total pay in the form of tax-free benefits, and the cost of providing those benefits has increased.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While real compensation for most Americans has increased, workers correctly believe that they should be better off today than they are. Tax increases in the 1990s deprived them of a higher standard of living by undercutting the economy's rate of growth, undercutting productivity gains, and holding back pay increases.<sup>9</sup>  If workers and businesses were not burdened with large tax and regulatory increases, total compensation and real take-home pay would be higher.
<p>
<b>HIGHER PROFITS BENEFIT WORKERS, FALLING PROFITS LIMIT COMPENSATION GROWTH</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is no evidence to support the popular assumption that rising corporate profits and the record high stock market have come at the expense of workers.<sup>10</sup>  <I>The Washington Post</I> was correct when it editorialized: "[Secretary of Labor Robert Reich] charges that the productivity improvements are going disproportionately to corporations. That's not the real explanation. While corporate profits, as a share of total economic output, are slightly higher than in the late 1980s, they remain lower than in the 1970s. The causes of the country's poor wage performance lie elsewhere."<sup>11</sup>  Those causes also do not include the trade deficit or immigration, both of which increased during the 1980s at the same time labor compensation increased significantly.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Whether corporate profits are falling or rising as a share of national income, labor's share of a growing economy remains fairly constant (see <a href="fyi97c3.gif">Chart 3</a>). The share of national income going to corporate profits declined in a seesaw fashion from 14.1 percent in 1965 to a post-World War II low of 6.0 percent in 1982. Workers' share of national income, however, rose from 68.1 percent in 1965 to 74.2 percent in 1970 and has remained relatively stable ever since.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Corporate profits and labor compensation generally rise and fall together (see <a href="fyi97c4.gif">Chart 4</a>). When corporate profits declined in 1974, labor compensation declined too. When corporate profits declined from 1979 to 1982, compensation failed to increase. Corporate profits resumed their increase in 1983, and labor compensation followed suit, increasing by 23.3 percent from 1982 to 1988. From 1988 to 1991, the growth of corporate profits declined and labor compensation stagnated; when corporate profits began to increase again in 1992, however, so did labor compensation.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Higher profits also benefit workers because they are shareholders. Sixty-four percent of all workers are employed by companies with pension plans, and 50 percent of all workers participate in those plans.<sup>12</sup>  Nineteen percent of all workers also have their own individual retirement accounts (IRAs).
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is no evidence to support the popular argument that rising corporate profits have come at the expense of workers. Corporate profits and labor compensation generally rise and fall together. Real labor compensation has risen $340 billion (in 1992 dollars) between 1991 and 1995, and corporate profits have increased $152 billion over the same period. Moreover, the fixed-pie assertion that a higher level of after-tax profits means less income available for labor compensation or tax revenue for the government is simply wrong. The problem is that the share of national income taken by all levels of government has increased from 32 percent in 1965 to 39 percent in 1994.<sup>13</sup>  This leaves a steadily smaller share for private citizens to spend, save, and invest.
<p>
	
<b>WAGE AND INCOME DIFFERENCES HAVE INCREASED</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Wage growth and wage differences are two distinct concepts,<sup>14</sup> but they interact to shape a worker's sense of well-being. If all real wages increase, everyone is better off, even if there is a widening difference in earnings. On the other hand, if average real wages stagnate while wage differences are growing, low-wage workers as a group may become poorer as the rich grow richer.<sup>15</sup>  In the case of the United States, the former pattern holds true: The standard of living for most Americans actually continues to rise, even though both wage and income differences have widened.<sup>16</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
  Studies suggest that there are several reasons for widening wage differences. The accelerated rate of technological change, for example, favors those with higher skills. Also, changes in the composition of the workforce -- including a slowdown in the relative growth rate of college graduates and the increasing labor force attachment of women -- lead to a divergence of incomes. And there has been a substantial shift in demand for the products of different industries (such as lower paying services replacing higher paying manufacturing).<sup>17</sup>  The increase in low-skilled immigrants (both legal and otherwise) and trade, however, had only a small effect on wage patterns in the 1980s.<sup>18</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since 1973, income differences among families also have grown because of the sharp rise in the proportion of Americans who live in families with no male workers, growing differences in earnings among men, and the increasing likelihood that in a traditional family both husband and wife will be working.<sup>19</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The size of a family makes a difference. Census Bureau income data collected according to the presence of children show that while families with no children experienced a 36 percent increase in real median income over the past 25 years, families with one or two children did considerably less than half that well. The real median income of families with more than three children declined over the same period.<sup>20</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although the difference between high-wage and low-wage workers has increased, a majority of men saw their real earnings rise 5 percent or more from 1979 to 1989, and a large majority of women (76 percent) saw their earnings increase.21  Moreover, a broad array of measures indicates that the standard of living for most Americans continues to rise. To the extent that real wages are falling for some workers, the solution is not higher taxes, more mandates, or job-killing increases in the minimum wage. Instead, what is needed are lower taxes for families and reforms that will increase worker productivity and job opportunities for Americans by, for example, improving basic education and encouraging more investment.
<p>
<b>MORE AMERICANS ARE MOVING UP THE ECONOMIC LADDER</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The dynamic U.S. economy is characterized by an extraordinary degree of income mobility which has been all but ignored in the controversy over wage differences. The notion that low-income or high-income groups are composed of the same people over time is an illusion. Data on income mobility reveal that most workers' incomes increase over time. The comparison of average incomes by group would be meaningful only if America were a caste society in which the people comprising one group remained constant. This is one reason why Americans with modest incomes tend to resist "soak the rich" class warfare arguments: They hope to be rich one day themselves. Further, average wage statistics are affected by economic changes that do not adversely affect most American workers.<sup>22</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the 1980s, there was considerable upward mobility for those in the lower-income and middle-income groups.<sup>23</sup>  For example, from 1979 to 1988, the income of 85.8 percent of workers in the lowest income group had increased enough to move them up into a higher-income group.<sup>24</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Income mobility is important, but the direction of that mobility is more important. Needless to say, some people move up while others are moving down (see <a href="fyi97c5.gif">Chart 5</a>). But in America, the upward movement of workers in the lowest, second-lowest, and middle-income groups is much larger than the downward movement. From 1979 to 1988, the income of 60.1 percent of workers in the second-lowest income group had increased enough to move them up into a higher income group, and 47.3 percent of workers in the middle group had moved up.<sup>25</sup>  Over the same period, much smaller percentages of workers were moving down: only 10.9 percent of the second-lowest group and 19.7 percent of the middle group.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The possibility of moving down increases as incomes rise, while the probability that low-wage workers will move up is much greater for those in the lowest quintile. Moreover, a worker in the lowest income group was more likely to have moved into the top income group by 1988 than to have remained in the bottom group.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
More than 60 percent of all workers can point to a minimum wage job as their first job experience.<sup>26</sup>  Some 40 percent of workers starting a minimum wage job receive their first raise within 4 months, and 63 percent of those workers earn 20 percent more than the minimum wage within 12 months.<sup>27</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. economy, while not without problems, thus remains dynamic, open, and productive enough to enable most Americans in the bottom income groups to work their way up the economic ladder. What is needed is policies to ensure that the opportunity for advancement is extended as widely as possible.
<p>
<b>INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS: MORE EQUALITY AND LESS GROWTH</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Concern about stagnating wages and increasing income inequality has some politicians looking to Europe for solutions. But proponents of government actions to "alleviate inequality" would do well to ponder the anemic job growth in Europe. European firms are encumbered with costly mandates and taxes that have discouraged hiring and held back employment growth,<sup>28</sup> so while incomes are more equal in Europe, this equality comes with a very high price in terms of economic growth, new jobs, and inflation.
<P><ul>
<li>From 1983 to 1993, the U.S. economy has grown an average of 2.9 percent per year, compared with 2.3 percent in the European Union.<sup>29</sup>
<p>
<li>Between 1970 and 1992, employment increased in the United States by 49 percent, compared with only 9 percent in the European Community.<sup>30</sup>
<p>
<li>Europe's employment rate (the proportion of its population of working age that is working) is the lowest of any industrialized part of the world. Moreover, it has fallen over the past two decades. The employment rate in the United States, which started in 1970 at a level similar to the European Community's, has grown in two decades to its current level of around 70 percent.<sup>31</sup>
<p>
<li>From 1983 to 1993, the U.S. unemployment rate averaged 6.9 percent per year, compared with 9.9 percent in the European Union.<sup>32</sup>
<p>
<li>From 1983 to 1993, consumer prices in the U.S. rose an average of 3.7 percent per year, compared with 5.1 percent in the European Union.<sup>33</sup>
<p>
<li>Although wage differences between low-income and middle-income workers are much higher in the United States than in Europe, the relative differences between middle-income and high-income workers are the same.<sup>34</sup>
</ul>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Europe is now realizing that its existing collective bargaining, tax, and labor cost arrangements do not create more jobs; instead, they cause gains from economic growth to be absorbed mainly by those already employed. European Community member states are seeking to remove obstacles to employment growth by adjusting employer taxes, the idea being to make more jobs available to the relatively less-skilled by reducing the cost to employers. They also are lowering the relative cost of labor with respect to other factors of production -- for example, by reducing the employers' social security contributions. These are precisely the types of policies that should be adopted in the United States instead of more mandates and labor market restrictions.
<p>
<b>TAXES AND MANDATES LIMIT TAKE-HOME PAY AND EMPLOYMENT GROWTH</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Real compensation and benefits are important, but take-home pay is what matters most to workers.<sup>35</sup>  The slow growth in take-home pay is not the result of corporate greed or trade deficits.<sup>36</sup>  It is the result of a slowdown in the growth of productivity caused in part by the expansion of government regulation, which in turn reduces the net value of workers' output and contributes to slower wage growth.<sup>37</sup>  Further, an ever-larger share of workers' total pay (wages and benefits) is beyond their control, consumed by mandated benefits and taxes.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As <a href="fyi97c6.gif">Chart 6</a> illustrates, productivity growth has slowed since 1973, leading to reductions in the growth of workers' pay. From 1959 to 1973, productivity increased an average of 3.2 percent per year, and real hourly compensation increased by an average of 2.8 percent per year.<sup>38</sup>  Between 1973 and 1994, however, productivity growth slowed to an average of 1.3 percent per year, and real hourly compensation growth increased an average of 0.4 percent per year.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Government taxes and fees at all levels are taking an ever-increasing bite out of personal income (see <a href="fyi97c7.gif">Chart 7</a>). Although personal income per person increased 121 percent from 1959 to 1995, government taxes and fees paid per person at all levels increased 155 percent over the same period. In 1994, federal, state, and local governments took an average of $2,800 (in 1992 dollars) from every man, woman, and child.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Several studies also point to the job-destroying effect of the regulatory and mandate explosion in recent years.<sup>39</sup>  For example:
<ul><p>
<li>There are at least 3 million fewer jobs in the American economy today because of the growth of regulation over the last 20 years.<sup>40</sup>
<p>
<li>A 1990 study estimated that environmental regulations alone had caused national employment to be 1.2 percent less in 1990 than it otherwise would have been.<sup>41</sup>
<p>
<li>In 1994, legally required benefits<sup>42</sup> accounted for 8.9 percent of total employer payrolls, up from 6.3 percent in 1971 and 3.5 percent in 1951.<sup>43</sup>  These mandated benefits are not "free" to the worker, as many employees assume. A range of studies indicates that, on average, 88 percent of the cost of all legally required benefits or payroll taxes is shifted to workers in the form of reduced cash compensation.<sup>44</sup>
<p>
<li>The increase in mandated benefits does not include the cost to employers and workers of complying with workplace safety and health regulations.<sup>45</sup>  One study has estimated that 19 percent of the productivity slowdown during the 1970s is directly attributable to regulations published by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).<sup>46</sup>
</ul><P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Up to a certain point, government functions enhance economic well-being. Beyond that point, however, the burden of excessive government reduces economic growth.<sup>47</sup>  Employers and workers are straining under unnecessarily burdensome regulations, mandates, and high taxes on labor and capital. This increasing drag on economic freedom has slowed growth, job creation, and wage gains. Government must roll back taxes, reduce the regulatory burden, and balance the budget to unshackle the economy and increase the real wages of all American workers.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The conventional wisdom is that wages are down, the middle class is shrinking, corporations are getting fat, and the rich are getting richer at the expense of the poor. Like most other examples of conventional wisdom, it is wrong.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States remains a nation of extraordinary opportunity and mobility. The real wages of high-income, middle-income, and low-income workers do not come at the expense of each other; they rise and fall together. The U.S. economy remains dynamic, open, and productive enough to enable most Americans to work their way up the economic ladder. To the extent that real wages are falling for some workers, the solution is not more government programs, trade restrictions, or job-killing increases in the minimum wage; it is policies that focus on the primary problems: high taxes and slow productivity growth. Only by correcting these problems can we increase job opportunities and real wages for all Americans.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b><BR>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Legislation to dismantle the current tax code and replace it with
a simple, 17 percent flat tax triggered immediate and strong support
when introduced last year by now-House Majority Leader<a href="http://www.house.gov/armey.flattax"> Richard Armey</a> (R-TX). Newspaper columnists said that, among other things,
this &quot;revolutionary reform&quot; would eliminate a &quot;Rube
Goldberg tax code.&quot;<sup>1</sup>  In the view of taxpayer groups, &quot;this legislation would unleash enormous economic growth and greatly
increase personal freedom&quot;<sup>2</sup> while &quot;eliminat[ing] the
long-time bias in the current tax code against saving and investment.&quot;<sup>3</sup>
 And Representative Armey has received thousands of letters of
support from people all across the country. In short, millions
of Americans know the current system is burdensome, unfair, unworkable,
and beyond repair.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A flat tax is more than popular, however; it is economically sound.
If enacted, for instance, it would:
<P><ul>
<li><b>Produce faster economic growth.</b> By reducing tax penalties levied
against productive economic behavior, a flat tax would spur increased
work, saving, and investment. Even if long-term growth rose by
as little as 0.5 percent, the average family of four's income
after 10 years would be as much as $5,000 higher than it would
be under current tax laws.<sup>4</sup><BR>

<P>
<li><b>Create instant wealth.</b> According to Harvard economist Dale Jorgenson,
the flat tax would boost national wealth by some $1 trillion.<sup>5</sup>
 Among the reasons:  Investments would be guided by profitability
rather than tax status and the value of income-producing assets
would rise as the after-tax stream of income generated by these
assets increased<sup>6</sup>.<BR>

<P>
<li><b>Lead to simplicity.</b> One business in 1992 had a tax return 21,000
pages and 30 volumes long.<sup>7</sup>  While generally better off than business,
individual taxpayers also face complex regulations, dozens of
special forms, and often heavy preparation costs. Under a flat
tax, all taxpayers, from General Motors to John Doe, would be
able to fill out their tax return on a <a href="bg1035c1.gif">postcard-size form</a>.<sup>8</sup>  Compliance
costs of the current system would drop by tens of billions of
dollars.<sup>9</sup><BR>

<P>
<li><b>Achieve fairness.</b>  A flat tax would treat people equally. A taxpayer
with 1,000 times the taxable income of another taxpayer would
pay 1,000 times more in taxes, but the tax code no longer would
penalize success and discriminate against citizens on the basis
of income.<sup>10</sup><BR>

<P>
<li><b>End micromanagement and political favoritism.</b> The flat tax would
rid the tax code of all deductions, loopholes, credits, and special
preferences. The only exemption that would be retained is a personal
allowance based on family size. Politicians thus would lose the
ability to pick winners and losers, reward friends and punish
enemies, and use the tax code to impose their values on the economy.
<BR>

<P>
<li><b>Increase civil liberties.</b> Under current law, someone charged with
murder has more rights and protections than a taxpayer dealing
with the Internal Revenue Service. With a simpler, fairer tax
code, infringements on freedoms and privacy would fall dramatically.<sup>11</sup>
<BR>

<P>
<li><b>Increase tax collections from the wealthy.</b> Just as happened in
the 1920s, 1960s, and 1980s, lower tax rates would result in increased
tax collections from upper-income taxpayers. The reason:  Incentives
to earn <I>and</I> report taxable income would climb dramatically.
</ul><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;America's tax system is a major reason for Americans' widespread
distrust of politicians. Taxpayers know they can spend their money
more wisely than bureaucrats and lawmakers, who seem reflexively
to raise taxes at every opportunity. The tax burden in America
is now at an all-time high, and economists estimate that this
causes both economic growth and job creation to suffer.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But this animosity is driven by more than opposition to an ever-growing
tax burden and concerns about lost jobs and lower wages. Most
Americans see the tax code as bewilderingly complicated, with
laws and regulations written for the benefit of special interests
rather than ordinary citizens. Families and businesses must pay
huge amounts to comply with this code, but even this does not
ensure an audit-proof tax return. Tax lawyers and accountants
admit that some provisions of today's tax law are so complex that
it is impossible to know whether returns are filed correctly.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congress could solve most of these problems by adopting a flat
tax, taxing income at a low, single rate and, with the exception
of a family allowance, eliminating the current labyrinth of rates,
deductions, credits, and exemptions. No income tax ever promoted
economic growth, but a flat tax at least would penalize work,
savings, and investment far less than the current tax code.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Unfortunately, while tax experts across the political spectrum
have been attracted to the flat tax, politicians have not been
as receptive. A flat tax would undermine their ability to use
the tax code to finance new spending, to grant favors to powerful
interests, and to generate contributions from those seeking to
change or preserve specific features of the tax code. Now, however,
thanks to the sweeping changes in Congress wrought by last November's
elections and the voters' demand for simplicity and fairness,
a historic opportunity exists for radical reform of America's
tax system.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>W</B></I><B>HAT IS A FLAT TAX</B>?<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While no two of the several flat tax proposals advanced over the
years have been identical, they usually are based on the proposal
developed about fifteen years ago by Stanford University economists
Alvin Rabushka and Robert Hall. Among the key features of a Hall/Rabushka-style
flat tax are:
<P>
<ol>
<li><b>A single flat rate</b> &#173;&#173; All flat tax proposals apply a
single tax rate to any income subject to tax, although proposed
rates may differ. Some plans call for rates as low as 10 percent.
<BR>

<P>
<li><b>Elimination of deductions, credits, and exemptions</b> &#173;&#173;
Most flat tax proposals would rid the code of various provisions
(for example, deductions for home mortgage interest, charitable
contributions, and state and local taxes) that bestow preferential
tax treatment on certain behaviors and activities.<BR>

<P>
<li><b>No double taxation of savings and investment</b> &#173;&#173; Flat
tax proposals are designed to reduce or eliminate the bias against
capital formation by ensuring that all income is taxed no more
than once. Simply stated, they often include the equivalent of
a &quot;super IRA&quot; to protect savings and investment from
additional levels of taxation.<sup>12</sup>
</ol><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While they share certain core principles, however, flat tax proposals
are not identical. The Armey proposal, for instance, calls for
a very generous family allowance.<sup>13</sup>  Others include smaller personal
allowances, a feature which allows the tax rate to be dropped
even further. Another major issue is whether a flat tax also should
be a tax cut. The Armey proposal would reduce government revenues
(according to static estimates). Others, like the Specter bill,
would collect the same amount of revenue.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Other differences involve the tax treatment of business. All flat
tax proposals based on the Hall/Rabushka model, such as Armey's,
address the many anti-growth features of the corporate income
tax. In theory, however, a flat tax could be designed that applies
only to the personal income tax. The Social Security and Medicare
payroll taxes, which together are the equivalent of a 15.3 percent
income tax for most Americans, are yet another unresolved issue.
Unlike the income tax, the Social Security portion of the payroll
tax (12.4 percent) is levied only on the first $61,600 of income.
The Medicare portion (2.9 percent) applies to all wage and salary
income. Hall/Rabushka-based flat taxes do not attempt to tackle
the special problems of these retirement programs, though it would
be possible to design a flat tax which incorporated payroll taxes.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In addition, there are proposals that move in the direction of
a flat tax but, for various reasons (usually political), do not
satisfy all three core criteria. Some retain a &quot;progressive&quot;
rate structure, penalizing those who contribute most to the economy's
growth<sup>14</sup>; others retain some deductions, usually for fear of offending
a powerful constituency<sup>15</sup>; and still others would continue to double-tax
savings and investment. Such proposals generally are an improvement
over the status quo, but they clearly would not have the positive
impact on jobs and wages that a true flat tax would have.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;More important, these attempts to find a &quot;middle ground&quot;
lack the political appeal of a genuine flat tax. One reason the
flat tax is so popular is that it breaks the special-interest
logjam by reversing the notion that the tax code should be used
to reward some groups while penalizing others. But allowing politicians
to continue choosing winners and losers also allows tax lawyers
and lobbyists to retain power and influence. Even worse, because
of budget deficit concerns, retaining special provisions in the
tax code almost inevitably results in tax rates that are higher
than they would be under a true flat tax. These halfway steps
also undermine the goal of simplicity, since every surviving credit,
deduction, and exemption means longer and more complex tax forms.
For these reasons, more &quot;moderate&quot; flat tax proposals
most likely would fuel cynicism among ordinary Americans and generate
far less support than more radical plans.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>W</B></I>HY A FLAT TAX IS FAIR<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Perhaps the most common argument against a flat tax is that it
would not be &quot;fair.&quot;  This assumes that the tax code
should impose increasingly steep rates on people as their income
rises. More specifically, a so-called progressive rate structure
facilitates far more income redistribution than is possible under
a single-rate system. As will be discussed in further detail later,
the economic consequences of this approach are severe and have
been demonstrated in many studies. Even leaving the broad economic
argument aside, however, the redistributionist approach fails
any reasonable test of morality and is fiscally counterproductive.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>&quot;Progressive&quot; taxation is discriminatory.</B> The
central tenet of a progressive tax is that the government has
a right to larger shares of an individual's income as his income
rises. But traditional notions of fairness suggest the law should
treat citizens equally, and penalizing those with higher incomes
violates this principle. As John McCulloch, an early student of
taxation, warned, &quot;The moment you abandon... the cardinal
principle of exacting from all individuals the same proportion
of their income... you are at sea without rudder or compass, and
there is no amount of injustice or folly you may not commit.&quot;
<sup>16</sup> Those favoring high, confiscatory tax rates sometimes argue that
well-to-do taxpayers received so much from society that it is
only proper that government seize bigger portions of their income
and use the money to benefit the less fortunate. This approach
presents several fundamental problems.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;First, in the private sector, income is earned by offering others
something of value. Employers pay workers because they produce;
consumers buy products because they value them. Without government
coercion, income is earned by offering something to society, not
by taking something from society.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The redistributionist credo, by contrast, holds that income is
earned at the expense of others in society. This assumes income
is a fixed pie and that any additional income earned by one individual
somehow comes out of the pockets of everyone else. As the <a href="bg1035c2.gif">chart</a>
above shows, however, earnings for all income groups tend to rise
and fall in unison. Incomes for all groups, including the poor,
rose substantially during the Reagan years when tax rates were
reduced. They did not perform strongly during the Carter, Bush,
and Clinton years when high-tax policies were enacted.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Second, advocates of high tax rates often claim that government
spending somehow helps the economy in general or the poor in particular.
As discussed previously, however, study after study shows that
higher levels of government spending are associated with weaker,
not stronger, economic growth. Even programs designed to help
the less fortunate, such as welfare and food stamps, seem to <a href="bg1035c3.gif">worsen conditions</a> for the poor by trapping them in a cycle of dependence
on government.<sup>17</sup>  As the adjacent chart shows, large amounts of
welfare spending have not lowered the poverty rate.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Third, studies have shown that high tax rates can backfire by
discouraging work, savings, and investment, thereby reducing taxable
income and &#173;&#173; depending on the tax rate &#173;&#173;
causing revenues to stagnate or fall.<sup>18</sup>  According to this principle,
popularly known as the Laffer curve, when tax rates reach certain
levels, total tax revenue will fall. Despite attacks by politicians
and journalists, the theory is valid. Imposing a 100 percent tax
on income above a certain level, for example, almost certainly
would yield no additional revenue, since people no longer would
have any incentive to earn money above that amount. Conversely,
the government would collect no money if tax rates were zero.
The only question (bearing in mind that the revenue maximizing
tax rate is not the same as the growth maximizing tax rate) is
whether tax rates are so high that government loses potential
revenue.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Unfortunately, official government projections are of limited
use when attempting to calculate the &quot;revenue-neutral&quot;
rate under a flat tax, since tax estimators in the Administration
and in Congress assume that taxes have no impact on the economy<sup>19</sup>.
 Most Americans would find it hard to believe that government
ignores economic effects in calculating revenue, but consider
the experience of Senator Bob Packwood (R-OR). In 1989, as ranking
Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, he asked the Joint
Committee on Taxation (JCT) to estimate what would happen if the
government confiscated <I>all</I> income above $200,000 per year.
The JCT projected that such a tax would raise $104 billion in
1989, $204 billion in 1990, $232 billion in 1991, $263 billion
in 1992, and $299 billion in 1993. As Senator Packwood remarked,
the Joint Committee's estimate &quot;assume[d] people will work
if they have to pay all their money to the Government. They will
work forever and pay all their money to the Government when clearly
anyone in their right mind will not.&quot;<sup>20</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This blunder was only a theoretical exercise, but it demonstrates
the enormous shortcomings of its methodology. Unfortunately, it
is this methodology that drives the JCT estimates that Congress
uses when considering alternative tax proposals, and the results
can be very costly, as many cases have demonstrated.<sup>21</sup>  Capital
gains estimates in the late 1980s that were off by more than 100
percent were used to kill a capital gains tax reduction that could
have eased the economic hardship afflicting the nation during
the Bush Administration.<sup>22</sup>  The large tax increase of 1990 was approved
in part because lawmakers were told it would balance the budget.
Instead, revenues came in below the tax collection estimates made
before the tax increase was enacted.<sup>23</sup>  Over the years, because
of static revenue estimating procedures, the JCT has seriously
overestimated revenues from such changes as the windfall profits
tax, the corporate income tax after the 1986 Tax Reform Act, and
the 1990 Luxury Tax on yachts.<sup>24</sup>  Ironically, the Clinton Administration
admitted the flaws of static scoring during the debate on the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), arguing correctly
that revenues generated by higher economic growth would more than
offset tax cuts in the trade legislation.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Recent evidence confirms the negative impact of high tax rates
on revenues. The 1993 Clinton tax increase was supposed to make
the &quot;rich&quot; pay more by imposing the largest income tax
rate increase since Herbert Hoover's in 1930. Yet, according to
Administration budget figures, individual income tax revenues
have been growing much more slowly than other tax revenues. These
figures are an early sign that this increase in the income tax
rate will not raise the $114 billion in new revenue the Administration
predicted. What makes the figures even more surprising is that
they include money generated by the retroactive &#173;&#173; and
thus unavoidable &#173;&#173; tax increase on 1993 income (due
on April 15, 1994). The fact that income tax revenues in 1994
were still 30 percent below the growth rates for all other revenues
is particularly significant.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Not surprisingly, the punitive Clinton tax increase caused rich
people to report less taxable income in 1993, as the <a href="bg1035c4.gif">chart</a> illustrates. The cause of this drop  &#173;&#173;  tax shelters,
reduced work effort, evasion  &#173;&#173;  is not yet clear.
Whatever the cause, the entire economy suffers.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Given what happened in the 1980s, however, the failure of the
Clinton tax hike should be no surprise. Critics charged that the
Reagan tax cuts were a &quot;giveaway to the rich,&quot; but government
figures show that upper-income taxpayers paid a significantly
<I>larger</I> share of the income tax burden after their tax rates
were reduced. Simply stated, lower tax rates encouraged substantial
income growth and reduced incentives to shelter and underreport
income, and the result was a large increase in taxable income
which generated substantial amounts of new revenue for the government
even though actual tax rates were lower.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>ADVANTAGES OF A FLAT TAX<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There are two principal arguments for a flat tax:  growth and
simplicity. Economists are attracted to the idea because the current
tax system reduces growth, destroys jobs, and lowers incomes.
While it would not eliminate this damaging impact, a flat tax
would boost the economy's performance when compared with the present
tax code. For many Americans, however, the most persuasive argument
for a flat tax is that the complicated documents and instruction
manuals they must struggle to decipher every April would be replaced
by a simple postcard-size form. This radical reform appeals to
citizens who not only resent the time and expense of their own
tax forms, but also suspect that the existing maze of credits,
deductions, and exemptions gives a special advantage to those
with political power and the money to afford tax accountants.
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>The Complexity Problem with the Current System<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;By penalizing work, savings, and investment, the income tax has
slowed economic growth and lowered living standards significantly.
This economic damage is compounded by a tax code that imposes
very high costs on those who try to follow the law. As categorized
in James L. Payne's comprehensive <I>Costly Returns:  The Burdens
of the U.S. Tax System</I>, these costs include:<sup>25</sup>
<P><ul>
<li><b>Record keeping</b> &#173;&#173;  organizing data collection systems;
collecting and appraising data; synthesizing data.<BR>

<P>
<li><b>Learning about tax requirements</b> &#173;&#173; studying tax form
instructions, tax books, pamphlets, and articles; seeking interactive
instruction in telephone calls and visits to IRS, discussion with
friends and volunteers, classes, training sessions; finding and
using a paid tax preparer<BR>

<P>
<li><b>Preparing the return</b> &#173;&#173;  making appropriate computations;
filling out tax forms and schedules; copying and sending the return.
<BR>

<P>
<li><b>Tax planning</b> &#173;&#173;  studying tax requirements, books, articles,
etc.; discussing tax avoidance with tax adviser and others; drafting
tax management plan.
</ul><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;According to Payne, today's tax code imposes 24.4 cents of compliance
costs for every dollar of taxes raised.<sup>26</sup>  The Tax Foundation puts
the cost at 15.2 cents<sup>27</sup>, though even this means the tax code imposes
$192 billion of compliance costs. Testifying before a congressional
committee, one economist stated, &quot;If an enemy power bent
on destroying our nation were somehow given the opportunity to
devise our tax code with a goal of sapping the nation of its economic
vitality... it could do little better than adopt our current Internal
Revenue Code.&quot;<sup>28</sup>  A professor of tax law declared, &quot;The
United States now has the most complex tax laws in the history
of civilization.&quot;<sup>29</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While every tax system imposes compliance costs, a simple flat
tax would sharply reduce these ancillary costs. As illustrated,
the Armey proposal would allow all taxpayers, from the teenager
flipping hamburgers to the General Motors Corporation, to submit
their returns on a postcard-sized form.<sup>30</sup>  The original tax code
was only 14 pages long, and tax forms were simple one-page documents<sup>31</sup>.
 Today's tax code has swelled to 3,458 pages.<sup>32</sup>  Moreover, the IRS
receives more than 1 billion form 1099s every year as part of
the government's cumbersome efforts to track income from interest,
dividends, and other forms of business income.<sup>33</sup>  With a flat tax,
this burden disappears. The effect would restore the simplicity
of the original income tax.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The tax laws are only the tip of the iceberg. Internal Revenue
Service regulations, supposedly written to clarify ambiguities
in the tax code, are nearly six times the length of the actual
tax law.<sup>34</sup>  To put this in perspective, federal tax laws and regulations
are more than six and one-half times longer than the King James
Bible.<sup>35</sup>  Unfortunately, length is not matched by clarity.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Compliance Costs of the Personal Income Tax<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Most individuals are painfully familiar with the peculiarities
of the personal income tax. They wade through the maze of forms
and instructions or pay professionals to do the job for them.
Studies show that Americans spend between 1.6 billion and 2.1
billion hours each year complying with the personal income tax.<sup>36</sup>
 In dollar terms, this represents an annual burden of between
$51 billion and $65 billion<sup>37</sup>, with compliance costs falling most
heavily on small businesses and the self-employed, thereby ensuring
that entrepreneurship is penalized.<sup>38</sup><BR>

<P>
What do taxpayers get for their time and effort?  All too often,
they get wrong answers. Each year, for example, <I>People</I>
magazine used to send tax information about a hypothetical family
to 50 different tax preparers, and each year virtually every one
came up with a different estimate of the family's tax bill &#173;&#173;
most of them missing the right figure by a wide margin.<sup>39</sup>  They
could have called the IRS for advice, but a 1987 General Accounting
Office survey found IRS officials giving taxpayers the wrong information
47 percent of the time.<sup>40</sup>  This survey was conducted just after
a major tax reform, and accuracy presumably has improved as IRS
staff have absorbed its intricacies. Nonetheless, the fact that
professionals both inside and outside of government have so much
trouble with the law argues compellingly for a simple flat tax.
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Compliance Costs of the Corporate Income Tax<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The personal income tax code is relatively simple when compared
with the laws driving the corporate tax system. According to Payne,
American businesses devote more than 3.6 billion hours to tax
compliance every year<sup>41</sup>, in addition to which compliance costs actually
may exceed the total raised by the corporate income tax. One recent
study estimated that these costs exceeded revenues by $40 billion,
while another found them to be as much as 75 percent of revenues.<sup>42</sup>
 Small corporations, those with assets of $1 million or less (90
percent of U.S. corporations), are especially victimized with
compliance costs of $382 for every $100 raised.<sup>43</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Like individual taxpayers, businesses may have no way of knowing
whether the information they put on their tax returns is accurate.
Provisions like depreciation, alternate minimum tax, uniform capitalization,
economic performance rules, transfer pricing, and allocation rules
all add to the complexity of corporate taxes and help explain
why businesses spend 3.6 billion hours a year trying to figure
out their tax bills.  Worst of all are the provisions affecting
U.S. corporations that do business overseas. As one executive
has remarked, the &quot;forms are so complex they defy interpretation
and result in noncompetitive cost burdens.&quot;<sup>45</sup><BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Tax Evasion<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
Many people in America and around the world choose to evade taxes
by operating in the underground economy.<sup>46</sup>  By its very nature,
the underground economy is difficult to measure. Scholars have
come up with estimates ranging from a low of 4.5 percent of official
U.S. economic output to a high of 27 percent.<sup>47</sup>  High tax rates
and complexity contribute to a decision to operate outside the
law<sup>48</sup>, but a great deal of the underground economy is the result
of government decisions to impose criminal penalties on drugs,
gambling, and prostitution. Income from such activity would not
be disclosed whatever the tax rate, and this makes it more difficult
to estimate the tax-induced economic losses from the underground
economy.<sup>49</sup><BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Costs of Taxation Incurred by Government<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A complex tax system with high marginal rates also imposes costs
on government. The annual cost of operating the Internal Revenue
Service, for instance, is expected to reach almost $10 billion
in 1995, and other government agencies also have tax-related divisions
which add about $3.5 billion to the total. All told, according
to one study, the federal government will employ more than 136,000
people and spend more than $13.7 billion enforcing the tax code
in 1995.<sup>50</sup>  While considerably less than the costs borne by the
private sector, these figures would drop significantly under a
simplified flat tax.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<I><B>T</B></I>HE ECONOMIC ARGUMENT FOR A FLAT TAX<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There are two ways to increase a nation's economic output or rate
of growth.  In simple terms, Americans must work more or work
more productively. Thus, economic growth depends on some combination
of:

<P><OL>
<b><li>Adding more labor to the economy</b>, which happens when people choose
to work longer hours, they take second jobs, or their spouses
join the workforce, or<BR>

<P>
<b><li>Adding more capital to the economy</b> so that workers can produce
more goods and services per hour of time worked.
<P></ol>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A flat tax would build a stronger economy by correcting both the
anti-labor and anti-capital features of the current income tax
code.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Why High Tax Rates Discourage Work<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Taxes on labor discourage work by reducing the benefits (after-tax
income) individuals receive from offering their labor to employers.
In the language of economists, taxes reduce the &quot;price&quot;
of leisure relative to work, so when taxes and other government
policies make work less attractive by reducing take-home pay,
many individuals choose either not to work or to cut back the
number of hours they work.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This can take many forms. Economic research indicates that taxes
have a strong impact on whether people work,<sup>53</sup> particularly people
with low incomes whose welfare benefits often result in higher
after-tax &quot;income&quot; than they can earn by holding a job.<sup>54</sup>
 Taxes also reduce incentives for those who do choose to work,
causing a decline in hours worked and, in the case of high taxes,
the willingness to work overtime (at least three strikes in recent
months were against additional overtime).<sup>55</sup>  Excessive taxation
also discourages second jobs, since workers often find that the
additional after-tax income is not enough to offset the leisure
time sacrificed. <a href="#appen1">Appendix 1</a> lists several studies that document
the impact of taxes on the decision to work.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Even though studies confirm the relationship, the idea that marginal
tax rates profoundly influence individual incentives is not immediately
obvious to many Americans. They recognize that businesses must
watch the bottom line and thus understand how higher taxes depress
wages and cost jobs, but they think about their own lives and
conclude that a shift &#173;&#173; up or down &#173;&#173; in
marginal tax rates probably will not mean dramatic change. Most
Americans, after all, do not take second jobs in response to lower
tax rates.<sup>56</sup>  Nor are many workers likely to refuse overtime just
because they rise. How, then, will lower marginal tax rates encourage
economic growth?<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It turns out that high tax rates have a particularly pronounced
effect at the upper end of the income scale. Unlike most citizens,
the &quot;rich&quot; have significant control over the timing
and composition of their income. As seen in the <a href="bg1035c5.gif">chart</a> on page
9, &quot;rich&quot; taxpayers receive most of their income from
investments and business activity.<sup>57</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Whether wealthy taxpayers are small businesses or investors, their
relative lack of dependence on wage and salary income means they
have far more ability to alter their economic behavior and protect
their income when changes in tax rates alter incentives. For small
businesses, any increase in tax rates lessens the ability to hire
workers or retain earnings for expansion. Because of the direct
effect taxes have on their generally smaller profit margins, small
businesses are even more sensitive to changes in the tax code
than large corporations are.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Many well-to-do taxpayers, of course, receive a large portion
of their incomes from dividends, interest, capital gains, and
other types of investments or passive business earnings. As with
most other Americans, they seek to realize the largest possible
return on their investments and to protect as much of their wealth
and income from the government as possible. In a survey conducted
by Prince &amp; Associates, a Connecticut financial consulting
firm, 89 percent of 311 high-income business owners were found
to be &quot;extremely interested&quot; in &quot;tax minimization
strategies.&quot;<sup>58</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One significant advantage these taxpayers have over most other
Americans is the ability to retain the services of highly qualified
tax lawyers, accountants, and investment advisors, each of whom
supposedly can generate the highest after-tax return for clients.
Needless to say, increases in marginal tax rates reduce the attractiveness
of many investments. This encourages tax professionals and their
clients to focus on sheltering income, reducing tax code earnings,
placing assets overseas, and otherwise avoiding taxes. Consider
the following:
<P><ul>
<li><b>Municipal bonds are exempt from federal tax.</b> In a <I>Wall Street
Journal</I> report on the growth of these bonds in the aftermath
of Clinton's record tax increase<sup>59</sup>, a member of one billionaire
family noted, &quot;A wealthy New York City resident is looking
at a combined city, state, and federal rate of nearly 50 percent.
So you've got to buy municipal bonds. You've got to. A long-dated
muni yielding 5.5 percent is equal to a 10.53 percent yield on
a taxable [U.S.] government bond.&quot;<sup>60</sup>  Rather than reduce the
budget deficit, as politicians claim, high tax rates merely drive
wealthy investors into tax-free municipal bonds and other shelters.
The federal government does not collect new tax revenues, and
overall tax collections may well fall. In addition, there is real
damage to the economy as driving investors out of productive private-sector
investments and into buying the debt of state and local government
undermines economic growth, resulting in less job creation and
stagnating incomes.<BR>

<P>
<li><b>Fidelity Investments offers a new mutual fund based on tax minimization
strategies.</b><sup>61</sup>  Again, the issue is economic. As with similar funds,
managers' investment decisions, deploying huge amounts of money,
are influenced more by the arcane features of the tax code than
by real economic factors.<BR>

<P>
<li><b>The tax code drives some people to hide their money by sending
it overseas.</b> Even though such behavior is illegal, one financial
adviser recently explained, &quot;People are hiding money. They
don't like the tax system, and they think it will get worse. Legal
experts outside the U.S. tell me that they are getting a 100 percent
increase in the business every six months.&quot;<sup>62</sup><BR>

<P>
<li><b>Perhaps most revealing, the tax burden has become so oppressive
that some Americans choose to emigrate to protect their earnings.</b><sup>63</sup>
</ul><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This anecdotal evidence that people respond to tax changes by
acting to protect their earnings and change their behavior is
supported by government data. Monthly personal income data from
the Commerce Department, for example, show that income jumped
sharply at the end of 1992 and fell just as dramatically in early
1993. The reason:  the widely expected Clinton tax increase. Taxpayers
with any discretion over when they received earnings shifted income
from 1993 to 1992 to limit the additional amount taken by the
government.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Not surprisingly, monthly tax collection figures echo these data.
Taxpayers with modest earnings pay most of their income taxes
in the form of amounts withheld from their paychecks throughout
the year. Wealthy individuals and businesses, however, because
most of their income is not subject to withholding, are legally
obligated to make quarterly payments. Most of these payments are
made routinely in the months they are due, but this pattern changed
dramatically in 1993, when January's share of the payments was
more than 70 percent higher than the average January share for
the previous 15 years. This is significant, because January 1993
was the month quarterly payments for the last three months of
1992 were due. Well-to-do taxpayers shifted large portions of
their income to 1992 because of widespread anticipation that the
incoming Clinton Administration would increase marginal tax rates.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These quarterly payment figures underscore that small businesses
and rich taxpayers can and do alter the timing and composition
of their income to protect their earnings. One prominent example
is the First Lady of the United States. Hillary Rodham Clinton
elected to take her partner's share of earnings at the Rose Law
Firm on December 31, 1992, rather than at the beginning of the
following year as she had in previous years. Perhaps Mrs. Clinton,
like other smart taxpayers, suspected the new President might
propose higher tax rates and did what she could to minimize her
family's tax liability. If she did, as the following examples
indicate, she was not alone.
<P><ul>
<li>The two top executives at the Disney Corporation exercised stock
options shortly before 1993, presumably to avoid widely expected
tax increases once Clinton took office.<sup>64</sup>

<P>
<li>Other top-level corporate executives did the same thing. Three
General Dynamics Corporation officials exercised options to purchase
over 500,000 shares of company stock before the 1993 tax year
began.<sup>65</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>Well-advised professional athletes also acted to protect their
earnings in 1992. Among baseball players, Oakland's Ruben Sierra
and Mark McGwire arranged for lump sum payments of $6 million
and $7 million, respectively, to avoid 1993's higher taxes. Other
players doing the same thing included David Cone of the Kansas
City Royals, with a lump sum of $9 million, and Detroit's Cecil
Fielder, who negotiated a record $10 million.<sup>66</sup><BR>

<I><B>Why High Tax Rates Discourage Savings and Investment</B>
<BR>
</I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Taxes on savings and investment harm the economy by reducing capital
formation, the process by which the quality and quantity of equipment,
tools, and technology available to workers are increased, thereby
raising their productivity.<sup>67</sup>  Since salaries and wages are linked
closely to productivity, the only way to raise the income of workers
permanently &#173;&#173; assuming no change in their skills &#173;&#173;
is through savings and investment. Simply put, workers are paid
on the basis of what they produce, and giving them better tools
allows them to produce more. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The level of capital formation largely explains why workers in
the United States, Germany, and Japan earn more than workers in
Brazil, India, and Nigeria. Similarly, workers in America today
earn more than their parents because of net investment (increases
in the capital stock). As a result, they are more productive,
generating more output per hour of labor.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;An ideal tax system does not penalize or subsidize particular
economic choices. Unfortunately, one of the most destructive elements
of the current income tax is the multiple taxation of savings
and investment. Just as savings, dividend, business, and other
forms of investment income are penalized by the personal income
tax, capital formation is hindered by corporate income, capital
gains, estate, and gift taxes, by depreciation tax provisions,
and by the corporate alternative minimum tax. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <a href="#appen2">Appendix 2</a> reveals ample evidence that taxes significantly reduce
savings and investment. This is important, of course, because
reduced levels of capital formation translate into reduced levels
of income.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Why Capital Formation Matters<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Economists of all persuasions recognize the relationship between
investment and wages. Paul Samuelson, for example, a Nobel Laureate
economist who endorsed Bill Clinton for President, has written:
<BR>

<P><blockquote>
 What happens to the wage rate now that each person works with
more capital goods?  Because each worker has more capital to work
with, his or her marginal product rises. Therefore, the competitive
real wage rises as workers become worth more to capitalists and
meet with spirited bidding up of their market wage rates. <sup>68</sup></blockquote>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Another example is taken from a 1991 report on economic growth
prepared by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, then
controlled by the Democrats:<BR>

<P>
<blockquote> When an economy's rate of net investment (gross investment less
depreciation)<sup>69</sup> increases, the economy's stock of capital increases.
A larger capital stock permits a fixed amount of labor to produce
more goods and services. The larger a country's capital stock,
the more productive its workers and, generally, the higher its
real wages and salaries. Thus, increases in investment tend to
cause future increases in a nation's standard of living.<sup>70</sup><BR>
</blockquote>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;According to a 1989 report on economic growth published by the
Congressional Research Service,<BR>

<P>
<blockquote> Capital deepening has been and will likely continue to be a central
force for accelerating growth and potential output over the medium
term. But as we have seen, a permanent increase in the long-term
rate of growth will hinge on the United States ability to increase
the pace of technical advance and innovation. However, both of
these routes to faster growth will be contingent upon the ability
to increase the level of investment spending &#173;&#173; more
spending for capital equipment and more spending for research
and development. To finance higher investment will, in turn, require
that Americans raise the national rate of savings.<sup>71</sup><BR>
</blockquote>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Critics of this analysis complain that it is nothing more than
&quot;trickle-down&quot; economics that relies on tax cuts for
the &quot;rich&quot; to boost wages. Such rhetoric may be useful
politically, but it cannot change economic reality, as economist
John Shoven has explained:<BR>
<blockquote>
<P>
 The mechanism of raising real wages by stimulating investment
is sometimes derisively referred to as &quot;trickle-down&quot;
economics. But regardless of the label used, no one doubts that
the primary mechanism for raising the return to work is providing
each worker with better and more numerous tools. One can wonder
about the length of time it takes for such a policy of increasing
saving and investments to have a pronounced effect on wages, but
I know of no one who doubts the correctness of the underlying
mechanism. In fact, most economists would state the <I>only</I>
way to increase real wages in the long run is through extra investments
per worker.<sup>72</sup><BR>
</blockquote>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The following example illustrates why savings and investment suffer
in the current tax climate. A taxpayer has $100 of income and
must decide what to do with it. He can consume the $100, spending
it on food, vacations, clothing, haircuts, or some other product
or service, in which case (with the exception of possible sales
taxes) he will receive close to $100 in goods and services for
his money. Or he can invest in the stock of a start-up company
with the potential to provide new jobs to the community and produce
goods that consumers desire. If the company succeeds, the investor
most likely will profit. If it fails, he will lose his $100.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In this case, the investment bears fruit and yields a 10 percent
rate of return, enabling the company to produce $10 of annual
income for every $100 invested. Under the current tax code, 34
percent is skimmed off to pay the corporate income tax, leaving
only $6.60 out of the original $10. This $6.60 then goes to the
investor as a dividend. But there are other taxes. Depending on
the investor's income, the personal income tax will take as much
as 39.6 percent of his $6.60, leaving him with less than $4.00
of annual income from a &quot;successful&quot; $100 investment.
In addition, he may face applicable state and local income taxes.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Finally, if the investor ever decides to sell the stock, he will
be hit by one of the highest capital gains taxes in the industrialized
world, and what little income he eventually receives from saving
and from having taken the risk of investing most probably will
be subject to sales tax when he spends it. To add insult to injury,
successful entrepreneurs who try to accumulate an estate to pass
on to their children are penalized by inheritance taxes which
can confiscate 55 percent of a deceased's assets.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Thanks to the tax code, a fortunate investor &#173;&#173; one
who actually earns money on his investments &#173;&#173; may have
to send more than half his earnings to the government, not to
mention having already paid taxes on the money used for the investment
in the first place. Thus, government tax policy has created a
very tilted playing field. By punishing saving and investment,
the tax code encourages both individuals and businesses to consume
rather than to build for America's future.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As discussed earlier, the only ways to boost per capita income
are to work more hours or produce more per hour worked. Since
leisure has a positive value to Americans, particularly those
with families, most would prefer to raise their living standards
by increasing their hourly productivity. This is why taxes on
capital are especially damaging. They penalize the very economic
actions &#173;&#173; saving and investment &#173;&#173; necessary
for increased productivity and the growth in wages that accompanies
it. Thus, while it is important that the tax code not discourage
people from working more if that is what they desire, eliminating
the multiple layers of taxes on saving and investment is even
more critical if we want higher incomes without sacrificing leisure
time.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Why High Tax Rates Depress Economic Growth<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Since taxes affect incentives to work, save, and invest so powerfully,
it should come as no surprise that major tax changes almost always
have a significant impact on the economy. Herbert Hoover's decision
in 1930 to increase the top tax rate from 25 percent to 63 percent
certainly contributed to the Depression. Lyndon Johnson's surtax
on income tax liabilities, enacted in 1968, together with an increase
in the capital gains tax helped end the 1960s expansion. Large
tax increases, including inflation-induced bracket creep, contributed
to the economy's dismal performance under Jimmy Carter. George
Bush's record tax increase in 1990 was a principal cause of the
recent recession and subsequent anemic recovery. And the sub-par
performance of today's economy, particularly the decline in median
household income<sup>73</sup>, almost certainly is attributable in part to
the record tax increase pushed through Congress in 1993 by Bill
Clinton.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Once again, the evidence is confirmed by academic research. As
the examples in <a href="#appen3">Appendix 3</a> indicate, tax codes that penalize productive
economic behavior are associated with weaker growth, fewer jobs,
and lower incomes. Other studies find that the damage occurs when
government spends the money. In either case, the message is clear:
 The larger and more intrusive a government is, the worse its
economy performs.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<h3>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT A FLAT TAX</h3>
<BR>

<P>
<b><font size="+1">Q</font> :  Will a flat tax encourage job creation?<BR>

<P>
<font size="+1">A</font>:  A flat tax will encourage more jobs and higher wages by boosting
incentives to work, save, and invest.</b> In the long run, the elimination
of most of the tax code's bias against savings and investment
will have the biggest effect. As studies show, a flat tax will
encourage capital formation, leading over time to higher levels
of productivity, increased wages, and more jobs. A flat tax also
will have a more immediate impact on job creation, however, by
making work more attractive. High tax rates drive a wedge between
what it costs a business to employ a worker and how much the worker
receives in take-home pay.<sup>74</sup>  By increasing the cost of labor, taxes
lower the number of workers a company is willing to hire. Businesses
do not exist to pay workers more than they are worth. They exist
to make money and will hire only as long as the value of each
new worker's additional output exceeds the total cost of employing
that worker.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;When politicians enact policies that raise the cost of employment,
the total cost of some workers will rise above the value they
bring their employers. In the long run, a business has only two
options when faced with this predicament:  close its doors or
lay off workers who are net money losers. Even workers who retain
their jobs pay a price. Taxes on labor income, whether paid by
employee or employer, dollar for dollar, unavoidably reduce the
amount that finds its way into their paychecks. Politicians may
pretend otherwise, but every time the tax burden climbs, workers'
after-tax income declines.<sup>75</sup><BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b><font size="+1">Q</font>:  Would a flat tax reduce the budget deficit?<BR>

<P>
<font size="+1">A</font>:  This depends on which flat tax is implemented.</b> More specifically,
it depends on the tax rate and whether the proposal includes limits
on government spending. Even though lower rates generally stimulate
economic growth and expand the tax base, at some point they translate
into less revenue. A flat tax of 20 percent, for instance, almost
certainly would raise more money than a flat tax of 10 percent.
The size of the personal exemption/family allowance also plays
a key role, since the decision to protect a certain amount of
income ($36,800 for a family of four in last year's Armey bill)
generally means the rate on taxable income must be higher.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;According to a Treasury Department analysis leaked to the media
before the 1994 elections, the Administration estimates that the
Armey flat tax would result in a $244 billion revenue loss to
the federal government in 1995.<sup>76</sup>  But this study contained a $500
billion error, as the Department later admitted<sup>77</sup>, and used the
17 percent rate to analyze 1995 revenues even though the Armey
bill calls explicitly for an initial rate of 20 percent (which
would be phased down to 17 percent). The Treasury Department now
claims that, once fully phased in, the Armey flat tax would &quot;cost&quot;
the government as much as $186 billion per year.<sup>78</sup>  Because it is
based on static analysis, however, this figure assumes that reduced
tax rates and simplification would have no positive effect on
the economy. Hence, it ignores the additional revenues produced
by income growth (as well as the binding caps on federal spending
that the Armey bill would impose).<sup>79</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A flat tax almost certainly would reduce long-term government
borrowing since its reduced rates and lower taxes on savings and
investment would boost economic growth. Each year, the result
would be an expanding tax base and at least some reduction in
outlays for certain means-tested programs and the unemployment
compensation system. According to one relatively modest estimate
of supply-side impact, a flat tax would increase the economy's
long-run annual growth rate by just 0.5 percent. By the tenth
year, national economic output would be $578 billion higher than
it would have been without a flat tax.<sup>80</sup>  Government's &quot;share&quot;
of this production of additional goods and services would be $86
billion in tax revenue.<sup>81</sup>  By the twentieth year, added growth of
0.5 percent would mean an increase of more than $2 trillion in
GDP and additional tax revenues in excess of $300 billion.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The revenue feedback from higher growth, however, probably would
not be enough in the short term to offset the revenue lost from
lower tax rates and elimination of the multiple taxation of capital
income. Achieving a deficit-neutral flat tax (at least the Armey
version) would require some restraints on government spending.
And if lawmakers were forced to balance the budget by 2002, the
limit on spending increases would have to be even more stringent.
<BR>

<P>
<b><font size="+1">Q</font>:  What would happen to charitable contributions and the housing
market?<BR>

<P>
<font size="+1">A</font>:  While many recognize that a flat tax is far better than the
current system, they fear that the transition would create problems</b> &#173;&#173; in particular, that the loss of charitable and home
mortgage interest deductions could cause turmoil in affected markets.
This is a legitimate concern. A wealthy individual donating money
to a museum no longer could claim the gift as a deduction, reducing
his tax burden by nearly 40 cents for every dollar given and thereby
also reducing the &quot;price&quot; of his gift. The loss of the
home mortgage interest deduction would increase the after-tax
cost of housing payments and could lead to a drop in housing values,
since experts believe the value of the home mortgage interest
deduction is factored into home values.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Fortunately, history suggests these fears are exaggerated. During
the 1980s, the top tax rate was reduced dramatically, from 70
percent in 1980 to 28 percent in 1988. The effect was to slash
the value of the deduction and raise the &quot;price&quot; of
gifts. Similarly, the decline in tax rates increased the after-tax
cost of mortgage payments. In fact, the after-tax costs of mortgage
interest for homeowners and donations for charitable givers in
the highest tax bracket jumped from 30 cents to 72 cents on the
dollar, an increase of 140 percent. Most other taxpayers also
experienced a significant increase in after-tax costs of contributions
and mortgages.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If these sectors of the economy depended on the value of the tax
deduction, there should have been a noticeable downturn in home
values and charitable contributions during the 1980s. As the charts
show, however, the value of <a href="bg1035c7.gif">housing</a> did not drop. Also, <a href="bg1035c6.gif">charitable contributions</a> rose throughout the 1980s even as the out-of-pocket
cost to donors increased. These charts do not mean that lower
tax rates necessarily encourage more charity and higher home values.
They simply suggest that any adverse consequences from lower rates
&#173;&#173; or from no deductions at all &#173;&#173; can be
offset if the economy's performance is robust. In other words,
charitable contributions and housing values may well depend more
on rising incomes and wealth creation than on tax status.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There is strong reason to believe, moreover, that a flat tax would
stimulate the housing industry because of its impact on interest
rates. The current tax treatment of mortgage interest &#173;&#173;
deductible to borrowers and taxable to lenders &#173;&#173; results
in artificially high interest rates.<sup>82</sup>  One need only compare the
interest rate on tax-free municipal bonds with the interest rate
on taxable bonds to see how tax treatment of interest results
in unnecessarily high interest rates. If adoption of a flat tax
reduced interest rates to the level enjoyed by municipal bonds,
the impact on the housing industry would be substantive and positive.
<BR>

<P>
<b><font size="+1">Q</font>:  What would happen to the price of other assets?<BR>

<P>
<font size="+1">A</font>:  While the potentially negative impact on housing markets and
charity appears negligible, the positive impact on income-producing
assets would be large.</b> Assets such as stocks, bonds, and rental
properties produce a stream of income over time. Their market
price is determined by calculating how much income an asset will
produce over time, after taxes, adjusted to reflect the fact that
income today is worth more than the same amount of nominal income
in the future.<sup>83</sup>  By lowering tax rates and removing the double
and sometimes triple taxation of capital income, a flat tax can
increase dramatically the after-tax income stream an asset will
generate. Thus, a low-rate flat tax would be a boon to asset holders,
offsetting any theoretical fall in housing prices, and would stimulate
a surge of new investment in the economy. Harvard professor and
tax economist Dale Jorgenson estimates that a flat tax would increase
national wealth by $1 trillion.<sup>84</sup>  While this may seem high, it
should be remembered that the mere announcement in Israel that
a capital gains tax was being imposed caused the Israeli stock
market to drop by 10 percent in just one day.<sup>85</sup><BR>

<P>
<b><font size="+1">Q</font>:  Would a flat tax benefit everybody?<BR>

<P>
<font size="+1">A</font>:  If the question is considered narrowly (will anyone's tax
bill rise?) it depends on how a flat tax is structured.</b> If it
is designed to give the government as much money as it receives
under the current system, and if there is no consideration of
the increased revenue that would accrue from new job creation
and higher economic growth, then it is impossible to avoid having
winners and losers. In the long run, a flat tax presumably would
generate higher incomes and living standards, raising after-tax
income even for those who suffered a short-term tax increase.
At the same time, it doubtless would have an adverse impact on
the lawyers, accountants, and lobbyists who profit from the current
law's complexity.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Many flat tax proposals are structured so that few taxpayers,
if any, would have higher tax bills. This is because they are
designed to go beyond simplification and rate reduction to include
significant tax cuts for the American economy. The Armey plan
is a good example. Using static estimating techniques, it probably
would save taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars over a five-year
period. While the combination of a 17 percent tax rate and generous
family exemption would not necessarily guarantee lower tax bills
for everyone, few would face higher taxes.<BR>

<P>
<b><font size="+1">Q</font>:  Is there a way to stop politicians from raising tax rates
in the future?<BR>

<P>
<font size="+1">A</font>:  There is no guarantee that a future Congress would not turn
a simple flat tax back into a complicated &quot;progressive&quot; tax.</b> This is the Achilles' Heel of tax reform. The sweeping reform
enacted in 1986 expanded the tax base by eliminating many deductions
while simultaneously reducing tax rates to keep the total tax
burden from climbing. Skeptics warned that politicians could not
be trusted to honor this arrangement and that eventually they
would raise rates while failing to restore deductions. This is
exactly what happened under Presidents Bush and Clinton.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Could this happen with a flat tax?  Using the promise of low tax
rates, could politicians take away the home mortgage interest
deduction, the charitable contributions deduction, and other tax
preferences but then raise tax rates in the future?  It is to
reduce this danger that most proponents of a flat tax include
an ironclad provision to make raising tax rates difficult or impossible.
One way to accomplish this would be by amending the Constitution
to require that no increase in tax rates can be approved without
the votes of at least three-fifths or two-thirds (in other words,
a &quot;super-majority&quot;) of both the House and Senate.<sup>86</sup><BR>

<P>
<b><font size="+1">Q</font>:  Should the income tax be abolished instead?<BR>

<P>
<font size="+1">A</font>:  Proponents of a flat tax note that the current &quot;progressive&quot;
income tax penalizes growth, discourages savings and investment, imposes heavy compliance costs, destroys jobs, and reduces America's international competitiveness.</b> It has been pointed out, moreover,
that a flat rate income tax reduces but does not eliminate these
negative effects. Thus, the question for some becomes whether
it would be better to replace the income tax with a sales or &quot;consumption&quot;
tax. Proponents of this view, including House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Bill Archer (R-TX) and Senator Richard Lugar (R-IN),
usually suggest that the foregone revenue could be offset by spending
cuts, consumption taxes, or some combination of the two.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Most advocates of a flat tax recognize that this argument is sound,
at least in theory. Abolishing the income tax, closing down the
Internal Revenue Service, and repealing the 16th Amendment clearly
would be in the national interest. Eliminating the income tax
would lead to even more economic growth and job creation than
would occur under a flat tax. The real question is how that goal
can be achieved.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Supporters of the flat tax have decided that eliminating the income
tax is unlikely, especially in the short run. Because so many
interest groups benefit from the current tax system, enacting
a flat tax will be difficult by itself. Moreover, there is some
concern that proposals to abolish the income tax could play into
the hands of those who want a national sales tax, or value added
tax (VAT), as an add-on tax. If implemented as a replacement for
the income tax, either of these would be less destructive to the
economy. The experiences of other countries, however, suggest
that, while a VAT would be implemented with the promise to eliminate
other taxes, politicians would never take that second step. The
country then would have the worst of both worlds:  income <I>and</I>
direct consumption taxes.<sup>87</sup>  In any event, enacting a flat tax is
probably necessary as an interim measure for those who favor eliminating
the income tax.<BR>

<P>
<b><font size="+1">Q</font>:  Would a flat tax eliminate the marriage penalty?<BR>

<P>
<font size="+1">A</font>:  Probably, but &#173;&#173; again &#173;&#173; it depends on
how the flat tax is structured.</b> The marriage penalty refers to
the increased tax faced by a married couple compared to two single
people with similar incomes. This penalty is most severe for couples
with similar earnings. A flat tax automatically solves part of
this problem by making it no longer possible for one spouse's
income to push a couple into a higher tax bracket. But the marriage
penalty also arises if the personal exemption for a married couple
is not twice the size of the exemption for those filing singly.
The Armey proposal solves this part of the problem by giving a
married couple twice the exemption of a single filer. Nevertheless,
a flat tax could be constructed that retains this penalty.<BR>

<P>
<b><font size="+1">Q</font>:  How would a flat tax affect business and payroll taxes?<BR>

<P>
<font size="+1">A</font>:  It would be possible to reform the personal income tax dramatically
while leaving the corporate income tax untouched.</b> As mentioned
earlier, many businesses file using the personal tax code, so
many of their problems would be solved by a flat tax that left
the corporate tax code untouched. All flat taxes based on the
Hall/Rabushka model, however, reform both the personal and corporate
income tax codes. Under the Armey proposal, for instance, the
business rate would fall to 17 percent, the same as the personal
rate, and the code would be reformed to eliminate the excess taxation
of capital.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A flat tax can be designed to include substantial reform of Social
Security and Medicare payroll taxes. Under current law, payroll
taxes totaling 15.3 percent are levied on the first $61,600 of
income (7.65 percent each from employer and employee, though economists
agree that the entire tax is borne by the worker).<sup>88</sup>  Although none
has reached legislative form, some flat tax plans incorporate
the payroll tax, making the total marginal tax rate a fixed percentage
regardless of income.<BR>

<P>
<b><font size="+1">Q</font>:  Would a flat tax help America compete?<BR>

<P>
<font size="+1">A</font>:  The historic tax rate reductions launched by Ronald Reagan
in the 1980s caused a chain reaction around the world.</b> Many nations
followed America's example and have made similarly dramatic reductions
in marginal tax rates in recent years. In large part, this worldwide
shift in tax policy was driven by competition as investors avoided
nations with high tax rates. Unfortunately, America seems to be
one of the few nations that have not learned from the experience
of the 1980s. While the rest of the world has been cutting taxes,
the United States stands alone as the only major nation to impose
sharply higher tax rates in recent years. Investors have reacted
accordingly, and the amount of new investment in American jobs
and business from overseas has dropped from an average of $175
billion per year during the low tax years of the 1980s to an average
of only $108 billion in 1990.<sup>89</sup><BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b><font size="+1">Q</font>:  What happens to capital gains taxes and estate taxes under
a flat tax?<BR>

<P>
<font size="+1">A</font>:  They are all eliminated.</b> One of the key principles of a flat
tax is that income is taxed only once. A capital gain for a financial
asset is simply a reflection that the market's expectation of
the after-tax streams of income from that asset has risen. Under
a flat tax, that income is taxed at the business level when it
is realized. To tax the capital gain is double taxation. Similarly,
the estate tax is a second layer of tax on earning which, under
the current system, already has been taxed at least once.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>C</B></I>ONCLUSION<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;America's income tax system punishes the economy, imposes heavy
compliance costs on taxpayers, rewards special interests, and
makes America less competitive. A flat tax would reduce these
costs drastically and create a tax system that rewards productive
behavior. Perhaps more important, it would reduce the federal
government's power over taxpayers' lives and get government out
of the business of trying to micromanage the economy. No tax is
good for the economy, but the flat tax moves the system much closer
to where it should be &#173;&#173; to being a tax that raises
needed revenue in the least destructive and least intrusive way
possible.

  Taxes Affect Decisions to Work</b>
<hr>
<P><ul>
<li>Joint research by economists from Princeton University and Brigham
Young University, based on a random survey of physicians, found
that a one percentage point increase in marginal tax rates is
associated with a reduction of as much as 1.11 percent in hours
worked.<sup>90</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>A University of California economist found that because of the
Tax Reform Act of 1986 (which lowered tax rates), the work effort
of high-income married women rose by 0.8 percent for every one
percent their after-tax wages increased.<sup>91</sup>

<P>
<li>Another economist found that &quot;Husbands of retirement age,
60 and over, show substantial variation in hours of work, related
systematically to wages and income in the expected way.&quot;
  Moreover, &quot;Wives in all age groups are quite sensitive
to wages and income.&quot;<sup>92</sup>  In other words, as after-tax income
falls, so does the incentive to work.<BR>

<P>
<li>Two other economists estimated that &quot;wives' labor supply
will increase by 3.8 percent&quot; in response to a reduction
in the marriage penalty.<sup>93</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>A comprehensive study in <I>The Journal of Human Resources</I>
found that taxes reduce married males' hours of work by 2.6 percent
and married females' by between 10 percent and 30 percent.<sup>94</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>According to a statistical study in <I>Econometrica</I>, yearly
hours of work for white married women increase by 2.3 percent
for every one percent increase in after-tax earnings.<sup>95</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>While husbands are not as sensitive to taxes as wives, the impact
of taxes on their behavior is nonetheless dramatic. One study
found that they work eight percent less than they would in the
absence of taxes.<sup>96</sup>  This indicates a loss in economic output of
at least $1,000 per person.<sup>97</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>All studies acknowledge that higher after-tax incomes increase
incentives to work by increasing the &quot;price&quot; of leisure,
but some assume this effect is offset because lower taxes allow
workers to achieve a certain level of income by working fewer
hours. While this trade-off is relevant when looking at individual
choices, two economists note that &quot;the generalization of
the individual analysis to the economy as a whole is invalid&quot;
because &quot;It will be impossible for <I>all</I> individuals
to consume both more goods and more leisure as the individual
work-leisure analysis implies.&quot;<sup>98</sup>  The actual economy-wide
response to changes in tax rates will be higher than almost all
studies indicate.<sup>99</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>One econometric model found that a one percent reduction in tax
rates increased work effort for lower-income workers by 0.1 percent,
for middle and upper-middle-income workers by 0.25 percent, and
for upper-income workers by more than 2.0 percent.<sup>100</sup><BR>

Taxes Reduce Savings and Investment</b>
<hr>
<P><ul>
<li>In a book on taxes and capital formation, Norman B. Ture and B.
Kenneth Sanden noted, &quot;The bias against saving in the present
tax system results from the fact that, with few exceptions, taxes
are imposed both on the amount of current saving and on the future
returns to such saving, whereas the tax falls only once on income
used for consumption.&quot;<sup>101</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>Economist John Shoven estimates that a reduction of 20 percent
in the top rate for capital gains would cause the stock market
to rise by 3 percent.<sup>102</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>Undersecretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers has written
that &quot;increases in the real after-tax rate of return received
by savers would lead to substantial increases in long-run capital
accumulation.&quot;  Further, &quot;bequests may account for a
large fraction of national capital formation,&quot; which strengthens
the argument that taxes influence savings.<sup>103</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>A study in <I>The American Political Science Review</I> noted
that &quot;Nations...where the extractive [tax] capacity of government
did not significantly increase, relative to the economic product,
have, in a sense, opted for...an increasing rate of private capital
accumulation.&quot;<sup>104</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>Analyzing the decline in savings, a study by three experts concluded
that Social Security and other transfer programs have led to a
&quot;decline in U.S. saving.&quot;<sup>105</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>Two other economists also concluded that Social Security reduces
savings because workers no longer worry as much about retirement.
<sup>106</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>Econometric results, according to a study published in the <I>Journal
of Public Economics</I>, &quot;suggest that dividend taxes have
important effects on investment decisions&quot; and that &quot;an
increase of 10 percent in the stock market would raise the investment
rate by about 15 percent.&quot;<sup>107</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>Writing in the <I>National Tax Journal</I>, three economists found
&quot;significant effects for the after-tax return on saving,
after-tax cost of borrowing, or both.&quot;  The Reagan tax cuts

tax burden reduces economic growth by 1.8 percent and lowers national
employment by 1.14 percent.<sup>111</sup><BR>

<li>According to a statistical study published in the <I>American
Economic Review</I>, for every dollar paid to the federal government
in taxes, 33.2 cents is lost to the economy.<sup>112</sup><BR>

1.9 million people out of the U.S. labor force.<sup>113</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>Statistical research published in <I>Lloyd's Bank Review</I> has
found that in the U.K. each one percent rise in payroll taxes
causes hiring to fall by approximately 1.4 percent. The same study
estimated that each $1 of additional tax revenue costs $3 in lost
economic output.<sup>114</sup> <BR>

<P>
<li> A study printed in the <I>American Sociological Review</I> concluded
that &quot;Increases of one percent in the tax burden relative

decline in economic growth over three years, or just under one
percent annually.&quot;<sup>115</sup><BR>

<li>A 1981 analysis of the Swedish economy in the <I>Journal of Political

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some sense, there are no economic losses,
since the income&#173;generating activity does occur. The &quot;losses&quot;
are the tax revenue the Treasury foregoes. In addition, costs
presumably are borne by those who seek to keep income from the
underground economy away from the prying eyes of the IRS.

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way to generate growth is by adding
to the population. Over time, a higher birth rate or increased
immigration will raise total economic output. This is not the
same, however, as higher per capita economic output, which is
the prerequisite for higher incomes and rising living standards.

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examining the relationship at the time

<P>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxation is not the only government activity
that inflates the cost of hiring workers and reduces take&#173;home
pay. Myriad regulations, mandated benefits, unemployment compensation,
liability costs, and labor laws drive up the cost of employment
and shrink workers' pay.
<P>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process usually works by delaying,
reducing, or canceling wage increases. In most years, additional
investment and training increase worker productivity, making employees
more valuable and allowing businesses to increases wages. When
these productivity increases are accompanied by higher taxes,
however, it is government, not the workers, that captures all
the benefits.

<P>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its analysis of the Armey proposal,
the Treasury Department admitted that &quot;no attempt is made
to estimate the tax&#173;induced behavioral responses of either
individuals or corporations. Following the standard revenue estimating
conventions used by both the Office of Tax Analysis and the Joint
Committee on Taxation, the macroeconomic aggregates, such as the
level of compensation, prices, employment, and gross domestic
product, have been assumed to be unchanged by the proposal.&quot;

growth to GDP with 6 percent nominal growth (assuming a similar
inflation rate).
<P>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming taxes would take only 15 percent
of the added output. Since taxes currently consume about 19 percent
of GDP, this estimate understates the potential supply&#173;side
impact on revenues.

<p>
<b>ROBERT MOFFIT:</b>  On Capitol Hill and around the country, Americans are pondering the basis for renewing the debate on the American health care system. What is our starting point?  Of course, with you, the members of the medical profession, the central issue is the doctor-patient relationship. Ideally, that relationship and its preservation should be the touchstone of reform. But not all agree. Some corporate experts feel that we ought simply to build reform on the basis of the current health insurance system -- the employee-based, tax-supported insurance arrangements that have been with us since World War II.
<p>
But underlying the current insurance system are major market distortions. This is a fundamental fact of our economic life. It is the environment in which you, as physicians, currently operate. These market distortions serve to drive up health care costs while accelerating the rate of uninsurance among the working population.
<p>
What this means, ladies and gentlemen, is that if you insist on building upon the current insurance system, inescapably this means that you must close it up even more, to adjust for these distortions, and increase the already heavy role of bureaucracy and the regulatory regime that governs it. It also means reducing doctors and hospitals to the status of even more highly regulated public utilities. I think this is logically inescapable if the basis for new reform is simply the current employer-based insurance system.
<p>
<b>Managed Competition.</b> With last year's collapse of the Clinton plan, several states are experimenting with the latest versions of "managed competition," establishing the managed care networks inspired by the theoreticians of the Jackson Hole Group.1<p>Let us consider the current trends in private, employer-based insurance. Right now, in too many boardrooms of corporate America, our colleagues in the business community are celebrating what they believe to be a triumph of the free market. We are witnessing a mass movement of employees into managed care networks. Now, the rate of acceleration is nothing short of breathtaking. In 1992, no more than 15 percent of all Americans were enrolled in health maintenance organizations. Today, 63 percent of all workers are enrolled in health maintenance organizations, PPOs, or other managed care plans.
<p>
While, in fact, many representatives of corporate America see this as a triumph of the market, it is nothing of the sort -- at least in the normal meaning of the market. Could you imagine a free market where there is no normal collision of the forces of supply and demand, even on the most basic level, which is the consumer purchase or sale of a commodity?  Could you imagine a free market where the customer of goods and services is an entirely different personality from the consumer of those goods and services?  Or could you imagine a free market where, for all practical purposes, the consumer of a good or a service has no property right in the commodity -- in this case insurance -- that is bought and sold?  Of course, you could not answer "yes" to any of these questions.
<p>
So it is really quite absurd to say that we are witnessing a triumph of the market when the consumer of the commodity -- in this instance, health insurance -- cannot personally buy it, when the consumer can have no property right in the commodity once it's purchased, and when the consumer cannot realize any personal savings in a free exchange by weighing the value of the commodity and the price to be paid for it.
<p>
The current mass movement to managed care, whether that form of care is a good idea or a bad idea, is not a triumph of the market. It is, however, the latest evolution of the current insurance system, which is a fundamentally distorted third-party payment system built upon a legally exclusive, tax-supported, employer-based model that frustrates consumer choice and competition.
<p>
<b>Consumer Demand and Consumer Choice.</b> In many instances, there is no consumer demand because, in fact, consumers are not even consulted by insurance companies about whether they would like to buy the product. Rather, corporate managers are deciding, for solid financial reasons relating to the company's bottom line, that they can no longer afford traditional indemnity insurance and are enrolling their workers in managed care plans. This is a transaction where the employer, not the employee, makes the key decisions and, at the same time, where the employer, not the employee, realizes the savings.
<p>
If the managed care plan is less expensive than the conventional corporate insurance plan, this amounts to a reduction in the worker's compensation. Too many Americans do not yet clearly understand this. The reason:  Too many Americans think, wrongly, that the employer's contribution to their company's health benefits package is the employer's money and not the employee's money. I personally know of no instance where corporate benefits managers are giving workers cash back in an amount equal to the difference, say, between the higher cost of last year's indemnity plan and the lower cost of next year's new managed care plan. Whatever the impact of the managed care revolution on the quality and delivery of health care services, this is very often an employer, not an employee, decision. This should be the subject of extensive congressional debate. Unfortunately, it is not; at least, not yet.
<p>
The new managed care revolution brings with it two related problems. One is economic. The other, more important problem is political.
<p>
In the transition from fee for service to managed care plans, there is likely to be -- and the preliminary studies bear this out -- a transitional savings to employers. The existing professional literature indicates that this is the case. The economic problem is that there is no guarantee that managed care, whether in the form of a staff model HMO or other managed care options, will contain long-term health care costs. According to a 1993 GAO report on the subject:  "Although many employers believe that, in principle, managed care plans save money, little empirical evidence exists on the cost of savings and managed care."
<p>
But that is not the most important problem. The more serious problem is political; and it is a political problem at the direct expense of managed care. Lest I be misunderstood, I am not an opponent of managed care. I am only saying that individuals should be personally free to choose or reject it, and that government policy on the issue should be strictly neutral. Managed care, in fact, is not being given a fair shot in the free market because there is no free market. This is bad for managed care. When employees are forced into managed care plans without other options, or against their will, they not only have been deprived of a choice of their health plan, but they also are deprived of their choice, in many instances, of a doctor or a medical specialist.
<p>
In other words, Americans will have even less choice over their health care decisions than they have today. If popular dissatisfaction with employer-based insurance grows -- as it surely will, especially with the higher number of uninsured and an expected rise in health care costs, which we may see again, perhaps at the end of this business cycle -- this popular dissatisfaction can threaten the entire private health care system.
<p>
Advocates of a Canadian-style system have had a rather difficult time selling the notion that monopoly is really good for you, or that government monopoly is even better. Or, as my colleague, <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm">Dr. Stuart Butler</a>, Heritage Foundation Vice President, suggests, try to imagine that your health care future is going to be bright and cheery when it is run by those thousands of eager public servants ready to answer your every call or help you with any question over the phone down at the local government clinic.
<p>
But advocates of the Canadian-style system can make an excellent case in saying, "You may not like the Clinton plan or its various congressional incarnations, and you may not like government-run health care, but at least, under a Canadian-style system, you will retain your right to a physician."
<p>
<b>The End of Private Practice?</b> That is, for most Americans, a powerful argument. It's a clincher. It can also mean the end of private health insurance, and I submit to you that if it's the end of private health insurance, it is really the end of private medical practice. Private practice cannot survive outside of private markets.
<p>
This morning, we have two physicians who are going to talk about this vital issue:  the doctor-patient relationship.
<p>
Kevin Vigilante, M.D., comes to us from the Miriam Hospital at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. He is the clinical partner in the Miriam Immunology Center. Kevin cares for women with HIV and started a community outreach clinic to provide health care to women coming out of prison. He has been the principal investigator in an NIH study to determine the effects of early treatment of HIV infection with AZT. He has also been the principal investigator on the Ryan White grant to provide HIV prevention and care. He has been the Director of Emergency Medical Services and Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine at Brown University. He has been the Director of Primary Care and Instructor of Medicine at Yale University.
<p>
Dr. Vigilante is a graduate of the Harvard School of Public Health and Yale University's Internal Medicine Department. His M.D. is from Cornell University. He got his master's degree in bacteriology from Wagner College, and he got his bachelor's degree at Johns Hopkins University in philosophy and political science. This past year, Dr. Vigilante ran for the U.S. House of Representatives against Congressman Patrick Kennedy, garnering 46 percent of the vote.
<p>
Sandra Mahkorn, M.D., serves as Chief Medical Officer of FHC Managed Care Health Services in Norfolk, Virginia. Before assuming that position, she was a Clinical Assistant Professor and Satellite Clinic Medical Director for the University of Wisconsin in the Wisconsin Medical School.
<p>
In the Bush Administration, she served in two capacities:  first, as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Health Policy of the Department of Health and Human Services between 1991 and 1992, and second, during the last several months of the Bush Administration, with Vice President Dan Quayle on the White House staff. She was an Associate Director for the President's Council on Competitiveness.
<p>
Before her White House appointment, Dr. Mahkorn was the lead physician at the Oxnor Clinic in New Orleans, Louisiana. She is a member of several medical associations and holds a master's degree from the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee in educational psychology and urban affairs and a master of public health degree from the Tulane School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine. She received her M.D. from the University of Wisconsin at Madison.
<p>
I turn you over to Dr. Vigilante.
<p>
<b>THE ETHICAL IMPERATIVE</b>
<p>
<b>KEVIN VIGILANTE:</b>  Thanks very much. It's great to be back here at the Heritage Foundation. It is always a pleasure to work with brilliant people, and I have been a fan of the innovative Heritage approach to solving our health care dilemma for quite some time.
<p>
I was asked to come and talk about the physician-patient relationship. I think it is probably the most precious thing we have in the practice of medicine. Most of us did not choose to do what we do because of money, but because of some other, more important sources of gratification. I think that in this whole national health care debate, the physician-patient relationship has not had adequate attention.
<p>
And it is undergoing a tremendous change. Go back to the Hippocratic Corpus, 2,500 years ago. We Hippocratics call it the Hippocratic Corpus because it was written by a number of different people. Hippocrates, the great Greek philosopher, only wrote a small portion of it, and like any piece authored by multiple people, it has its share of contradictions, inconsistencies, and differences in style.
<p>
But one thing throughout the entire Corpus is constant:  It is the physician's primary duty -- actually, his sacred duty -- to serve the patient. It puts the physician clearly in the servant role.
<p>
That is the ideal. Throughout ancient and modern history, that tradition endured right up until the present time. True, you can find exceptions, such as the Great Plague, where some of the best and brightest physicians fled the towns and cities to leave their patients behind to be cared for by lowly "plague doctors."  But that was an exception.
<p>
We all know physicians who are, perhaps, pompous and arrogant, and thus do not typify the notion of the servant. But, again, that is a deviation from the ideal.
<p>
Under this model, it is the patient's prerogative to leave the physician at will, for whatever reason, without explanation. But, ethically, it is not a reciprocal relationship. The physician can never leave the patient at will, or abruptly. That, according to the professional ethic and the law, is called abandonment. The physician must subordinate himself or herself to the needs of the patient in a service capacity.
<p>
What has happened recently, very recently, is that for the first time in the last 2,500 years, on a large scale, that relationship has started to change. In a very subtle, insidious, and somewhat unrecognized way, it is changing, and we are seeing corporate medicine, managed care medicine. It is a change from a dual relationship to a triadic relationship, where the physician is no longer employed by the patient. The physician is now employed by a corporate entity.
<p>
A physician has two functions in that regard. He has to care for the patient, but he also has to meet a financial or cost objective established by the corporate entity. So what was previously a very unambiguous relationship with the patient has become conceptually blurred. Where does the physician's loyalty lie?
<p>
Most of us, and most of our colleagues, are going to go on practicing largely the same as we did before. We have a strong feeling that the ethical imperative is to be responsible first to your patient. But like all such changes, at first imperceptible and insidious, these things have gradual influence, and in subsequent generations, I fear we are going to see a change in physician behavior. This is borne out, I think, most acutely or dramatically in the concept of futility. Somebody mentioned last night at dinner that the last few months of life are the most expensive when we're under care.
<p>
There is a raging debate in the realm of medical ethics called the problem of futility. When you have somebody who is in the last days and months of life, undergoing extraordinary methods of treatment, and the physician feels that this is futile care, that this will not change the ultimate outcome of this person's life, who has the right to withdraw treatment?  Is it the physician unilaterally?  Is it the physician in consultation with the family, particularly if the family wants everything done?
<p>
In the old model, you could have a debate as to whether the physician had some right in saying, "I'm not obliged to deliver all forms of treatment -- I can withhold some treatments based on professional judgment."  But now there is a third factor in this decision, not related to the physician's professional judgment as to whether this care is futile or in accord with the family's wishes. It's the pressure that the managed care corporation brings to bear.
<p>
Their bottom line is precious; and if the last six weeks, or six months, of care is responsible for the majority of their cost -- well, who is going to be making decisions about futility, and where are the pressures going to come from?  And when there is uncertainty, when do you come down on one side or the other?  This is very, very important ethical territory. We cannot avoid it.
<p>
So I am very concerned about the corruption of the physician-patient relationship. Again, let me just say one thing:  I am not anti-managed care and I am not anti-HMO. Some of my best friends work for HMOs, and they're good doctors. Harvard Health is in my territory, and I'd be proud to practice medicine there. It's good medicine. But you know, there's the good among HMOs, there's the bad, and then there's the ugly. And it's not always easy to tell, especially if you're a lay person, which is which, or what it's going to be five years from now.
<p>
<b>Personal Choice.</b> The solution to this problem, to this dilemma, is choice. Give the patient the choice of saying, "Yes, I want to be a part of that HMO and that doctor," or, "I don't. I would prefer to be a part of that HMO, or managed care, or PPO, or neither. I want to go to somebody else completely outside the managed care structure."
<p>
That is the essence of it. Because once you've done that, you've empowered the patient. He can make the decision as to how much ethical ground he's going to trade in for cost savings, and it's his choice. Right now, it's the employer's choice because the employer says, "Look, I'm getting the best deal from X Y Z managed care down the road. So you don't get so many MRIs. However they're doing it, I don't care. They're saving me money. That's who you're going with."  For employers and their doctors, that's a real problem.
<p>
The reason why employees don't have choice is simple:  the tax code. It is because the only way you can get a tax break is if your employer buys the policy for you. And that's nuts.
<p>
Most people still don't get it. They don't realize that right down there in the bowels of the system is this one small, invisible tax lesion. It's like a genetic error. It's very tiny; it's very small; but its effects are protean, and it's passed on from one generation to the next. Unless you identify that gene, you will not fix the disease.
<p>
But this is more invisible than any gene, because nobody is out there getting NIH grants to look for it. Unless you change the tax code, you're not going to fix this problem. And that's the importance of what the Heritage people were saying years ago:  "Fix this lesion."  If you do that, the American health care system will be in a position to pick up its pallet and walk.
<p>
The other thing that is very important is medical savings accounts (MSAs). MSAs provide an ethical, as well as financial, counterweight to corporate managed care because with an MSA, you are dealing, for much of your care, in cash, and cash goes anywhere. It's your choice as to where to bring it. Nobody says you can't go here or go there. It preserves the possibility of a fee-for-service environment and opens up possibilities for other forms of care. And it injects price competition, real price competition, into the marketplace. The only way a consumer can tell what something is worth economically is price. That's what prices are for.
<p>
So I conclude by warning that the traditional physician-patient relationship is under threat. This very emotional, precious relationship is under threat from a very arcane and technical marauder:  a few lines in the federal tax code. For too many policymakers, there is a cognitive disconnect here; you almost can't believe it. Unless we focus on it, we will not be able to heal our health care system or salvage the doctor-patient relationship.
<p>

<b>A MODERN FABLE</b>
<p>
<b>SANDRA MAHKORN:</b>  I'd like to tell you a story about Dr. Goodfellow, who lives and practices in Home Town, U.S.A. Dr. Goodfellow finished his internship in 1963 and set up a simple general practice. He hired a medical assistant and a receptionist and worked hard, often seeing as many as thirty-five to forty patients a day.
<p>
A large factory in Home Town shut down, and Dr. Goodfellow saw about five or six patients a day for free during the local economic crisis. Many of these were older and retired people, and he knew they'd have a hard time paying their bills.
<p>
Dr. Goodfellow knew his patients very well, and so did his medical assistant and his receptionist. He loved medicine, and he loved being his own boss, a trait that he had inherited from his father, who ran a small family grocery store. In the evening, Dr. Goodfellow often spent an hour or so going over books and catching up on his paperwork, and at the end of the day, he went home to find his two children watching "Leave It to Beaver" and to enjoy a good, home-cooked meal.
<p>
He worked long days, and sometimes nights, but he was happy. He felt good about what he did, and he knew his patients liked him and believed in him.
<p>
The years passed quickly. One morning after coming to the office, Dr. Goodfellow paged through his 1995 calendar. August 8 was a day he had circled in red. He would turn fifty-nine-and-a-half on that day, and he could withdraw money from his IRA without penalty. Should he retire?  He never thought he'd want to consider that option so soon, but things had changed.
<p>
"Oh, well. I'll think about it a little more," he decided. Then he grabbed his white coat and stethoscope, and entered the examining room of his first patient.
<p>
"Hello, Mrs. Adams. I'm Dr. Gatekeeper -- oh, I'm sorry. I mean, Goodfellow. I see you're a new patient with Happy Health HMO. Can I do anything for you today?"
<p>
Mrs. Adams pulled a long strip of paper from her purse. He sank onto the swivel stool, prepared for a long session. "Well, I've been seeing a dermatologist for this rash and an allergist for these awful sinus problems I have. And I have some urinary problems, so I see this nephrologist. So if you'd just write me some referrals, I'll be on my way."
<p>
"Why didn't the HMOs ever tell patients they'd have to get most of their care from a family doctor?"  thought Dr. Goodfellow. He resented being put in the middle.
<p>
Dr. Goodfellow's staff had grown with the years and the hassles, and he now employed a registered nurse, a file clerk, a receptionist, and a medical assistant. Besides that, he contracted with a billing service, an answering service, and medical transcriptionists. Not infrequently, he was forced to hire a lawyer. He was also forced to hire consultants to help him decipher new regulations, such as OSHA and CLIA.
<p>
Last year, the overhead alone was over 60 percent, and his income had dropped. Dr. Goodfellow now had time to see only about eighteen patients a day. Some days, it seemed as though the paperwork took the bulk of his time.
<p>
New Medicare regulations had just been published. "Well, I guess that interesting article on new treatments for rheumatoid arthritis will just have to wait," he thought. A few years ago, he had neglected to keep up with some regulations regarding Medicare billing, and several patients left his practice after receiving nasty-sounding letters from the federal government that made it seem as though he was fraudulently charging them.
<p>
He walked into the next exam room. Mrs. Williams hadn't noticed him come in at first. Her forehead was barely visible behind the latest issue of  . Dr. Goodfellow's mouth dropped a little bit when he read on the front cover of the magazine, "What Your Doctor Doesn't Know Can Kill You."  As Mrs. Williams slowly lowered the magazine that she had picked up in his waiting room, Dr. Goodfellow detected a sense of anxiety in her expression. After spending half an hour convincing her that he really did understand the side effects of Robitussin DM, he ordered all magazines removed from his waiting room except for   and  .
<p>
He was about to see his third patient of the day when the receptionist paged him to take a call. It took him twenty minutes to explain to Happy Health HMO's utilization review expert why Mr. Cardiac, a 52-year-old business executive in congestive heart failure and a four-day-old coma, wasn't a candidate for early discharge on a home respirator.
<p>
Even though his office staff had swelled, it seemed as though the number of things he was able to do in his office had dwindled to nothing. Last year, he discarded the strep screens he had been doing and placed his cholesterol monitor in storage after registering as a waivered lab under CLIA -- the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. He continued, however, to secretly perform Gram stains from time to time, something he had learned in medical school. In his heart, he felt he really had a right to provide that service to his patients.
<p>
He kept his microscope in a locked cabinet in a dark corner of his office. One day, a disgruntled employee discovered the Gram stain reagents he had forgotten to replace in the desk drawer and called the CLIA police. The next afternoon, an officious-looking gentleman stormed into his crowded waiting room flashing a badge, while anxious patients looked on. Intimidated, he escorted the surly inspector to his office. His microscope, a bottle of Crystal Violet, and his microbiology texts were all confiscated. "You know, you could be fined $10,000 for this," said the inspector as he bagged up the evidence.
<p>
Finally, it was lunch time. He grabbed a bagel that had been left by a drug detail man and jumped into his car. The hospital had called a meeting to discuss the new PHO they were forming. The idea sounded good until he read the fine print.
<p>
The afternoon schedule was almost as challenging as the morning's. Exhausted, he was about to leave the office when the hospital's patient advocate called. "Mrs. Macintosh was irate," she explained. "She insisted she had not given informed consent for the two metal staples to be used in place of the two silk ones after her laparoscopy. She's threatening to sue, and her attorney wants you to call him."
<p>
"Tell Mrs. Macintosh I'll speak to her about it in the morning," sighed Dr. Goodfellow wearily and apologetically.
<p>
Patient advocates. Every hospital has them now. "Strange," he thought. "There was a time I thought I was the patient advocate."
<p>
He shuffled into the den after a long ride home. His grandchildren were at first oblivious to his presence, watching "Beavis and Butt Head."  Finally, his granddaughter bounced onto his lap:  "Grandpa, guess what?  I've decided to become a doctor."
<p>
<b>The Moral of the Story.</b> The Dr. Goodfellow story illustrates several factors that have contributed to the disintegration and dissolution of the physician-patient relationship.
<p>
First, there has been a revolutionary transformation in the medical marketplace resulting in a dramatic shift in the way we interact and view ourselves in relation to our patients. The helping relationship has been replaced by a contractual relationship. Instead of doctor and patient, it is now provider and consumer.
<p>
Second, the third-party payer has taken on a directive role. Rather than passive players, as was the case with traditional indemnity plans, physicians and patients are the subjects of behavioral management strategies. Reimbursement schemes and monetary incentives are designed to elicit defined health care decision responses. Not only must the physician and patient consider the medical pros and cons of alternative treatment, but other factors must be considered. For example, should the 60-year-old woman who has been doing well on a particular blood pressure medicine that is no longer on her HMO's preferred drug formulary risk changing medications to avoid a higher copay?
<p>
Third, since PPOs and MCOs discourage or prohibit the use of providers not listed in their panels, the doctor-patient relationship has been supplanted by the patient-HMO relationship. It's no longer "my doctor," but "my HMO."
<p>
Fourth, the media have not been particularly kind to the physician. Perhaps it's the anti-authority inclination; perhaps it's a bit of muck-raking. Doctors are not above being questioned. Nor should they be immune to legitimate challenges. But the challenge often takes the form of an attack. Articles such as "What Your Doctor Never Learned in Medical School" abound and undermine former trust.
<p>
Finally, federal and state governments have stepped into the physician's office to regulate the practice of medicine. Under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, for example, physicians who choose to do a simple strep screen or read a Gram stain are faced with costly and burdensome regulatory requirements. Regulations promulgated under the guise of protecting the public too often have been the products of scientifically baseless political grandstanding. A 1994 study in the   found that strep screens could be performed by sixth graders, with an average IQ of 90, with 95 to 100 percent accuracy on the first attempt. Yet the government considers strep screens so complex a test for the physician that expensive regulatory burdens are required to protect the public.
<p>
There is probably no turning back, but where do we go from here?  As physicians, we must take an active role in deciding our futures. In many cases, we may be employees. But the health system can't function without us, and therein lies our strength. We have a responsibility to our patients to preserve their health care choices. And we have a responsibility to ourselves to preserve our decisionmaking options.

The Clinton Administration has set records for spending by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. And no wonder. The agency has helped rebuild some pretty expensive properties. Some $268 million of our tax dollars have gone to replace blown-down trees on golf courses, rebuild yachting marinas, and repair horse trails.

<blockquote>

	"Have allergies? Then you might want to move to Albuquerque. That city wants to stop the production of nasty pollen, so it as banned cypress, mulberry, elm, and male juniper trees. The prohibition becomes law later this year. A person can then get slapped with a $500 fine for planting, growing, importing, or selling such trees. Actually, experts say than the ban will have little effect on allergies, as people will get sensitized to other types of pollen."

(Perhaps for space considerations, perhaps because of Asian-money scandals, no yellow figure is represented.)"

<blockquote>


"Mike Wallace did a piece for the January 19th <I>60 Minutes</I> on the Ted Turner/Rupert Murdoch feud. 
<P>
"Murdoch wouldn't talk to him, so Andrew Neal (sp?), a former editor of one of Murdoch's London newspapers, served as the Murdoch expert. . . .
<P>
"Wallace: 'In the last election campaign Murdoch contributed more than a million and a half dollars to political candidates, most of them Republicans. . . . Which was obvious during the election campaign to readers of the [New York] <I>Post</I>. . . . And on Murdoch's new cable channel the news also comes with a conservative spin. . . . Ted Turner disdains all this. He believes Murdoch's political bias contaminates his news coverage.'
<P>
"Turner: '[Murdoch] looks down his nose at do-good, honest journalism. He thinks that his media should be used by him to further his own goals.' "

<H2>Dr. Ebonics</H2><br>
</CENTER>
<P>
<blockquote>


"Students can explore the link between the languages of African peoples throughout the diaspora in a course called Ebonics. 
<P>
"Ebonics has been portrayed over the years as slang, a corruption of English, or a minor subdivision of the English language. The course, which was formerly called Black English, will present Ebonics positively in the spirit of Afrocentrism. <P>
" 'Ebonics is rooted in the African experience; it is the result of African languages that have come in contact with European languages over many centuries,' said Professor Aisha Blackshire-Belay, Ph.D.. <P>
" 'Students will look at writings from educators, researchers and linguists in a critical approach to the issues, facts and evidence pertaining to the language of African people in the attempt to fully grasp the debate and controversy of the subject matter,' said Blackshire-Belay. <P>
"The renovated course is being offered through the African-American Studies department. It will be taught by Blackshire-Belay, an African-American studies linguist. <P>
" 'The primary aim of this course,' said Blackshire-Belay, 'is to provide an Africological approach to the observation of the cultural-linguistic continuity of African people throughout the world.' 
"According to Blackshire-Belay, the Ebonics course will be taught from an Afrocentric perspective and with the 'view that it is a language in its own right.' <P>
"The course will teach language performance skills and analytical methods developed by Blackshire-Belay and other leading Ebonics linguists and researchers. <P>
"The class is a three-credit, graduate level course, but undergraduate seniors may be admitted with the professor's approval. <P>
"The class is not a requirement for African-American studies majors, but it is for graduate students who are working toward doctoral degrees in the area of Ebonics. Ebonics will be offered every year and is becoming a very popular class. Students outside the African-American studies program have expressed interest in the course. <P>
" 'If given the chance I would take the course,' said junior Renee Williamson, a mathematics major. 'It's an opportunity to learn more about your people.' <P>
" 'It sounds interesting; if I wasn't in such a hurry to graduate, I would take it,' said senior Georgina Texeira, a computer science major."

<H2>President Looks for Babes</H2><br>

<P>
Date: Mon, 30 Dec 1996 15:11:42 -0700 (MST)<br>
From: lydia_bickford@ios.doi.gov<br>
Subject: opportunity for your views to be heard (fwd)<br>
<P>

The Clinton administration has asked its women political appointees, like me (Interior-Indian Affairs), to meet with women around the country as they travel. Since I am pretty well anchored to my desk, I am conducting the project by internet. Please let me know what's on your mind. It can be issues/concerns/good/bad/all of the above. I will need your name and mailing address so the White House can send you a thank you note. (Don't get nervous if it takes a while, I do the reports in my spare time and can't always get to them right away.) Your name will NOT be sold or given away. 
<P>
Please describe yourself briefly so I can do a short demographic paragraph in my report. Then tell me what you want the President to know. I write reports of your views which go to the White House Women's Office, President Clinton, and his top aides. It can be as long or as short as you like. There is no time limit on this project, but if you could get back to me in the next month or so, I would appreciate it. Please share this information with other women you think might be interested. (Not to worry, this is not a poll and other women appointees are meeting with groups of women personally. This is my way to reach more women.) . . .
<P>
Thank you for taking your time to do this. I truly appreciate it. It's a terrific project because of women like you who are willing to participate and help. Take care. I look forward to your responses. 
<P>
Lydia

"The Rev. Patrick J.

In a letter from Interior, Mr. Mahoney and members of the Christian Defense Coalition were warned they might be arrested if they showed up for Mr. Clinton's parade with pro-life signs.

<blockquote>



	"An outdoor display by the Penn State art department included a statue of the Virgin Mary resting within what appeared to be a grotto setting but which was actually female genitalia complete with surrounding pubic hair and emanating blood. When a priest from the Catholic campus ministry complained about this kitsch he was told the work was intended to bring attention to 'oppressed women in the church.' The 'artist' proved unable to explain what the placing of  a statue of Mary in this venue had to do with the oppression of women. While giving its blessing to what feminists celebrate as vaginal art, Penn State discourages nativity scenes as being contrary to the spirit of multiculturalism."

<h2>"No Child Is Unadoptable"</h2>
<b>by Charmaine Crouse Yoest</b>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<dd>
	Liberalism, the self-styled defender of children's welfare, harbors a myth that dehumanizes and threatens countless children every day. It is a myth embodied in a bureacratic label: "unadoptable." It is the assumption that, because some children are not wanted by their biological parents, they are wanted by no one.
<p>
<dd>	This myth fuels the tragedy of abortion. According to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, at least 13 percent of all women choosing abortion do so because they believe their unborn child suffers from some mental or physical disability. So who would want them? 
<p>
<dd>	This myth undermines an already troubled foster-care system, where thousands of children are officially classified "unadoptable" by their caseworkers. Children acquire this label for many reasons -- because of emotional problems, physical handicaps, or the color of their skin. In part because of this tag, 15,000 kids turn 18 each year while still in foster care.<p>

<p>
<dd>	Across the country, however, there are countless men and women disproving the unadoptable label every day. "There is a home for every child who is out there," says Brit Eaton, the executive director of an organization called Adopt a Special Kid (AASK) Midwest. Eaton's organization, which uses the Internet to match foster children with willing families, is one of a growing number of private organizations finding permanent homes for so-called special-needs kids -- older children, sibling groups, the severely disabled, the emotionally damaged, or those with life-threatening diseases.
<p>
<dd>	They are kids like Michael. He has the impish smile of an 11-year-old who does not like spinach. A profile of him available on the group's Internet Web site says that he was born with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, that he is a fifth-grader with attention-deficit disorder who doesn't read terribly well, and that he lives in foster care and a family "to provide him with the reassurance that he is loved and needed."	
<p>
<dd>Michael is followed by other faces and names -- Joe, Elliot, Rachel, Sherita -- all looking for a permanent home. Sherita, for example, loves to play dress-up and is wearing a party dress in her picture. Her little brother Antwan sports a bow tie. They clutch each other's hand tightly. Both were exposed prenatally to crack cocaine and then neglected after birth; Sherita was sexually abused.<p>
<a name="adopt"><b>Adopting the Net</b>

<p>
<dd>	Working with county social-service agencies across the country, AASK Midwest gathers information on foster children for whom the public agency hasn't found a home and enters the data into its database. Michael, Sherita, and the others are just a few of the kids listed on AASK's Web site (<a href="http://www.aask.org">http://www.aask.org</a>). Says Eaton, "Some of these kids know this is their only chance to find a family."
<p>
<dd>	Conducting the search nationwide increases the chance of finding a suitable family. AASK recruits families from all across the country to match with waiting children: It now has 973 children and 1,032 families in its database. It averages 100 assisted placements a year; since its founding 12 years ago, it has matched more than 1,200 families.
<p>
<dd>	The "Telemagic" software system AASK uses to match kids with families gives the group 21st-century tools, but its greatest strength is human, not technological: Twenty-two families in 14 states across the country serve as volunteer recruiters. All the AASK field representatives have adopted special-needs children, and many have adopted more than 10; 95 percent of them have adopted transracially.
<p>
<dd>	This personal involvement accounts for the agency's success. Field representatives are passionate about adoption, and they know what it takes to adopt a special-needs child successfully. Working in the field with prospective adoptive families, these volunteers provide both screening before the adoption and support afterwards.
<p>
<dd>	Such commitment permeates the organization. That's why AASK succeeds in finding homes for children when the public agencies fail, says Eaton. Many county workers still believe that special-needs children are unadoptable. Others are simply too swamped to spend the time looking for appropriate families for the children. "They are overloaded," says Eaton. "The social worker will tend to forget about the child if they are in an adequate foster-care situation."
<p>
<dd>	It costs AASK $2,500 on average to find a match for each child. In addition to its computer database, AASK maintains a Web site with pictures and biographical sketches of 20 waiting children. The list of children is changed monthly. The site is interactive and interested families can fill out an application on-line. AASK charges no fees for its services to adoptive families.
<p>
<dd>	AASK Midwest was established by Richard Ransom, the founder of Hickory Farms, a food company, after he met Bob and Dorothy DeBolt, who started the flagship organization in California. The DeBolts themselves  have adopted 20 special-needs children.
<p>
<dd>	"There are so many success stories; there's just a magic that happens in this business," Eaton says. "When a child wouldn't otherwise have any hope, finding them a placement is like scoring a home run."
<p>
<dd>	Patrick is one of those out-of-the-ballpark hits. Born drug dependent, he was completely nonverbal when he was adopted at three years old. A picture arrived on Eaton's desk recently: Patrick, with his mom. He is nearly unrecognizable as the sad baby Eaton remembers. Now, he is a happy, charming, chattering five-year-old, ready to start school.

<a name="kids"><b>A K.I.D.S. Exchange </b>

<p>
<dd>	As a child, Janet Marchese was scared to death of a man in her neighborhood -- a man known as "crazy Raymond" who, it turns out, had Down's syndrome. 
<p>
<dd>	The fear and ignorance she was taught as a child Marchese now confronts on a daily basis as the founder of A K.I.D.S. Exchange, which stands for "adoption, knowledge, and information on Down's syndrome."
<p>
<dd>	Literally a kitchen-table operation, Marchese and her husband, Louis, a retired New York City policeman, work tirelessly to match Down's syndrome babies with families who are willing to adopt them. With no outside funding except for a now-expired six-year grant from the John F. Kennedy Jr. Foundation, the Marcheses have used all of their resources to combat the myths about Down's syndrome. "When you're motivated," Marchese says, "you find ways."
<p>
<dd>	To support their efforts, Louis works as a plumber, while Janet has established herself as one of the top doll dealers in the United States. Everything they earn goes into their adoption work, especially monthly telephone bills that run into thousands of dollars, plus mailing and photocopying costs. 
<p>
<dd>	Their motivation comes from their own adopted son, T.J., who has Down's syndrome. Now 20 years old and a senior in high school, T.J. is a social butterfly and computer whiz who works part-time at a video rental store, writes for the school newspaper, and is going for his brown belt in karate. But when Janet and Louis first took him in as foster parents after he'd been abandoned at the age of three weeks, the social worker said he was unadoptable, incapable of walking or talking, and bound for an institution. "What a pitiful scenario," says Janet. "I was amazed at how bright he was and how wonderful he was."
<p>
<dd>	The Marcheses fell in love with T.J. and quickly moved to adopt him. Ensuring that other Down's syndrome babies weren't labeled unadoptable soon became their life's mission. "If I didn't exist," says Janet, "there would be a hundred more kids like him disappearing into institutions."
<p>
<dd>	Since the Marcheses launched their organization in 1976, they have orchestrated at least 3,500 adoptions of Down's syndrome children. Janet hears about babies who need homes and connects them with suitable families. With her nationwide network of contacts, she assists agencies that may never have handled a Down's syndrome baby and don't have the resources to find a home for the child. In more than 20 years of handling such adoptions, she has never seen a family regret adopting a child.	
<p>
<dd>Why are they so successful? Janet cites those large phone bills. She explains that when parents are distraught over discovering they have, or will soon have, a handicapped baby, they need individual counseling with someone who has gone through the same experience. Prospective adoptive parents, too, need this kind of personal attention. 	
<p>
<dd>"There's a lot to do with such a simple little thing as who answers the phone," she says. "People will call the social-service agencies and get turned off -- that's where we lose the success. The public agencies have limited budgets and a lack of enthusiasm. For them, it's a job. For us, it's our life."	
<p>
<dd>She has also excelled in her secondary goal: Dispelling the myths about Down's syndrome. "When I started, there were 20 kids for every parent," she says, "and now there are 20 parents for every kid."	
<p>
<dd> But much remains to be done. After receiving a prenatal test indicating Down's syndrome, a mother these days is still likely to be counseled to terminate her pregnancy or institutionalize the child. And agencies continue to classify Down's syndrome babies as unadoptable. "It's still those same people who are saying, 'Run for your life! It's Raymond!' " says Janet.

<a name="aids"><b>Children with AIDS </b>
<p>
<dd>	James Michael Jenkins began his life as Infant X, a racially mixed baby addicted to methadone, heroin, and cocaine. He had been abandoned at birth and had tested positive for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. The hospital that was his home couldn't even find a foster family for him. That is, not until Joy Jenkins, a nurse at the hospital who wanted to adopt a baby, came by one day.
<p>
<dd>	Like Janet and Louis Marchese, Joy  and her husband, Jim, soon found themselves in love with the little guy, adopted him, and then established an organization to help other children like him. For the last eight years, Jim Jenkins has been running the Children with Aids Project, mostly full-time, with minimal compensation.	
<p>
<dd>So far, the project has no major funding, but Jim remains optimistic. His aim is to develop a national endowment fund that would help defray the expenses of families who want to adopt infants with HIV.	
<p>
<dd>The project has undertaken a major fundraising drive. On September 16, Louie Rochon began a walking trip across the United States that will take him two years to complete, raising funds along the way for the children. They have raised $2,000 and hope to find a publicist to promote the walk in the coming months. Jenkins refuses to take any public grant money. "I'm a firm believer that private enterprise can come to the fore to solve social problems," he explains. 	
<p>
<dd>The Children with Aids Project also functions as an information exchange, not an adoption agency. Jim maintains a database of families interested in adopting HIV-positive children on a computer donated by Sears Business Systems. Rather than maintain files on waiting children, Jenkins focuses on recruiting families and then refers them to adoption agencies on a case-by-case basis. 	
<p>
<dd>The Jenkinses have recruited mainly through word-of-mouth, but the project has recently taken off through the Internet. Jim says their Web site has "just gone crazy," receiving more than 250,000 visitors from around the world. Since families pass through his offices on their way to an agency, Jim doesn't always know when he's been successful, but he does know that they have helped at least 60 children find homes since they began eight years ago.	
<p>
<dd>Jim wears two silver bracelets to remind him of two of those children, Laurie and Alexis, both of whom died of AIDS. Both children died, however, in the care of loving families. And that's what motivates Jim Jenkins in the face of hardship. "If you can find one home for one child," he says, "that's a victory."

<a name="pers"><b>Personal Commitment</b>
<p>
<dd>Each of these private groups is stepping in to fill a vacuum: Their work is a plea for the children that many parents are aborting on a daily basis. And their efforts are putting to shame the excesses of a government-run foster-care system that allows too many children to go through their childhoods without a permanent, loving home.	
<p>
<dd>Why are these groups successful, on such limited budgets, when the public agencies are not? The biggest reason is their personal commitment to the children -- their passion for helping kids find permanent families. In most cases, these activists know from personal experience what many government bureaucrats can never know: "There is no such thing as an unadoptable child," says Maureen Hogan, the executive director of AASK's advocacy office in Washington. "We can say that with no qualification."

<h2>Groups to Watch </h2></a>

<b>A Head Start for Charities</b>

<p>
<dd>There may be no such thing as a free lunch, but individual citizens, families, and companies interested in starting charities can now receive the required legal work absolutely gratis. Through its new "Counsel for Charitable Giving" program, the Washington Legal Foundation hopes to spur the formation of new philanthropic groups throughout the country. Setting up such tax-exempt institutions usually requires legal counsel and copious help filing forms with the IRS. The foundation, a nonprofit, public-interest law firm in Washington, D.C., is offering to provide free advice and the services of D.C. tax lawyer William J. Lehrfeld to people starting nonprofits.
<p>
<dd>	The activities and philosophy of such charities must be in accord with WLF's own principles: free enterprise, limited and accountable government, entrepreneurial spirit, and patriotism. Hoping to create more philanthropy overall, WLF has already fielded several dozen serious inquiries from would-be foundation founders.

<p><b>Education Reformers</b>

<p>
<dd>	Nobel laureate Milton Friedman and his wife, Rose, have started a new foundation bearing their names to promote "reform of elementary and secondary education by increasing competition through parental choice."	
<p>
<dd>The new group, headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, will champion education alternatives to public schools by sponsoring research on the benefits of such competition, raising public awareness, providing legal assistance to activists, granting money to parental groups and nonprofits, and maintaining a database of legislative developments. Friedman was one of the first advocates of vouchers that allow parents to choose among public, private nonsectarian, and private religious schools. <p>

<p>
<dd>	A new Washington-based foundation is launching a pair of programs "to renew the American character." Lamenting the isolation and moral relativism of modern American culture, the Tricentennial Foundation for America (TFA) seeks to promote civic virtue by creating "character-building programs for youth, family, and professional people in all walks of life." 
<p>
<dd>	One of the foundation's projects is an after-school program for youth called Tricentennial Clubs for America. The youth activities would combine volunteerism, recreation, mentoring by adults, and character education, often in partnership with existing service organizations like Rotary Clubs and Kiwanis Clubs.
<p>
<dd>	The foundation's second major project is a "calendar-based home-learning system" for promoting awareness of family history and reestablishing the family as the "primary stewards" of civic character. The program, called the Almanac for the American Family, allows households to "journal their current family events, document their family history, and reconstruct their roots with reference to American history and cultural customs and traditions."	
<p>
<dd>TFA hopes to establish a grassroots network of "resource centers" and communication links joining families to their local cultural, civic, and religious institutions.

<a name="tales"><h2>Cautionary Tales </h2><b>Young Thugs</b>
<p>
<dd>	Although the overall crime rate in New York City has declined dramatically in recent years, prosecutor Peter Reinharz notes that violent crimes committed by teenage predators have increased sharply. Reinharz blames this soaring teen crime wave on the New York state legislature, which passed and continues to preserve the Family Court Act governing juvenile justice in New York. This Act, with its anti-incarceration, pro-rehabilitation bias, "has made sure that a New York crime victim's suffering comes cheap."
<p>
<dd>	Under current New York law, the maximum sentence that 13- to 15-year-olds can receive for most crimes -- including many crimes of violence -- is 18 months of incarceration in a camp-like residential facility. In practice, even hard-core juvenile offenders guilty of reckless manslaughter or robbery serve no more than 10 months, while most car thieves usually get off with probation. (In New York, 16-year-old offenders are tried in adult criminal courts -- rather than in family court -- but the state's youthful-offender law authorizes judges to reduce their sentences sharply and expunge all criminal aspects of the case from their records.)	
<p>
<dd>New York law favors youthful offenders in other ways as well. For example, it denies family court judges the authority to issue search warrants and arrest warrants, so that if police retrieve a gun used by a 15-year-old mugger without a search warrant, lawyers for the offender (usually from the Legal Aid Society) can seek to suppress the weapon as evidence. And even if juvenile offenders are convicted, they are considered not to have committed actual crimes, but only "acts which, if committed by an adult, would be a crime." Since no crime was committed, juvenile offenders acquire no criminal record.	
<p>
<dd>According to Reinharz, "The philosophy behind the state's no-fault juvenile justice system" -- its emphasis on rehabilitation rather than punishment -- "might have made sense in the days when juvenile offenders stole apples and picked pockets, often driven by poverty. . . . But are the teen criminals in court today, almost nine out of 10 of whom are violent felons, really juvenile delinquents rather than criminals?"	
<p>
<dd>Reinharz argues that the New York state legislature's emphasis on rehabilitating youthful offenders is misplaced, since all the evidence indicates that authorities have had very little success in rehabilitating violent teens. He calls on the New York state assembly to emulate most other states and modify its juvenile justice code by lengthening sentences and trying violent teens in criminal courts at an earlier age. "Surely," he concludes, "it's time for our assembly leadership to get mugged by reality, as the expression goes, before the rest of us all get mugged in earnest." <p>

<a name="thought"><h2>Thoughts on Civil Society</h2><b>A New Model for Communities</b>
<p>
<dd>	The November-December 1996 issue of the <i>American Enterprise</i> addresses "Cures for Lonely Suburbs and Dying Cities." Journalist Philip Langdon describes a new trend in contemporary architecture and community development: The attempt to overcome the loneliness of conventional suburban life by returning to traditional community designs. "Traditionalist" community developers stress the importance of the public realm -- streets, sidewalks, parks and gathering places -- as a way of fostering a sense of community. In traditionalist developments, houses are built close enough together so that neighbors get to know each other, streets tend to be narrow to slow the flow of traffic, and most essential neighborhood services are accessible without cars.
<p>
<dd>	"This setting benefits children as much as adults," Langdon contends. Children have the opportunity to explore the neighborhood and develop a healthy sense of autonomy, while simultaneously enjoying the kind of adult supervision characteristic of traditional communities. By contrast, Langdon believes that conventional, automobile-dependent suburbs deprive children of the skills and judgment needed to manage unfamiliar situations.
<p>
<dd>	Today, about 100 traditionalist developments are in planning or under construction. Perhaps the strongest indication that the new traditionalist town "is more than a hobby horse for nostalgic visionaries" is the Walt Disney Co.'s decision to build an entire new community -- to be called Celebration -- near Orlando, Florida. Designed to house 20,000 people and costing $2.5 billion, "Celebration elevates traditionalism from the province of mostly small, local, and often contrarian developers to the realm of amply financed mainstream corporations."	
<p>
<dd>But what can be done to improve the neighborhoods of the overwhelming majority of Americans who do not live in traditional communities? Harvard professor Harvey Mansfield argues that neighborhoods can be improved by a renewed emphasis on "respectability." Littering, decorating public spaces with graffiti and begging are all instances of the breakdown of respectability. "It is wrong and undemocratic," Mansfield writes, "not to make the effort to gain our fellow citizens' respect."	
<p>
<dd>Robert H. Nelson of the University of Maryland believes that residents of inner-city neighborhoods should be allowed to privatize essential services. "Private inner-city neighborhoods could contract competitively for trash collection, street cleaning, and other services, bypassing expensive and ineffective municipal bureaucracies." Alan Ehrenhalt, editor of <i>Governing</i> magazine, regards neighborhood schools as the engine of neighborhood renewal.
<p>
<dd>	Robert B. Hawkins Jr. of the Institute for Contemporary Studies believes that, "Washington and the state capitals must return real authority to citizens in the form of charter schools, tenant ownership, and governance of public housing projects, and the like." And traditionalist developer Henry M. Turley Jr. believes in returning to "older, traditional ways of building communities [that] were often more wholesome, comfortable, and efficient" than their modern counterparts.	
<p>
<dd>But it's not only community developers who are concluding that in many respects the past was better than the present. Fred Siegel, a professor at the Cooper Union in New York City, writes, "If we could simply return our older cities to the conditions they enjoyed before Lyndon Johnson declared 1965 'The Year of the Cities'. . . it would be considered an historic achievement." The massive failure of the urban-renewal programs begun during the 1960s has led to a radical rethinking of how best to help the urban poor. Instead of pouring billions of taxpayer dollars into an ineffective social service bureaucracy, the emphasis now is on fostering business-financed inner-city economic growth.	
<p>
<dd>Currently, the most important sources of such economic growth in New York are in retailing and niche manufacturing. "It would be a happy conjunction of forces if some of the workers in these new manufacturing jobs could come from the ranks of those scheduled to be moved off AFDC by the 1996 welfare reform bill," concludes Siegel. "But that will be a difficult task."	
<p>
<dd>The task would be much simpler, writes Joel Kotkin, if our large and poorly governed urban mega-jurisdictions were broken up into smaller political units. And, in fact, "regional secession movements" exist throughout California, in the New York boroughs of Queens and Staten Island, and even in Kansas. In Los Angeles, that hotbed of contemporary urban secessionism, both conservative and liberal politicians endorse the general right of cities or school districts to secede.
<p>
<dd>	Secessionism is popular, argues Kotkin, because governing can be done far more flexibly, quickly and intelligently in smaller jurisdictions. "When city deficits mounted in L.A.," he writes, "the city council raised city taxes and fees. The smaller cities, in contrast, responded by slashing fees to provide businesses with incentives to expand, while putting the lid on city spending."	
<p>
<dd>As a result, the unemployment rate in small cities adjacent to Los Angeles, such as Burbank and Glendale, is much lower than in its giant neighbor, and while major corporations have been fleeing Los Angeles in droves, its smaller neighbors are experiencing a massive business expansion fueled by such firms as Time Warner, Disney, and NBC. "The comparative fortunes of these smaller cities and the big city of Los Angeles," he concludes, "is telling evidence of the benefits of devolving political power to a more local level than most current city boundaries allow." <p>

<h2>Innovations in Public Safety</h2>

<p>
<dd>	Like many conservative state policy groups, the Pioneer Institute for Public Policy, in Boston, Massachusetts, sponsors an annual competition for "better government." Recently it honored 10 innovations in public safety, its category for 1996. These state and municipal government initiatives and nonprofit projects, many of them in Massachusetts, include the following:<blockquote><b>Alliance All Purpose</b> (Mass.)  --  A group home for adolescent boys that seeks to "channel the energy and ambitions of troubled youth into the mainstream through manual labor and entrepreneurship."<p>

<h2> A Union Leader Betrayed </h2>
<b> By Aaron Steelman </b>

<hr width=50%></center>

<p>
<dd>
Before the last election, the AFL-CIO, under the direction of its president John Sweeney, spent nearly $40 million lobbying on behalf of candidates who wished to expand the size and scope of government. It was the most ambitious political program the AFL-CIO had ever undertaken. It was also one at odds with the vision that labor pioneer Samuel Gompers had for the union movement. 
<p>
<dd>	Gompers was born in London in 1850. His formal education ended at the age of 10, when poverty forced him to leave his neighborhood's Jewish school and find work in the shoemaking business. He quickly grew tired of that trade and coaxed his father into teaching him cigarmaking. But even with the addition of Samuel's income, the family was unable to make ends meet. So in 1863, the Gompers family, like thousands of other European families of that period, secured passage to New York. In America they didn't expect to find a handout, but rather the opportunity for a better life. 
<p>
<dd>	Gompers soon began work in a New York cigarmaking factory. He was instrumental in the founding of the National Cigarmakers Union and served as its vice president for four years. In 1881, the cigarmakers joined several other unions in creating the Federation of Trades and Labor Unions of the United States and Canada.	
<p>
<dd>In 1886, the federation was reorganized and renamed the American Federation of Labor (AFL). Gompers was elected president and paid a yearly "salary" of $1,000. He quickly proved himself capable and, with the exception of 1895, was annually reelected president until his death in 1924. During that period -- as the AFL's membership grew to more than 4 million -- real wages increased, work weeks shortened, and working conditions improved in industry after industry. 	
<p>
<dd>Although he supported such legal protections as child-labor laws and general liability laws for employers, he favored union bargaining power over government regulation as a means to advance the economic standing of wage earners. As historian Florence Calvert Thorne has written, Gompers thought that "by joining hands with like-minded workers," laborers could increase their "bargaining strength for higher wages which could make more material comforts available." That, coupled with "personal freedom and self-dependence, would help them to be alert and responsible citizens of their community."<p><b>A Nonpartisan Union</b>

<p>
<dd>	From the beginning, Gompers was wary of embroiling the AFL in politics of any kind, partisan or otherwise. He had seen a rival labor organization -- the Knights of Labor -- implode over faulty political alliances and feared that the same thing could happen to the AFL. More fundamentally, he believed that government activism was harmful to the working man. 	
<p>
<dd>In 1915, he wrote, "Doing for people what they can and ought to do for themselves is a dangerous experiment. In the last analysis the welfare of the workers depends upon their own private initiative." He applied that belief to issue after issue.
<p>
<dd>	He argued that "compulsory sickness insurance for workers is based upon the theory that they are unable to look after their own interests and the state must interpose its authority and wisdom and assume the relation of parent or guardian. There is something in the very suggestion of this relationship and this policy that is repugnant to free-born citizens."
<p>
<dd>	As for welfare programs, Gompers believed that "social insurance cannot remove or prevent poverty." Moreover, he maintained that welfare is "undemocratic" because it tends "to fix the citizens of the country into two classes, and a long established system would tend to make these classes rigid." 
<p>
<dd>	Gompers also worried that welfare would undermine the ethic of self-responsibility. As early as 1915 -- 20 years before the enactment of Social Security -- he stated, "Whether as a result of laziness or incompetency there is a steadily growing disposition to shift responsibility for personal progress to outside agencies. What can be the result of this tendency but the softening of the moral fiber of the people?" 	
<p>
<dd>Undoubtedly, he would have disapproved of the modern regulatory state as well. In an article for the <I>American Federationist</I>, Gompers argued that "regulation of industrial relations is not a policy to be entered upon lightly -- establishment of regulation for one type of relation necessitates regulating of another, until finally all industrial life grows rigid with regulation." And when asked in 1916 if he favored a law mandating an eight-hour day, he remarked, "Do you know where the eight-hour law in California originated? It was started by the Socialist Party of California." For Gompers, a fierce critic of the American Socialist and Communist parties, that seemed be a sufficient response. 
<p>
<dd>	Samuel Gompers's lifelong devotion to both the union movement and Jeffersonian political principles improved the lives of millions of working men and women. He rightly deserves to be called the greatest friend labor has ever known.

<b>Newt Comes To His Own Defense</b><br>
	Speaker Newt Gingrich came to his own defense in his high-profile ethics controversy over the weekend. It was typical Newtoutspoken, brilliant on certain points, and almost certainly ill-advised. His brash remarks at a town-hall meeting served only to keep the controversy on the front pages. As Rep. Peter King (R., N.Y.)  put it: Gingrich "needs to be smart enough to realize that he's got to end this. He needs to stop talking about what happened and move on." Still, Gingrich was certainly correct to make the following points:<p>

Democrats have thrown dozens of bogus accusations at him, and there should be some penalty for bringing frivolous complaints to the ethics committee.
<p>
The media have been out to get Gingrich, and they have upheld a double standard that lets Democrats get away with anything while Republicans are held to the highest possible ethical scrutiny. 
<p>
But Gingrich is on shakier ground when he defends himself from the charge that he deceived the ethics committee: "I trusted the law firm to have done the job [of advising him] right. They didn't do the job right and I didn't catch them, so I thought the most honorable thing to do when you have done something wrong is to say 'This was a mistake.' " Here is a brief primer to considering the crucial question of whether or not Gingrich lied deliberately: 
<p>
	In Newt's favor is some substantial circumstantial evidence, which has led us to conclude, as we say in our latest issue, that "the distractions of other business, and the absurd multiplicity of the charges brought against him by Democratic hell-hounds, plausibly explain the misinformation he gave Congress."
<p>
	The question, of course, is whether Newt meant to mislead the committee by telling it that GOPAC had nothing to do with the development of his college course. In letters on December 8, 1994 and March 27, 1995 Gingrich said, erroneously, that GOPACcentral to the development of the coursehad nothing to do with it. But in an October 4, 1994 letter Gingrich had admitted that GOPAC was involved in the course. This is fairly compelling evidence that the misstatements in the letters were honest mistakes. 
<p>
	Newt was terribly busytrying to run a revolutionat the time the erroneous letters were sent, and it is reasonable conclude he didn't have time to review them thoroughly, and just trusted his lawyers (after all he was paying them, as he said the other day, to get things right). 
<p>
	It would be monumentally stupid to think he could actually get away with lying to the committee. 
<p>
But there is some evidence the other way, which is why committee counsel James Colein effect, Newt's prosecutor, whose job was to put as harsh a light on Newt as possibleconcluded it reasonable to think Gingrich deliberately lied:
 <p>
	Gingrich had a motive. When he sent the October 4 letter the committee was asking him whether congressional funds had been used to develop the course. At that point, GOPAC's involvement was exculpatory. But the next two letters were focused on tax questions. At this point the involvement of GOPAC, a frankly partisan group, was a liability for Gingrich, and it would have made sense for him to deny that it had anything to do with the course. In other words, denying GOPAC's involvement, if a mistake, was a convenient one. 
<p>
	The letters made several statements that GOPAC had nothing to do with the course. The references would have been hard to missespecially considering they went to the core of the committee's investigationand Gingrich was the only one reviewing them for accuracy. 
<p>
	In September 1996 the ethics committee expanded its inquiry into the question of whether or not Gingrich mislead it. Nonetheless, Gingrich wrote in a letter last October 31 that the letters in question were accurate. As Ethics Committee member Steven Schiff (R., N.M.) said: "One would have thought when we pointed out the letters, he would have read them. And if something was wrong you thought he would bring it to our attention. But he did not. Instead he sends us a letter repeating what he said before. He doesn't see anything wrong. Well, that makes it tough for us to understand that in fact this is as innocent as some people would have us believe." (Schiff, however, seems to say the misstatements were honest errors.) 
<p>
It wasn't until Nov. 13 that Gingrich, testifying under oath before the ethics subcommittee, acknowledged the mistakes, and only after prodding. Cole said: "it was not that he just walked in, recognized everything was inaccurate and explained it right off the bat to the subcommittee. . . . [Gingrich] ultimately didafter questioning and . . . showing him documents and things of that naturedid acknowledge that there were inaccurate" statements. 
<p>
	Stay tunedbecause, unfortunately, the Gingrich controversy isn't finished yet.

<b>White House Lies, Cont.</b><br>
It's just the latest exercise in mendacity from a White House that has mastered it. All along the Clinton Administration has alleged that it didn't know that Webster Hubbell was retained by the Lippo Group in 1994 when he was desperately in need of cash. There is an appearance here that the purpose of the deal was to encourage Hubbell to keep his mouth shut about the Clinton scandals. Hubbell denies it, and the White House had been pleading ignorance. Now it turns out that Clinton advisor Bruce Lindsey was indeed aware of the arrangement back in 1994. Other recent White House lies, as documented in Friday's <I>Washington Post</I>, include the canard that Lippo big-wig James Riady and fund-raiser John Huang visited the White House for "social chats" and that Vice President Al Gore was unaware that the event he attended at a Buddhist temple in the Fall was actually a fund-raiser. The source of both the Hubbell and RiadyHuang deceptions was Lindsey, who seems to be the White House point man on feeding lies to the press; needless to say, he is a very busy man.
<P>
<b>O.J.'s Reality</b><br> 
Take a break for a moment from politics to consider the extraordinary closing arguments in the O. J. Simpson case. O.J.'s lawyers basically maintain that they know the evidence against the football star was tainted, they just don't know how. "The picture that we have," said O.J. lawyer Robert Blasier, who from his wheelchair looked like one of those bizarre Christopher Walken villains from the movies, "is a picture of corruption, of contamination, of planting, tampering, and we don't have all the paint. We're not going to be able to paint you a complete picture of that." Oh, OK. According to the Simpson defense, we live in a strange unaccountable world where things aren't what they seemeven if there is nothing to indicate they are anything different from what they appearand even if no one can say what exactly things are if they aren't what they appear. Got it? The jury gets the case Monday, and hopefully it will strip O.J. of everything he has, including those fancy shoes we never owned.

<b>Sexual Politics, 1997</b><br>
Reporters have been belatedly asking feminists why they're not supporting Paula Corbin Jones when they were so vehement in their support for Anita Hill. The subtext: Could it be that their stance on sexual harassment depends on the politics of the person being accused? The resulting squirming by feminists has been a delightful spectacle. According to today's <I>Washington Times</I>, feminist grande dame Betty Friedan explains that Mrs. Jones doesn't have a case because "she wasn't killed. She wasn't harassed [for her rejection of then-Gov. Clinton's alleged advances]. She wasn't fired. Her boss wasn't told to get rid of her." Mrs. Jones, Friedan explains, is a gold-digging bitch. Hmmm . . . sounds like blaming the victim to us. There's just one problem with Mrs. Friedan's attempted justification: It applies to Anita Hill too. Better go back to the drawing board. (That goes double for the woman who wrote in to the <I>New York Times</I> yesterday that Jones shouldn't be taken seriously because she waited until after Clinton was president to file charges. Hill waited for TEN YEARS, until Clarence Thomas had achieved prominence; Jones told friends about her alleged incident immediately and filed charges soon after her name appeared in print as a Clinton lover.) 
<P>
<b>The Language of Life</b><br>
Richard Cohen's column today notes that Fr. Richard John Neuhaus, editor of <I>First Things</I>, "is no marginal figure" because he is a "frequent contributor to <I>National Review</I>." We're flattered, we guess, but we wish Mr. Cohen's foray into the <I>First Things</I> controversy were not merely another tired lament about the "extremism" of anti-abortion rhetoric and how it encourages violence. Now <I>First Things</I>, of course, published a symposium in 1994 on why violence in the anti-abortion cause is wrong. But obviously no amount of such condemnations will satisfy pro-choicers. Nor is their concern really for civil debate: when's the last time the Cohens of this world spoke out against coat-hanger imagery, or the contemptible suggestion that men shouldn't be allowed to take a pro-life stand? No, what they want is for pro-lifers to stop making the allegedly dangerous claim that abortion takes a human life. The other side's rhetoricthat the fetus is just a bunch of protoplasm, for instancehas dangerous consequences too, as the Delaware infanticide case demonstrates. The difference is that the pro-abortion rhetoric is false.
<P>
<b>Truth in Labeling</b><br>
By the way, since the label "anti-choice"whose crudity takes the breath awayhas become more or less universal among apologists for feticide describing anti-abortionists, with no less than Al Gore using it in his NARAL address yesterday, isn't it about time we all started calling them pro-abortion?

<b>More DNC Chutzpah</b><br>
Hey, guess what, the Democratic National Committee is no longer going to take contributions from foreign nationals or the American subsidiaries of foreign corporations! Just where are all the Buddhist nuns going to go with their big political donations now? The renewed attempt by the DNC and the White House to get on the side of the angels on campaign finance is just another example of Democratic shamelessness on this topic. The White House has, all along, absurdly maintained that the DNC is some alien entity to which it bears no relation whatsoever. In fact, Bob Woodward reported in his latest book that the White House was essentially directing the production of DNC advertisements (which is illegal, by the way). Asked recently by the <I>Washington Post</I> how the White House could claim such distance from the DNC when it appointed the DNC's top two officials, Gore made a long pausethinking, thinking really hardthen said: "The DNC is a different entity from the campaign, and that's a fact." Uh-huh. We'll believe that as readily as Gore's initial claim that he thought his fund-raiser in a Buddhist temple was really a community outreach project. (He recently had to back down from that misstatement.) 
<P>
The worst part of the Democratic offensive on campaign-finance reform is the push it is giving the McCainFeingold bill. Just finished savaging campaign-finance laws, the Democrats now want to shred the Constitution via this misguided tangle of new election regulations. "It is tough, it is balanced, it is credible," is how Clinton plugged the bill in a recent speech to the DNC. Save us from the talk of new laws, please, until you have an interest in obeying the current ones.

<b>Newt: It's Not Over Yet</b><br>
The House Tuesday voted to reprimand and impose a stiff $300,000 penalty on Speaker Newt Gingrich. But this might not be the end to the Gingrich ethics scandal. The newest issue is whether he will pay the fine from personal or campaign funds. If Gingrich were to pay the $300,000 with campaign donations it would be another PR disaster that might again put his speakership in doubt. Notable is the shot House Republican Conference Chairman John Boehner -- who has otherwise been a reliable Gingrich defender -- fired across the Speaker's bow the other day. Even though Gingrich is still undecided on how to pay the fine, Boehner said he should pay it out of personal funds -- an amazing, if subtle, public signal.
	Gingrich needs to be cautious, as independent counsel James Cole's suggestion that he intentionally lied to the Ethics Committee -- and the unprecendented $300,000 penalty -- have rattled  House GOP members' faith in their leader: 
<P>
	Rep. Mark Sanford (R., S.C.) said he feels as though he was "sold down the river" by leaders who pushed him to vote for Gingrich for Speaker before the Ethics Committee report was in. Said Sanford: "There was a uniform chorus within the Republican Conference that said what we're talking about is nothing serious, a speeding ticket. I have yet to see a $300,000 traffic violation." Sanford added, speaking of his children: "I will not say to them, 'I want you to grow up to be like Bill Clinton or Newt Gingrich.' . . . I don't want my son to have to sell his soul for personal power." 
<P>
Said Rep. Jay Dickey (R., Ark.): "I'm having some difficulty placing it in the minor category; $300,000 is a lot of money."
<P>
 Rep. Sue Kelly commented: "For that size a fine, it's a sign that the committee wanted to send a message. I wish we had that information before we had to vote." 
<P>
Rep. Steve Largent (R., Okla.) complained that he felt as though Republicans were misled by their colleagues on the House ethics sub-committee, who wrote a crucial letter before the vote for Speaker saying they knew no reason why they couldn't support Gingrich's election. Asked if he would vote for Gingrich again, Largent replied, "I really don't know the answer to that question. That is why this is such a difficult issue. Is this the guy that should be leading the Republican conference and the House of Representatives? I sure have some reservations, serious reservations."
<P> 
Rep. Tom Coburn said of his vote for Speaker: "I'm sorry that I had to vote at all." (All quotes courtesy of <I>The Hotline</I>, a daily political newsletter.) 
<P>
So far Gingrich has managed to walk a political tightropea plea bargain with the committee, a big assist from Jim McDermottto maintain his grip on the Speakership. The GOP reaction to the Cole report indicates he still has some tough balancing to do, especially when it comes to the question of how he will pay his fine. And, of course, through it all Democrats will continue to bay like wolves for the Speaker's hide. They still might get it.

<b>Skeleton at The Feast</b><br>
D.C. has been absolutely inundated with Democrats this weekend. You couldn't spit without hitting one, and believe us, we frequently wanted to. . . . In a passage of his Inaugural address that's sure to escape much comment, President Clinton promised an America where the streets would be filled with the sound of children's laughter because nobody would be shooting them or trying to sell them drugs. If Clinton could actually accomplish these and sundry other feats he promised, we shouldn't have made him Presidenthe would already be God. Many, perhaps most people would respond to this criticism that the President was articulating a worthy ideal, and that's what ritual oratory is for. Perhaps. But an ideal is abstract, not concrete; a principle, not a situation. And ideals are meaningless without practical plans to approach them. The fact that saccharine such as the President today served is what Americans now expect from great political oratory is an indictment of the sensibilities of the day.

<b>The Further Adventures of Jacob Heilbrunn</b><br>
Jacob Heilbrunn, author of "Theocon v. Neocon" (the primary target of Ramesh Ponnuru's "Con Job" in <I>NR</I>'s latest issue) responds to some of his critics in the new edition of the <I>New Republic</I>. The response is characteristically poor. Having insisted without evidence in the original article that Catholic intellectuals like Fr. Richard John Neuhaus, Robert George, and Russell Hittinger are out to make America a "Christian nation" politically, he now allows that "perhaps" this was wrongwhile insinuating that it's not a very important point. Nor did he mean to suggest that Neuhaus was an anti-Semite. Oh no, he was just criticizing attempts to read Catholicism into the Constitution. Again, he has provided no evidence that anybody is doing that, for there is none. And if his point was narrowly constitutional, why the closing attack on Fr. Neuhaus's defense of the Southern Baptist resolution on converting Jews? We may have more to say on this at a later date. For now, we'll just note the obvious: having repeatedly lied <I>in</I> his article, Heilbrunn is now lying <I>about</I> his article.

<b>Big MaxTax Attack</b><br>
In Tuesday's <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, Stephen Moore picks up on a brilliant idea of Alan Reynolds (full disclosureboth men are on <I>NR</I>'s masthead): the alternative maximum tax. Liberal attacks on tax reform have centered on the harm it would allegedly do to middle-class families by removing breaks and flattening rates. Why not deflect that attack by introducing a flat tax as an option for taxpayers? Anyone who wanted could pay taxes under the current system, itemizing all deductions. Or taxpayers could opt for a 25 per cent flat tax (minus a tax credit for payroll tax payments to prevent double taxation). Call it the MaxTax. In addition to its political advantages and intellectual elegance, the idea of injecting choice into the tax system would also offer significant policy advantages: the messy and complicated "transition issues" that have bedeviled technical analysts of the flat tax would disappear. Instead of having to phase out various deductions, a market-like system would make those deductions less and less relevant as taxpayers opted out.

<b>LibertarianismII</b><br>
The American Enterprise Institute hosted a panel discussion of Charles Murray's <I>What It Means to Be a Libertarian: A Personal Interpretation</I> Tuesday. Moderated by James Glassman, the panel included heavy-hitters Robert Bork, Irving Kristol, and Michael Novak. The discussion was fascinating, and entertaining: Novak read a poem comparing Charles Murray to dance king Arthur Murray, for instance. Kristol and Bork were the most critical. Bork focused on Murray's claim that individuals own themselves and its implications on drugs, pornography, and suicide. Kristol argued that Murray's rosy view of human nature overestimates the likelihood that harmonious communities will spontaneously form. So far, so arguable. Kristol's next points, however, seemed weaker. Against Murray's claim that freedom is necessary for "a fully human life," Kristol argued that in fact many voluntary surrenders of freedom (as in marriage) are necessary. Against the notion of self-ownership, Kristol said that we are all initial public offerings (IPOs), and would if lucky be oversubscribed: "No one owns himself, unless he is very unlucky." Lastly, he argued that communities can't exist without standards that would restrict libertyin some cases, through social sanctions fiercer than law. These arguments suffice to refute a Rousseauvianism that defines freedom, as it were, sociologically. ("Autonomy" is a better word for this concept, central to modern liberalism.) Against Murray's Burkean libertarianism, however, these arguments are beside the point, because he defines freedom as the absence of coercion strictly defined. Social sanctions may be on occasion more psychologically compelling than the use or threat of force embodied in the law, but the two are formally distinguishable for the purpose of moral analysis. Kristol is unquestionably righti.e., no one would question himwhen he says that communities have to shape character. But Murray's argument isn't about what functions must be performed in a society but about specifying which institutions should perform them. Kristol and Bork may be able to win that argumentwhen talk turned to concrete applications like local censorship regimes, they seemed to have Murray on the runbut first they have to engage it.
<P>
<b>Democrat Dreams</b><br>
E.J. Dionne's Monday column argues that a role reversal of sorts has taken place: liberals are just bursting with new ideas, while conservatives are the dispirited salesmen of "tired ideas." His evidence for the former claim: a conference last weekend with liberal thinkers Theda Skocpol, Stanley Greenberg, William Julius Wilson, and Alan Brinkley. Now it's true that liberals have shed the former complacency and grown more sophisticated in "trying to change the direction of the political debate" (Dionne), having learned from the Kristol family and other conservatives. But what's in the cupboard? Skocpol is quoted saying that two-parent families are ideal, while "single-parent families" are "second-best necessities." Greenberg argues that government programs , especially social-insurance programs, should be pitched to middle-class families. Brinkley says that big government has historically helped make America great. Wilson wants government to improve interracial unity by focusing on "problems" like "job security, wages, escalating medical and housing costs, public education, crime and drugs." None of these ideas is new. What's true in Skocpol's comments is trivial and obvious. Social democrats like Wilson have been arguing for a race-neutral panoply of new programs since the '60s. Greenberg's middle-class entitlement strategy dates back at least to the New Deal. Liberal historians and their readers have been making their arguments since time was. We don't have any particular enthusiasm for "new ideas," most of which turn out to be bad. But Dionne hasn't found any to worry about.
<P>
<b>On The Other Hand</b><br>
<I>The Washington Post</I> op-ed page does have at least one bright spot today: Henry Kissinger lays out a level-headed case for NATO expansion, and against making Russia a de facto member of the alliance.

<b>Libertarianism Pro And Con</b><br>
Two reviews of Charles Murray's new book, <I>What It Means to Be a Libertarian: A Personal Interpretation</I>, appeared Monday, one by Michael Barone in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> and one by Daniel Casse in the <I>Weekly Standard</I>. Both are thoughtful, incisive writers affiliated with the Right. Barone's review (also of David Boaz's <I>Libertarianism: A Primer</I>) is mostly positive, but raises the question of whether a libertarian polity can defend itself from attacks, both internal and external. A deep and searching question. Casse's review is more critical. It is also, we must say, uncharacteristically disappointing. Too much of Casse's critique of libertarianism is simply that it doesn't poll well. On Social Security and Medicare, he writes, "There is, as the last election proved, no demand to abandon them wholesale outside of libertarian intellectual circles." Americans like paternalism, he argues, citing recent welfare-reform efforts as an example. We'd quibble with that examplepublic pressure may have forced reform, but the power of the welfare bureaucracy and its allies influenced the direction those reforms have taken. But more to the point, the popularity of a program is not relevant to an inquiry into the truth of the philosophy from which that program derives. Casse accepts James Q. Wilson's dictum that government always gets "bigger, more complicated, more burdensome, and more costly." Murray, Casse argues, doesn't confront "this unavoidable truth about government. . . . The sheer magnitude of the problems that government now fumbles with may militate against the voluntary and private solutions that worked during the early part of this country's history." Now in fact libertarians have devoted a lot of attention to this particular argument; a refutation of it is a focus of Richard Epstein's <I>Simple Rules for a Complex World</I> and a muted theme of the conclusion to <I>The Bell Curve</I> (which Murray wrote with the late Richard Herrnstein). Indeed, Barone's review quotes Boaz making the counter-arguments: that increased social complexity makes attempts at government control more and more futile; that complex systemsecological, economic, socialcan be self-ordering. The <I>Weekly Standard</I> seems to have an anti-libertarian streak. We look forward to the day it publishes a cogent critique of libertarian political philosophy. (For an example of one, see Robert P. George's essay in <I>National Review</I>'s 40th anniversary issue.)

<b>Cheap Shot</b><br>
In recent weeks, both Robert Novak and the American Conservative Union, led by David Keene, have referred to Laura Ingraham as an "alleged" conservative because she has questioned whether Rep. Dan Burton is the right man to lead the House investigation into Whitewater and related matters. This is childish. Whether or not Ingraham was correctand she is hardly alone in having reservations about Burton's judgmenther conservative credentials are impeccable. One could just as fairly, and just as foolishly, excommunicate Mr. Novak (for his Perotista views on campaign-finance reform) or Mr. Keene (for his years of subservience to Bob Dole).

<b>It Takes a Village To Have an Abortion</b><br>
It crops up all the time in discussions of abortion, this notion that the choice is best left to "a woman, her doctor, her conscience, and her God." That last was Colin Powell's formulation, but other variants are common. In Garry Wills's New York Post column today, for instance, he writes that most Americans "want the decision to be made by the women involved, with the help, ideally, of family and doctors and religious pastors." It never seems to occur to people who talk this way-and who are always accusing pro-lifers of being unrealistic-that this description is otherworldly. People don't generally go to their family doctors for abortions; they go to abortionists with whom they have no prior relationship and who have a direct financial interest in the abortion taking place. (By the way, if consultation is such a great idea, why do "pro-choicers" oppose waiting periods and counseling and informed-consent laws, no matter how mild?)
<P>
For a measure of Wills's intellectual integrity in this matter, consider that he refers to "late-term abortions in emergency cases-the procedure shrewdly but misleadingly labeled 'partial-birth abortion' by its opponents." He's also prone to making highly suspect empirical claims with no evidentiary support. "Even those who disapprove of abortion in general do not consider it murder," he writes. "And those who oppose late-term abortions do not consider them infanticide." How does Wills know this? (Polls actually suggest the reverse of his first claim: more people consider abortion murder than want to prohibit it.) He also writes that 'more people of genuine belief and piety do not consider abortion, no matter how wrong, to be murder." Perhaps Wills is using a circular definition of 'people genuine belief and piety" to mean those people who agree with him on the wisdom of liberal abortion laws. But on any plausible reading of the phrase, the claim is almost certainly untrue.
<P>
<b>As the Book World Turns</b><br>
In yesterday's <I>Washington Post</I> Book World, Charles Murray's new book was reviewed by a liberal (historian Michael Kazin), and former Planned Parenthood head Faye Wattleton's new autobiography was reviewed. . . that's right, by a liberal (whose name we won't mention because the review was so embarrassingly admiring, and besides we forget it).

<b>Truer Words Were Never Spoken</b><br> 


The Washington Post today editorializes against tax cuts. Clinton's "would give an indiscriminate and costly children's credit to the middle class; we can think of better uses of the money." We'll bet they can.
<P>
Come to think of it, we can think of better ways for the Post to spend its money too.

<b>They're Back!</b><br> 
The Harvard freshman orientation seminar is back alive and kicking. In 1994 the Heritage Foundation had succeeded in killing it off with its own alternative orientation for freshmen Republicans. Encouraged by the new House leadership, enough freshmen opted for Heritage over Harvard that Ivy League school canceled its event altogether. At the time, it was good riddance. Going to Harvard right after becoming a congressman was always exactly the wrong way to get started, enduring huge doses of goo-goo liberal good government and stern lectures about working together and bi-partisanship right off the bat. But now, in another sign of the return to "normalcy" in Washington and American politics, Harvard is back. The good news is that most Republican freshmen are still staying away: 35 Democrats and six Republicans attended the Harvard event. They heard from such luminaries as former Dole chief of staff Sheila Burke (now the executive dean of the Kennedy School), outgoing Clinton flack and media darling George Stephanopoulos, and former Bush policy advisor Roger Porter who best captured the spirit of the hapless Bush Administration and would allegedly judge applicants for White House policy jobs on the basis of their tennis games. Anyone who learns about Washington from this crew may never recover. The six Republicans who attended, according to a Harvard list, were: Merrill Cook (Utah), James Gibbons (Nevada), Asa Hutchinson (Ark.), Charles Pickering (Mississippi), Joe Pitts (Pennsylvania) and John Sununu (N.H. ). Count it as one strike against them.

<b>Media Bias Revisited</B><br>
A while back we discussed William Powers's maiden effort as <I>The New Republic</I>'s media critic. We complained that liberals who acknowledge the existence of anti-conservative media bias feel that they must simultaneously slam conservatives for having a crude , conspiratorial view of that bias. In fact, we observed, most conservative press critics understand the sociological reasons for media bias and accept that it is generally not deliberate or orchestrated. One of our readers kindly passed along an article  from <I>NR</I>'s special issue on the press (June 21, 1993)  that nicely makes the point. Ted J. Smith III wrote: "In short, by any reasonable standard, the case for widespread bias in reporting has been made. This does not imply, as some members of the press seem to imagine, that journalists have been found guilty of consciously slanting the news to make it conform with their ideological perspectives. While this may occur on occasion, what is more commonand more insidiousis the sort of bias that reflects the  unconscious assumptions of the writer. This emerges in such things as the kind of adjectives he employs, the kind of 'experts' he quotes, the kind of organizations he considers authoritative, and the kind of issues he thinks important." . . . And while we 're on the subject: Brent Bozell's Media Research Center Awards for the worst quotes of 1996 will be out by the end of the week. Our own Kate O'Beirne was one of the judges.

<b>Musical RNC Chairs</b><br>
The race for RNC chairman is getting more crowded. Texas GOP chairman Tom Pauken has announced his candidacy, which is being promoted by the conservative weekly <I>Human Events</I>. Pauken is smart, principled, and in Texas he has successfully knit together the  social and economic wings of the conservative movement. Announcing his candidacy, Pauken said: "Under my leadership the RNC will be a member-driven organization with an increased emphasis on rebuilding the grassroots Reagan coalition of economic and social  conservatives. By reactivating the Reagan coalition as well as forming other coalitions with those who believe in economic liberty, limited government, and the traditional American values that made our country great, the Republican Party will be able to  retain and increase its control of Congress in 1998 and make a unified effort to reclaim the presidency." Also entering the race is ex-RNC co-chair Jeanie Austin, who flirted with the interesting idea of running on a joint ticket with Rep. J. C. Watts, but  Watts declined. Austin will appeal to those convinced the party needs more high-profile women to combat its "gender gap" problem. Austin says that's not why she's running, but noted: "I have devoted a good part of my career in the Republican Party, recruiting women into the party, and getting women elected to office. I think our party needs to pay closer attention to what women are saying, and we need to listen to their ideas and concerns." The Christian Coalition has flagged Pauken, ex-New Hampshire Gov. Steve  Merrill, and California GOP chairman John Herrington as its preferred candidates. At this point the race is wide open, but the RNC insiders who will be doing the voting at the winter meeting on Jan. 17 are likely to favor one of their own, a fellow insider. This certainly spells trouble for Pauken and Merrill.

<b>Cohen-Head</b>
The cabinet pick Republicans should be happiest about (at least from a cynical political perspective) is probably Bill Cohen at Secretary of Defensealthough not for the reasons the Clinton Administration thinks. The bi-partisan bounce Clinton will get from this pick will last about two weeks; as soon as Cohen is confirmed the honeymoon ends. Then Clinton gets to deal with side of Cohen Republicans are so familiar withthat is his unreliable, disloyal side. The <I>Washington Post</I>'s Al Kamen recently provided a run-down of his record: Cohen broke with other Republicans during Watergate to vote to send articles of impeachment against Nixon to the House floor; during the Reagan Administration he constantly undercut the Administration's position on Nicaragua; he was skeptical of the Gulf War and at one point told Bush: "We visited the Kuwaitis, we saw the Kuwaitis, and we realized that Kuwaitis are willing to fightuntil every U.S. soldier has dropped." Cohen reportedly got the job on the strength of his interview with the President. But he has no management experience and beginning today all his cachet with Republicans is shot; Clinton is about to learn the limits of a pleasant conversationalist as Secretary of Defense.

<b>Fourth-Floor, Hardcore</b><br>
Hard-core House conservatives have made a concerted effort to get office space together on the fourth floor of the Cannon House office building, the better to coordinate their strategy in the next session of Congress. Get a load of this: on one corridor of the fourth floor of the Cannon building the line-up is John Hostettler (Ind.), John Shadegg (Ariz.), Tom Coburn (Okla.), Todd Tiahrt (Kan.), Steve Largent (Okla.), Gil Gutknecht (Minn.), Zach Wamp (Tenn.), Walter Jones (N.C.), Mark Souder (Ind.), Steve Stockman (Tex.), Mark Neumann (Wisc.), Jon Christensen (Neb.), John Ensign (Nev.), and, right around the corner, Ed Bryant (Tenn.). Whew! Texas Democrat Lloyd Doggett was briefly angling for space on Cannon's fourth floor, but when he realized who surrounded him he gave it up. Look for New Jersey Democrat Frank Pallone, plopped down in the middle of this right-wing real estate, to begin to look for new accommodations soon too (or maybe he'll convert). The House leadership, not eager to face pressure from the Right, can't like the idea of having all these guys together. Says one House aide: "They're going to post sentries, I think, on either end of the hallway."

<b>Tidbits and Outrages</b><br>
<I>The Washington Monthly</I> has a soporific reputation. It's concentrated for the last several years on nuts-and-bolts policy analysis - more nuts than bolts, if you ask us. Now the magazine has embarrassed itself by giving its monthly journalism award to Donald Barlett and James Steele for their interminable <I>Philadelphia Inquirer</I> series "America: Who Stole the Dream?" which has now, inevitably, been released as a book. It's been hooted by columnists right and center for its ludicrous and often self-contradictory arguments, its primitive "analysis," and its ignorance of basic economicsthemes that, alas, run through Barlett and Steele's work. <I>The Washington Monthly</I>, however, not only gave B&S an award, but excerpt their book in the same issue. This odd sort of self-dealing appears to be a pattern at the monthly: in his section of the magazine, editor Charlie Peters takes the <I>California Journal</I>'s side in a legal dispute with the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>; later in the magazine, the <I>California Journal</I>'s managing editor has a long article.

<b>The Senate's Only Democratic Committee Chairman</b><br>
Bad news for conservatives in the Senate. Indiana Sen. Dan Coats has decided not to challenge Vermont Senator James Jeffords for chairmanship of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee. The committee has always been a trouble spot, featuring some of the Democrats' most liberal Senators and some of the Republicans' most accommodating members. Retiring "Clueless in Kansas" Sen. Nancy Kassebaum was the last chairman, and with Jeffords taking over for her, if anything, the panel will get worse. Jeffords was the only Republican sponsor of the Clinton health care bill. His AFLCIO rating (45 per cent) is nearly as high as his U.S. Chamber of Commerce rating (55 per cent). In short, he's just the type of legislator who helped make the U.S. Senate a graveyard for House initiatives over the last two years. But disloyalty apparently has its rewardnow he's going to be chairman of one of the Senate's most important committees.

<b>Bias Squared</b><br>
"What every conservative press critic preaches, and almost every reporter denies, is largely true: the mainstream press is liberal," writes William Powers in the cover story of this week's <I>New Republic</I>. ". . . When conservatives huff about the cabal of liberal journalists that is constantly plotting to slant coverage, they are right about the effects but wrong about the cause. There is no plotting at all: liberal bias flows from principles so deeply held they're mostly unconscious." It's nice, we guess, to get another admission of liberal media bias by a non-conservative. But somehow such admissions always come wrapped in layers of condescension. No serious conservative press criticcertainly not L. Brent Bozell and his colleagues at the Media Research Center, perhaps the most prolificmaintains that reporters are "constantly plotting to slant coverage." (Notice, by the way, the pejorative choice of verb, "huff," which is a standard <I>TNR</I> technique for parroting an observation and slamming the observer simultaneously.) Most conservatives think that for a variety of sociological reasons journalists tend to be liberal, and this fact affects their coverage. Evidently Powers agrees. Couldn't he just say that on this point, conservatives are unambiguously right?

<P>
<b>Sin Tax Sins</b><br>
Libertarian <I>Washington Post<I/> columnist James Glassman today defends liquor companies' right to advertise their product. Guardians of the public health, he suggests, ought to try to raise beer taxes instead. He writes that "we don't tax beer nearly enough. Currently, the United States earns"surely he means "takes"?as much in excise taxes from a single bottle of scotch as it does from 39 cans of beer, according to Congressional Budget Office figures." Say it ain't so, Jim! Repeat after us: Beer isn't undertaxed; scotch is overtaxed.

<b>Oops</b><br>
Jonathan Yardley, one of the <I>Washington Post</I>'s most sensible regular reviewers and columnists, wrote in Sunday's Book World that "even the most devout Christians" know that Christ wasn't born on Christmas day. Even? Surely Yardley means "especially."

The <I>Washington Post</I> today referred to the possibility that "conservative" Dan Coats might challenge "moderate" Jim Jeffords for the leadership of the Senate Human Relations Committee.

<title>Daily Commentary - January 1, 1997</title>

<body>

<center><h1>Daily Commentary<br>
January 1, 1997</h1></center>

<p><hr width=75% size=3><p>

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

I'm a bit old-fashioned, so every New Year's I make resolutions.
Some are personal -- like remembering to walk the dog before
I turn in for the night.  But others are public.  Here at the
Family Reserch Council, we've made several resolutions for the
New Year.

<p>

First, we're resolved to make 1997 the year of pro-family
tax relief.  Family tax cuts are one of those things that everybody
supports, but nobody enacts.  It's time this nation invested as
much in human capital as it does in physical capital.  Second,
we're resolved to make 1997 a year of national awakening about
the need for judicial reform.  With pending  issues like assisted
suicide and same-sex marriage, there's no time to lose in restoring
legislative power to the American people.  Third, we're resolved
to launch a new youth program, that will help train the next generation
of young men and women in the Judeo-Christian world view.

<p>

Finally, we resolve to seek these goals with an attitude
of prayerful humility.  As we reach out to the better angels of
our neighbors, we must first renew our own better angels.

<p>

For the Family Research Council, this is Gary Bauer with
today's Washington Watch.  For more information about us, call
1-800-225-4008.  That number again:  1-800-225-4008.

<title>Daily Commentary - January 2, 1997</title>

<p>

When a set of indicators is headed in one direction, while
a related indicator is headed the other way, society must take
notice.  That's the case today in the area of drug-related arrests
among juveniles.  Overall, the national crime rate is declining.
But arrests of young people for drug possession are soaring.
Just one example.  In Fairfax County, Virginia, where I live,
the arrest rate for juvenile drug possession has increased <I>sevenfold</I>
since 1991.

<p>

That number is appalling, not just for what it says about
drug use, but also about the conditions in which drug use thrives.
Police now estimate that there are roughly 25,000 gangs operating
in the United States.  All told, these gangs have 652,000 members.
They typically commit all sorts of crimes, but the drug trade
remains a keystone business for most of them.

<p>

Thomas Constantine, head of the federal Drug Enforcement
Administration, calls this situation &quot;a ticking time bomb.&quot;
I agree.  You and I -- and every citizen -- must re-enlist in
the war against drugs.  If we fail, that bomb will go off in a
crowd of our children.

<p>

For the Family Research Council, this is Gary Bauer with
today's Washington Watch.  For more information about us, call
1-800-225-4008.  That number again:  1-800-225-4008.

<title>Daily Commentary - January 6, 1997</title>

<body>

<center><h1>Daily Commentary<br>
January 6, 1997</h1></center>

<p><hr width=75% size=3><p>

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

Now here's some good news from America's inner city.  Picture
this.  In Baltimore, fifty-eight young boys arrive for school
at 7:15 am.  It's cold and dark outside.  But inside, the boys
get a warm greeting from a Catholic priest and the 31-year old
headmaster at Ignatius Academy.  Each boy shakes hands with the
two men.  It is a civilized ritual.  If their pronunciation is
wrong, it is corrected, but no one is demeaned.  Most of the fifty-eight
boys are black, a few are white or Hispanic.  Only eighteen are
Catholic.  But each boy knows he is a child of God.

<p>

The school operates on the assumption that it makes a 
difference when young children are taught
that Jesus loves them.  It costs five thousand dollars a year
to educate each boy, but that's far less than Baltimore spends
on its public school students.  Generous donors provide scholarships
for the boys and each boy writes a personal thank-you letter,
because they should.  There are no metal detectors here.

<p>

The donors, the parents and the teachers at this school are saving
Baltimore, one soul at a time.  I pray that 1997 will give us
more stories like this academy.

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

House Republicans are deciding whether or not Newt Gingrich will
remain Speaker.  Few think the GOP will fail to keep the leader
who brought them out of forty years in the political wilderness.
Whatever details eventually emerge on this continuing saga, one
thing should be clear:  We have a <I>double</I> standard in Washington
when it comes to ethics.

<p>

The charges against Speaker Gingrich need to be fully explained.
We believe that no official, Speaker or President is above the
law.  But let's be fair.

<p>

Liberals crucified Judge Bork.  They tried to lynch my friend
Clarence Thomas. They nearly ran Ed Meese out of town for ethical
violations so minor that today no one can even remember what they
were.

<p>

Yet serious charges against liberals often go without investigation
and without prosecution.  Why, even now, all the president's men
are in federal court arguing that Paula Jones' credible sexual
harassment charges should not even be heard.

<p>

The motto at the Supreme Court is &quot;equal justice under
law.&quot;  We need to see justice for conservatives as well as 
liberals.  It's only fair.

<p>

For Family Research Council, this is Gary Bauer with today's
Washington Watch.  For more information about us, call 1-800-225-4008.

<p>

Vice President Al Gore will celebrate the twenty-fourth anniversary
of <I>Roe v. Wade </I>on January 22nd.  That's right, I said <I>celebrate.</I> 
He will be the keynote speaker at a gala luncheon sponsored
by NARAL, the militant National Abortion Rights Action League.
Gore will appear with actress Demi Moore.

<p>

Tipper Gore, the Vice President's wife, will present a <I>lifetime</I> 
achievement award.  Sad that Tipper honors some <I>lifetimes</I>
while millions are snuffed out.

<p>

NARAL, of course, presses for abortion-on-demand with American
taxpayers paying for it.  They defend every one of the 30 million
abortions that have been performed since 1973.

<p>

How tragic for Al and Tipper Gore.  Just eleven years ago,
<I>Senator</I> Al Gore wrote of his <I>deep, personal conviction
that abortion is wrong.</I> Today the Gores chose to be honored
by the abortion lobby.

<p>

It is always sad when someone aboandons principle for political
gain.  But time and time again, our unborn children have been
abandoned by politicians.  And that is a tragedy.

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

Here's a &quot;dear Abby&quot; story for you, but it's not about
the famous newspaper columnist who gives advice to the lovelorn.
The Abby I'm talking about is a darling kindergarten girl who
lives in suburban Washington DC.  Her classmates were passing
out Christmas cards and she wanted to share in the holiday joy.

<p>

But Abby's cards contained Bible verses and shared the love of
Jesus with the elementary kids in this local public school.  Believe
it or not, her teacher confiscated Abby's cards.  When her dad
went up to the school to complain, the principal said the materials
were &quot;offensive and inappropriate.&quot;  Apparently, he
hasn't heard the reason for the season.

<p>

Christmas comes but once a year, but this militant, anti-religious
attitude, unfortunately, can be found all year long.  It's not
just uncharitable, it's <I>unconstitutional</I> Supreme Court
rulings have been bad on voluntary school prayer and the religious
rights of students, but <I>no</I> court has gone to this outrageous
extreme.

<p>

We will work to correct these injustices.  We know that as long
as this is America, we don't have to hide our light under a bushel.

<p>

When the lawyers in favor of assisted suicide stood before our
Supreme Court last week they made all kinds of arguments for what
they called the right to die.  But Justice Antonin Scalia nailed
them with this probing question: &quot;This is <I>lovely</I> philosophy.
Where is it in the Constitution?&quot;

<p>

Now, I've spoken with you about assisted suicide before.  Today,
I want to focus on Justice Scalia's question.  Over the past thirty
years, we have seen a judiciary that is out of control on a host
of issues.  If our judges would only ask themselves Scalia's question,
they would not give in every time some bizarre claim is presented
to them.  Think of the outrageous rulings our courts have handed
down.  Abortion-on-demand. Banning voluntary school prayer.  Approving
flag burning. 

<p>

We need to hold the courts accountable. Abraham Lincoln said
that if we don't,  we will cease to be our own rulers.  Let's
make all our judges answer Justice Scalia's question.  &quot;Where
is it in the Constitution?&quot;

<p>

One of the most enduring qualities about Americans is that we
constantly strive to do better.  We did so this week when we 
finally recognized the heroism of seven black veterans of World War 
II with the Congressional Medal of Honor.

<p>

Now these men fought with valor in segregated units.  But for
a half-century they were denied the full recognition they deserved.

<p>

One of them was Vernon Joseph Baker, the sole survivor of those
honored this week.  In 1945, he intentionally drew enemy fire so 
his wounded men could be evacuated.  He recounted his experience 
to reporters saying, &quot;Men were being killed all around me, cut 
to pieces.  But I escaped without a scratch.  I knew there was someone 
on my shoulder.&quot;

<p>

This same faith, which saw Lt. Baker through the horrors of combat,
also saw him through difficult times in America's history.  Although 
saddened by the injustices he and other blacks faced, he said, 
&quot;I always knew things would get better, and I'm happy I'm here 
to see it.&quot;

<p>

Today we all share that joy as we remember their sacrifice.

<p>

I'm afraid we've reached a dangerous point in American politics.
It seems that public scandals have replaced public policy as the top 
agenda item in Washington.

<p>

We're all familiar with the allegations against my friend Newt
Gingrich.  Now it seems that his accusers may have committed serious 
crimes in their efforts to discredit him.  The FBI is currently 
investigating how a private phone conversation between the Speaker 
and GOP leaders was illegally taped.  They're also looking
into the role of the Ethics Committee's senior Democrat, Jim McDermott, 
in leaking the tape to the media.

<p>

It's clear that neither political party has a monopoly on virtue
or vice.  But what's also clear is that this constant drumbeat of 
scandals is shifting the focus away from dealing with important 
problems we have to solve.  Who is going to defend the sanctity 
of life, promote reliable standards of right and wrong, and bring
relief to over-taxed families, while we're all confronting our leaders' 
latest ethical lapses?

<p>

It's time we got to the bottom of this mess and then move on
with the people's business.

<p>

Washington Watch.  For more information about us, call 1-800-225-4008.

<p>

How ironic that just as we prepare to observe the memory of a
man who devoted his life to correcting injustices peacefully, some 
in our country try to do so violently.

<p>

If Dr. Martin Luther King were alive today, he no doubt would
join us in condemning yesterday's bombing in Atlanta.  We pro-lifers
are heartbroken by the deaths of millions of innocent children
through abortion.  But we must seek a peaceful solution to this
tragedy.  One that teaches the value of all human life.

<p>

Like Dr. King's struggle against segregation and racism, our
struggle against abortion is a process that involves changing 
hearts and minds. We will never win the hearts and minds of the 
American people through violence.  This movement is about life, 
not destruction.

<p>

Thankfully no lives were lost in the explosion.  And we look
forward to the day when no lives are lost inside the abortion clinic. 
We at the Family Research Council will take the lead in condemning 
these acts.  But we will also redouble our efforts to extend the 
protection of our laws to unborn children.

<p>

Washington Watch.  For more information about us, call 1-800-225-4008.

<p>

For years Bill Cosby brought family-friendly entertainment into
millions of living rooms.  We identified with the triumphs and trials 
of the Huxtable family.  That's why the sorrow of last week's tragic 
death of Bill Cosby's son Ennis, is shared by Americans everywhere.

<p>

It's also a reminder that we've become a country where the streets
are no longer safe.  Government is failing in its first purpose: to 
protect the safety of its citizens.  We also see from this tragedy that 
the breakdown of reliable standards of right and wrong is deadly.

<p>

You know, this breakdown in values has other consequences.  Like
the callousness of one T.V. network showing footage of Cosby's
son lying in a pool of blood.  Amazingly, the network said &quot;[it]
had no precise rules for airing such footage.&quot;

<p>

Well, folks, that's exactly the problem.  Our society no longer
seems to have precise rules for living.  And until we recover those 
core values, it's no longer safe to stop and change a flat tire.

<p>

For now our thoughts and prayers are with the Cosby family.
May God comfort them in this time of loss.

<p>

There was a memorable line in Bill Clinton's inaugural address
that bears repeating.  He said: &quot;We cannot, we will not succumb
to the dark impulses that lurk in the far regions of the soul
everywhere.  We shall overcome them.&quot;

<p>

As I listened to the president, I wondered what dark impulses
he had in mind.  Was he talking about the choice movement that
has left over 37 million unborn children dead on this the 24th
anniversary of <I>Roe v. Wade</I>?

<p>

Was he talking about the philosophy that leads government bureaucrats
to take an extraordinary bite out of the paychecks of working
families, only to pay for programs that whittle away at our liberty?
And what about the dark impulses that lead our own government
to give benefits to citizens based on their race instead of judging
the content of their character.

<p>

Sadly, this government has succumbed to all of these bad ideas.
But I hope the President's call to overcome &quot;dark impulses&quot;
will signal a turning point on these issues.  In the weeks and
months ahead let's watch carefully to see whether his actions
match his rhetoric.

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

Yesterday marked the 24th anniversary of the Supreme Court's
<I>Roe v. Wade</I> decision.  And for the 24th time tens of 
thousands gathered in Washington to protest the deaths of 
millions of children from abortion.

<p>

Over the past 30 years, demonstrators have acquired a bad reputation.
The turbulent anti-war protests of the 60s, along with extremist movements
like radical environmentalism and the animal rights crowd, have caused many
of us to view protesters with suspicion.

<p>

But yesterday's peaceful March for Life was different.  The marchers
weren't demanding special benefits for themselves. Nor were they demanding
that society embrace some bizarre social agenda.  Instead Americans from all
walks of life gathered in the nation's capital for the most unselfish of 
reasons: to defend innocent human life.

<p>

I think these men and women are the conscience of America.  They
remind us that all men are endowed by their creator with &quot;certain
unalienable rights,&quot; which include, &quot;life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness.&quot;  They also remind us that the
contradiction between the principles of the Declaration of Independence,
and the practice of legal abortion, must be resolved in favor
of life.

<p>

<p>

Hold on to your wallets folks, the UN is after your money.  That's
right, the same bunch that brought us the Convention on the Rights
of the Child and the Beijing conference on women is now hitting
us up for over $1 billion.

<p>

And listen to this, they say we <I>owe</I> it to them.  But for
years the United States has been paying a quarter of the UN's
budget, with current contributions costing American taxpayers
$4 billion a year.  And what do we get in return?  Conferences
that push the radical liberal agenda on a global scale, treaties
that sell out American sovereignty and &quot;peacekeeping&quot;
missions that put our soldiers in danger and under foreign command.

<p>

Meanwhile, the UN's bloated bureaucracy continues to grow unchecked.
And the corruption and lavish spending, which are the real reasons
for it's cash shortfall, are ignored.  The nerve of these people;
instead of handing over more money to the UN, the United States
should insist that it get serious about reform by demanding that
they cut staff and stop meddling in the internal affairs of sovereign
nations.  Congress should send back the UN's invoice marked &quot;request
denied.&quot;

<p>

It's time to get down to business. Here in Washington, Congress
is back in session, and the president has been sworn in along with 
his new cabinet.

<p>

But lately this city has been preoccupied with scandals.  The
past few weeks have focused largely on Newt Gingrich.  The next few 
weeks will likely focus on the range of ethical problems at the White 
House.

<p>

Authorities will continue their investigations in these matters -- and
they should. But now it's time for Congress and the president to focus 
on the people's business.  I for one want to see immediate action on 
protecting unborn children, tax relief for America's families and 
measures to protect marriage.  We also need a serious judicial reform 
effort. We need to rein in judges who have taken legislative power away
from the people. And it's past time to do something about wasteful 
government spending.  We should start by insisting that the president 
set a better example than he did when he blew $12 million of the 
people's money for his second inauguration.

<p>

There are no more excuses; it's time for our leaders to get back
to work.

<p>

If you're like me, you're tired of watching federal judges impose
their political will.

<p>

Just last week a judge overturned a law keeping pornography from
being sold on military bases.  Recently, an appellate judge ruled it's
unconstitutional for courts to send alcoholics to Alcoholics Anonymous 
because AA acknowledges God.  And another judge threw out 80 pounds 
of heroin and cocaine as evidence in a drug case.

<p>

These cases have two things in common: all of the judges were
appointed by Bill Clinton and all were <I>unanimously</I> approved by 
the Senate. It seems this administration likes activist judges to 
dictate from the bench because their agenda doesn't sell with voters.

<p>

Well my friends, this must stop.  If the Senate won't protect
us from this nonsense, we'll do it ourselves.  That's why FRC has joined a
coalition of over 200 local, state and national organizations dedicated to 
putting an end to judicial tyranny.  We won't long remain a free country 
if we let unelected judges do the work of elected representatives.

<p>

It's time to rule activist judges out of order.  Freedom and
self-government hang in the balance.

<p>

You know, it's difficult for a free people to imagine not being
able to speak out against corrupt politicians.  But in China,
a billion people are under the thumb of an oppressive government,
and they dare not say a word about it.

<p>

A report by the State Department shows there are no dissidents
left in China.  They've all been jailed or exiled.  In 1989, we
watched in amazement the courage of Chinese students who marched
in Tienanmen Square.  Today, they are all gone.

<p>

During their struggle, they looked to us for inspiration.  They
quoted our Declaration of Independence and built a paper-mache
model of our Statue of Liberty.

<p>

But U.S. policy makers answer with cold economic theories to
solve China's abuses of human rights.  We've allowed corporate
projections of huge profits to drive our policy.  And in doing
so, we've ignored everything from forced abortion to China's sale
of dangerous weapons to our sworn enemies.

<p>

My friends, I know America is better than that.   Our leaders
must have the courage to confront China's abuses.  The price of
not doing so is simply too high.

<p>

Well, they're at it again.  Politicians who were elected to
Congress claiming to favor a balanced budget amendment are looking
for ways to break their promise.  Why am I not surprised?  Meanwhile
experts here in Washington are predicting that the deficit will
start rising again this year.

<p>

Now this issue affects every family.  The burden of the debt
we are building today will be carried by our children tomorrow.
We have two choices in dealing with the deficit.  The first is
to pass the balanced budget amendment.  The second is to do what
economists call &quot;monetizing&quot; the debt.  Now without
getting too technical, this simply means to print more money.
But every time we do that, we lower the value of dollars already
earned.  That will create huge inflation and wipe out Americans'
savings.

<p>

It's clear that the only way to force Congress to balance the
budget <I>and</I> protect the savings of working families is
to pass the balanced budget amendment.  There's one more thing
we ought to do -- we should tie congressional salaries to progress
on eliminating the debt.  Now there's an idea whose time has come.

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

My family and I enjoy the outdoors.  And like most people we
share a real concern for the environment.  But for the Washington
bureaucrats, what masquerades as concern is just another power
grab.

<p>

In recent years the government has taken control of 100 million
acres of land.  That's roughly equivalent to Ohio, Indiana and
Illinois put together.  Most of the land is privately-owned and
all of it was taken because the government reclassified it as
&quot;wetlands.&quot;  In low-lying Louisiana, the government
has effectively asserted control of over half of all private land.

<p>

But what's really weird is how the government defines &quot;wetlands&quot;.
In fact, land that is dry 350 days a year can still be considered
a &quot;wetland&quot;.  Under this definition even a puddle would
qualify.

<p>

You know, Teddy Roosevelt was one of my favorite presidents.
And he was known for his love of the outdoors.  But that's a
lot different from today's bureaucrats who use concern for things
like the environment and child welfare as cover to take power
from families.

<p>

That's an encroachment we must guard against.

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

You know, one of the most depressing things in the fight to defend
human life is watching just how low radical feminists are willing
to go in justifying abortion.

<p>

A new book by Northeastern University political science professor
Eileen McDonagh advocates self-defense as the strongest legal
case for abortion.  That's right, this woman actually says that
unborn children intrude on women's bodies and take their liberty.
She says that if a woman doesn't want this imposition she should
be able to use deadly force to stop it like she would if it were
&quot;rape, kidnapping or slavery.&quot;

<p>

It's difficult to imagine a person so hardened that they'd consider
a defenseless baby a violent intruder.  But it shows just how
out of touch radical feminism is with most women.  Instead of
using terms like &quot;intruder&quot; or &quot;assailant,&quot;
most women think of the life growing in the womb as a baby. 
They think of birth as a blessed event.  God help the pro-abortion
radicals that can't tell the difference between a rapist and a
baby.

<title>Daily Commentary - February 5, 1997</title>

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

In last night's State of the Union Address, Bill Clinton was
articulate as usual. He spoke with the concern we all share
for the problems facing our nation, and ticked off a list of government-backed
initiatives and programs to deal with them.

<p>

But as the president spoke, it struck me that shuffling taxpayer
dollars from one government account to another isn't going to
address the real problems we face.  After last year's speech I
said that politicians had not given adequate answers to the questions
gnawing at America's heart.  Well, after a year of election campaigns
we're right back where we started.

<p>

We still see our standard of living sag as our taxes rise.  Family
breakdown and poverty continue to damage our children.  The general
breakdown of values leaves us morally confused.  And illegal drugs
are flooding our neighborhoods and schools.

<p>

Now these problems won't be solved overnight.  But we haven't
made enough progress on them.  I hope this year is different and
that Washington finds a way to talk about the things that touch
on the hearts of the people.

<title>Daily Commentary - February 6, 1997</title>

<body>

<center><h1>Daily Commentary<br>
February 6, 1997</h1></center>

<p><hr width=75% size=3><p>

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

This week the White House thought it would be a good idea to
make Bill Clinton look like a forward-thinking leader by focusing
on education.  But instead they exposed his belief in big government.

<p>

Keep in mind that this is the same president, who just last year
declared the era of big government was over.  Now he's launching
a $51 billion initiative that would massively expand the federal
role in education.  Now that may sound good, but the facts tell
a different story.  In the past 18 years since the creation of
the Department of Education, test scores have gone down, the quality
of education has declined and too many schools have become unsafe
for students and teachers alike.  You know all this already, of
course.  All this despite a tripling of its budget.  Now the president
is calling for a 20% increase.

<p>

That's exactly the wrong direction to take.  There's no connection
between government spending and educational improvement.  But
there is a connection between government spending and government
control.  This administration should look for ways to increase
parent's control instead of government's.  It's the only way we
can really reform education.

<P>
America's foremost family advocate, Dr. James Dobson, and former White House domestic policy adviser Gary Bauer team up in this analysis of the "civil war over values" in contemporary culture.  With candor matched by conviction, Dobson and Bauer describe the challenges parents face raising children in today's moral wilderness.  Each author brings to the book his special expertise:  Dobson as psychologist and author, Bauer as public policy expert and longtime observer of the Washington political scene.  They discuss the sexual revolution, declining respect for human life, the campaign to redefine the family, Washington's failure to defend hearth and home, and much more.

<center><h2>MEDICAL JOURNAL EDITOR IGNORES FACTS IN<br>
PROMOTING LUNACY</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;The editor of the <I>New England
Journal of Medicine</I> (NEJM) violated one of the first principles
of good medicine by publishing his call for legalizing 'medical'
marijuana,&quot;  FRC senior policy analyst Robert Maginnis said
Thursday, following the release of an NEJM editorial.  &quot;Dr.
Jerome Kassirer ignored readily available government studies and
court decisions.  He is guilty of recommending bad medicine.&quot;

<p>

<B>Maginnis noted that among the many facts overlooked by the
writer was the work of his predecessor</B>. A previous editor
of the NEJM, Dr. Arnold Relman, chaired a 1982 Institute of Medicine
review of the available scientific information on the health effects
of marijuana.  That review was also published in the NEJM and
concludes, &quot;The available evidence is incomplete and much
more work is needed.&quot;

<p>

Dr. Kassirer's editorial cites a 1988 administrative court judge's
decision supporting limited medical use of marijuana, but completely
ignores a 1994 court of appeals decision overruling the earlier
decision.  The appeals court established guidelines requiring
rigorous scientific proof in order to satisfy the requirement
of &quot;currently accepted medical use&quot; for schedule II
drugs. The appeals court also supported the Drug Enforcement Administration's
decision denying re-scheduling of marijuana with the statement,
&quot;The administrator reasonably accorded more weight to the
opinions of the experts than to the laymen and doctors on which
the petitioners relied.&quot;

<p>

Maginnis said, &quot;Dr. Kassirer must be unaware of a <B>1992
National Institutes of Health review which concluded, 'There is
no scientifically sound evidence that smoked marijuana is medically
superior to currently available therapies.'&quot;</B>

<p>

The ongoing debate which Dr. Kassirer now joins is really between
drug legalizers and the American Medical Association, the American
Cancer Society and the American Ophthalmological Society, notes
Maginnis, saying:  &quot;These national organizations have repeatedly
condemned marijuana as medicine in the face of advocates promoting
only anecdotal evidence.

<p>

&quot;Dr. Kassirer says that the determination of safety and efficacy
is irrelevant in persons with advanced illnesses.  But this ignores
many FDA-approved medicines which have superior efficacy and are
available. <B>He must understand that giving crude marijuana
is parallel to providing pond water to a patient when pure water
is available.</B>  No prudent doctor would ever recommend smoking
as medicine given the fact that smoke is highly correlated with
many cancers.

<p>

&quot;He ignores the damage left in the wake of marijuana abuse
and the mixed message so-called 'medical' pot sends to the general
population.  Government studies link pot with many traffic fatalities,
unsafe sex, more alcohol consumption, higher suicide rates, increased
suppression of immune systems especially among AIDS and cancer
patients and numerous lung ailments.

<p>

&quot;Even the often pro-drug nation of The Netherlands recently
declared marijuana unfit medicine.  The December 31, 1996 report
from the Health Council of the Netherlands declares, '...the Committee
has concluded that evidence is insufficient to justify the medical
use of marihuana [sic].'

<p>

&quot;Kassirer's compassion for suffering patients is understandable,
but his ignoring a wealth of conflicting science isn't.  Doctors
need to listen to medical experts and not to the drug lobby.&quot;

<center><h2>CLINTON ADMINISTRATION HAS DOUBLE<br>
STANDARD ON SCHOOL STANDARDS, NOTES FRC</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Bill Clinton exhibits selective
memory on the issue of academic standards, but on one thing we
agree, local control of our schools is an important tradition
and condition for school success,&quot; Family Research Council
Gary L. Bauer said Thursday, following Clinton's remarks on national
standards.

<p>

<b>&quot;We all agree that we need high standards for our children's
education. The critical  question is whose standards?</b> For
example, the state of Ohio set the standard that all high school
graduates be required to pass a ninth-grade proficiency test.
One of Clinton's federal agencies thought that was too high and
took the state to court.

<p>

<b>&quot;This raises the important question, will our children
be better educated with a Clinton standard?</b> Today in America,
we have the general standard that children learn to read by the
end of first grade. Bill Clinton proposed a $2.75 billion new
program to use paid 'volunteer' tutors to get kids reading by
the end of third grade. But isn't that what tax payers expect
teachers to do?

<p>

&quot;The president also called for more testing, but already,
regular testing shows that America's kids are falling behind other
nations. Perhaps Bill Clinton would join FRC in supporting standards
for teachers and in giving schools the authority to evaluate teacher
performance.

<p>

&quot;Recent controversy surrounds the dumbing down of standard
tests such as the SAT. There are no guarantees that the testing
Clinton advocates will not be altered to achieve certain results.
<B>All tests are not equal</B>. The answer to our current problems
is not to strengthen federal bureaucrats at the expense of parents
who love their children and local teachers who work with families
daily.

<p>

&quot;Frankly, I'd like to hear the president explain how he plans
to set national standards while strengthening local control. You
can't have it both ways. Currently, the federal government puts
in about seven cents of the education dollar spent at the local
level. And those seven cents are used as a powerful carrot and
stick on our schools. Where has that carrot led us?

<p>

&quot;<b>Recent history is clear. The more the federal government
has become involved in our schools, the poorer the students have
performed</b>. It's time to strengthen the parents, local educators
and state leaders who are on the front lines and are committed
to making a difference for our kids.&quot;

<center><h2>JUDGE TELLS PENTAGON<br>
IT MUST SELL SMUT</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Forcing the military to sell pornography
is &quot;a miscarriage of justice and another indicator of an
out-of-control judiciary,&quot; Family Research Council Military
Readiness Project Director Lt. Col. Robert Maginnis said about
the decision made Wednesday by a New York judge.

<p>

Judge Shira Scheidlin, U.S. District Court for the Southern District
of New York, said that the new law banning the sale of sexually
explicit material in military stores violates the pornographer's
First Amendment rights.

<p>

Colonel Maginnis explained, &quot;Congress has the constitutional
obligation (Art. I, Sec. 8) to set the rules and regulations for
the military.  The Congress passed the ban, and it was signed
by the President.  The law bans 'the sale or rental of sexually
explicit written or videotaped material on property under the
jurisdiction of the Department of Defense.' Although customers
pay less than the market price for pornography in military stores,
the Pentagon earns over $4 million in annual sales of 219 sexually
explicit magazines.

<p>

&quot;The major constitutional obligation in this area is for
Congress to protect the military's combat fitness, therefore it
has declared that selling pornography is bad for readiness.&quot;

<p>

The Pentagon has declared that it does not intend to appeal the
decision.  &quot;This is desertion in the face of pornographers,&quot;
said Maginnis.  &quot;The Pentagon is running from its duty to
execute the law and liberal judges are doing the dirty work.

<p>

&quot;A military that says it wants more servicewomen is at the
same time forced to remain one of the nation's largest purveyors
of pornography.  It has been shaken by the ongoing Aberdeen Proving
Grounds sexual harassment scandal.  News that the military must
continue selling woman-demeaning smut sends the wrong message
to traumatized women who understand the direct association between
exposure to pornography and sexual misconduct.&quot;

<title>January 22, 1996 Press Release</title>

<font size=-1>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
January 22, 1996 ** 24th Anniversary of <i>Roe v. Wade</i><br>

<p>

<center><h2>ABORTION: OUR FINEST MOMENT AS WOMEN?<br>
NO, WOMEN WORTH MORE THAN THAT, SAYS FRC</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Liberal feminism has elevated
abortion to something that represents our greatest freedom --
our finest hour as women. But the worth of women is not measured
in the number of abortions, but in our accomplishments as whole
people -- mothers, employers, volunteers, professionals and a
host of other roles,&quot; said Family Research Council Director
of Communication Kristi S. Hamrick on Wednesday -- the 24th anniversary
of <i>Roe v. Wade</i>.

<p>

Mrs. Hamrick made the following statement: &quot;It's odd that
man-hating feminism measures the worth of women by how much they
<I>ACT</I> like men -- whether they have an uninterrupted career
path or push their children into the hobby category. But on this
day, when pro-life Americans reflect on our society, it's clear
that women were misled by this form of feminism. We are not diminished
by childbirth. We become more than who we were.

<p>

&quot;Liberal feminism teaches that children are a parasite or
a millstone to our careers and lives. These so-called women's
advocates say that women are not capable of handling the births
of their children and the capabilities of their minds at the same
time. We must 'choose' one. But when individual 'choice' is elevated
to the constitution, it's not just our children who are injured.
We  see in the euthanasia cases before the Supreme Court that
all the weak become vulnerable when others are given the right
to 'choose' to end their lives.&quot;

<p>

Mrs. Hamrick continued: &quot;Family Research Council condemns
the cowardly acts of people who plant bombs and attack strangers.
The heart of the pro-life message is that the innocent must be
protected. These bombings are unacceptable and must be prosecuted
to the full extent of the law. The pro-life movement seeks to
work within the law to accomplish real change, one life at a time.

<p>

&quot;Family Research Council salutes the pro-life men and women
who work in crisis pregnancy centers, take unwed mothers into
their homes, give of their time and money to families in need
and adopt very wanted children. These Americans are the heart
of the pro-life community and represent America's best response
to women who need help in a difficult time.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>EDITOR'S NOTE: B-ROLL/PICTURE OPPORTUNITY</h3></center>

<p>

Family Research Council will welcome March for Life participants
for an open house today from 2:30 p.m. to 4 p.m. at the new office
location of 801 G Street N.W.

<center><h2>'VIOLENCE IS NOT AN ANSWER TO VIOLENCE'</h2>
<h4>Gary L. Bauer Statement following<br>
1/16/97 Atlanta Abortion Clinic Bombing:</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council President Gary
L. Bauer made the following statement Thursday following media
reports of an abortion clinic bombing in Atlanta:

<p>

&quot;Violence is not an answer to violence. That is especially
clear on the eve of the nation's observance of Martin Luther King
Day.

<p>

&quot;Dr. King galvanized a movement to correct a profound injustice,
but he used peaceful means to accomplish the highest goals. Millions
of Americans are frustrated by the deaths of millions of children
through abortion. But we have sought and must continue to seek
loving solutions, honest public debate and sound legislation.

<p>

&quot;We are very thankful to learn through the news media that
no employee of the clinic was killed in this dreadful incident.
Family Research Council condemns today's acts of violence in Atlanta.&quot;

<center><h2><u>COURT WATCHERS:</u><br>
REMEMBER HOW <i>ROE V. WADE</i> CHANGED AMERICA?<br>
IT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN AFTER TODAY</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The U.S. Supreme Court is preparing
to hear two cases in January -- one today -- that could change
the face of the life debate. <B>The courts, having decided that
human life did not have intrinsic value at its conception, now
will decide what value it holds at its conclusion.</B>

<p>

THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT A NATION HAS STOOD ON THE THRESHOLD.
In a brief to the Supreme Court filed by the Family Research
Council, attorney of record Cathy Cleaver describes the circumstances
in pre-Nazi Germany's medical community that led to euthanasia
and of fateful decisions about &quot;good death&quot; and the
end of human life. Once a nation decides that there is such a
thing as a &quot;life not worth living&quot;, history has shown
that decisions to terminate such lives infect the corridors of
power.

<p>

Neither Germany nor Holland made it legal, per se, to kill through
euthanasia during World War II. The policies were subtly adopted,
and the results are easy to read. What would happen in America
if our courts actually give a legal foundation to wide-spread
&quot;good death&quot;?

<p>

THE FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL CAN HELP.  We have experts in the
areas of law and disability who understand the slippery slope
on which the high court is poised by these cases. The implications
of a hasty ruling could change America's health care system and
lead all of us to wonder &quot;who can be trusted&quot; when faced
with a personal medical crisis.

<center><h2>HOLLYWOOD TV RATINGS TURN PARENTS<br>
INTO &quot;GARBAGE GOALIES&quot;</h2>

<p>

<h4>BAUER BLASTS VALENTI FOR &quot;MORAL POSTURING&quot; 
SAYS NEW SYSTEM WILL ENSURE THAT TV WILL &quot;PUMP MORE 
TRASH INTO AMERICA'S LIVING ROOM&quot;</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The parental TV ratings system unveiled
Thursday by Motion Picture Association of America's President Jack Valenti
is &quot;an insult to parents everywhere, and a clear sign that
Hollywood has no intention of curbing sex, violence and foul language
on television,&quot; Gary Bauer, President of Family Research
Council said.  &quot;At best, this moral posturing promises no
changes in programming and turns parents into garbage goalies.

<p>

&quot;Mr. Valenti said that content-based ratings are impossible
because no one could distinguish hugs and kisses on <I>Dr. Quinn,
Medicine Woman</I> from Sharon Stone's sexual explicitness in
<I>Basic Instinct</I>.  And these are the people who will rate
the shows?  Somehow I have trouble working up a lot of faith in
this system.

<p>

&quot;Mr. Valenti offers lots of flowery rhetoric about parents'
concerns, but he never once has suggested that Hollywood should
curb the production of sex, violence and swearing that are common
during prime-time, even in the 'family hour,'&quot; Bauer said.
&quot;The net effect of this system will be to pump more smut
into America's family rooms.

<p>

&quot;I personally find the TV-14 rating the most revealing category.
Mr. Valenti said, 'We're ratcheting up now.'  I think he should
have said, 'We are ratcheting down -- toward the gutter.'  TV-14
says that programs suitable for 14-year-olds contain 'sophisticated
themes, sexual content, strong language and more intense violence.'
In their manufactured polls, I bet they didn't ask parents whether
they thought 14-year-olds ought to get a TV diet of sexual content,
foul language and 'more intense violence,'&quot; Bauer continued.
&quot;Even the TV-PG category shows Hollywood's true intent.
'Infrequent coarse language, limited violence, some suggestive
sexual dialogue and situations' are supposed to be suitable for
more children.  What planet is Mr. Valenti living on?  I'll tell
you -- Planet Hollywood.&quot;

<p>

Bauer called on Hollywood to &quot;quit hiding behind this phony
ratings ploy and pledge to clean up your act.  Be the good citizens
that you want parents to believe you are -- stop the trash, don't
just rate it.&quot;

<center><h2>PENTAGON DRAGS ITS FEET TO KEEP PORN<br>
IN MILITARY STORES</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;Military must show that it's serious
about sexual harassment and obey the new law banning porn sales,&quot;
Maginnis said</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council Military Readiness
Project Director Lt. Col. Robert Maginnis criticized the Pentagon
Wednesday for not following the law signed by President Clinton
three months ago banning &quot;the sale or rental of sexually
explicit written or videotaped material on property under the
jurisdiction of the Department of Defense.&quot;  Although the
law is scheduled to go into effect December 22, Maginnis said
&quot;the smut will likely remain on the shelves for now because
the Pentagon is more afraid of pornographers than Congress.&quot;

<p>

Claiming the ban will hurt porn sales, Bob Guccione, publisher
of <I>Penthouse</I> magazine, filed suit in New York asking for
an injunction to stop the Pentagon from removing his magazines
from military bookshelves.  Military lawyers' main objection to
the law is that it raises &quot;serious constitutional and administrative
problems,&quot; however Maginnis said the issue is not about constitutional
rights but about money.  Although customers pay less than the
market price for pornography in military stores, the Pentagon
earns over $4 million in annual sales.

<p>

&quot;The major constitutional obligation in this area is for
Congress to protect the military's combat fitness,&quot; Maginnis
said.  &quot;Congress has declared that selling pornography is
bad for readiness, and the military should obey.&quot;

<p>

Research shows that there is a direct association between exposure
to pornography and sexual misconduct.  The 1986 Attorney General's
Commission on Pornography cites studies which show that over half
of rapists say they were &quot;incited to commit an offense&quot;
by pornography and that 42 percent of child molesters &quot;implicated
pornography&quot; in their crimes.

<p>

&quot;The Pentagon must show that it is serious about sexual harassment
and military readiness,&quot; Maginnis said.  &quot;While Aberdeen
Proving Ground's sexual harassment hotline continues to ring off
the hook, pornography will remain on its shelves.  If the Pentagon
won't read the research, they must listen to female U.S. Army
officers based in Bosnia who complain about the 'rampant presence
of pornography, which is offensive to women, degrading to the
command atmosphere and encourages misconduct.'&quot;

<center><h2>TV RATING SYSTEM CALLED<br>
AN &quot;END-RUN AROUND PARENTS&quot;</h2>

<p>

<h3><i>Hollywood Looking for &quot;Excuse to Pollute,&quot; 
Bauer says</i></h3></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The TV industry's proposed age-based rating
system is &quot;an excuse to pollute the airwaves,&quot; said
Gary L. Bauer, President of the Family Research Council on Wednesday,
one day before the industry prepares to release its ratings system.

<p>

Bauer made the following statement: &quot;Parents ought to be
able to tell whether a television program contains explicit sexual
scenes, vulgar language, violence and graphic murder portrayals,
or homosexual themes and references. What parent, in their right
mind, would accept a package at the front door labeled simply;
'Suitable for your 10-year-old,' and hand that package to their
child without checking further?  Parents need to know the contents
of the programming that Hollywood wants to give to our children.

<p>

&quot;What Hollywood thinks is acceptable is not the issue. The
entertainment industry should help parents make intelligent decisions
for their children with content-based ratings. Any claims that
more informative labels are not possible ring false when you consider
that many cable stations already provide information on program
content before a movie or show.

<p>

&quot;The age-based ratings constitute an end-run around parents,
who will be told that it is up to them to be monitors at all times
and in all places their child might be affected.  A similar system
was unveiled in 1965 for the movie industry, and it freed film
makers from any sense of responsibility.

<p>

&quot;You be the judge:  In 1965, <I>The Sound of Music</I> was
awarded the Oscar for Best Picture.  Four years later, the X-rated
<I>Midnight Cowboy</I>, about a bisexual hustler, won for Best
Picture.  Hollywood's attitude seems to be, as long as we rate
it, we can make anything we want and parents should shut up.

<p>

&quot;The new ratings system will perpetuate, not clean up, a
culture already soaked with sex, violence and foul language,&quot;
Bauer continued.  &quot;It's like setting a bunch of drunk drivers
loose on the streets while telling motorists that, in return,
they'll get upgraded bumpers and seat belts.  The industry needs
to clean up its act, period.  And content-based ratings could
help in that effort.&quot;

<p>

<center><h2>SUPREME COURT TO REVIEW COMPUTER PORN RULING</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The Supreme Court announced Friday
that it will review the <i>Reno v. ACLU</i> decision to enjoin
the Communications Decency Act made earlier this year by a three-judge
panel in Philadelphia.

<p>

Family Research Council Director of Legal Studies Cathy Cleaver
said that the Department of Justice's appeal of the Philadelphia
ruling is the right thing to do, and that now the Supreme Court
has the opportunity to &quot;reverse the radical ruling which
gave Bob Guccione the right to give his <I>Penthouse</I> magazine
to our children on the Internet.&quot;

<p>

Cleaver continued, &quot;Laws against selling porn magazines to
kids are not unconstitutional.  Why should we have to tolerate
the same degrading images of women being given to those same kids
on-line?&quot;

<p>

Family Research Council presented a &quot;friend of the court&quot;
brief with the Philadelphia judges in <I>ACLU v. Reno</I> defending
the cyberporn provisions of the Communications Decency Act.  Cleaver
said the Philadelphia decision contradicts previous Supreme Court
decisions on the distribution of indecent material through the
media.

<p>

The Communications Decency Act:

<p><ul>

<li>Prohibits adults from using a computer to send indecent pornography 
directly to a known child

<p>

<li>Prohibits adults from knowingly displaying indecent pornography to 
children

<p>

<li>Defines &quot;indecent material&quot; as material, which in context, 
depicts or describes sexual or excretory activities or organs in a patently 
offensive manner

<p>

<li>Imposes fines, prison sentences (up to 2 years), or both on violators

<p>

<li>Exempts those who merely provide access to a network or system over 
which they have no control

<p>

<li>Provides limited defenses for employers and those who make a reasonable 
and effective effort to restrict children's access to pornography

<p>

<li>Expands telephone harassment prohibitions to include harassment by 
computer

</ul><p>

Arguments will likely be heard in early spring.  Family Research
Council and other pro-family and anti-pornography groups will
be filing briefs in support of the Justice Department's defense
of the law.

<center><h2>Judge Chang Has &quot;Ravished the Rule of Law<br>
in Hawaii,&quot; FRC's Knight Says

<p>

Calls Marriage Ruling a &quot;slap in the face of Hawaiians<br>
-- and Americans everywhere,&quot; and Asks for Judge's<br>
Removal from Office</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;In striking down Hawaii's state
law that preserves marriage as the union of one man and one woman,
Judge Kevin Chang has ignored the wisdom of the ages, the will
of the Hawaiian people, and ample evidence of the state's compelling
interest in preserving this vital institution&quot; said Robert
Knight, Director of Cultural Studies for the Family Research Council.

<p>

&quot;His ruling legalizing the fiction of homosexual 'marriage'
essentially destroys the rule of law in Hawaii, and is a slap
in the face of  the Hawaiian people, who have made abundantly
clear their wish to resist judicial tampering with society's foundational
institution,&quot; Knight continued.  &quot;It is also a slap
in the face of the American people, who overwhelmingly support
marriage as a union reserved to one man and one woman.&quot;

<p>

Knight asserted that the Hawaiian Attorney General's office deliberately
underargued the case by &quot;ignoring a  mountain of evidence
that homosexuality is destructive to individuals, families and
society and that homosexuality is a changeable condition.

<p>

&quot;The state hung its case on a single factor -- the possible
effects on children -- which Judge Chang apparently has ignored,&quot;
Knight continued.  &quot;Concern for children, all by itself,
should have been enough reason for a sitting judge to uphold the
rule of law, of nature and of nature's God,&quot; Knight said.
&quot;No law that contradicts the fundamental moral law is legitimate.
This means that the court has now acted lawlessly, and the people
of Hawaii, who have spoken repeatedly and clearly about this issue,
would be well justified in seeking Judge Chang's removal from
the bench.

<p>

&quot;This decision underscores Congress' wisdom in enacting the
Defense of Marriage Act, which protects other states from the
Hawaiian courts' reckless activism.

<p>

&quot;It's time for Americans to examine and to exercise ways
to nullify the actions of judges who flout the law.  This is no
small legal matter but an assault on morality and the rule of
law itself.  Hawaiians can assist the entire nation by ending
the judicial arrogance that has precipitated this national threat
to marriage.&quot;

<center><h2>POLL FINDINGS ARGUE AGAINST NEW<br>
WELFARE ROLE FOR HILLARY</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</B> First Lady Hillary Clinton recently
touched off a firestorm (even within her own party) when she revealed
that she intends to take on a &quot;formal&quot; role on welfare
issues in the coming months.  Apparently, Mrs. Clinton envisions
leading an effort to reverse some of the key features of the welfare
reform legislation passed last year by the Congress and signed
by the President.

<p>

<b>But a new poll commissioned by the Family Research Council
finds that most Americans strongly support the new welfare bill
and do not want to see it reversed</b>. The survey, which was
conducted in November, 1996 by the Voter/Consumer Research polling
firm, found that only 12 percent of the 1,000 registered voters
surveyed felt that welfare reform &quot;has already gone too far.&quot;
Another 11 percent said that President Clinton and the Congress
&quot;have done enough&quot; to reform welfare, and a whopping
<b>72 percent said that the President and the Congress &quot;should
do more to reform welfare.&quot;</b>

<p>

In addition, another question in the FRC survey found Americans
quite unwilling to return to &quot;the era of big government.&quot;
When asked whether &quot;President Clinton and the Congress should
return to a greater role for the federal government in addressing
the country's domestic problems or should they continue cutting
back the size of the federal government,&quot; 62 percent called
for further cuts in government spending.  Only 26 percent supported
an increased federal role.

<p>

&quot;These poll findings make it clear that Hillary Clinton's
objectives on welfare are at odds with the will of most Americans,&quot;
FRC President Gary L. Bauer said today.  &quot;If the First Lady
wants to carry out the people's wishes on welfare reform, she
should be shouting, 'Charge!,' rather than 'Retreat.'&quot;

<center><h2>CENSUS STUDY PRESENTS MIXED PICTURE</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council Sr. Writer
for Cultural Renewal William Mattox on Tuesday called the results
of a new Census Bureau report on household and family characteristics
a &quot;mixed picture.&quot;  He said the new Census numbers show
that:

<p>

<li><b>Reports of the traditional family's death are greatly exaggerated.</b>
The report begins by asking, &quot;Are 'traditional' households
dead?;&quot; and then gives great attention to the fact that &quot;married,
with children&quot; families  now comprise only 25 percent of
all households.

<p>

But buried within the report is an acknowledgment that more than
half of all households are headed by a married-couple (some of
whom have yet to have children while others have already raised
children) and an acknowledgment that much of the growth of non-family
households is due to the rise in the number of elderly people
living alone after the death of their spouse.

<p>

Moreover, when one looks only at the universe of <I>families</I>
-- rather than all households -- more than three-fourths (77 percent)
of all families are headed by a married couple, and seven in ten
families with children are headed by a married couple.  Thus,
to a certain degree, the more things change, the more they remain
the same.

<p>

<li><b>The rise in single-parent households continues to be a cause
for concern.</b> While we should not overlook the prevalence
of married-couple families, neither should we ignore the significant
rise in single-parent households.  Clearly, the dramatic rise
in the number of single-parent households is the most disturbing
demographic change of the last 25 years.   While it is reassuring
to know that most families are still headed by a married couple,
the fact that single-parent households have nearly doubled in
number over the last quarter-century is a clear sign that all
is not well on the home front.

<p>

<li><b>The rise in unmarried households should not be a cause for
celebration.</b> Unlike the spin doctors in the Census Bureau's
public relations department, many Americans are troubled by the
rise in unmarried households.  Among those most likely to view
recent trends as a cause for concern are children being raised
without the benefit of two parents (a group we know to be growing
in size) and single women who would like to be married (a group
that appears to be growing in size -- if the fact that <I>The
Rules</I> stands atop the current best-seller list is any indication).

<center><h2>FRC TALKS TURKEY</h2>
<h3><i>OFFERS RESULTS OF RECENT POLL<br>
OUTLINING MENU FOR ACTION IN 105th CONGRESS</i></h3></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Just as the Pilgrims and the
Native Americans learned to live harmoniously together, the American
people definitely want Congressional Republican leaders and the
Democratic President to work together in the coming year,&quot;
said Gary L. Bauer on Tuesday as Family Research Council released
its 1996 post-election poll.

<p>

But after being served bland mashed potatoes day after day for
most of the 1996 presidential campaign, Americans responding to
a recent Voter/Consumer Research poll commissioned by the Family
Research Council want to make sure the menu for action in the
105th Congress includes:

<p>

<h4>1. THE MAIN COURSE:</h4>

<p>

<li><b>A Pro-Family Tax Cut Big Enough to Put a Turkey in Every
Pot.</b> Seventy-two percent of the 1,000 Americans responding
to the FRC survey say they favor a cut in federal income taxes.
In the 104th Congress, the House and Senate passed (but President
Clinton vetoed) a tax cut bill which included a $500 per-child
tax credit.  When the 105th Congress convenes in January, this
pro-family tax measure should be at the top of the economic agenda.

<p>

<h4>2. THE TRIMMINGS:</h4>

<p>

<li><b>More Carrots for the States to Continue Welfare Reform.</b>
One of the major achievements of the 104th Congress was the passage
of a welfare reform bill which, among other things, offers states financial
incentives for lowering their out-of-wedlock birth rate.  When
asked about the welfare reform issue, 72 percent say President
Clinton and the Congress &quot;should do more to reform welfare,&quot;
11 percent say their elected officials in Washington &quot;have
done enough to reform welfare,&quot; and only 12 percent say that
&quot;welfare reform has already gone too far.&quot;

<p>

<li><b>Balanced-Budget Peas that Must Be Eaten.</b> Seventy-one
percent of Americans responding to the FRC poll say they &quot;strongly
favor&quot; balancing the budget.  Another 22 percent say they
&quot;somewhat favor&quot; this policy objective.

<p>

<li><b>Sweet Potatoes -- with No Artificial Sweeteners Added (Not
Even for Medicinal Purposes).</b> Seventy-one percent of the
public say they &quot;strongly favor&quot; increased federal efforts
to fight drug trafficking. Another 15 percent &quot;somewhat
favor&quot; this objective. Moreover, 71 percent say President
Clinton and his top officials have failed to pull their weight
in America's war on drugs. Only 24 percent say the Clinton adminstration
has &quot;been doing what could be expected.&quot;

<p>

<li><b>Educational Choice of Whole Apples, Cut Apples, Cooked Apples,
Applesauce, Apple Pie, Etc.</b> Seventy-one percent of the public
say they support education vouchers that would give &quot;parents
the ability to choose the private or public school their children
attend.&quot;  Apparently, this support is not only broad, but
is also quite deep -- two-thirds of those who favor school choice
say they do so &quot;strongly.&quot;

<p>

<li><b>Fat-Free Desserts (since the Era of Big Government Is Over).</b>
Sixty-two percent of the respondents say they believe
the President and the Congress should &quot;continue cutting back
the size of government.&quot;  Only 26 percent say they want their
elected officials to &quot;increase the federal government's role&quot;
in addressing American's domestic problems.

<p>

<h4>3. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS (Table Rules, Manners, etc.)</h4>

<p>

<li><b>Extra Seats at the Table for Babies Saved by Abortion Restrictions.</b>
Seventy-three percent of the respondents say they favor efforts
to require &quot;the consent of parents before a teenager is given
abortion counseling or referrals.&quot;  A similar majority (60
percent) express support for parental consent &quot;before teens
are given condoms, pills, or other forms of birth control.&quot;

<p>

<li><b>No Seconds (or Other Special Privileges) Until Everyone Is
Served.</b> More than four out of five Americans (83 percent)
say that gays and lesbians in the workplace should <i>not</i>
&quot;be given special protections, like those given to minorities
or the disabled.&quot;  Only 13 percent say they support measures
to extend job protections to gays and lesbians (like the legislation
Senator Ted Kennedy championed in the 104th Congress).  Moreover,
64 percent say they think the news and entertainment media devote
&quot;too much attention to homosexuality.&quot;  Only eight percent
say there is &quot;not enough&quot; coverage of these issues.

<p>

<li><b>A Prayer of Thanksgiving Acknowledging God's Providence.</b>
Nearly half of all Americans (44 percent) say the news and
entertainment media devote too little attention to the role of
religion in American life.  Thirty-seven percent say the amount
of media attention given religion is &quot;about right.&quot;
Only 14 percent say &quot;too much&quot; attention is devoted
to religion by the news media.

<p>

The Voter/Consumer Research survey for the Family Research Council
was conducted by telephone from November 6 through November 10,
1996, under the direction of FRC policy analyst Bill Mattox.
The sample of 1,000 registered voters was selected by using random-digit
dialing procedures.  The margin of error was roughly plus or minus
three percentage points.

<center><h2>BAUER ISSUES CHALLENGE TO GOP</h2></center>

<p>

<i>Gary L. Bauer, President of the Family Research Council and a 
Republican strategist challenged the Republican Party today to 
find its voice on values and to redirect its economic policy toward 
working class and middle class families. Here are some exerpts from 
his speech at the Heritage Foundation</i>.

<p>

"The great danger facing America is not from barbarians at the gates, 
but the sickness of our own hearts. What is at stake is whether this 
great experiment in ordered liberty under God can survive. That was 
the great issue that should have been central to the presidential 
election. Instead, in some bizarre role reversal, the party most 
associated with the permissiveness of the last thirty years constantly 
talked about values, while the party, <b>my</b> party, that counts on 
the votes of millions of Americans worried about our virtue deficit, 
instead seems obsessed with our wallets ...

<p>

"The warning signs of the failure of the 1996 campaign were these 
from the beginning. Our unelected party leadership was obsessed for 
the last four years with the mantra of 'big tent'. A big tent for 
what? To what end? To change America how? To improve the prospects 
for our families and children in what way? We can mock Bill Clinton's 
bridge to the 21st century, but it at least signals ideas. Big tent 
signals that when it comes to ideas we don't care enough to make a 
case for what we believe ...

<p>

"The key fact of the American economy is this: It is getting harder, 
not easier, for working families to make ends meet. Yet the elite of 
my party often seem not to recognize the problem. It isn't just a 
problem of slow economic growth. The real problem is that the take-home 
pay of workers has fallen behind the growth of the economy. They get to 
keep less and less of what they earn. Here's a stunning fact. We have 
created 10 million-plus new jobs, but only eight million more workers 
are now employed. Every three workers are holding down four jobs. One 
income used to provide for a family. Then it took two. Now, increasingly, 
it takes three! ...

<p>

"The days are over when a few Washington think tanks can be allowed 
to make elite economic policy for a party that is increasingly the 
party of small businesses, entrepreneurship, and Main Street. There 
is much to be done, from pro-family tax reform to placing entitlements 
on a sound footing. But the goals of these efforts can be summarized 
in a single phrase: we must be, we <b>will</b> be, for working families. 
We must support families that 'work' in that they are able to support 
themselves with the fruits of their labor ...

<p>

For way too long now both political parties have been guided by 
political consultants, pollsters and focus group gurus who substitute 
media manipulation for a governing philosophy. We need to look no further 
for the growing cynicism of the American people. I have little influence 
on the Democratic Party, so this advice will be to my fellow Republicans. 
Save your donors a lot of money by jettisoning the whole political clique 
of Washington manipulators. You don't need them to tell you what to 
believe. This is the party of Lincoln. Appeal to the better angels of 
the American people and trust them to respond as they always have when 
they hear the truth."

<center><h2>'A MISSION IMPOSSIBLE':<br>
MILITARY'S POLICY ON WOMEN IN COMBAT</h2></center>

<p>

<b>Washington, D.C. --</b> &quot;Sexual harassment and criminal
misconduct should be strongly condemned and the guilty must be
prosecuted.  But anyone who has worked with mixed gender settings
in a 24-hour per day, high stress and away-from-home environment
knows such settings are ripe for sexual improprieties even under
the best leaders,&quot; said Robert Maginnis, Director of Family
Research Council's Military Readiness Project, and retired military
on Thursday. &quot;But the result is a two-fold problem.&quot;

<p>

&quot;The first issue, and most important, is a moral one. The
incidence of outright coercion by officers against the women in
their command shows that character does matter. The breakdown
of values and lack of moral character are creating a debt that
men and women are paying and will pay well into the future. The
vulnerable become victims of the ruthless.

<p>

&quot;The Armed forces must make sure that those responsible for
misconduct receive swift and sure punishment. American parents
must be assured that their daughters who serve their country will
not be raped or forced into harmful, sexual situations.

<p>

&quot;The second issue is a different kind of problem -- that
of consensual sex within the military ranks. Because of the pressure
to ignore the differences between men and women in the name of
political correctness, we are creating a recipe for national disaster.
Our attempts to incorporate women are nothing like the successful
polices that integrated the races because the two issues are completely
different. With gender policies, problems will continue as long
as men and women are sexually attracted.

<p>

&quot;These radical changes came without Congress answering the
question, 'Does removing most exemptions for women promote military
readiness?' The answer for many commanders is no! We have created
sexually tense situations.

<p>

&quot;Consider this sad situation: Calls to Aberdeen's sexual
harassment center have exceeded 3,100 and involve all services
reaching back to World War II. So far, 341 cases are under
criminal investigation.

<p>

&quot;As planes begin to lift-off for Zaire for yet another deployment
of soldiers to primitive and wrenching places, <B>it's time to
rethink why we have saddled the military with a mission impossible</B>.
Sex happens when men and women stay long enough in forced intimate
situations. It happened in Haiti and Somalia, aboard dual gender
ships and in Bosnia. It will happen in Zaire, too. Sexual relationships
in units hurts effectiveness.

<p>

&quot;The goal of the military is to protect and defend the Unites
States of America. But social experiments are weakening the men
and women on whom we all depend. Those guilty of sexual impropriety
must be punished, and the status of  women in the Armed Services
must be reviewed to protect those who serve.&quot;

<center><h2>'96 ELECTION A WIN FOR CONSERVATIVES --<br>
REAL AND PRETEND, SAYS BAUER</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Bill Clinton's
victory began when he recast himself as a pro-family conservative
and modeled Ronald Reagan's re-election campaign,&quot; Family
Research Council President Gary L. Bauer said Wednesday about
the election. &quot;As the President moved to the right, many
people were led to believe that his pro-family speeches meant
he had abandoned his liberal agenda. What we're more likely to
see is the same Bill Clinton of the last four years who will appoint
liberal judges, advance gay rights and insist on abortions even
in the ninth month of pregnancy.&quot;

<p>

Bauer continued: &quot;Once again, we see the winning formula.
Those candidates that support lower taxes, smaller government,
family values and respect for life get elected. Those who focus
on economics alone lose. Our hope is that the Republican leadership
finally understands this.

<p>

&quot;Throughout the campaign the true heart of the Republican
resurgence was evident in the conservative tone of the issues
supported and the race for the right. 'Liberal' was a dirty word
... even Bill Clinton took time on the stump to help redefine
Paul Wellstone as a conservative.

<p>

&quot;The big mistake the media and pundits make now is to ignore
the mandate the newly elected congress has to pursue principled
economic and family policy. Despite millions of dollars spent
by the labor unions and the Democratic Party, the vast majority
of the freshman House members survived -- strengthened by their
values.

<p>

&quot;This Congress has a mandate to act on behalf of the family
-- to support genuine family tax relief, to reenact the Partial
Birth Abortion Ban Act -- a critical issue that helped to bring
Ann Northup to the House -- and to act aggressively on the drug
problem that threatens our children. And since <I>everyone</I>
now claims to be a pro-family conservative, perhaps some of these
things can be achieved.&quot;

<center><h2>&quot;PORNOGRAPHY AWARENESS WEEK&quot;...<br>
BATTLING PORNOGRAPHY IN THE<br>
INFORMATION AGE</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;From protecting minors from on-line
pornography to eliminating the government's role as pornography
salesman, the 104th Congress took significant steps in waging
the ongoing war against pornography in the changing environment
of the Information Age,&quot; Family Research Council Director
of Legal Studies Cathy Cleaver said Thursday.  &quot;Celebrate
these victories during this year's <B>'Pornography Awareness Week'
(Oct. 27 - Nov. 1)</B>, but keep in mind that the cable and cyberporn
battle is far from over.&quot;

<p>

<h4>PROGRESS MADE....</h4>

<p><ul>

<li>Pro-family support made passage of the Communications Decency
Act (CDA) possible. With a strong provision to combat cyberporn,
the CDA prohibits adults from knowingly sending or displaying
indecent material to minors on the Internet.

<p>

<li>Additional protection for children came in the Child Pornography
Prevention Act of 1996.  It extends existing child pornography
restrictions to include any visual depiction that <I>appears to
be</I> a child engaging in sexually explicit conduct.  In other
words, it prohibits &quot;simulated&quot; pictures created by
computer programs, &quot;morphing&quot; images together, artistic
renderings which look like real children, and pictures of young
adults who are made to look like and are advertised as children.

<p>

<li>Congress also passed an amendment to the 1997 Defense Authorization
Act that prohibits the sale or rental of pornography by the government
anywhere on U.S. military property.

</ul><p>

<h4>THE ROAD AHEAD FOR CYBERPORN...</h4>

<p>

The Department of Justice
this month appealed to the Supreme Court a Philadelphia federal
court's ruling against the CDA. (<I>ACLU v. Reno</I>)  The court's
decision allows adults to knowingly send and display pornography
to minors on the Internet and maintains that it is &quot;either
technologically impossible or economically prohibitive&quot; for
pornographers to comply with the regulations. FRC filed a brief
defending the cyberporn provisions in the CDA and will continue
at the Supreme Court level to support ways to protect children
from on-line pornographers.

<p>

Cleaver said, <b>&quot;Cyberspace is our children's new playground,
and it is a world where pornography knows no bounds.  Failure
to defend strong laws would be like leaving a loaded gun in that
playground.  Families report that this is a serious problem, and
the burden of protecting children from exploitation should not
rest solely on them.&quot;</b>

<center><h2>SUPREME COURT &quot;KNOWS A SOLID RULING<br>
WHEN IT SEES ONE,&quot; FRC SAYS

<p>

FRC COMMENDS COURT'S DECISION TO<br>
UPHOLD LAW EXCLUDING HOMOSEXUALS<br>
FROM MILITARY SERVICE</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council commended the
Supreme Court's decision Monday to turn down a challenge to the
law excluding homosexuals from military service in <I>Thomasson
v. Perry</I>.  &quot;The Court knows a solid ruling when it sees
one,&quot; FRC Attorney Melissa Wells-Petry said Monday. &quot;Military
people support the ban and so do the American people.&quot;

<p>

FRC was given the rare opportunity to present oral arguments in
this case before the Fourth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.  Wells-Petry,
a former Army lawyer who has defended the military's ban on homosexuals
for years, submitted friend-of-the-court arguments to the effect
that the dismissal from the Navy of Lt. Paul G. Thomasson, a self-identified
homosexual, should be upheld.

<p>

&quot;The Fourth Circuit not only upheld the law excluding homosexuals
from military service,&quot; Wells-Petry continued, &quot;it also
made hash of the Administration's regulations implemented to enact
the law.&quot;

<p>

Technically, FRC and the Clinton Justice Department were on the
same side of this case, however their arguments differed greatly.
The Justice Department opposed FRC's arguments, which were based
on the intent of the law passed by Congress rather than on the
often contradictory directives prepared by the Administration
to implement the law.  The Justice Department also submitted a
brief opposing FRC's participation.  The Justice Department rested
their case, as their brief stated, on the &quot;paramount interest
in defending the validity of Directives&quot; issued to implement
the law.

<p>

&quot;Friends of the armed forces are pleased the Court let this
excellent ruling stand,&quot; Wells-Petry said.

<center><h2>&quot;ONCE GAY, ALWAYS GAY&quot; NOT TRUE,<br>
LOVE OFFERS REAL HOPE, KNIGHT SAYS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;For too long, many people have
come to believe that people with homosexual desires cannot change. <b>The
'once gay, always gay' fiction has persuaded more than a few Americans
to support so-called 'gay rights' out of a misdirected sense of
compassion.</b> But it is anything but compassionate to tell
someone they have no hope of change and that they might as well
indulge in sexual behavior that is unhealthy, immoral and in many
cases, even fatal,&quot; Bob Knight said Thursday during a ground
breaking news conference.

<p>

Knight, Family Research Council Director of Cultural Studies,
participated in a 9:30 a.m. news event to unveil PFOX -- Parents
and Friends of Ex-Gays (Contact: Anthony Falzarano) -- a new,
national parents group that will counter the pro-homosexual PFLAG. The
news event, which included former homosexuals and lesbians, also
highlighted the Second Annual National Coming OUT OF Homosexuality
Day. (Contact: Michael Johnston)

<p>

Knight made the following comments during the news event at the
<b>National Press Club</b>:

<p>

&quot;Over on the mall this week, the AIDS quilt is a silent and
wrenching testimony to the hundreds of thousands of people struck
down with premature death.  The quilt also symbolizes tragic choices
made by many people who were misled into believing they had no
other option.  How many of these sons, daughters, fathers, brothers
or sisters would be alive today if they had had access to compassionate
people like these around me who have been caught up in sexual
or drug addiction but have broken the deadly pattern?

<p>

&quot;Today's message is very simple:  No one has to be 'gay.'
No one should reject a family member because that family member
is 'gay.' But love does not require accepting behavior that is
harmful. In fact, real love in action is a conscious effort to
steer someone away from behavior that can hurt or even kill. 
It isn't always easy, but it can be done, as evidenced by the
many who have.

<p>

&quot;Parents, Family and Friends of Ex-Gays (PFOX), which is
being introduced today, has been formed to aid people who have
family members struggling with homosexuality.  PFOX is dedicated
to correcting the many distortions and increasingly abusive assertions
made by homosexual activist groups against those with whom they
disagree. The homosexual activist movement despises and attacks
the ex-gay movement out of fear that these people are exactly
who they say they are: people once in bondage to homosexuality
but now freed to pursue a fuller life. But their lives are evidence
of options rarely discussed but very real.&quot;

<p>

<i><b>NOTE: From 10-11 a.m. on Friday, Oct. 11, former homosexuals
and lesbians will join together for a time of testimonials, sharing
and outreach on the West Front of the Capitol. Their efforts are
timed to coincide with the AIDS Quilt.  All are welcome.</b></i>

<center><h2>ASSISTED SUICIDE CASES DRAW<br>
ATTENTION OF PRO-FAMILY GROUPS</h2>

<p>

<h3><i>Stop the &quot;cheapening of human life,&quot; Cleaver 
says</i></h3></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The Supreme Court Tuesday announced
its decision to review two recent U.S. federal court cases on
assisted suicide.  The Ninth Circuit in <I>Glucksberg v. Washington</I> 
struck down a Washington statute prohibiting doctors from
prescribing lethal &quot;medication&quot; as violative of the
Constitution's liberty interest, using reasoning identical to
the Supreme Court abortion cases.  <I>Quill v. Vacco</I> from
the Second Circuit concluded that New York's anti-assisted suicide
violated the Equal Protection Clause on the ground that there
is no difference between &quot;allowing nature to take its course&quot;
and intentionally causing death.  Family Research Council is preparing
<I>amicus</I> briefs on these cases for the Supreme Court, urging
the Court to reverse the decisions from Washington and New York.

<p>

Director of Legal Studies Cathy Cleaver said, <b>&quot;It is a
tragic irony that our country is moving to a place where we prohibit
only the killing of the healthy and strong, while we sanction
the killing of the frailest members of our own families: our
unborn children and elderly parents and grandparents.&quot;</b>

<p>

Cleaver cited a recent report produced at the request of Congressman
Charles Canady on euthanasia in the Netherlands:  &quot;The <B>Netherlands
Report</B> presents some alarming facts,&quot; Cleaver said. 
&quot;In 1990 alone, 2,300 people were killed by Netherlands doctors
in its euthanasia program.  While this is certainly tragic, what
is more shocking is that, in the same year, more than 1,000 people
were <I>euthanized without their consent</I>; 140 of these cases
involved a fully competent person who was never given a choice.&quot;
<B>Euthanasia perverts and demeans the health profession by not
giving doctors the tools of life but rather putting in their hands
the instruments of death.</B>

<p>

Cleaver continued, &quot;The cheapening of human life which was
begun with the sanctioning of killing of our unborn children must
not be expanded to include the elderly or disabled who may be
the weakest and most needy among us.  The persons most likely
to be pressured into assisted suicide are the very people who
need us most to help them rise above depression and illness. 
A truly compassionate society will offer assistance and hope to
its citizens in need; relegating them to the morgue is the height
of utilitarian arrogance and greed.&quot;

<center><h2>DON'T FUND DR. DEATH, FRC SAYS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council commended Friday
the efforts of Rep. Charles Canady in the production of the Congressional
Report on Assisted Suicide in the Netherlands.  FRC Director of
Legal Studies Cathy Cleaver said Friday she believes the report
is an important contribution to the debate concerning physician
assisted suicide and euthanasia in America.

<p>

<b>Cleaver said, &quot;It is a tragic irony that our country is
moving to a place where we prohibit only the killing of the healthy
and strong, while we sanction the killing of the frailest members
of our own families:  our unborn children and elderly parents
and grandparents. Euthanasia perverts and demeans the
health profession by not giving doctors the tools of life but
rather putting in their hands the instruments of death.&quot;</b>

<p>

FRC also praised the efforts of Senators John Ashcroft and Byron
Dorgan to prohibit federal funding for assisted suicide.  Already
in Oregon, the director of Medicaid has announced his intention
to use federal funds for assisted suicide.

<p>

&quot;The <b>Netherlands Report</b> presents some alarming facts,&quot;
Cleaver said.  &quot;In 1990 alone, 2,300 people were killed by
Netherlands doctors in its euthanasia program.  While this is
certainly tragic, what is more shocking is that, in the same year,
more than 1,000 people were <I>euthanized without their consent</I>;
140 of these cases involved a fully competent person who was never
given a choice.&quot;

<p>

This October, the Supreme Court is likely to announce its decisions
regarding review of two recent U.S. federal court cases on assisted
suicide.  The Ninth Circuit in <I>Glucksberg v. Washington</I> struck
down a Washington statute prohibiting doctors from prescribing
lethal &quot;medication&quot; as violative of the Constitution's
liberty interest, using reasoning identical to the Supreme Court
abortion cases.  <I>Quill v. Vacco</I> from the Second Circuit
concluded that New York's anti-assisted suicide violated the Equal
Protection Clause on the ground that there is no difference between
&quot;allowing nature to take its course&quot; and intentionally
causing death.  Family Research Council is preparing <I>amicus</I> 
briefs on these cases for the Supreme Court.

<p>

Cleaver continued, &quot;The cheapening of human life which was
begun with the sanctioning of killing of our unborn children must
not be expanded to include the elderly or disabled who may be
the weakest and most needy among us.  The persons most likely
to be pressured into assisted suicide are the very people who

<center><h2>DEATH SENTENCE FOR UNBORN IS STAIN ON<br>
THE LAND OF THE FREE, HOME OF THE BRAVE</h2>

<p>

<h3><i>THIS ISSUE WILL NOT GO AWAY, BAUER SAYS</i></h3></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;This tragic vote, condemning
the lives of thousands of our children, will not be the end of
debate over Partial Birth Abortion. The President and those who
stood with him should be ashamed for blinding themselves to tragic
deaths in an attempt to win political points,&quot; Family Research
Council President Gary L. Bauer said Thursday after the Senate
voted 57 to 41 -- 8 votes short of those needed to overturn Bill
Clinton's veto.

<p>

&quot;The only pain Bill Clinton seems to feel is his own. This
vote is about the kind of 'choice' people make when they see others
dying on a roadside. Some stop to help. Others keep walking. It
is inhumane to know how children are being killed as they pass
through the birth canal -- and do nothing.

<p>

&quot;Partial Birth Abortion is the sleeper issue of 1996. It
is a measure of the kind of people we are.

<p>

&quot;This vote will not rest easy on the conscience of the American
people. This is a nation built on the idea that all people are
created equal. This will stick in their throats. We are a better
country than one that takes the lives of defenseless children
in this way.&quot;

<p>

Earlier today Gary Bauer stood with many distinguished senators
and a dozen of pro-family, pro-life, and religious leaders, including
Dr. James Dobson, in the office of Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott to denounce partial-birth abortion and to call on the Senate
to override President Clinton's veto of the Partial-Birth Abortion
Ban Act.

<center><h2>ENOUGH BLAME, TIME FOR ACTION IN<br>
WAR ON DRUGS,<br>
FRC SAYS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, DC --</b> &quot;It's time to wake up and admit that
we have a major crisis on our hands,&quot; FRC Senior Policy Analyst
Bob Maginnis said Thursday. &quot;For the second time in a month,
new statistics have been released showing a dramatic increase
in the number of teens who use drugs.&quot;

<p>

According to a study released Wednesday by the National Parents'
Resource Institute for Drug Education (PRIDE), the number of teens
in grades six through twelve using illicit drugs on a daily basis
increased 147 percent in the past decade.

<p>

These latest findings, along with the results of the Columbia
University study released in August, are a cause of great concern
to parents, teachers and politicians alike.  A joint Congressional
hearing Thursday will look into the causes of the recent jump
in teenage drug use.

<p>

&quot;The current Administration has virtually ignored the fact
that anti-drug abuse campaigns like former First Lady Nancy Reagan's
'Just Say No' program work,&quot; Maginnis said, &quot;There is
a definite correlation between the absence of such high-profile
nationalized efforts and the recent rise in drug use among teens.&quot;

<p>

&quot;It's time to stop complaining and get to work,&quot; Maginnis
explained. &quot;We've dropped the ball on the drug issue.  All
the evidence says the same thing, 'Talk to your kids about drugs.
Make them aware of the real dangers surrounding drug abuse, and
they will be less likely to experience firsthand the pain of addiction.'
We also need to reconsider a balanced interdiction and demand
reduction policy.&quot;

<p>

Maginnis returned last week from Zurich, Switzerland where he
addressed the Association for the Advancement of Psychological
Understanding of Human Nature and several other international
organizations on the topic of teen drug abuse in the U.S.

<center><h2>SLEEPER ISSUE OF 1996 WAKING UP<br>
PRO-FAMILY MAJORITY, BAUER SAYS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Americans of many faiths stand
here today in unity because of the horrifying reality of Partial
Birth Abortion,&quot; <b>Family Research Council President Gary
L. Bauer</b> said Thursday morning, before the anticipated Senate
veto override vote. &quot;In recent days, liberals and conservatives,
Democrats and Republicans and those who worship in many ways have
joined their voices to speak for those children killed as they
pass through the birth canal.&quot;

<p>

Bauer made the following statement from the U.S. Capitol with
leaders from the Protestant, Catholic and Jewish communities.
The news conference followed an ecumenical prayer breakfast for
our nation's children and the partial birth abortion vote.

<p>

<b>&quot;However this vote goes, this will not rest easy on the
conscience of the American people. This is a nation built on the
idea that all  people are created equal. This will stick in their
throats. We are a better country than one that takes the lives
of defenseless children in this way. The President should be ashamed.

<p>

&quot;Partial Birth Abortion is the sleeper issue of 1996</b>.
It has proved a powerful rallying cry for many Americans. And
as it is described, more and more people recoil in horror from
what really happens to thousands of our children.

<p>

&quot;It is an issue that is waking up a pro-family majority.
And it is an issue that illustrates just how radical Bill Clinton's
abortion position is. <b>Apparently, he does not feel the pain
of healthy children</b> killed moments from birth. <b>Apparently
he does not feel the pain of children who may have handicaps to
overcome</b>, but have a world of love to offer.

<p>

&quot;We Americans have to choose what kind of people we will
be. This 'choice' screams of injustice.&quot;

<p>

<center><h2>REAGAN-PROCLAIMED &quot;RELIGIOUS<br>
FREEDOM WEEK&quot; SIGNIFIES BATTLE FAR<br>
FROM OVER FOR PEOPLE OF FAITH,<br>
FRC SAYS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council announced this
week its support for &quot;Religious Freedom Week,&quot; beginning
Sept. 23.  Proclaimed in 1988 by President Ronald Reagan, Religious
Freedom Week began because &quot;(t)he American people have long
recognized that the liberty we cherish must include the freedom
to worship God as each of us pleases.&quot;

<p>

In celebrating Religious Freedom Week, FRC, whose motto is &quot;Defending
Family, Faith, and Freedom,&quot; joins hundreds of pro-family
organizations and religious institutions to acknowledge the importance
of faith and religious freedom in our country.

<p>

In believing that our Founding Fathers did not intend to establish
the principle of &quot;freedom <I>from</I> religion&quot; but
rather &quot;freedom <I>of</I> religion, &quot; FRC policy and
legal analysts have worked for years on ways to promote and protect
the freedoms people of faith enjoy in this country.

<p>

FRC President Gary Bauer has taken the issue of religious freedom
to Capitol Hill on numerous occasions testifying before Congress
on a proposed Religious Liberty Amendment and on the world-wide
persecution of Christians.

<p>

The rising occurrence of church burnings and of religious persecution
both in schools and in the workplace reveals the need for continued
efforts to restore the original intent of our Founding Fathers
in the Constitution.  As President Reagan noted, the First Amendment
&quot;is the protection of religion and conscience from government
interference.  It creates neither hostility between government
and religion nor a civil religion of secularism.&quot;

<p>

Plans have already begun to build greater awareness for Religious
Freedom Week in 1997. FRC policy analysts and government affairs
office have also begun developing policy initiatives and legislative
strategies to protect religious liberty in the 105th Congress.

<center><h2>PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION:<br>
'THE SLEEPER ISSUE OF 1996'</h2>

<p>

<h3>Bauer commends House;<br>
calls on Senate to overturn Clinton veto</h3></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Partial birth abortion is the
sleeper issue of 1996,&quot; Family Research Council President
Gary L. Bauer said Thursday. As the House voted 285 to 137 to
overturn President Bill Clinton's veto of legislation to ban a
horrific procedure used in the late stages of pregnancy, Bauer
made the following comments.

<p>

&quot;The fact that the late-term abortion technique called Partial
Birth Abortion even exists shows just how terrible is the slippery
slope message that children should be 'planned and wanted' before
having value. Americans on both sides of the life debate have
joined together to say that this cruel procedure goes too far.

<p>

&quot;The Clinton administration has presented us with tremendous
irony this week in their defense of Partial Birth Abortions and
their aggressive support of abortion-causing drugs, called RU-486,
and then their surprise at the increase in child abuse. When the
political elite use the bully pulpit to argue that life has no
value unless it's healthy, planned and desired, society's weakest
members become vulnerable.

<p>

&quot;Family Research Council commends the House for their courage
in highlighting a procedure so terrible, it could not be used
on animals ... and should not be used for our unborn. And we call
on the Senate to join their collegues from both sides of the aisle
to overturn Clinton's veto of the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act.&quot;

<p>

<h2>HOUSE TO VOTE ON PARTIAL-BIRTH<br>
ABORTION OVERRIDE THURSDAY</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> On the day of the vote to override
President Clinton's veto on the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act
(H.R.1833) in the U.S. House of Representatives, Family Research
Council Director of Communications Kristi Hamrick said, &quot;By
telling people that only 'planned and wanted' children have value,
we have opened a deadly Pandora's box for our most helpless members
of society.

<p>

&quot;This week in the news, we see the Clinton administration
pushing chemical abortions, talking about partial-birth abortions
and then commenting on an increase in child abuse. But it is no
surprise to pro-family Americans that children are being injured
as we communicate the message that children are not a blessing,
but an option or a problem.  We must talk about all children --
born and unborn -- as valuable and worthy of our sacrifices for
them. Pro-family America calls on all members of Congress to override
the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act veto. We must act today to
support all our children.&quot;

<p>

The House will begin one hour of debate at 10:30 a.m. Thursday
morning followed by a vote.

<p>

<center><h4>What Experts are Saying About Partial-Birth 
Abortions</h4></center>

<p>

&quot;I believe that Mr. Clinton was misled by his medical advisors
on what is fact and what is fiction in reference to late-term
abortions.  Because in no way can I twist my mind to see that
the late-term abortions as described -- you know, partial-birth,
and then destruction of the unborn child before the head is born
-- is a medical necessity for the mother.  It certainly can't
be a necessity for the baby.  So I am opposed to ... partial birth
abortions.&quot;

<p>

-- <i>World-renowned pediatric surgeon and former Surgeon General
C. Everett Koop, in an August 19, 1996 interview with <U>American
Medical News</U>, &quot;The view from Mount Koop,&quot; p.3.</i>

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

&quot;Pro-choice activists categorically insist that only 500
of the 1.5 million abortions performed each year in this country
involve the partial-birth method, in which a live fetus is pulled
part way into the birth canal before it is aborted ... But interviews
with physicians who use the method reveal that in New Jersey alone,
at least 1,500 partial-birth abortions are performed each year
-- three times the supposed national rate.  Moreover, doctors
say only a 'minuscule amount' are for medical reasons.&quot;

<p>

-- <i>&quot;The facts on partial-birth abortion,&quot; by Ruth
Padawer, <U>The Sunday Record</U> (Bergen County, NJ), September
15, 1996.</i>

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

&quot;Congress, the public -- but most importantly women -- need
to know that partial-birth abortion is never medically indicated
to protect a mother's health or her future fertility.  On the
contrary, this procedure -- which has never been evaluated in
mainstream, peer reviewed literature -- can pose a significant
threat to both her immediate health and future fertility...  We,
and many other doctors across the United States, regularly treat
women whose unborn children suffer these and other serious conditions.
Never is the partial-birth procedure medically indicated.  Rather,
such infants are regularly and safely delivered live, vaginally,
with no threat to the mother's health or fertility.  Sometimes,
as with hydrocephalus, it is first necessary to drain some of
the fluid from the baby's head.  And in some cases, a cesarean
section is indicated.  In no case is it medically necessary to
partly deliver the child vaginally, and then terminate his or
her life before completing the delivery.&quot;

of more than 230 physicians, mostly professors and other specialists
in obstetrics, gynecology, and fetal medicine.</i>

<center><h2>RU-486: IT'S NO MIRACLE CURE</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;WHERE ARE THE GUARDIANS OF WOMEN'S HEALTH?&quot; HSU 
ASKS</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;The Food and Drug Administration
has a responsibility to ensure the safety and effectiveness of
any drug that would be marketed for U.S. consumption. <b>But
with this rushed acceptance of RU-486, the FDA has clearly shown
that those safeguards can be ignored for political purposes</b>,&quot;
Family Research Council analyst Gracie Hsu said Wednesday as the
news broke of the conditional approval of the abortion-causing
drug regimen.

<p>

&quot;The Clinton Administration threw its political weight behind
pushing this abortion-causing drug past the safeguards that protect
American women. But this interference was not to save women's
lives. It wasn't for a breast cancer treatment or even for experimental
drugs for life-threatening diseases like AIDS.  It was simply
to approve a drug whose sole purpose is to end the life of a child,&quot;
Hsu said.

<p>

<center><h3><u>QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ANSWERED:</u></h3>

<p>

<h4>HOW WILL RU-486 AFFECT WOMEN'S HEALTH?</h4></center>

<p>

During the U.S. clinical trials earlier this year, four women
required blood transfusions because they lost so much blood, 15
women required surgery, 21 required hospitalization, 13 percent
required treatment for bleeding, and five percent of all the women
in the study required narcotics for the pain.  All of these side
effects happened in spite of the fact that the women who participated
in the clinical trials were highly motivated, closely monitored,
and underwent follow-up.  We can expect that women will suffer
results far worse than these when RU-486 becomes available to
all U.S. women without the ideal conditions associated with clinical
trials.

<p>

Furthermore, the FDA has still failed to answer pressing questions
regarding how RU-486 will affect women's health.  For example,
if the drug fails to result in a complete abortion -- whether due
to drug inefficacy or failure of the woman to comply with protocol -- the
medical complications could be severe, i.e., infection,
sterility, or giving birth to a deformed baby.  There is also
a dangerous void of research about the long-term effects of RU-486
on women, including the future fertility of women, the possible
link with breast cancer, and the medical complications resulting
from the drug's accumulation in the body.

<p>

Beyond these issues of physical health, RU-486 will also negatively
impact women's emotional and psychological health.  The numbers
of women suffering from post-abortion trauma are already reaching
a critical mass, and we can expect these numbers to dramatically
increase with the introduction of RU-486.  This is because RU-486
requires women not only to take the abortion drug with their own
hand, but also to bear the psychological trauma of viewing their
unborn children after the &quot;products of conception&quot; are
passed.

<p>

<center><h4>WHO WILL BE RESPONSIBLE IF WOMEN BLEED TO DEATH?</h4></center>

<p>

The Clinton administration partnered with an abortion advocacy
organization, the Population Council, to bring RU-486 to the United
States. The drug manufacturers did not advocate or advance this.
Therefore, who will be legally responsible for what happens to
women?  Will women who are harmed by the drug have recourse to
sue?  Will the American taxpayers foot the bill for any problems
since this administration pushed the drugs even without the corroboration
of a drug manufacturer?

<p>

<center><h4>*Most asked media question*<br>
WHERE WILL THE PRO-LIFE MOVEMENT GO IF THERE ARE NO
PRAYERFUL PROTEST SPOTS?</h4></center>

<p>

The pro-life community is hardly confined to abortion clinics.
Rather, the pro-life movement is composed of concerned citizens
all across the United States who believe that human life is valuable
at all stages of life, from the moment of conception to the time
of natural death.  While some in the pro-life community choose
to peacefully protest abortion by praying in front of abortion
clinics, the pro-life community is widely represented by its compassion
for women in crisis pregnancies.  Crisis pregnancy centers provide
pregnant women with hope in the form of financial, material, and
emotional support.  These pregnancy care centers also provide
loving counsel for those women who suffer from post-abortion trauma.
Furthermore, adoption agencies provide women with a way to give
their children the gift of a family.  These ministries to women
will not change, but the pro-life community is saddened that the
approval of RU-486 will only cause more women to seek their services
as more women face the tragedy of post-abortion trauma.

<center><h2>FRC EQUIPS <i>MOMS AND DADS</i> WITH<br>
<i>SCHOOL SURVIVAL GUIDE</i>, A TOOL FOR<br>
KEEPING PARENTS AWARE AND<br>
INVOLVED</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;WHAT A DIFFERENCE A PARENT MAKES,&quot; BAUER SAYS</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council released Tuesday
the 1996 <I>Moms and Dads School Survival Guide</I>, a 64-page
resource to help parents stay informed and involved in their children's
educational process.

<p>

&quot;Parents today are spending too much time combating condoms,
offensive curriculum, and failed federal programs,&quot; FRC President
Gary Bauer said upon the release of the <I>Survival Guide</I>.
&quot;While test scores plummet, horror stories about flagrant
breaches of parental rights are coming to us from around the country.&quot;
Here are some of the stories:

<p><ul>

<li>On March 19, 1996, 59 sixth-grade girls in East Stroudsburg,
Pennsylvania, were required to submit to a genital examination
as part of a &quot;routine&quot; physical.  Without parental consent,
the school conducted the exams blocking the exit door and refusing
to allow the crying and pleading young girls to call their parents.

<p>

<li>Psychological testing under the guise of standardized testing
includes intrusive questions about the child's emotional state
and his relationship with his parents.  For example, a 149-question
survey used in Minnesota public schools without parental approval
contains questions such as:  Have you ever tried to kill yourself?
How often have you run away from home?  Have you felt so discouraged
or hopeless that you wondered if anything was worthwhile?

<p>

<li>In Stephens County, Georgia, parents were shocked to discover
that their 14- and 15-year-old daughters had been driven to a
birth control clinic by a public school staffer without their
knowledge.  The county clinic dispensed birth control pills and
condoms to the girls and administered Pap smears and AIDS tests.
The parents were then denied access to the test results by the
school, which defended its actions on the grounds that the counselor
believed she was doing what was best for the girls.

</ul><p>

Author and FRC Education Policy Analyst Jennifer A. Marshall said
the <I>Moms and Dads School Survival Guide</I> was designed to
help parents not only know their rights in these situations but
also how to prevent them from happening in the future.

<p>

&quot;Families need not simply survive school,&quot; Marshall
said. &quot;They should be free to thrive and excel in any environment
- public, private, or home-based education.  Parents playing an
active role makes all the difference in children's educational
attainment.  They are the key to everyday school survival, and
we need to equip them to do the job they do best.&quot;

<p>

The <I>Survival Guide</I> is a detailed look at educational issues
facing all parents, whether they help with homework or homeschool.
The guide defines education jargon, like &quot;outcome-based
education,&quot; &quot;one-stop shopping center,&quot; and &quot;vouchers&quot;;
it explains students' religious liberties in the public school;
and it details what parental rights are and how parents can defend
them.  The <I>Guide</I> also introduces parents to the variety
of educational options available to them, including classical
and parent-based education.  Extensive reference lists place key
resources, from newsletters to on-line information, at parents
fingertips.

<p>

&quot;Parents are looking for alternatives and answers every day,&quot;
Marshall said. &quot;By getting information into the hands of
each parent, this guide is a simple, yet powerful way to restore
parents to their proper place at the helm of their child's educational
journey.&quot;

<center><h2>FRC SUPPORTS BILL TO ELIMINATE<br>
GOALS 2000</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;This long overdue legislation will send federal
tax dollars back where they are needed the most -- in the hands
of the parents and teachers who can best decide how to use them,&quot;
Marshall says.</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, DC --</b> Family Research Council supported the
&quot;Goals 2000 Elimination Act&quot; introduced by Rep. Lindsey
Graham (R-SC) at a news conference on Capitol Hill Wednesday.

<p>

&quot;This legislation repeals the federal Goals 2000 program
and sends its funding back where it belongs,&quot; FRC policy
analyst Jennifer A. Marshall said, &quot;to the local school boards,
elected by parents and community members, who have the authority
to make decisions for their own schools.&quot;

<p>

&quot;Goals 2000 snatched local authority and put it in the federal
government's hands.  Under Goals 2000, state and local school
districts must spend their money according to Washington's bureaucratic
priorities, not their local needs,&quot; Marshall said.

<p>

&quot;Take a closer look at Goals 2000 and you'll see that it's
not about the 3 R's.  Read the eight national education goals
and objectives, and you'll find Goals 2000 talking about enhanced
prenatal health care, comprehensive sex education and requirements
for American businesses with regard to education.  The program
isn't about education -- it's about using our schools to forward
a broad, liberal social agenda,&quot; Marshall explained.

<p>

&quot;We all know that education in America is suffering,&quot;
Marshall says, &quot;but Goals 2000 is not the solution.  Enhanced
social services -- including school-based health care and sex
education beginning as early as kindergarten -- can't solve the
fundamental crisis our schools.  A return to what schools <I>ought</I>
to do best -- teaching the academic basics like reading, writing
and arithmetic -- is the right answer.

<p>

&quot;FRC applauds Rep. Graham's commitment to the family and
to education as demonstrated by the Goals 2000 Elimination Act.&quot;

<center><h2>&quot;AMERICA DODGES THE BULLET,&quot;<br>
BAUER SAYS OF ENDA DEFEAT</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;America has dodged the bullet,&quot;
Family Research Council President Gary Bauer said of the Senate's
narrow (49-50) defeat of the so-called Employment Non-Discrimination
Act (ENDA).

<p>

&quot;For the U.S. Senate to come within one vote of enshrining
homosexuality along with race, sex and ethnicity in our nation's
civil rights laws represents a disconnect from reality.

<p>

&quot;Many ENDA supporters equated homosexuality with being black
or Hispanic. But minority groups that enjoy special protections
do so because of group histories of political powerlessness, economic
deprivation and unchangeable characteristics.  Homosexuals do
not qualify in any of these categories.

<p>

&quot;This was a homosexual jobs bill, pure and simple. It would
have forced employers to keep detailed records of the private
sexual preferences of their employees. How bizarre that the defenders
of <I>the constitutional right of privacy</I> were prepared to
annihilate privacy in the service of the homosexual agenda.

<p>

&quot;ENDA would have led, inexorably, to quotas and set-asides.
All the most divisive social conflicts in America today would
have been inflamed by the passage of this ill-advised legislation.
Can nearly half of our senators really want that?  Supporters
of  ENDA shrewdly used paper exemptions for churches and synagogues
to create a facade of deference to the religious community.  But,
make no mistake, this bill would have been used as a sledgehammer
to smash faith-based, for-profit institutions -- like religious
broadcasters, like religious publishing houses and bookstores,
like summer camps for religious youth.

<p>

&quot;Passage of ENDA would have signaled the contempt of Senate
liberals for the legitimate rights of the states, one-third of
which still list sodomy as a crime. Worst of all, ENDA would have
encouraged more young people to enter an immoral and unhealthy
lifestyle. Society cannot be indifferent to the signals -- subtle
and not-so-subtle -- that it sends its youth. ENDA would have meant
that the U.S. government doesn't care whether young people who
are struggling with their sexual identity resolve to live normal,
heterosexual lives or not.

<p>

&quot;But this <I>is</I> a day to savor victory. It is sweet because
it was so hard won. The overwhelming vote of the Senate (85-14)
in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA)
sends a clear message that this basic institution is valued and
will be fought for. No one can take seriously the argument that
it is beneath the dignity of the Senate to debate the survival
of marriage. Failure to pass DOMA would have exposed the entire
federal union -- <I>all</I> the states, <I>all</I> branches of the
federal government -- to the dangers of an imperial judiciary. With
this stunning vote, the Supreme Court of Hawaii has all the justification
it needs to <I>reject</I> gay marriage. Let's put this bad idea
to rest now -- and forever. President Clinton should now eat his
spinach and sign DOMA immediately.&quot;

<center><h2>SENATE'S PASSAGE OF DOMA IS<br>
&quot;A VOTE FOR COMMON SENSE,&quot; BAUER SAYS</h2>

<p>

<h4>Calls on President to &quot;eat your spinach<br>
and sign the Defense of Marriage Act&quot;</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council President Gary Bauer
hailed the overwhelming vote of 85 to 14 by the U.S. Senate to
pass the Defense of Marriage Act, which puts the bill on President
Clinton's desk.

<p>

&quot;Now that Congress has done its job and passed this wise
and needed legislation, we are saying to the President, 'eat your
spinach and sign the Defense of Marriage Act as you promised.'&quot;
Bauer said. &quot;Given the gravity of the judicial challenge
in Hawaii, it is imperative that DOMA become the law of the land
as soon as possible so that the states won't be forced to accept
counterfeit 'marriage' should the Hawaiian courts take the radical
step of destroying the traditional definition.

<p>

&quot;It is amazing that we even had to fight a battle to ensure
that marriage remained the legal union of a man and a woman,&quot;
Bauer continued. &quot;But it was also heartening that so many
people around the nation rallied to defend this irreplaceable
institution.  The huge margin of victory was won by millions of
people who let their representatives know how they felt.&quot;

<p>

&quot;We commend Sen. Nickles and Reps. Bob Barr and Steve Largent
for their leadership in bringing the Defense of Marriage Act to
passage.

<p>

&quot;Failure to pass DOMA would have jeopardized the moral foundation
upon which the rest of society is built,&quot; Bauer continued.
&quot;Marriage has already suffered a loss of respect thanks
to the sexual revolution.  Many people are struggling with broken
families and are trying to put their lives back together.  Many
have prevailed over difficult circumstances and sought a better
life for their own families.  But society must never deliberately
raise the bar higher for the next generation of children. They
deserve the marriage-based blessings that previous generations
have enjoyed.

<p>

&quot;America's commitment to marriage has been strengthened by
this Act.&quot;

<center><h2>ENDA WOULD USHER IN NATIONAL<br>
HOMOSEXUAL AGENDA, KNIGHT SAYS</h2>

<p>

<h4>&QUOT;'GAY JOBS BILL' THREATENS FREEDOMS OF RELIGION,<br>
CONSCIENCE, ASSOCIATION AND SPEECH&QUOT;</h4></center>

<p>

&quot;The Employment Non-Discrimination Act (HR 1863; S972) is
a radical change in workplace discrimination law,&quot; said Robert
Knight, Family Research Council's Director of Cultural Studies.
This legislation, sponsored by Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA), is
currently under consideration in the Senate and could be voted
on at any time.

<p>

&quot;What is being described as a harmless gesture of 'tolerance'
toward homosexuals in the workplace is actually a mighty weapon
to be used against both employers and employees who believe that
homosexuality is wrong.  This 'gay jobs bill' threatens the freedoms
of religion, conscience, association and speech,&quot; Knight
said.  &quot;ENDA puts children's camps, Christian- and Jewish-owned
businesses, and many other institutions in the crosshairs of homosexual
activist lawyers.  At its root,&quot; Knight noted, &quot;ENDA
would distort the concept of civil rights by creating an unprecedented
behavioral component whose outer limits cannot even be imagined.

<p>

&quot;The so-called 'religious exemption' in Kennedy's amendment
is so narrow that it will leave millions of devoutly religious
Americans exposed to the heavy hand of big government.  ENDA's
sweeping protection based on &quot;sexual orientation&quot; eliminates
any legitimate questions as to appropriateness of sexual behavior,&quot;
Knight said.  &quot;ENDA guarantees an onslaught of costly litigation
which could hurt small businesses most of all.

<p>

&quot;ENDA paves the way for quotas based on sexual preference,
regardless of a provision that stipulates that no quotas are allowed;
(remember Hubert Humphrey's promise in 1964 that the Civil Rights
Act would never lead to quotas?); prohibits employers from disciplining
or taking into account in any way sexual activity <b>on or off
the job</b> by an employee (the term &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
is infinitely expandable); defines &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
so broadly that all sexual proclivities, from pedophilia to bisexuality,
are given special protection and therefore moral status on a par
with sex within marriage; and suggests the federal government
is officially supportive of sexual promiscuity, since bisexuals
by definition have sex with more than one person.

<p>

&quot;People want homosexuals to have the same rights -- not more
rights -- in the workplace as anyone else,&quot; Knight said.  &quot;The
federal government has no business ordering millions of Americans
to accommodate behavior that they believe is wrong and destructive.&quot;

<i>&quot;ON DRUGS<br>
THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S CURIOUS<br>
SURRENDER&quot;</i></h2>

<p>

<h4>Available NOW along with other policy works
on the growing drug problem in America.</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;The policy debate over the drug
problem has radically changed from one that tried to find effective
ways of keeping our children from drugs to 'harm reduction' strategies
which facilitate 'safer' drug use ... and you can see the result
of that seriously flawed switch,&quot; said Robert L. Maginnis,
drug policy analyst for the Family Research Council. The policy
expert made his comments as more evidence was unveiled this week
on the growing drug crisis in America.

<p>

&quot;Illicit drugs kill 20,000 Americans every year,&quot; Maginnis
noted. &quot;We must get serious about the life and death struggle
that casual attitudes toward drug use ignore.&quot;

-- the fight for Dole's senate seat<br>
-- the Speaker's home state<br>
-- the state of a governor who has been on the short list of

</ul><p>

<li><I>New York Times'</I> polling shows what Gary Bauer has said
all along, the people making up the GOP delegation are primarily
pro-life.

<p>

<li>To the contrary of what pro-abortion Republicans have said,
the platform remains a document that reflects the majority view
of the GOP -- that life is an important issue.

<p>

<li>Gary Bauer continues to be a champion in the fight for life,
meeting with the majority of the delegation repeatedly during
these days to find reasonable ground.

<center><h2>DO YOUR KIDS INFLUENCE YOUR VOTE?<br>
FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL SAYS<br>
TRACK THE &quot;PARENT GAP&quot;</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON --</b> In the last presidential election, the &quot;Parent
Gap&quot; proved to be far bigger than the &quot;Gender Gap,&quot;
as voters with children in the home showed less support for Clinton
than childless voters or empty nesters.  In fact, &quot;the demographic
peers of George Bush and Ross Perot were more responsible for
the election of Bill Clinton and Albert Gore than any other age
group,&quot; noted Family Research Council Vice President for
Policy Bill Mattox.

<p>

Mattox made his observations in &quot;The Silent Minority -- The
Hidden Electoral Impact of Children&quot; based on original, scientific
polling FRC commissioned after the last presidential election.

<p>

On Wednesday, Mattox noted that the research tracks with current
polling which underscores that <i>marriage and property ownership
are good indicators</i> of whether someone votes conservatively.

<p>

&quot;<i>But tracking marriage alone is not enough</i>. The presence
of children in the home is sometimes even more important than
marital status,&quot; Mattox said.

<p>

<b>In the last election, &quot;none of the standard demographic
variables -- gender, income, ethnicity, religion, age, marital
status, or education -- was as reliable in predicting whether
or not someone voted for Clinton as the presence of children in
the home,&quot; Mattox reported.</b>

<p>

In fact, the presence of children in the home is a good indicator
of conservative leanings as a whole and a heightened interest
in &quot;values&quot; issues specifically, Mattox said.

<center><h2>FDA SHOULD NOT APPROVE RU-486 DUE TO<br>
ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS, FRC SAYS</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;The federal government should not promote a drug whose 
sole purpose is to destroy human life,&quot; Policy Analyst Gracie 
Hsu says.</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Indeed, we would all be outraged 
if the federal government ever issued an approval of Dr. Kevorkian's 
killing machine simply because he claims there are 'therapeutic' 
effects for his patient,&quot; Family Research Council Policy Analyst 
Gracie Hsu said Thursday.  &quot;We know otherwise.  In the same way, 
the federal government should not give its imprimatur to RU-486 
because no government should ever be responsible for the killing 
of innocent human beings or an accomplice to the mothers who would 
take the lives of their own children.&quot;

<p>

Hsu made her statement as Family Research Council and the National 
Right to Life Committee co-sponsored a news conference on the 
medical risks and legal implications of RU-486.   The news conference 
was held one day before a hearing by the Reproductive Health Drugs 
Advisory Committee of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to 
consider whether the abortion drug RU-486 should be recommended for 
use in the United States. Hsu is scheduled to testify before the 
Advisory Committee Friday.

<p>

&quot;It is unacceptable for the federal government, through the 
vehicle of the FDA, to promote a drug whose sole purpose is to 
destroy the life of another human being.  There are no therapeutic 
effects of RU-486,&quot; Hsu said.

<p>

&quot;Furthermore, the FDA has an ethical duty not to approve a 
drug that would be harmful to the mothers taking the drug.  We 
already know that at least one woman in Iowa lost so much blood 
as a result of taking RU-486 that she almost died.  And there are 
other issues regarding the abortion drug's safety and efficacy.  
For example, if the drug fails to result in a complete abortion -- 
whether due to drug inefficacy or failure of the woman to comply to 
protocol -- the medical complications could be severe, i.e., 
infection, sterility, or giving birth to a deformed baby.  There 
is also a dangerous void of research about the long-term effects 
of RU-486 on women, including the future fertility of the women, 
the possible link with breast cancer, and the medical complications 
resulting from the drug's accumulation in the body.

<p>

&quot;The FDA has heretofore compromised its objectivity and ethical 
standards because FDA Commissioner David Kessler promised that he 
would place RU-486 on a fast track and approve the drug within six 
months.  FRC calls on the FDA to halt its attempt to circumvent its 
own approval statutes to ensure safe and effective drugs for the 
sake of the lives and safety of both women and children.&quot;

<center><h2>FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL PULLS OUT<br>
OF &quot;STACKED&quot; HEARING UNDER STRONG<br>
PROTEST</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Ordinarily, we are honored to
be invited to testify at a congressional hearing, but we won't
allow ourselves to be used as a fig leaf for a propaganda party
on a homosexual 'civil rights' bill,&quot; said  Robert H. Knight,
Director of Cultural Studies for the Family Research Council.
&quot;It is obvious that they are staging this stacked hearing
now to try to cripple final passage of the Defense of Marriage
Act.&quot;

<p>

Knight had been slated to testify on July 17, 1996 before the
Government Programs Subcommittee of the House Small Business Committee,
chaired by Rep. Peter Torkildsen (R-MA).  The topic was to be
the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) (HR 1863) which would
give homosexuals special rights in the workplace that other employees
do not enjoy.

<p>

Knight, who had testified in 1994 before the U.S. Senate Judiciary
Committee on an earlier version of the bill, canceled after learning
the lineup of witnesses.  The July 17 hearing lineup consisted
of three panels, with 10 of 12 people speaking for ENDA.

<p>

The first panel was slated to be of five businesspeople, all of
whom were supporters of ENDA.  The second panel was to consist
entirely of purported &quot;victims&quot; of discrimination because
of their sexual orientation.  No speakers were invited who had
suffered at the hands of homosexual activists wielding 
&quot;anti-discrimination&quot; charges. No former homosexuals were 
invited to counter the faulty research that has been publicized on 
causes of homosexuality.

<p>

The final panel was to have included Family Research Council and
a spokeswoman from the Small Business Survival Committee, along
with two pro-homosexual witnesses.

<p>

Both Family Research Council and Small Business Survival Committee
pulled out of the hearing, citing similar reasons:  the hearing
was a stacked showcase for ENDA, and not enough notice was given
to attain more witnesses to provide balance.  The Small Business
Survival Committee representative also said she had a prior commitment.

<p>

&quot;Torkildsen's Massachusetts colleague, Sen. Ted Kennedy,
has announced his intention to attach ENDA to DOMA when the bill
is considered in the Senate.  Since this addition would be unacceptable,
it is clearly an attempt to kill DOMA,&quot; Knight said.

<p>

&quot;ENDA is being raised at this time not on its own merits
but as a vehicle that they hope will derail the Defense of Marriage
Act (DOMA) which passed the House on a vote of 342-67,&quot; Knight
said.  &quot;Why would anyone who supports DOMA want to be a party
to this charade?&quot;

<p>

&quot;President Clinton has said he <I>would sign it in its current
form</I>. Any effort to tamper with the language might jeopardize
final passage of the bill,&quot; Knight said.

<p>

Family Research Council had urged the Chairman's staff to contact
several other potential witnesses, including Anthony Falzarano,
Director of Transformation Ex-Gay Ministries in Washington, D.C.;
Seattle businessman Bryan Griggs, who was forced to defend himself
against a false charge of discrimination by a homosexual employee,
and Joseph Broadus, a George Mason University law professor and
expert in civil rights law.  Falzarano was never contacted; Broadus
was unable to be reached, and Griggs received a call at about
3:30 p.m. Washington time the day before the hearing, after Family
Research Council and Small Business Survival Committee had pulled
out under protest.  Statements from Broadus, Falzarano and Griggs
are available from Family Research Council.

<p>

&quot;The timing of the hearing and the lack of balance constitute
a naked attempt to use ENDA as a way to harm passage of DOMA,
and Family Research Council will not be used as a pawn in this
cynical game,&quot; Knight said.

<center><h4><i>** MEDIA ADVISORY **</i></h4>

<p>

<h2>RU 486: SUNNY RHETORIC OR BLOODY REALITY?</h2></center>

<p>

On <b>Thursday, July 18</b>, one day before the FDA Advisory Board
hearing to review the application to market the RU 486 abortion
technique in the United States, Family Research Council and a
number of national pro-life groups will hold a news briefing to
highlight the viewpoints of medical and legal experts on the dangerous
aspects of RU 486.

<p>

<center>The news conference will be held:<br>
<b>Thursday, July 18, 1996<br>
10:00 a.m.<br>
First Amendment Room, National Press Club</b></center>

<p>

This highly controversial drug has been put on the fast track.
Reports claim that the American trials have had no serious problems,
however there are many crucial questions that remain unanswered.
In fact, one doctor's patient was close to death after having
an RU 486 abortion.  Dr. Mark Louviere, an Iowa physician who
supports legalized abortion, will speak Thursday about his experience
administering the drug to a patient who lost more than half of
her blood volume after taking RU 486.

<p>

Other doctors and an attorney will address the many risks and
complications of RU 486, including: the psychological trauma,
safety and liability issues, and the problems with the approval
process.  For example, five Committee members and the executive
secretary of the Advisory Committee may have a conflict of interest
and bias in favor of abortion.

<p>

Family Research Council Policy Analyst <b>Gracie Hsu</b> will
testify Friday before the Advisory Committee for Reproductive
Health Drugs and will be present at the news conference for interviews.

<center><h2>FAMILIES SALUTE CONGRESS ON DEFENSE<br>
OF MARRIAGE VOTE</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;It is not intolerance to believe in traditional morality,&quot; 
Bauer says.</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;<b>Defending normalcy is not
an intolerant act.</b> It is not intolerance to believe in traditional
morality. The vast majority of Americans, from Hawaii -- where
this attack on marriage originates -- to the other 49 states,
all agree that marriage is the bringing together of the two sexes.
Family Research Council applauds this historic affirmation of
marriage,&quot; Family Research Council President Gary L. Bauer
said Friday.

<p>

Bauer made the following statement after the House voted 342 to
67 to pass the Defense of Marriage Act, which would define marriage
as the union of a man and woman in federal law and would allow
states to refuse to recognize same sex unions as marriage.

<p>

Bauer said: &quot;<b>We commend those pro-family champions who
voted today to protect marriage</b> from the aggressive legal
actions of homosexual activists and the ambitions of liberal judges.
The House made an important first step in defending marriage from
its attackers. <b>Family Research Council calls on the Senate
to also support the foundational, fundamental union of marriage
when the bill reaches it shortly. And FRC calls on the Senate
to reject diversionary efforts -- as the House did -- to alter
the bill.

<p>

&quot;Often I am asked, what does it matter if two men or two
women down the street want to call what they have 'marriage'?
Why does it hurt you or your marriage? Well it doesn't -- unless
they bring the law into it.</b> Then the fiction is imposed on
everyone and the counterfeit will do great harm to the special
status that genuine institution has earned. The force of law would
come against businesses, school and all institutions -- such as
the Boy Scouts -- that do not embrace homosexuality as a good
and normal behavior.

<p>

&quot;There are many relationships in which love is involved.
But marriage is a unique bonding of the two sexes, with the probable
expectation of procreation of children. It is the core of civilization
and is universally honored.

<p>

&quot;Good men and women of varying beliefs have been subjected
to a barrage of name-calling and abuse for simply saying that
marriage ought to be the union of a man and a woman and that the
law should protect this vital social norm. <b>It is not hatred
to prefer normalcy</b>.&quot;

<center><h4>** MEDIA ADVISORY **</h4>
<h2>FRC TO TESTIFY ON CAPITOL HILL...</h2></center>

<p>

<li><h4>GARY BAUER ON THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT</h4>

<p>

On <B>Thursday, July 11</B> at <B>10:00 AM</B>, Family
Research Council President Gary Bauer will testify before the
Senate Judiciary Committee in support of the Defense of Marriage
Act (S. 1740). The hearing will take place in the <B>Senate Dirksen
Building, Room 226</B>.

<p>

&quot;This is by far one of the most crucial pieces
of legislation ever to be voted on in Congress,&quot; Bauer said
Wednesday. &quot;This bill was not invented to oppress a segment
of our society, but rather to defend the institution of marriage
- the core of our civilization - from being redefined into oblivion.&quot;

<p>

The House of Representatives is tentatively scheduled
to vote on DOMA (H.R. 3396) on Friday, July 12.

<p>

<li><h4>GRACIE HSU ON ABSTINENCE</h4>

<p>

Also on <B>Thursday</B> at <B>9:30 a.m.,</B> FRC

<center><h2>SUPREME COURT DECISION FREES CABLE<br>
OPERATORS TO REFUSE PORNOGRAPHIC<br>
PROGRAMS</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;Major Court victory will allow local cable companies
to protect our children from pornography,&quot; Cleaver
says.</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> American families fighting to shelter
young children from cable television pornography won a major battle
today as the Supreme Court upheld the right of private cable operators
to screen pornographic programs from their leased access channels
in its <I>Denver Area Educational Telecommunications Consortium,
Inc. v. FCC</I> decision. &quot;This is a major victory for parents,
children and the First Amendment alike,&quot; says Cathy Cleaver,
Director of Legal Studies for the Family Research Council.

<p>

&quot;The Court's reaffirmation of the indecency standard as a
check to determine which material is suitable for children is
significant,&quot; Cleaver continued. A June 12th federal district
court decision in Philadelphia ruled that the definition of indecency
as &quot;patently offensive communication, taken in context, which
describes or depicts sexual or excretory activities or organs,
as measured by contemporary community standards&quot; is too vague
as it applies to the Communications Decency Act (CDA) which sought
to protect children from indecent material on the Internet.  According
to Cleaver, &quot;This latest decision greatly increases the likelihood
of a reversal of the Philadelphia decision when it is heard by
the Supreme Court.&quot;

<p>

In today's decision, the Court upheld the First Amendment rights
of cable operators by giving back to them the editorial power
to decide what programming they <I>do not</I> want to transmit.
However, the Court struck down provisions that <I>required</I>
cable operators to &quot;segregate and to block&quot; transmission
of sexual programs which they <I>choose</I> to show.  The Court
did not free cable operators to refuse pornographic programs on
public, educational or governmental channels because &quot;cable
operators have not historically exercised editorial control&quot;
over such channels.

<p>

&quot;The Court has done its part by giving cable operators the
ability to refuse pornographic programming,&quot; Cleaver said.
&quot;Now it is time for citizens to hold cable operators accountable
to the community.  Anyone who is concerned with this issue should
contact their local cable company and let them know, in no uncertain
terms, that pornography -- on any channel -- is simply unacceptable.&quot;

<center><h2>CLINTON ADMINISTRATION TREADS<br>
ON RELIGIOUS, CIVIL RIGHTS<br>
OF CATHOLICS IN THE MILITARY</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;President Bill Clinton's administration
has gagged Catholic chaplains in the military,&quot; Family Research
Council President Gary L. Bauer noted on Friday.

<p>

In response to a massive post card mailing from the National Conference
of Catholic Bishops calling upon the Congress to ensure the acceptance
of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, HR 1833, Clinton's appointees
in the Pentagon moved to silence Catholic chaplains. An order
was sent from the Pentagon to the military chaplains not to participate
in the post card mailing.

<p>

&quot;Catholic service members and their families will thus be
denied the guidance of their priests and their bishops. They will
also be prevented from participating in an effort to communicate
to the Congress their own strongly held beliefs on one of the
premier moral issues of our day,&quot; Bauer said.

<p>

Bauer said he deplored the Clinton administration action. &quot;This
is denial of the religious and civil rights of Catholic Americans
serving in the military. Every day, these loyal Americans put
their lives on the line to defend our liberties. They deserve
respect, not abuse.&quot;

<p>

Bauer noted Clinton administration claims that the pro-life post
card campaign constitutes &quot;partisan political activity.&quot;
But this claim is belied by the fact that the Partial-Birth Abortion
Ban was passed by overwhelmingly bi-partisan majorities in both
houses. Among the supporters in the House were such leading Democrats
as Minority Leader Dick Gephardt (Mo.), Minority Whip David Bonior
(Mich.) and freshman Patrick Kennedy (R.I.).  In the Senate, respected
senior Democrat, Daniel Patrick Moynihan (N.Y.) vowed to support
the override of Clinton's April 10 veto.  &quot;It's just too
close to infanticide,&quot;  Moynihan said.

<p>

&quot;Family Research Council endorses the efforts of the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops to communicate with their co-religionists
in the armed forces,&quot; Bauer said. &quot;We will stand beside
our friends in defense of children threatened by this hideous
and painful method of abortion.&quot;

<center><h2>ON THE &quot;MORNING-AFTER PILL&quot;:<br>
FRC TO FDA: VOTE NO ON RELABELING,<br>
IT'S NEITHER &quot;EMERGENCY&quot; NOR<br>
&quot;CONTRACEPTION&quot;</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council Director of
Communications Kristi Hamrick on Friday urged the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) to reject relabeling of oral contraceptives
to include abortion-causing uses.

<p>

Mrs. Hamrick said: &quot;Although proponents of the 'morning-after
pill' like to call it 'emergency contraception,' the effect of
relabeling oral birth control pills for post-coital use would
make the pills neither 'emergency' nor 'contraception.'  Indeed,
we can expect that, if relabeling occurs, girls and women may
forgo other forms of birth control and simply choose to consume
larger dosages of the pill after sex.  And, the major function
of the pill when used after sex, if conception has occurred, would
not be 'contraception' (preventing fertilization) but 'abortion'
(preventing implantation of a living human being).

<p>

&quot;On the societal level, the 'morning-after pill' further
distances the act of sex from the physical consequence of pregnancy
and especially from its proper context within marriage.  Therefore,
it would be much harder to send a message of responsible sexual
behavior, especially to young men and women, when the immediate
potential effect of pregnancy is removed.  But even without pregnancy,
sex has consequences -- both physical and emotional.  Without
the fear of pregnancy, some might mistakenly presume that it is
'safe' to engage in sex, and therefore, initiate sex earlier or
engage in sex more frequently with multiple partners.  However,
these behaviors significantly increase the risk of sexually-transmitted
diseases and infertility.  On the emotional level, more often
than not, it is the woman who gets hurt by these noncommittal
liaisons.

<p>

&quot;Furthermore, a 'morning-after' remedy would give men 'a
way out' from assuming responsibility for their sexual behavior,
shifting the power balance even more in favor of men.  The real
result of this overdose of birth control pills would be to cut
more of the moral ground out from under women who are trying to
make good choices for their lives.

<p>

&quot;Why should the FDA be so interested in relabeling oral contraceptives
when the drug manufacturers haven't petitioned for the change?
Currently, consumers can hold their physician liable if a drug
used for off-label purposes results in adverse health consequences.
Relabeling may protect physicians from liabilitiy, but it hardly
helps their patients, especially when long-term physical and social
consequences have not been carefully examined.&quot;

<p>

<i>Mrs. Hamrick made her statements on the eve of the FDA Reproductive
Health Drugs Advisory Committee hearing set for Friday</i> in
Maryland.  The continued push for relabeling comes from liberal
feminist and pro-abortion groups such as Planned Parenthood, the
Center for Reproductive Law &amp; Policy and the American Medical
Women's Association which filed a citizen's petition to force
the issue.

<p>

<b>An FDA decision to relabel oral contraceptives for use as a
&quot;morning-after pill&quot; would be troubling for several
reasons:</b>

<p>

(1) If the girl/woman did indeed become pregnant (post-fertilization),
the morning-after pill <i>would work, except in rare cases, as
an <b>abortifacient</b></i>, thickening the uterine lining to
prevent implantation.  The embryonic human being has already been
alive and growing for about a week, and since human life begins
at the moment of conception, preventing implantation is not 
&quot;contraception,&quot; it is &quot;abortion&quot; and should be 
treated as such.

<p>

(2) Furthermore, there are <i><b>serious potential risks</b></i>
to the women taking the &quot;morning-after pills.&quot;  For
example, it is quite likely that FDA approval of post-coital use
would cause women to change their behavior and use &quot;contraception&quot;
only after sex rather than the currently specified daily dosage
at a particular time.  The effect of consuming larger dosages
of birth control pills frequently is not known. <i>There are
apt to be <b>side effects</b></i>, potentially on future fertility,
possibly producing birth defects in surviving children, certainly
on the woman's immediate health, for it would compound the discomfort
of the regular-dosage &quot;pill&quot; -- nausea, bleeding, etc.

<p>

(3) These &quot;morning-after pills&quot; also <i>give men an
upper hand in <b>highly pressured sex situations</b>, and tilt
the power relationship in favor of the man</i>.  Recent research
reveals that many girls feel pressured to have sex by their boyfriends.
With the availability of these FDA-approved post-coital pills,
no longer can these girls appeal to the fact that they are not
&quot;on the pill&quot; or that they fear pregnancy; indeed, this
removes one of the most effective reasons which these girls may
use to defend themselves.  This could have the societal effect
of cheapening women, and sexual abuse may occur more often.

<p>

(4) One societal consequence of relabeling oral contraceptives
would be to <i>falsely create an equivalency between abortion
and contraception</i>.  It trivializes human life even more to
say that the pills' abortifacient nature in this context is no
more significant than simply using contraception.  It also helps
foster an attitude of irresponsibility with regards to sex, <i>placing
a misguided emphasis on <b>short-term rather than long-term thinking</b>
and consequences</i>.

<p>

(5) Drug manufacturers haven't petitioned for the change. <i>Relabeling
shifts the burden from physicians protecting patients, to patients
protecting themselves</i>.  If patients suffer from adverse consequences
associated with taking the &quot;morning-after pill,&quot; relabeling
may protect physicians from liability, but it doesn't help the
patients who have less recourse against such harm.

<center><h2>SUPREME COURT DOOMS<br>
EDUCATIONAL DIVERSITY</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The Supreme Court today struck down
the Virginia Military Institute's 157-year-old tradition of providing
single-sex education in <I>U.S. v. Commonwealth of Virginia</I>.
The Family Research Council had filed a friend of the court
brief in this case favoring single-sex public colleges.  FRC Senior
Policy Analyst Bob Maginnis noted that the decision &quot;limits
the diversity of education alternatives and obstructs a state's
traditional duty to provide education.&quot;

<p>

Maginnis said, &quot;Through eliminating publicly funded single-sex
education, the Supreme Court effectually instituted the Equal
Rights Amendment which failed to muster support from a majority
of the American people.  The ERA sought to equate gender with
race for discrimination laws despite the obvious differences between
men and women which do not exist among different races.  Nevertheless,
the Supreme Court by-passed the Constitution attempting to equate
race with gender by judicial fiat.&quot;

<p>

While this particular case appears to empower a woman's ability
to select the university of her choice, the shift in equal protection
jurisprudence may invalidate all 87 single-sex education facilities,
82 of which exist for females.  This shift precludes both men
and women from choosing to receive the benefits of single-sex
education.

<p>

Maginnis noted that &quot;research shows single-sex education
enables students to achieve higher educational performance and
encourages women to pursue majors such as science, math, and management.
Recognizing differences between the sexes and preparing educational
curriculum accordingly is rational; ignoring obvious differences
between the sexes in hopes they will disappear is nonsensical.&quot;

<p>

Although single-sex education may still exist in private schools,
the Supreme Court decision eliminates the possibility of single-sex
education for a large segment of the population who cannot afford
the cost of attending a private institution. Maginnis said that
&quot;the options available to individuals seeking an education
most appropriate for their specific needs is eliminated.&quot;

<center><h2><u>MISSION IMPOSSIBLE:</u><br>
REDEFINING MARRIAGE WITHOUT<br>
DESTROYING AMERICAN SOCIETY

<p>

HOW DO WE KNOW?<br>
ASK THE TOUGH QUESTIONS AT A MEDIA<br>
&amp; HILL STAFF BRIEFING ON JULY 2</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> In a special briefing for media and
Capitol Hill staffers, national leaders in the fields of law,
medicine, education and culture will outline the societal implications
of redefining marriage.

<p>

<b>Family Research Council President Gary L. Bauer will host
this historic briefing from 9:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. in the U.S.
Capitol, room HC-5, on July 2. Speakers list TBA.</b>

<p>

&quot;Marriage was not invented to oppress homosexuals,&quot;
Bauer noted. &quot;But most of the conversation on the Defense
of Marriage Act has centered around people's perceptions of the
homosexual experience, rather than on the consequences of  a tremendous
cultural change. The purpose of this event is to present intellectual
answers to the toughest questions. And to introduce national leaders
to the media on a revolutionary topic.

<p>

&quot;We have not begun to discuss, as a nation, the implications
of same sex 'marriage' on the law, our school, or our community.
We have barely acknowledged the many benefits of marriage between
a committed man and woman. We owe it to ourselves to understand
the possible outcomes of this unprecedented change.&quot;

<center><h2>GARY BAUER AND GRASSROOTS LEADERS ON<br>
THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT ...

<p>

HOW DOES AMERICA VIEW AN END TO<br>
MARRIAGE BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE?</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> For a discussion of the grassroots
implications of redefining marriage, reporters, columnists and
editors should plan to attend a <B>9:30 A.M. MONDAY, JUNE 24</B>
news conference in the <B>MAIN LOUNGE</B> of the <B>NATIONAL PRESS
CLUB</B>. Family Research Council President Gary L. Bauer and
grassroots leaders will detail the need for the Defense of Marriage
Act along with the implications of destroying this pivotal union.

<p>

&quot;Nothing is as foundational for a culture as family. And
with poll after poll showing that American's number one concern
is family breakdown, this effort to cause the family death by
political correctness is even more out of place,&quot; said Bauer.

<p>

To discuss the grassroots reaction and strategy of DOMA, pro-family
leaders from the following states will attend: MICHIGAN, OHIO,
CALIFORNIA, ILLINOIS, KENTUCKY, MISSOURI, SOUTH DAKOTA, IDAHO,
MAINE and VIRGINIA.

<p>

Many of the men and women who will be represented have already
won battles to protect marriage. Others are in the legislative
process in the states, and all will be calling for Washington
to respect the right of citizens to set the laws for their individual
states.

<p>

The Defense of Marriage Act both defines marriage for the federal
codes and establishes the right of states to make laws governing
marriage for their citizens.

<center><h3>DEMOCRATIC LEADERS PREPARE TO RELEASE<br>
&quot;FAMILIES FIRST&quot; AGENDA SUNDAY...</h3>

<p>

<h2>BUT YOU CAN GET YOUR COPY TODAY</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b>What is a pro-family agenda? What would
America look like if family policy was more than just political
rhetoric? For answers to those questions, reporters and editors
do not have to wait for the Democratic event scheduled for Sunday.
Gary L. Bauer, president of the Family Research Council, has spent
more than 20 years answering those questions and has written a
concise book detailing what a pro-family America would look like.

<p>

For any reporter wondering how a prominent pro-family conservative
evaluates family issues, the book is a great reference and easy-to-use
guide. In fact, at the end of every chapter, yes-or-no questions
make it simple to analyze the kinds of policy initiatives making
daily news.

<p>

Already, Gary Bauer's book has sold more than 300,000 copies.
In fact, it is the number one best-selling paperback on the Christian
book sellers list.

<p>

Some people think it takes a village to figure out what's best
for children. For millions of Americans, parents decide one on
one every day.

<p>

<b>If you're looking for a pro-family American agenda, call Family
Research Council at 1-800-225-4008 or 202-393-2100.</b>

<center><h2>HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES HAVE WORSENED SINCE<br>
CHINA RECEIVED MFN STATUS</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;It's time to put teeth to our convictions<br>
and stop rewarding barbarity&quot; FRC says.</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;For 15 years, the United States
has extended 'most favored nation' trade status to China.  Originally,
it had been argued that an economic 'open door' might encourage
the Chinese government to shape up their human rights policies,
but in these past 15 years, we have only seen the barbarity and
cruelty of this communist regime increase,&quot; Family Research
Council Policy Analyst Gracie Hsu said Tuesday.

<p>

Hsu made her comments as Rep. Chris Smith's International Operations
and Human Rights subcommittee began its hearing on &quot;China
MFN:  Human Rights Consequences.&quot;  FRC urged Congress to
pass legislation revoking China's &quot;most favored nation&quot;
trade status because of China's continuing human rights abuses.
The House of Representatives is expected to take up legislation
regarding China's MFN status next week.

<p>

&quot;It was seven years ago when Chinese democracy-seekers were
ruthlessly gunned down at Tiananmen Square;&quot; Hsu continued,
&quot;it was only last year when Hong Kong newspapers reported
that aborted human fetuses were being cannibalized in China, sold
as health food. Last September, directly before the United
Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, the Chinese
government executed nine prisoners to 'send a message' to their
own people that they should not attempt to demonstrate against
the Chinese government.

<p>

&quot;In addition to these 'newer' human rights violations, other
abuses which existed in China prior to their receiving MFN status
continue to go unabated.  For example, the Chinese government
continues to exploit prisoners for slave labor in their gulag
system known as 'laogai,' as Harry Wu has demonstrated.  Furthermore,
Chinese women continue to be forcibly aborted or sterilized, state-run
orphanages continue to starve female children to death, and Christians
continue to be systematically tortured and imprisoned.

<p>

&quot;The failure of the United States to hold China accountable
for its heinous behavior has only encouraged the communist regime
to become more oppressive because it no longer fears that any
sanctions will be taken against it.  Year after year, the United
States has issued only empty threats against the Chinese government,
and in doing so, we have strained our credibility and undercut
our own stature as a moral leader in the world.  Instead, the
U.S. has sent the shameful message that, as a country, we care
more about succeeding economically than about championing universal
human rights.

<p>

&quot;It is time for the United States to put teeth to our convictions
and revoke China's 'most favored nation' trade privileges.&quot;

<center><h2>WHO CARES ABOUT MARRIAGE ...<br>
AND WHY OFFICIAL WASHINGTON<br>
SHOULD CARE</h2>

<p>

<h4>GRASSROOTS LEADERS TO STAND WITH FAMILY RESEARCH<br>
COUNCIL ON THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The grassroots implications of the
Defense of Marriage Act will be the topic of a <B>Monday, June
24, news conference</B> called by the Family Research Council
and Family Policy Councils from across the nation. The event will
take place in the <B>National Press Club Main Lounge at 9:30
a.m.</B>

<p>

&quot;One of the hottest issues in the public debate today is
same sex marriage. And there is every reason to believe that it
will be hotly debated by Bob Dole and Bill Clinton,&quot; said
Gary L. Bauer, Family Research Council president. &quot;FRC will
stand with state leaders who have already earned their stripes
on this issue at the local level in defense of marriage.&quot;

<p>

&quot;For anyone wondering whether the defense of home, family
and marriage is a winning issue, the grassroots victories and
support for the Defense of Marriage Act should make it clear.
Every major religion and every successful society has understood
the importance of marriage as the bringing together of the sexes.
And families across America also know just how important this
foundational institution is.&quot;

<p>

Many of the state leaders who will be in attendance have already
won battles in defense of marriage in their legislatures and will
be calling for the federal government to respect the views of
their state citizens. Others are in the middle of legislative
action on state marriage initiatives.

<p>

Family policy councils are state-based organizations that monitor
and advocate at the state level as FRC operates at the federal
level. Leaders from <b>Michigan, Ohio, California, Idaho and Missouri</b>
will be attending. Other state leaders, such as from <b>Pennsylvania,
Indiana, North Carolina and South Dakota,</b> will participate
either by statement or in person. Updated state information on
other participants will be available throughout the week.

<center><h2>SUPREME COURT EXTENDS<br>
JUDICIAL TYRANNY TO CITY LEVEL</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;Court has quit being a constitutional umpire</br>
and now bats clean-up for homosexual activism,&quot; Knight
says.</h4></center>

<p>

<b>Washington, D.C.--</b> In throwing out a lower court's ruling
that upheld Cincinnati's Issue 3 amendment to the city charter,
the U.S. Supreme Court went beyond its ill-reasoned decision last
month in <I>Romer v. Evans</I>, said Family Research Council Director
of  Cultural Studies Robert Knight on Monday.

<p>

In <I>Romer</I>,  the court had ruled that Colorado (or any state)
could not pass a law barring homosexuals from receiving special
civil rights protections at the state or local levels.  The law,
Colorado's Amendment Two, was designed to afford statewide protection
of speech, assembly and religion from coercive homosexual activism.

<p>

&quot;In today's Cincinnati case, the court says that voters can't
even amend their own city charters to preclude the enactment of
laws giving homosexuals more rights than other citizens,&quot;
Knight said. &quot;In remanding the case with instructions to
look at <I>Romer v. Evans</I>, the court is extending its illogic
to a new level.&quot;  As Justice Scalia said in today's dissent,
&quot;the consequence of holding this provision unconstitutional
would be that nowhere in the country may the people decide, in
democratic fashion, not to accord special protection to homosexuals.&quot;


<p>

&quot;As the sexual revolution keeps grinding, new litigants seeking
rights for pedophilia, polygamy and other sexual 'lifestyles'
will soon surface,&quot; Knight said. &quot;The people of Cincinnati
were right to try to keep 'sexual orientation' from being awarded
special protection.

<p>

&quot;The Supreme Court is stacking the deck against parents,
clergy, the Boy Scouts and businessmen who are being targeted
by coercive 'gay rights' laws.  In so doing, the court has quit
its role as constitutional umpire and is now batting clean-up
for the homosexual rights movement,&quot; Knight said. &quot;Let's
hope and pray that the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals won't be
cowed into creating more bad law.&quot;

<center><h2>ARROGANT DECISION CONTRADICTS PRIOR<br>
CASES ON PORNOGRAPHY DISTRIBUTION TO<br> 
MINORS, FRC SAYS</h2></center>

<p>

<center><h4>FRC Director of Legal Studies Cathy Cleaver says decision on
the Communications Decency Act not a pro-family defeat</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;What else should we expect from
an ACLU-hand-picked judge than a sweeping, radical decision allowing
adults to knowingly send and display pornography to minors on
the Internet?&quot; Director of Legal Studies Cathy Cleaver said
Wednesday. &quot;Nevertheless, this is not an ultimate defeat
for American families and children.  No matter where this case
goes next - either to the full Eastern District Court or the Supreme
Court - the Department of Justice will have a better opportunity
to defend the constitutionality of this statute.&quot;

<p>

Cleaver made her remarks as the Federal District Court for the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania released their decision Wednesday
on the <I>ACLU v. Reno</I> case involving the regulation of pornography
distribution to minors on the Internet.  Family Research Council
presented a &quot;friend of the court&quot; brief defending the
cyberporn provisions of the Communications Decency Act.  The decision,
written by Dolores K. Sloviter, Chief Judge of the 3rd Circuit
Court of Appeals and Carter appointee, contradicts previous Supreme
Court decisions on the distribution of indecent material through
the media.

<p>

&quot;It is an arrogant decision which flies in the face of the
Supreme Court and our society,&quot; Cleaver said.&quot; We have
long embraced the principle that those who peddle harmful material
have the obligation to keep the material from children. Outside
cyberspace, laws restrain people from displaying sexually explicit
images in public places and from selling porn magazines to children.
So, on the Internet, the burden of protecting children from exploitation
should not rest solely on the parents.&quot;

<p>

In her decision, Judge Sloviter maintains that it is &quot;either
technologically impossible or economically prohibitive&quot; for
pornographers to comply with the regulations. However, Cleaver
said that &quot;this decision reflects the Court's unwillingness
to consider proposed regulations by dismissing them as 'burdensome.'
There are constitutional ways to protect children from cyberporn
but not restrict the freedom of speech of the pornographers or
the adults.&quot;

<p>

Cleaver continued, &quot;Cyberspace is a work in progress. We
should not squander the opportunity to examine and appreciate
a world where pornography knows no bounds. Failure to enact strong
laws is a concession that the information superhighway should
belong to pornographers.  It would be like leaving a loaded gun
in a playground.&quot;

<p>

<h2>JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TO MARK UP<br>
DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE<br>
AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY BILLS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The House Judiciary Committee begins
mark up today of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) (H.R. 3396)
and the Church Arson Prevention Act (H.R. 3525). 

<p>

Family Research Council President Gary Bauer said that &quot;Congress
and the President should do everything they can to extinguish
the fires that are causing the religious liberty of thousands
Americans to turn to nothing but embers.&quot; On the DOMA bill
Bauer added that &quot;the stability of this country rests on
our faith and our families. Without defending our nation against
the current threat of a redefinition of marriage, the traditional
family unit will never be the same.&quot; 

<p>

Both bills are on the fast track due to current events in Hawaii
and in the southern states.  As the date for the Hawaiian Supreme
Court case on &quot;gay marriage&quot; rapidly approaches, the
full House Judiciary Committee presses forward on DOMA today.
In the next few weeks, the Senate Judiciary Committee plans a
hearing at which Gary Bauer will testify on DOMA.

<p>

As the number of reported church fires in the southeast nears
60 since January 1995, the House Judiciary Committee begins mark
up of the Church Arson Prevention Act.  Co-sponsored by Chairman
Henry J. Hyde (R-IL) and ranking Democrat John Conyers (D-MI),
this bill enables Federal authorities to more quickly and efficiently
investigate and prosecute these cases and also protects the freedom
of religious expression.

<center><h2>WILL THERE BE ANY PRO-LIFERS IN THE BIG TENT?

<p>

GARY BAUER COMMENTS:</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The following is a statement from Gary
L. Bauer following up on Senator Dole's comments on CNN <i>Inside
Politics</i> regarding the pro-life plank in the platform:

<p>

&quot;Senator Dole had, this past weekend, navigated some tough
shoals.  Today the ship has been run a ground again. I hope sometime
soon the senator will stop debating fellow Republicans on abortion
and start debating the most pro-abortion President in American
history.  If this keeps up, the so-called big tent won't have
any pro-lifers in it.&quot;

<center><h2>BIG GOVERNMENT CAN'T STAND FOR CHILDREN<br>
BUT IT COULD STEP ASIDE FOR PARENTS,<br>
FRC STANDS WITH MOMS AND DADS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- &quot;If the tobacco lobby tried to rally
for smokers' rights, most people would mock their efforts</b>,
but when more than a 100 organizations that lobby for and receive
federal grant monies get together to pressure for more welfare
spending, they're treated as though the name of the event equals
reality. But to stand for children, you need to stand for families,
not big government,&quot; said Kristi S. Hamrick, Family Research
Council Director of Communications on Friday.

<p>

Mrs. Hamrick made her comments on the eve of the liberal Children's
Defense Fund &quot;Stand for Children&quot; rally set for June
1. She and other pro-family leaders stood together with families
who have had struggles in areas of taxes, adoption and education.
The news conference highlighted the many issues and organizations
pointedly unnoticed in the so-called &quot;non-partisan&quot;
event.

<p>

She said: <b>&quot;Big government doesn't best stand for children,
parents do</b>. And in the last 30 years, through excessive taxes,
failed welfare programs and overbearing federal control of education,
<b>parents have been squeezed out of the driver's seat of their
family cars, to be replaced by Big Brother. It's too bad he's
been headed in the wrong direction</b>.

<p>

&quot;During the last 40 years, the tax burden on the American
family has gone from one dollar in 50 to one dollar in four. It's
a reverse Robin Hood situation, taking from the poor to give to
bloated government programs and bureaucrats who act as though
they know what's best for other people's money and children.

<p>

&quot;<b>We need the $500 per child tax credit</b>. We need a
balanced budget. We need adoption tax credits. And we need them
now. We applaud the fact that Congress kept its promises and passed
this long overdue tax relief for families and began to address
the burden of debt that will be left to our children. Unfortunately,
liberal activists -- like the Children's Defense Fund -- prevailed
upon President Bill Clinton to veto this necessary tax relief
and balanced budget legislation.

<p>

<b>&quot;The Children's Defense Fund has embraced the attitude
that liberal elites know better</b> than parents. The goals of
federal policy should not be to replace the family or parents,
but to affirm them. In particular, we need to help those children
most in need get into stable families.

<p>

&quot;It is shameful that foster care, 'a temporary' program,
becomes a quasi-parent for more than 600,000 abused and neglected
children. Ten percent wait more than 7 years for the system to
give them legal, loving parents. These languishing children deserve
better. We can help them by freeing them for adoption after a
set period of time, and supporting adoption tax credits.

<p>

<b>&quot;It shouldn't surprise anyone</b> that the groups invited
to attend the rally -- groups like The Gay and Lesbian Victory
Fund, Planned Parenthood, Zero Population Growth, National Organization
for Women -- support government as surrogate parent. But men and
women nationwide understand that it's parents who best know and
best love their children. And for radical activists to claim that
they are advocates for children is so lacking in credibility,
it doesn't pass the straight face test.&quot;

<p>

<center><h2>TO THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND:<br>
THE <i>REAL</i> QUESTION IS WHO BEST STANDS FOR<br>
CHILDREN ... AND THE ANSWER IS PARENTS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- &quot;The best advocates of children today
-- and the most unappreciated -- are mothers and fathers, working
together to stand for children,&quot;</b> said Gary L. Bauer,
president of Family Research Council on Wednesday, May 29. &quot;The
best thing we could do as a society to stand for children is affirm
and support parents.&quot;

<p>

<b>Bauer made his comments on the eve of the Stand for Children
Rally</b> scheduled to take place on June 1 in Washington, D.C.
The rally was organized by the liberal Children's Defense Fund
known for supporting big government intervention in the family.

<p>

<b>&quot;For Children's Defense Fund</b>, the organizer of the
impressively-named 'Stand for Children' event, the best advocate
a child has is a government official or bureaucrat. But government
is often part of the problem, both by implementing family un-friendly
policies and diminishing the importance of the people who best
love children -- parents,&quot; said Bauer.

<p>

&quot;The Children's Defense Fund has embraced the attitude of
parents as 'guilty until proven innocent.'  But healthy societies
have understood that parents are almost always those who best
defend children. And only when the home has broken down should
the state intervene to save the child and assist in getting that
child permanently into a loving family.

<p>

<b>&quot;Family is key</b>. Children from broken families should
not be captives of temporary government solutions. It is shameful
that foster care, a 'temporary' program, becomes a quasi-parent
for more than 600,000 abused and neglected children.  Ten percent
wait more than seven years for the system to give them legal,
loving parents.  These languishing children deserve more than
'bought' foster care.  As one system child of 10 years said, 'I'm
all wrapped up in programs, what I need is a mom and a dad.'

<p>

&quot;Not surprisingly, the groups invited by CDF to attend the
rally were primarily those who believe that government should
be a child's best friend. In fact, despite well-spoken words about
faith in child rearing, an anti-faith attitude has marked CDF's
policies. Children's Defense Fund has been hostile to the role
religious organizations can play as advocates for children and
families in place of government.

<p>

<b>&quot;CDF has taken the attitude that experts know best</b>
--  rarely parents -- and have consistently fought against school
choice for parents and day care vouchers for poor parents who
want their children instructed in a values setting.

<p>

&quot;But most significantly, time and time again, the Children's
Defense Fund has missed the mark on <b>the greatest crisis facing
our children -- family breakdown</b>. For them, every problem
is an economic one, explained not in the loss of values or loving
homes, but in dollars and cents. The last 30 years has shown clearly
the failure of these approaches. Unless we all stand together
for the family, our society will fall.&quot;

<center><h2>BAUER CALLS<br>
AMENDMENT TWO DECISION<br>
'DISASTER FOR SELF-GOVERNING PEOPLE'</h2>

<p>

<h4>'THE COURT IS TAKING AWAY AMERICANS'<br>
FREEDOM TO DISAGREE ON HOMOSEXUALITY'</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Today's 6-3 Supreme Court decision
in <I>Romer v. Evans</I> is a disaster,&quot; said Gary L. Bauer,
President of the Family Research Council.  &quot;The legal details
will be debated, but the ruling's immediate impact is clear enough:
No state in the country may amend its constitution to bar the
granting of special rights for homosexuals.

<p>

&quot;No one -- including the people of Colorado -- is suggesting
that homosexuals should lose any rights; but nobody has the right
to 'win' at the ballot box even when losing.  Homosexual activists
lost at the ballot box, but now they will see their will imposed
on the people of Colorado -- and the rest of the nation -- by an 
out-of-control, unelected judiciary.

<p>

&quot;Now, with state laws being struck down, it is clear that
the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) is urgently needed.
Otherwise, marriage itself will be redefined radically by unrestrained
judges. DOMA may just be the antidote to the judicial lunacy.

<p>

&quot;As Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in a stinging dissent, 'Today's
opinion has no foundation in American constitutional law, and
barely pretends to.  The people of Colorado have adopted an entirely
reasonable provision which does not even disfavor homosexuals
in any substantive sense, but merely denies them preferential
treatment . . . Striking it down is an act, not of judicial judgment,
but of political will.'

<p>

Bauer continued: &quot;On yet another question of profound public
concern, the legislative voice of the American people has been
silenced.  Even the illusion of a level playing field evaporates
before our eyes.

<p>

&quot;Here's how it works:  Homosexuals may win laws providing
themselves with special rights, and Americans who disagree may
not pass any laws to the contrary. No other group has that kind
of power to impose its agenda on the rest of the people.  This
decision, apart from its policy consequences, should send chills
down the back of anyone who cares whether the people of this nation
any longer have the power of self-rule.&quot;

Family Research Council Director of Cultural Studies Robert Knight
said Wednesday.  &quot;Rep. Steve Gunderson has said the events
at two parties have been misconstrued in a written eye-witness
account -- but a picture is worth a thousand words.&quot;

<p>

&quot;The Family Research Council became concerned about a possible
misuse of family tax dollars after reading lewd advertisements
for the events in homosexual publications and other media outlets.
The gay-friendly, Washington, D.C. libertarian newspaper <I>City
Paper</I> described the Cherry Jubilee Main Event Party as a &quot;gay
'circuit' party....Circuit parties are all-night -- and usually
drug-infested -- gay dances.&quot;

<p>

&quot;Video footage taken at the Main Event clearly shows half-naked
men dancing to a disco beat in the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium,
a hall that has been used for presidential ceremonies,&quot; Knight
said.  &quot;And earlier footage shows the same auditorium hosting
the indescribably vulgar Sado-Masochistic Leather Fetish event
during the 1993 Homosexual March on Washington.  It is inappropriate
in the city of Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln for vulgar parties
thrown by anyone for any reason to be staged in our taxpayer-funded
facilities built to accomplish the noble goals of democracy. 
Hardworking American families should not be forced to facilitate
conduct unbecoming to our national heritage.  And the Rayburn
House Office Building should not be used for Sunday disco parties.

<p>

&quot;The offensive use of taxpayer-funded buildings set aside
for federal agencies and the business of the House shows that
the issue here is not 'tolerance.'  Unfortunately, that word has
been abused to force Americans to endorse, support and facilitate
offensive behavior.  And when people object to this abuse, they
are assailed as 'bigots' or 'haters.'&quot;

<p>

&quot;Despite Rep. Gunderson's words on the House floor that
nothing inappropriate took place, <b>here are four accounts to
note:</b>

<p><ul>

<li><i>&quot;...the dancing became increasingly lewd and
suggestive.  As the night wore on, the dancers began simulated
sex gyrations.  There was intense groping and stroking of each
other.  Some couples dancing on table tops, mimicked anal sex
through their clothing, while others pantomimed oral sex.....At
about 4 a.m., two men proceeded to engage in illicit sexual behavior
in the main auditorium.....oral intercourse....The restroom stalls
at the Mellon auditorium were constantly being occupied by two
men at a time....evidence of illegal drug use was present.  Audible
snorting could be heard throughout the evening in the bathroom
stalls.&quot;  -- free-lance video journalist Marc Morano in an
eye-witness account published in the Congressional Record.</i>

<p>

<li><i>&quot;Jim Jennings of Hill &amp; Knowlton, a sponsor
of the event, said he didn't witness drug use but added, 'I would
not be surprised, though, that in any group of 20-to-30-year-olds...[that]
there would be some who had done drugs...If it became clear that
[drug use] was a serious element of this event we'd stop it.'
Instead, he said he simply witnessed 'very provocative dancing.'&quot;
-- Paul Bedard, &quot;Gay GOP lawmaker defends 'Jubilee,'&quot;
The Washington Times, May 15, 1996, p. A-1.</i>

<p>

<li><i>&quot;I saw a couple of instances of people in a
corner using drugs...a fair number of people using drugs.&quot;
-- City Paper homosexual reporter John Cloud, as quoted in The
Washington Times.</i>

<p>

<li><i>&quot;The stately place was incredible -- we felt like
we were in a hallowed hall. We spent much of our time out on the
dance floor trying to cop a feel, or back in the sponsors' lounge
trying to cop a feel, or outside in the designated smoking area
trying to cop a feel and a smoke.&quot; -- columnist in the homosexual
Metro Weekly, as quoted in The Washington Times.</i>

</ul><p>

&quot;Pro-family Americans are tired of having their values disparaged
and their tax dollars wasted on undignified personal agendas,&quot;
Knight said. &quot;These charges are serious enough that they
should be investigated by Congress, by the Metro Police and by
the General Services Administration, which is responsible for
events at the Mellon Auditorium.&quot;

<center><h2>DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT IS &quot;IN<br>
CIVILIZATION'S BEST INTEREST,&quot;<br>
BAUER SAYS</h2>

<p>

<h4>FRC URGES HOUSE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT H.R. 3396</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The Defense of Marriage Act (H.R. 3396)
&quot;is one of the most urgent and essential pieces of legislation
to be considered in this century.  The institution of marriage
must not be taken lightly,&quot; said Family Research Council
President Gary Bauer. &quot;Clearly, those who care deeply about
children, about morality, about the well being of the larger society,
must resist the attempts by a tiny segment of the population to
diminish the foundation on which society stands.&quot;   Bauer
made these comments as the House Judiciary Constitution Subcommittee
held a hearing on the legislation that would preserve marriage
from being redefined by state courts.

<p>

Sponsored by Representatives Steve Largent (R-OK) and Bob Barr
(R-GA) and with a companion bill introduced by Senator Don Nickles
(R-OK), the Defense of Marriage Act would protect the traditional
definition of marriage as a legal union between one man and one
woman in the U.S. Code, and also protect states from any redefinitions
imposed by courts.

<p>

The issue of the definition of marriage has been quickly raised
to the federal level because it is widely believed that the Hawaiian
courts will soon take the radical step of striking down that state's
marriage law. Under the Constitution's &quot;full faith and credit&quot;
clause (Article IV), this decision could jeopardize marriage laws
in the other 49 states.

<p>

&quot;Marriage has been the foundation of civilization for thousands
of years in cultures around the world. It is the single most important
social institution, and it is the basis for the procreation of
children and the heart of family life,&quot; Bauer said. &quot;Marriage
is a societal good even without children, as husbands and wives
serve as role models for children in their neighborhoods. Marriage
between one man and one woman gives children the best economic,
emotional, and psychological environment in which to grow up.

<p>

&quot;We must step up our efforts to defend marriage now.  Instead
of submitting to radical demands that would destroy marriage,
we need to restore the primacy of marriage within the law and
the culture.&quot;

<center><h2>FRC LABELS NEEDLE EXCHANGE<br>
PROGRAMS BAD MEDICINE FOR<br>
FIGHTING AIDS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;The fight to establish federally-funded
needle exchange programs is being urged as a wedge issue to gain
drug legalization,&quot; Family Research Council's policy analyst
Robert Maginnis said today.  &quot;Linking drug addiction with
the emotion-charged AIDS epidemic under the pro-drug umbrella
called 'harm reduction' may be good political strategy, but it's
an awful idea that is gathering momentum, and it must be countered.
Needle exchange programs are simply bad medicine.&quot; 

<p>

Maginnis spoke today at the National Conference of State Legislatures
on the topic, &quot;Getting to the Point: The Role of Sterile
Syringes in HIV Prevention.&quot;

<p>

Needle exchange programs are intended to curb the practice of
sharing needles among injecting drug users to reduce the risk
of transmitting the AIDS virus.  Exchange advocates claim that
the science conclusively supports these programs, however on close
examination the science is seriously flawed.

<p>

&quot;The science downplays sexual transmission of HIV among addicts,&quot;
Maginnis said.  &quot;Some resort to prostitution to fund their
addiction.  After all, non-needle-using crack addicts have a high
incidence of HIV. Most of the needle studies fail to interview
neighborhood residents to see whether they approve of the effect
of these programs.  They also tend to trivialize the drug problem
and offer no alternative solutions.

<p>

&quot;Needle exchanges promote a breakdown in law and order. They
are poor medicine and poor public health practice. Our goal should
be to eliminate drug abuse, not find a safer way to do it.  The
best way to curb the spread of HIV among injecting drug users
is to get them off drugs.&quot;

<center><h2>DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE IS &quot;CULTURAL<br>
WATERSHED,&quot; BAUER SAYS</h2>

<p>

<h4>FRC GIVES FULL SUPPORT TO DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA)
&quot;is one of the most crucial pieces of legislation to be considered
in this or any year. This is a cultural watershed,&quot; said
Family Research Council President Gary Bauer. &quot;Will America
move to protect marriage -- the foundation of civilization --
or will America become the first nation to destroy marriage? At
stake is nothing less than the future of the nation and the well
being of our children.&quot;

<p>

The Defense of Marriage Act was announced today in the House and
the Senate, and Family Research Council gave its full support
to the legislation that would protect marriage against current
attempts to redefine it.  Sponsored by Representatives Steve Largent
(R-OK) and Bob Barr (R-GA) and with a companion bill introduced
by Senator Don Nickles (R-OK), the Defense of Marriage Act would
protect the traditional definition of marriage as a legal union
between one man and one woman in the U.S. Code, and thus protect
states from any redefinitions imposed by courts.

<p>

The issue of the definition of marriage was raised to the federal
level because it is widely believed that the Hawaiian Supreme
Court will soon take the radical step of striking down the state's
marriage law. Under the Constitution's &quot;full faith and credit&quot;
clause (Article IV), this decision could jeopardize marriage laws
in the other 49 states.

<p>

Bauer noted that more than 30 states have legislative activities
underway to address this threat and 9 have already enacted such
laws. But because marriage is referenced in the U.S. Code, the
Uniform Code of Military Justice, and in Social Security regulations,
federal law is necessary to ensure that no state would be forced
to submit to a redefinition of marriage should another state's
court system take that step.

<p>

&quot;The heart of family life is marriage,&quot; Bauer said.
&quot;It brings the two sexes together in a unique legal, social,
economic and spiritual union -- no other relationship provides
society with the benefits that marriage does. As we have drifted
from the defense of marriage, we have experienced severe social
and economic problems, and now, marriage is under attack as never
before. If the one-man, one-woman definition of marriage is broken,
there is no logical stopping point for continuing the assault
on marriage. No civilization has ever introduced a counterfeit
definition of marriage, and those who have allowed the family
to be weakened have not survived.&quot;

<center><h2>HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES DISQUALIFY<br>
CHINA FROM RECEIVING<br>
&quot;MOST FAVORED NATION&quot; STATUS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The Family Research Council on Tuesday
urged the Clinton Administration to revoke China's &quot;most
favored nation&quot; trade status because of China's myriad human
rights abuses.

<p>

Policy Analyst Gracie Hsu released the following statement prior
to the press conference held by the Coalition to Stop MFN for
China: 

<p>

&quot;China's horrific record on human rights is undisputable.
Its blatant disregard for the sanctity of human life has led
to such abuses as the massacre of democracy-seekers at Tiannanmen
Square, the exploitation of prisoners as slave laborers, women
being forcibly aborted or sterilized, female infanticide, and
the systematic intimidation, torture, and imprisonment of Christians.

<p>

&quot;In the 15 years since the United States has granted China
'most favored nation' trade status, our economic 'open door' policy
has not resulted in even one of these human rights abuses being
halted or abated.  Even if there was, at one point, justification
for extending MFN status to China, arguing that economic trade
might lead to greater influence in the human rights realm, China's
record of continued human rights abuses should completely dispel
that notion.

<p>

&quot;Up to now, the Clinton Administration has only paid lip
service to human rights.  For even while Hillary Clinton was verbally
condemning coercive abortion policies last September in Beijing,
President Clinton was refusing to grant asylum to several Chinese
women who fled their homeland to escape their country's forced
abortion policies.  It is time for President Clinton to put actions
to his words.

<p>

&quot;The oppressive nature of this Chinese government regime
is well-known.  And if the United States does not use the carrot
of its economic markets to encourage China to a humane standard,
then the stick should be the closing of our economic doors.

<p>

&quot;Those obsessed with the idea that there is money to be made
in China seem to forget that the United States is the richest
market in the world and has a lot to offer or withhold. If all
that we communicate to the world is that money making is our only
value, then we cannot be surprised when dictators rise to power,
promising only economic concessions while people die.&quot;

<center><h2>FRC SUPPORTS DEFENSE BILL<br>
CUTTING GOVERMENT'S ROLE AS<br>
PORNOGRAPHY SALESMAN</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The U.S. House of Representative's
National Defense Committee passed by voice vote an amendment today
to the 1997 Defense Authorization Act that would prohibit the
sale or rental of pornography anywhere on U.S. military property.

<p>

Robert Maginnis, FRC's director for the Military Readiness Project
and a retired Army lieutenant colonel, said &quot;This legislation
will aid in strengthening the moral character of our military
personnel, as well as protect the military family. Sexually explicit
material intended to appeal to prurient interests should not be
sold in government stores.&quot;

<p>

But in 1995, the Army Air Force Exchange Service sold more than
$5 million of pornographic materials and today the Pentagon's
bookstore sells <I>Playboy, Penthouse, Playgirl, Penthouse Letters,
Penthouse Comics and Penthouse Men's Adventure Comix</I>. 

<p>

According to Colonel Maginnis, &quot;Pornographic material, like
alcohol, is a powerful stimulant.  Beginning with 'soft'  pornography
sold in military stores, the desire for sexually explicit material
grows to require more explicit images in order to reach the previous
level of sexual arousal.  Gradually, the addict becomes desensitized
even to the more explicit material and may act out sexual fantasies
inspired by the material.&quot;

<p>

The Military Honor and Decency Act comes in the wake of the rape
of a 12-year-old girl in Okinawa by a U.S. sailor and two Marines,
and the groping of a female sailor by a drunken chief petty officer
on a commercial flight.

<p>

Under current policy, military store managers select magazines
based on sales volume, customer preferences, and, in the case
of pornographic material, whether it fits the definition of obscenity
outlined by the Supreme Court. The high court's criteria were
written to protect freedom of speech and expression but there
are kinds not protected by the Constitution.  These include, among
others, slander, libel, perjury, yelling &quot;fire&quot; in a
crowded theater and child pornography.

<p>

&quot;The government should not be involved in the distribution
of material that conflicts with the principles of honor and decency,&quot;
said Maginnis.  &quot;With the growing number of sexual misconduct
cases in the military, it is time the federal government sever
its involvement in the pornography trade.&quot;

<center><h2>GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO UNTO OTHERS...<br>
ORDINARY PEOPLE DESERVE THE SAME PERKS<br>
AS FEDERAL WORKERS, BAUER SAYS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council President Gary
L. Bauer joined with Sen. John Ashcroft Tuesday in calling for
increased workplace flexibility and more &quot;comp time&quot;
options. Currently, laws on a 40-hour workweek prohibit flexible
schedules, and rather than merely offer time-and-a-half money
for overtime work, comp time could be expanded to offer time-and-a-half-off
options as well.

<p>

Bauer made the following comments during a 3 p.m. news conference
in S-211 of the U.S. Capitol:

<p>

&quot;Ironically, the federal government has boasted of its success
in providing flexible scheduling for the people who fill its ranks
... but rank and file Americans don't have the same options. Government
should do unto others what it has done for itself -- remove the
restrictions on a work week and allow freedom to enter the kinds
of  start-up businesses that are on the cutting edge of growth
and opportunity. And to allow those businesses which built America
to offer the same options that federal workers receive.

<p>

&quot;Recent focus groups have shown that women in particular
are deeply concerned about the amount of  time they have to spend
together as a family. Children's schedules are not always compatible
with corporate America. We need to get government bureaucrats
out of the scheduling business that takes place between employers
and employees who are juggling jobs and families. A recent study
conducted by the Family and Work Institute found that 66 percent
of employed families with children under 18 indicated that they
didn't have enough time for their children. And an original poll,
conducted for the Family Research Council, showed that 61 percent
of Americans favor more time over more money. We have the ability
to address the Family Time Famine in America.

<p>

&quot;Increasing opportunity is a women's issue, a children's
issue and most particularly, a family issue.

<p>

&quot;And I would also urge the Congress to adopt the $500 per
child tax credit, because it would reduce economic pressures on
families, thereby freeing parents to spend more time with their
children. These are the kinds of changes that men and women desired
when they voted for a change in Washington D.C. And I commend
Sen. Ashcroft's leadership in spearheading this positive change
in today's workplace.&quot;

<center><h4>EDITORS' NOTE: REPORTS INDICATE CLINTON TO RELEASE 
PARTIAL-BIRTH VETO STATEMENT AT 5 P.M.</h4>

<p>

<h2>CLINTON SHOWS SHOCKING DISREGARD FOR THE VALUES OF THE 
<i>MAJORITY</i> OF AMERICANS, AGAIN REWARDS PRO-ABORTION ALLIES</h2>

<p>

<h3><i>&quot;Clinton seems to find no life worth saving</i>,&quot;
says Bauer</h3></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Clinton's veto of  the overwhelmingly
supported Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act shows once again his
absolute loyalty to the most extreme abortion advocates,&quot;
Family Research Council President Gary L. Bauer said on Wednesday.

<p>

Bauer made the following statement after Clinton vetoed the Partial-Birth
Abortion Ban Act -- a measure which passed both houses with wider
margins than almost any bill this session.

<p>

Bauer noted: &quot;Polling out this week shows once again that
the vast majority of Americans -- more than two-thirds -- support
either restrictions on abortion or its elimination. These numbers
tell a story that every man and woman of conscience understands.
People do not want to see life casually ended. And they do not
accept abortion as the highest and best offering of our great
Constitution. They are troubled by a 1.5-million person death
count every year. And the overwhelming success of pro-life candidates
in the last election, both Democratic and Republican, underscores
the troubled electorate's concern for run-away abortion 'rights'
turned into societal wrongs.

<p>

&quot;Bill Clinton has again aligned himself with the most extremist
elements of the abortion lobby -- those who see no value in life
poised on the edge of birth. Bill Clinton said he wants abortion
to be rare, but he seems to see no life worth saving, not even
a fully viable child, whose living brain tissue is vacuumed out,
causing painful death.

<p>

&quot;I am among the majority of Americans who knows that our
nation has more to offer than abortion. And from my travels around
the country, I can say for certain that this veto will mark the
Bill Clinton presidency with a stain that will not be white washed
with any amount of election rhetoric.&quot;

<center><h2>FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL<br>
DEFENDS MILITARY LAW<br>
IN <i>RICHENBERG V. PERRY</i></h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> <I>Richenberg v. Perry</I>, a military
case that involves a former air force captain challenging his
discharge for homosexuality, will be heard today in a federal
appeals court in St. Louis, Missouri.  The Family Research Council's
Military Readiness Project, the only national group actively defending
the military's legal ban in court, filed an amicus curiae brief
defending the federal law.  MRP representatives will be attending
the case in St. Louis and will be available for interviews. 

<p>

MRP Director Robert Maginnis, a retired Lieutenant Colonel, explains,
&quot;FRC is in court because the Clinton administration refuses
to defend the law.  Rather, it defends a faulty implementation
of the law labeled &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; which permits
homosexuals to serve.  The American people, the law and military
tradition have spoken clearly on this issue:  homosexuals are
not permitted to serve in the armed forces.&quot;

<p>

MRP counsel Melissa Wells-Petry, a former Army litigator, wrote
in the brief that Richenberg's case is fatally flawed when it
attacks the &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; implementing regulations.
&quot;This policy,&quot; she says, is only &quot;a political myth.&quot;
According to Wells-Petry, Richenberg's case argues that &quot;treating
detected and undetected homosexuals differently in terms of eligibility
for military service renders the policy irrational, in that it
furthers no legitimate governmental goal&quot; by sifting homosexuals
into two camps, separated only by detection.  On this, she notes,
&quot;No doubt the policy described by Richenberg might pose the
constitutional questions he attempts to raise.  But no such policy
is at issue in this case.&quot;

<p>

In addition, she holds that the Department of Justice does not
even need to defend the regulations.  Instead, the law passed
by Congress, 10 U.S.C. &#167; 654, is what really is at issue
and is quite clear:  all homosexuals are barred from service.
Thus, there is no legal loophole through which homosexuals can
serve in the military.  The Military Readiness Project has long
maintained that the real problem is the Clinton Administration's
persistence in claiming the law permits homosexuals to serve instead
of enforcing the law's true intent, namely, to codify the armed
forces' long and constitutional policy of prohibiting homosexual
service.

<p>

MRP has provided briefs in similar cases concerning homosexual
servicemembers.  In the 4th Circuit case of <I>Thomasson v. Perry</I>,
it was given the unusual opportunity to make oral arguments before
the full court.

<p>

The <I>Richenberg</I> case is one of eight appellate cases making
their way to the Supreme Court. It's expected that either the
2nd Circuit's <I>Abel</I> case or the <I>Thomasson</I> case will
likely be heard on appeal by the high court in its next session.

<center><h2>BAUER TO EDUCATION SUMMIT:<br>
&quot;Empowering Parents helps Kids&quot;</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;When all is said and done, the
highest goal of an education summit should be our children's improved
learning,&quot; Family Research Council President Gary Bauer said
on Tuesday as the Governor's Education summit began. Bauer, undersecretary
of education during the Reagan Administration, urged the attendees
of the summit to focus their attention on initiatives that help
children -- not bureaucrats.

<p>

&quot;We know that these kinds of meetings over the years have
made the participants feel good, but on the whole, they've done
little to improve American education,&quot; Bauer said. &quot;But
when it comes to our kids, it's worth the effort to find what
really works. I would urge the attendees to follow these principles:

<p><b>

<li>Empower Parents not bureaucrats.<br>
<li>Reject the anti-American National History Standards<br>
<li>Submit any agreements made at the summit to the American
people.

</b><p>

&quot;I do not believe government-funded or endorsed national
standards will increase local control or lead to better education,&quot;
Bauer said. &quot;Summit leaders can score real achievement by
voting to reject the outrageously biased, anti-American history
standards.  Proponents of national standards have had a difficult
time assuring the American people that their standards would be
high enough to make America internationally competitive and at
the same time low enough so that the vast majority of students
could achieve to such levels.&quot;

<p>

Bauer noted that a goal since the Reagan Administration was to
dismantle the U.S. Department of Education. &quot;Governors have
a keen interest in education. They therefore should support calls
for abolishing the Department of Education. We need to bring decision
making authority back to local schools and local leaders.&quot;

<p>

&quot;But no matter what is agreed upon,&quot; Bauer said, &quot;I
urge the governors not to sign any agreement that has not been
released for public comment in their states.  I urge CEO's not
to sign any agreement that would increase government interference
with the American economy. American students deserve our best
efforts in their behalf.&quot;

<p>

<i>REPORTERS PLEASE NOTE: FRC Special Assistant to the President
Robert Morrison is attending the summit and will be available
for comment on site.</i>

<center><h2>CLINTON WRONG AGAIN ON<br>
TEENS AND AIDS</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> A White House report issued today shows
that 25 percent of Americans who are infected with AIDS each year
are under the age of 20.  The report calls for more explicit AIDS
education, and HIV testing without parental notice.
<p>
&quot;This is a policy-driven tragedy unfolding, and the Clinton
Administration is offering only more of the same prescription
that got us here in the first place,&quot; said Family Research
Council Director of Cultural Studies Robert H. Knight.  &quot;To
say that lack of information is causing the problem is outrageous.
The schools inundate children with graphic sex information beginning
in kindergarten, and when record numbers of teens experiment and
contract diseases and unwanted pregnancies, the answer, we are
told, is always more of the same -- more condoms, more 'education,'
more knowledge of deviant sex practices -- and less parental input.
<p>
&quot;Teens themselves have told reporters that information is
not the problem -- it's the presentation of sex as an inevitable
plumbing exercise in a sex-saturated culture, without regard for
marriage.  According to a University of Minnesota study by a homosexual
researcher, young males &quot;often engaged in high-risk sex despite
good knowledge about HIV.&quot;  The teens &quot;correctly recognized
they were more likely than others to be infected, but were not
deterred from dangerous behavior.&quot;  (Dr. Gary Remafedi, survey
of 239 gay and bisexual males aged 13 to 21, 1994).
<p>
Knight adds, &quot;The condom-based approach has failed miserably
for 20 years and ruined countless lives.  Good programs are available
that work, but the Clinton Administration and their allies are
trying to kill them off.  And the same government that wants to
steal children's innocence now wants to test them for HIV without
parents' knowledge.
<p>
&quot;Parents across America are vitally concerned about their
children's well-being, and they -- not the government -- should be
the primary counselor in their child's sexual development,&quot;
Knight said.  &quot;Parents must not be cut out of their children's
lives, especially if their child's life is in jeopardy. No one
should face HIV test results alone,&quot; Knight said.

<center><h2>MILITARY CASE <i>PHILIPS V. PERRY</i><br>
TESTS HOMOSEXUAL LAW</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> --  In Seattle today, a Federal Appeals
court will <I>hear Philips v. Perry</I>, a case involving an openly
homosexual sailor who admitted to past misconduct and who intends
to continue that practice.  On October 27, 1995, the Family Research
Council filed a friend of the court brief calling for the dismissal
of the case.
<p>
Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.), FRC's director
of the Military Readiness Project (MRP) will attend the Seattle
hearing.  He said, &quot;Machinist Mate Mark Philips confessed
to homosexual misconduct in 1992 but he filed a lawsuit blocking
his discharge.&quot;  FRC first joined this case in early 1995
by filing a court brief at the trial court level.  Philips lost
that challenge.
<p>
&quot;Philips is a homosexual crusader,&quot; said Colonel Maginnis,
&quot;who wants to use the court to air and resolve national policy
on homosexuals in the military and in particular Congress' constitutional
authority to dictate military personnel policy.&quot;
<p>
Machinist Mate Philips claims that his discharge is based on homosexual
&quot;status&quot; when in fact the Navy board was swayed by his
admission of misconduct.  He also claims there are sexual acts
that are guaranteed within a constitutionally protected zone of
privacy.
<p>
This case is one of five military homosexual cases now pending
at the Federal Appellate Court level and three cases at the Federal
District Court level.  The MRP is involved in all the appellate
cases as an amicus and had the unusual opportunity last December
to make oral arguments before the Fourth Circuit's <I>Thomasson
v. Perry</I> hearing. 
<p>
As the nation's leading organization defending the military's
ban, FRC argues that many of these cases came about because the
Clinton administration purposely did an end run around the law
and wrote implementing regulations labeled &quot;Don't Ask, Don't
Tell&quot; which permit homosexuals to serve.  The law prohibits
service by homosexuals.

<title>February 28, 1996 Press Release</title>
<body>
<center><h2>MEMO</h2></center>
<p>
<b>February 28, 1996
<p>
TO:     National News Media<br>
FROM:   Gary L. Bauer, President, Family Research Council<br>
RE:     Statement on Religious Bigotry in Media Coverage</b>
<p>
<b>Religious bigotry, and facile appeals to such bigotry, have no place in the 
American political lexicon.</b> In the past few weeks, some media coverage of 
the 1996 Presidential campaign has betrayed a disturbing insensitivity to the
standards of civil discourse that our nation's founders intended to prevail in
public debate.  Last Friday night's edition of ABC's Nightline is only the latest
example of this insensitivity, an uncharacteristically superficial report by Ted
Koppel that attempted to legitimize the idea that American Catholics in the
1940s and 1950s were given to reflexive prejudice against their fellow Jewish
Americans.
<p>
<B>Americans of all faiths -- and even no faith -- cherish a heritage of religious 
liberty that celebrates the contributions of diverse denominations to our 
national life.</b>  They honor the examples of tolerance and courage that abound
in our history, from Sam Adams' call that the First Continental Congress open
with the prayer of a clergyman not of his own denomination, to the famed
incident of the four chaplains -- a rabbi, a Methodist minister, a
Catholic priest, and a Dutch Reformed minister -- who sacrificed their 
life-jackets to other men and perished in the sinking of the troop ship 
Dorchester in July 1943.
<p>
<b>Prejudice has certainly written dark chapters in every era of American 
history, but ABC breaches its responsibility to the American people when it 
paints a misleading and malignant portrait of American Catholics.</b>  As an
organization representing hundreds of thousands of American families, including
Catholics, the Family Research Council deplores ABC's report.  We urge everyone
engaged in coverage of the 1996 elections to maintain the highest standards
of journalistic ethics and to cover the issues with factuality and fairness. ABC
owes all religious people of goodwill a swift and heartfelt apology.

<center><h2>CLINTON WRONG ON PARTIAL BIRTH</h2>
<p>
<h4>PRO-LIFE AMERICANS AND CLINTON KNOW THAT<br>
HEALTH OF THE MOTHER = ALL ABORTIONS</h4></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council Policy Analyst
Gracie Hsu made the following statement following President Clinton's
comments regarding his new position on the Partial Birth Abortion
Ban Act:
<p>
&quot;After Congressional hearings and extended public debate
and no doubt prayerful consideration, members of both houses of
Congress, on both sides of the aisle, passed a bill which would
ban partial birth abortions.  However, President Clinton has now
announced that, after 'praying' long and hard, he will support
the late-term abortions of babies who are breech-delivered alive
until all but the head remains in the mother's womb, and who die
because the abortionist stabs the back of their heads to suction
out their brains.
<p>
&quot;That President Clinton would veto a ban on a procedure characterized
as 'four-fifths infanticide and one-fifth abortion' shows his
clear disregard for the value of human life.
<p>
&quot;Even worse, Mr. Clinton has tried to cloud his extreme pro-abortion
stance by saying that he, in fact, supports the ban except 'to
save the life of the mother and <I><B>for the mother's health</B></I>.'
<p>
&quot;The Partial Birth Abortion Ban, as passed by both houses
of Congress, already includes a life of the mother exception.
But the health clause that President Clinton seeks to include
is so broadly defined in U.S. law that it would make <b>all</b>
partial-birth abortions acceptable, including the 80 percent of
partial birth abortions that are performed for purely elective
reasons.
<p>
&quot;The 1973 <I>Doe v. Bolton</I> Supreme Court decision defined
'health' as encompassing '<I>all</I> factors -- physical, <I>emotional,
psychological, familial</I>, and the woman's age -- relevant to
the <I>well-being</I> of the patient' (emphasis added).  As a
Yale Law school graduate, President Clinton is completely aware
that adding a health exception to the partial birth abortion ban
would render the bill meaningless.  And his attempts to deceive
the public by talking about prayer and health will not overcome
the overwhelming objections to this heinous form of infanticide.&quot;

<center><h2>SUING SUCCESSES, FLAUNTING FAILURES:<br>
HENRY FOSTER'S RECORD<br>
ON TEEN PREGNANCY</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> -- Family Research Council Policy Analyst
Gracie Hsu made the following statement Wednesday in response
to President Clinton's teen pregnancy task force under the leadership
of failed Surgeon General nominee Dr. Henry Foster:
<p>
&quot;<B>Dr. Foster and Planned Parenthood</B> -- Dr. Henry Foster
has had a long-time association with Planned Parenthood and promotes
its goals.  Dr. Foster was a member of the Board of Directors
for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) for several
years beginning in 1975.  In 1989, Dr. Foster served on PPFA's
National Leadership Committee in their Campaign to Keep Abortion
Safe and Legal, the main purpose of which was to fight against
parental consent laws, waiting periods, and other moderate restrictions
that states have the right to set.  In 1992, Dr. Foster was one
of PPFA's Public Policy Advocates, promoting PPFA's goals and
programs in the public policy realm.
<p>
&quot;<B>Suing Successes</B> -- Planned Parenthood has filed lawsuits
against pregnancy prevention programs that work.  For example,
in Hemet, California, Planned Parenthood sued to remove three
successful abstinence programs -- <I>Teen-Aid, Sex Respect, </I>and<I>
Choosing the Best</I> -- from the school district.  In independent
evaluations, all three abstinence programs proved to reduce the
teen sexual activity level, the teen pregnancy rate, and help
change students' attitudes towards saving sex until marriage.
In Jacksonville, Florida, Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit
against <I>Teen-Aid</I> despite the fact that Teen-Aid reduced
the teen pregnancy rate by 35 percent just 3 years after its implementation.
<p>
&quot;<B>Flaunting Failures</B> -- Dr. Foster sought to become
Surgeon General on the platform of combatting teen pregnancy due
to his experience with his own Nashville-based program, &quot;I
Have A Future&quot; (IHAF).  But IHAF's contraceptive-based approach
was a proven failure -- participants in the program actually showed
<I>higher</I> rates of sexual activity than those outside of the
program, according to a Carnegie Corporation evaluation.  These
results are consistent with other contraceptive-based programs
-- all of which show an increase in sexual activity rates, teen
pregnancy rates, and increased exposure to sexually-transmitted
diseases.
<p>
&quot;<B>What's Wrong With This Picture?</B> -- Why has President
Clinton chosen Dr. Foster as his senior advisor on teen pregnancy
when it is clear that Dr. Foster's policies and philosophy have
failed?  And, why has Mike McCurry said that the task force will
pursue contraceptive-based approaches when research clearly shows
that such approaches only put our children at higher risk?  Most
of all, why select a senior advisor on teen pregnancy who associates
himself with suing prevention programs that do indeed work?  President
Clinton, the American people await your answer.&quot;

<center><h2>CHALLENGE TO PRESIDENT CLINTON:<br>
SUPPORT <i>REAL</i> PREVENTION OF<br>
TEENAGE PREGNANCY</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> -- Family Research Council Policy Analyst
Gracie Hsu made the following statement Tuesday in response to
President Clinton's newly formed task force to combat teen pregnancy
under the leadership of failed Surgeon General nominee Dr. Henry
Foster:
<p>
&quot;<b>For the Record --</b> In his State of the Union address,
President Clinton said that he would form an organization which
would 'support grass-roots community efforts all across our country
in a national campaign against teen pregnancy.'
<p>
&quot;<b>Abstinence Programs Work</b> -- If President Clinton
is really serious about decreasing the teenage pregnancy rate,
he needs to look no further than the myriad of successful abstinence
programs around the country.
<p><ul>
<li>For example, <I>Best Friends</I> is a program which connects
teenage girls with mentors and utilizes the benefits of positive
peer pressure to promote abstinence.  A recent evaluation showed
that only 1.1 percent of its participants became pregnant, as
opposed to the 25 percent pregnancy rate for other girls in the
city.
<p>
<li>An evaluation of <I>Sex Respect</I>, an abstinence-based curriculum,
found that students participating in the program had considerably
lower pregnancy rates than those in a comparison group (5 percent
vs. 9 percent).
<p>
<li>Since Jacksonville, Florida (the fifteenth largest school
district in the nation) implemented the abstinence curriculum
<I>Teen-Aid</I> three years ago, the rate of teen pregnancy has
dropped by 35 percent.
<p>
<li>Other successful programs abound such as <I>True Love Waits</I>,
<I>Reasonable Reasons To Wait</I>, <I>Choosing the Best</I>, and
<I>AANCHOR</I>, among others.  And the one common denominator
in all these programs is that they emphasize abstinence and character
development.
</ul><p>
&quot;<B>Contraceptive-Based Approaches Fail</B> -- The data are
clear:  President Clinton should not support contraceptive-based
programs because they have proven to fail, increasing not only
the teen pregnancy rate but also teen sexual activity.
<p><ul>
<li>A study using data from the 1988 National Survey of Adolescent
Males (NSAM) found that adolescent males who had been instructed
in sexual biology and birth control were at a higher risk of early
intercourse than were those who had received no instruction.
<p>
<li>After Balboa High School in San Francisco instituted a condom
availability program, the school's overall teenage pregnancy rate
increased by a fourth in just two years.
<p>
<li>A recent <I>Washington Times</I> article reported that teen
pregnancy rates are higher in states that teach condom use than
in states that eschew sex education or stress abstinence.
<p>
<li>Participants in Dr. Henry Foster's Nashville-based program,
&quot;<I>I Have A Future</I>,&quot; actually showed higher rates
of sexual activity than those outside of the program, according
to a Carnegie Corporation evaluation.
</ul><p>
&quot;<B>What Will The Future Record Show?</B> -- The real question
is, will the Clinton/Foster task force support the abstinence
programs which have proven successful in reducing not only teenage
pregnancy, but also teenage sexual activity?  Or, will the task
force continue to support failed contraceptive programs and policies,
such as Dr. Foster's very own &quot;I Have A Future&quot; program?
<p>
&quot;We urge the President to carefully examine the data.  The
Family Research Council hopes that this task force will support
SUCCESS over IDEOLOGY.&quot;

<center><h2>PROMOTING FAILED POLICIES ON<br>
TEEN PREGNANCY:<br>
DR. HENRY FOSTER, TAKE 2</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> -- Family Research Council Policy Analyst
Gracie Hsu made the following statement Monday in response to
President Clinton's newly formed task force to combat teen pregnancy
headed by failed Surgeon General nominee Dr. Henry Foster:
<p>
&quot;<B>Disappointing -- </B>Bill Clinton in his State of the
Union Address sounded a very loud call for sounder values in society.
We were skeptical but hopeful that he intended to follow through
with the ideas expressed in his speech. Unfortunately, this appointment
shows that that is not the case.
<p>
&quot;<B>Replicating Failure -- </B>When President Clinton nominated
Dr. Henry Foster for Surgeon General, he said that he wanted Foster's
program, 'I Have A Future' replicated throughout the nation. 
But part of  the reason Dr. Foster was rejected as Surgeon General
was because his program, like all contraceptive-based programs,
was a proven failure.  Participants in Dr. Foster's 'I Have A
Future' program actually showed <I>higher</I> rates of sexual
activity than those outside of the program, according to a Carnegie
Corporation evaluation.
<p>
&quot;During Dr. Foster's confirmation hearings, Senator Nancy
Kassebaum (R-KS) said that 'the bottom line' was that 'there were
difficulties' (with Foster's program), including a 'dropout rate
[of]...at least 47.6 percent.'
<p>
&quot;<B>What Works?</B> -- Evaluation studies are crystal clear:
the only programs that really work to reduce teen pregnancy are
ABSTINENCE programs.  During his State of the Union address, President
Clinton noted that the teen pregnancy rate has dropped for two
years in a row.  The reason for this decline is <b>not</b> due
to federally-funded &quot;safe sex&quot; programs nor Joycelyn
Elders' conscience-assaulting promotion of condoms. Rather<I><B>,
teen pregnancy is declining because more teens are choosing abstinence</B></I>
despite all of the federal government's efforts to promote the
contrary. Statistics published by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention show that the decrease in teen pregnancy rates
is concurrent with the rising number of teens choosing to abstain
from sex.
<p>
&quot;<B>Lacking Common Sense</B> -- Why has the President appointed
Dr. Henry Foster to head a task force to combat teen pregnancy
when Dr. Foster's own program has a proven track record of failure?
Why has the President ignored all the data about the effectiveness
of abstinence-based programs and instead chosen to promote a failed
policy nationwide?
<p>
&quot;The American people rejected Joycelyn Elders, Kristine Gebbie,
and Dr. Henry Foster because they all promoted the same disastrous
policies.  Each of them was finally ousted because of the outcry
of the American people against their programs.  The President
should know that he cannot escape accountability simply by giving
Dr. Foster a back door by which to enter to do more harm to our
children.&quot;

<center><h2>FORGET DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN SPINNING<br>
WHAT IS A PRO-FAMILY PLATFORM?<br>
HOW CAN YOU KNOW WHO WILL FIGHT FOR IT?<br>
<p>
THERE IS A SINGLE SOURCE.<br>
<i>OUR HOPES, OUR DREAMS</i></h2></center>
<p>
<B>WASHINGTON, D.C</B>. -- &quot;At Family Research Council, we
don't endorse candidates. But we want <b>every</b> candidate to
deal with the breakdown of values and the disintegration of the
family that is eroding the America of our hopes and dreams,&quot;
said Gary L. Bauer, president of Family Research Council and author
of the soon-to-be released <I><B>Our Hopes, Our Dreams: A Vision
for America.</B></I>
<p>
<b>This book is the answer to the most asked questions</b>, &quot;What
do you want for America?&quot; and &quot;What do you want people
to do about it?&quot; Gary Bauer is uniquely qualified to answer
those questions. His almost 30 years in political life include
serving President Ronald Reagan as domestic policy advisor and
serving as undersecretary of education under William Bennett.
<p>
Bauer notes, &quot;Every politician talks about supporting the
family, but when the election results are in and the rhetoric
dies down, different visions are in conflict. And every time,
America's families wonder why the people who sounded so good,
could make such bad policy. My book is a tool for deciphering
exactly what a politician means by 'pro-family policy.'
<p>
&quot;<b>Hillary Clinton says it takes a village to raise a child</b>,
but the real 'village' is founded on strong parents, supported
by family, friends, churches, schools and the local community.
Big government isn't a village. And bureaucrats in Washington,
D.C. are not better able to make decisions for children than loving
parents. The village must be an environment in which families
are supported and strengthened.
<p>
&quot;<b>The problem today <i>is</i> the village</b>. Cultural
pollution, crime, violence, liberal government policies, sexually
explicit images, unresponsive educators and anti-faith bigotry
are among the 'village forces' that work against families trying
to teach their children right from wrong and trying to give them
a sense of  the American dream.
<p>
&quot;<b>The dream is not the pursuit of money</b>, but it is
the hope that every person will have the opportunity to succeed
in a world that does not self-destruct, but has enduring values
that protect us and our families.&quot;
<p>
Published by Focus on the Family,<I> Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I>
is a valuable grassroots tool. You can order a copy by calling
1-800-225-4008. <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> will be available
Feb. 1 at your local Christian bookstore.
<p>
&quot;<b>Dr. James Dobson and I want to get this book to one
million readers in 1996</b>,&quot; Bauer noted, &quot;so that
every American will have a pro-family resource. At the end of
each chapter, Yes-or-No questions make it possible for people
to take the spin out of the rhetoric.
<p>
&quot;But the heart of the book is the 'Compact with Our Fellow
Americans,' a commitment for those who sign it  that we will work
together to heal America and make it the place of  our hopes and
dreams.&quot;

<center><h2>AFTER JUDGE WITHDRAWAL, U.S. APPEALS<br>
COURT SET TO HEAR ABEL CASE</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> After almost a month delay, <I>Abel
et. al, v. U.S.A. et. al</I>, one of the many cases involving homosexuals in 
the military, will be heard today in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second 
Circuit in New York City.  On Dec. 19, Judge Guido Calabresi recused himself
from the case because of a letter he had written in favor of a
more liberal position than the law at the time set out.  Today,
a new three judge panel will hear arguments about six service
members' discharges on the basis of admission of homosexuality.
 Family Research Council filed a friend of the court brief, written
by Melissa Wells-Petry, counsel for FRC's Military Readiness Project,
in the case.  Experts will be available for comment in New York.
<p>
The lower court ruled that Abel's six service members' First and
Fifth Amendment rights were violated when the military sought
to discharge them solely based on their admission of homosexuality.
 But as pointed out in the recent <I>Thomasson</I> hearings in
Richmond, Virginia, the military homosexual cases are about the
Clinton Administration's effort to make an end-run around Congress
by defending vague regulations rather than the 1993 law which
clearly excludes homosexuals from military service.
<p>
&quot;The Clinton Administration is doing all it can to put homosexuals
in the military,&quot; said Bob Maginnis, FRC Director of the
Military Readiness Project and a retired Army lieutenant colonel.
&quot;Congress passed the law excluding homosexuals serving in
the military in support of what the American people demanded,
but the Clinton Pentagon has subverted the law with bad implementing
regulations -- many say deliberately creating a legal quagmire.&quot;
<p>
Maginnis continued: &quot;The Clinton Administration wants the
law viewed through the prism of the bad regulations which create
two classes of homosexuals, those who have sex and those who don't.
 But the law presumes and the courts have long affirmed that a
homosexual is one who regularly engages in, or intends to engage
in, same sex activity. While some who struggle with homosexual
temptations may never act on them, there is no such thing as a
chaste homosexual,&quot; Maginnis said.
<p>
&quot;The pro-homosexual Clinton Justice Department has created
a constitutional thicket for the courts by adding to the law what
was never intended.  FRC's brief points out this thicket and calls
for the court to affirm the law and the Pentagon's discharge for
self-avowed homosexuals.&quot;
<p>
Because of <I>Abel's</I> delay, <I>Thomasson v. Perry</I>, another
case on this issue recently heard in the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Fourth Circuit, may reach the Supreme Court before <I>Abel</I>.
FRC presented oral arguments in <I>Thomasson</I> and may have
the opportunity to argue before the highest court in the land
one of the most controversial issues of our day.
<p>
<center><h4>Both Maginnis and Wells-Petry will be available for comment
at the hearing. They also can be reached by contacting the FRC
media office.</h4></center>

<center><h2>FRC APPLAUDS TELECOM BILL<br>
CYBERPORN LANGUAGE,<br>
SAYS LAW PROTECTS MINORS<br>
FROM A &quot;LOADED GUN&quot;</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council applauds the
Telecom Conference Committee's decision to include pornography
restrictions in the Telecommunications Bill.   &quot;Leaving pornography
unrestricted in cyberspace is like leaving a loaded gun in a playground.
The new language will help parents protect their children by making
cyberporn inaccessible by children,&quot; Director of Legal Studies
Cathy Cleaver said.
<p>
Highlights of the cyberporn provisions:
<p><ul>
<li>Use of court-approved &quot;indecency&quot; standard, defined
in the bill as an <B>&quot;image or other communication that,
in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive
as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory
activities or organs&quot;</B> 
<p>
<li>Indecent communications <B>restricted from children</B>, available
to adults
<p>
<li>People liable only for <B>knowing violations</B> of the law
<p>
<li>Online service providers not liable for violations beyond
areas they own or control
<p>
<li>E-mail privacy laws unchanged
<p>
<li>Those taking good faith efforts to restrict pornography from
children have a defense
</ul><p>
Cleaver noted that, contrary to much of the current rhetoric,
the cyberporn provisions will not find Shakespeare or any other
serious work of literature or library art to be indecent. &quot;Adults
with common sense do not confuse art and literature with patently
offensive materials which degrade women, corrupt children, and
ruin men,&quot; Cleaver said, &quot;and the courts will be obliged
to evaluate material in its proper context.&quot;
<p>
FRC's Assistant to the President for Government Relations Marty
Dannenfelser noted that a few other provisions of the bill are
still unresolved and urged the conferees and the Congressional
leadership to make every effort to conclude these matters as soon
as possible.
<p>
&quot;I hope that both the House and the Senate are able to give
final approval to this important legislation by the end of the
year, so that we do not risk losing the opportunity to protect
our children from the cultural poison of cyberporn,&quot; Dannenfelser
said.

<center><h2>NEW DIVORCE RATES RELEASED</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The national divorce rate is 4.6,
according to a compilation of new data released today by the Family
Research Council.  In 1994, 4.6 of every 1,000 Americans divorced.
<p>
Massachusetts and Connecticut rank 1st and 2nd, respectively,
for having the lowest divorce rates in the nation.  Both states
experienced a moderate drop in divorce rates between 1992 and
1994 to remain at the top of the list.  Massachusetts fell from
2.8 in 1992 to 2.4 in 1994, while Connecticut fell from 3.1 to
2.8.
<p>
Nevada once again had the highest divorce rate in the country,
even though it experienced the most marked drop in divorce rates
during the two-year period.  Nevada fell from 11.4 in 1992 to
9.0 in 1994.
<p>
Currently, divorce laws in almost every state give greater legal
rights to spouses who want to end the marriage than to spouses
who want to try to work out their marital problems. According
to FRC's 1995 Family Issues Survey, 55 percent of the American
public want to see these laws modified to offer greater protection
to spouses interested in saving the marriage.  &quot;Clearly divorce
reform is an issue that needs to be addressed at the state level,&quot;
said Gary L. Bauer, president of the Family Research Council.

<center><h2>NEW ILLEGITIMACY RATES RELEASED</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Thirty-one percent of all births in
the U.S. are to unmarried women, according to a compilation of
new data released today by the Family Research Council.
<p>
&quot;Most Americans believe preventing out-of-wedlock pregnancy
is a realistic goal,&quot; said FRC president Gary Bauer.  He
cited findings from FRC's 1995 Family Issues Survey showing that
most Americans actually have greater hope for illegitimacy prevention
programs than for workfare programs designed to move single mothers
off welfare.
<p>
In addition, FRC's poll showed that most Americans consider &quot;putting
the child up for adoption&quot; and &quot;marrying the child's
father&quot; to be better responses to an unwed pregnancy than
single motherhood.  A clear majority -- 55 percent -- say abortion
is the &quot;worst&quot; response to an unwed pregnancy, Bauer
said.
<p>
The state with the lowest percentage of births to unmarried women
is Utah, with 15.5 percent.  Like Utah, most other states with
low illegitimacy ratios are sparsely-populated states west of
the Mississippi River.  East of the Mississippi, only Vermont
and New Hampshire show a ratio of less than 25 percent of births
to unmarried women.  
<p>
Of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 10 states have
illegitimacy ratios at or above 35 percent.  All of these states,
with the exception of New York, are along the southern rim of
the 48 contiguous states.

<center><h2>ABEL JUDGE PULLS OUT OF CASE<br>
GOOD NEWS FOR FAMILIES, SAYS FRC</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> When Family Research Council staff got to
the New York court on Tuesday where the <I>Abel et al v. William
Perry </I>was being heard, they were prepared to hear arguments
about six service members' discharges on the basis of admission
of homosexuality. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
in New York City was the next stop for the case which could go
on to the Supreme Court. 
<p>
However, at the last minute, Judge Guido Calabresi recused himself
from the case because of a letter he had written in favor of a
more liberal position than the law at the time set out. Court
watchers said that the judge pulled out after the Justice Department
reminded him of the letter. Since there were only two judges left
to hear the case, rather than the three needed, the hearing had
to be postponed.
<p>
&quot;This is very good news for pro-family Americans,&quot; FRC
Director of the Military Readiness Project Robert Maginnis said,
directly after the hearing. &quot;The New York court is not expected
to be as favorable to the view of most Americans, the law and
military experience -- the view that homosexuals should not be
allowed to serve in the military because of the problems their
presence cause.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Abel was one of two cases on this issue making its way toward
the Supreme Court. The other, <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i>, was heard
recently in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit,
and Family Research Council presented oral arguments. Now, Thomasson
may very well make it to the Supreme Court first, and Family Research
Council could argue before the highest court in the land one of
the most controversial issues of our day.
<p>
&quot;The Clinton Administration has not been making the case
that has traditionally fallen to the government -- the case for
a strong military force, free from a sexually charged environment.
It is critical that a fighting force be able to work as a team
without the complications of sexual politics.&quot;

<center><h2>ABEL CASE DOES END-RUN AROUND THE LAW,<br>
SET FOR TUESDAY HEARING IN NEW YORK</h2></center>
<p>
<b>Washington, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council, a national
leader in the battle opposing homosexuals in the military, filed
this summer a friend of the court brief in the <I>Abel et al v.
William Perry</I> federal case which is scheduled for arguments
on Dec. 19.  Either this case or the 4th Circuit's <I>Thomasson
v. Perry</I> case is expected to reach the Supreme Court next
year.  Family Research Council will be at the U.S. Court of Appeal
for the Second Circuit in New York City when the case will be
heard, and experts will be available for comment.
<p>
The lower court ruled that Abel's six service members' First and
Fifth Amendment rights were violated when the military sought
to discharge them solely based on their admission of homosexuality.
 But as pointed out in the recent Thomasson hearings in Richmond,
Virginia, the military homosexual cases are about the Clinton
Administration's effort to make an end-run around Congress by
defending vague regulations rather than the 1993 law which clearly
excludes homosexuals from military service.
<p>
&quot;The Clinton Administration is doing all it can to put homosexuals
in the military,&quot; said Bob Maginnis, FRC Director of the
Military Readiness Project and a retired Army lieutenant colonel
 &quot;Congress passed the law excluding homosexuals serving in
the military in support of what the American people demanded,
but the Clinton Pentagon has subverted the law with bad implementing
regulations -- many say deliberately creating a legal quagmire.&quot;
<p>
Maginnis continued: &quot;The Clinton Administration wants the
law viewed through the prism of the bad regulations which create
two classes of homosexuals, those who have sex and those who don't.
 But the law presumes and the courts have long affirmed that a
homosexual is one who regularly engages in, or intends to engage
in, same sex activity. While some who struggle with homosexual
temptations may never act on them, there is not such thing as
a chaste homosexual,&quot; Maginnis said. 
<p>
&quot;Feeling pulled to do something is not the defining issue.
A person who is tempted to shop lift when a clerk's back is turned
is not a thief. A thief is the person who acts on that temptation
or who enters the store looking for an opportunity to steal,&quot;
Maginnis said.
<p>
&quot;The pro-homosexual Clinton Justice Department has created
a constitutional thicket for the courts by adding to the law what
was never intended.  FRC's brief points out this thicket and calls
for the court to affirm the law and the Pentagon's discharge for
self-avowed homosexuals.&quot;
<p>
After the hearing, a ruling could be expected sometime between
March and May, Maginnis said. The brief was written by Melissa Wells-Petry, 
counsel for FRC's Military Readiness Project. 
<p>
<b>Both Maginnis and Wells-Petry will be available for comment
at the hearing. They also will be reachable by calling the FRC
media.</b>

<p>
<center><h2>CLINTON'S JUSTICE DEPARTMENT USES<br>
SUPREME COURT TO PROMOTE<br>
ANTI-FAMILY AGENDA</h2></center>
<p>
<b>Washington, D.C. --</b> Today, the Family Research Council
filed a friend of the court brief in the Supreme Court case of
<I> U.S. v. Commonwealth of Virginia</I> (the Virginia Military
Institute). FRC Policy Analyst Bob Maginnis noted that &quot;in
this case, the Clinton Administration is promoting a radical agenda
that would enact the goals of the failed Equal Rights Amendment
without a vote.&quot;   Oral arguments are set for January 17,
1996.
<p>
Clinton's Justice Department goes well beyond the issue of whether
single-sex public colleges should be legal.  According to the
government's brief, Clinton wants the high court to impose a &quot;strict
scrutiny&quot; test which would make all classifications by gender
very hard to defend legally.  With high court approval, this would
be a back door to the Equal Rights Amendment reviving old debates
about Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, homosexual marriage and unisex
bathrooms.
<p>
The brief was written by Melissa Wells-Petry, counsel to FRC's
Military Readiness Project.
<p>
&quot;Ironically, this case would strike its hardest blow on women's
institutions,&quot;  Wells-Petry said. &quot;Single-sex schools
for women number 87, compared to two all-male partially state-supported
schools. Educators working with both sexes have long appreciated
that for some girls and some boys, a single-sex education provides
unique benefits. We can include the First Lady and a quarter of
the female members of Congress among leading Americans who are
single-sex education alumni.&quot;
<p>
The government's Supreme Court brief states, &quot;The long history
of discrimination against women, the general irrelevance of sex
as a ground for official decision-making, and women's continuing
under representation in government, all support the application
of strict scrutiny here.&quot;   This ignores differences between
men and women which were cited in the VMI hearings and helped
defeat the ERA.
<p>
The Clinton Administration appealed the decision by the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit  which accepted Virginia's proposal
to offer a military-style alternative at Mary Baldwin College
in Stauton, Virginia.  The government claims that  the 1976 forced
integration of women at the service academies shows that &quot;the
admission of women into a rigorous, military-style educational
program does not impair any governmental interest in producing
military personnel, let alone 'citizen-soldiers.'&quot; 
<p>
&quot;Accepting this 'evidence' will seriously erode female combat
exemptions and may subject women to a future combat draft,&quot;
said Maginnis, a retired Army lieutenant colonel.
<p>
Drew Days, III, Clinton's solicitor general, argues &quot;that
strict scrutiny is, in fact, the correct constitutional standard
for evaluating differences in official treatment based on sex.&quot;
 Strict scrutiny applies to racial classifications challenged
under the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.  It requires
the defendant to prove that any race-based classification is narrowly
tailored to achieve a compelling government objective.  But the
color of a person's skin and sex are different spheres.
<p>
Looking at legal precedents, Maginnis noted, &quot;A strict scrutiny
finding in this case could eliminate single-sex education, permit
homosexual adoption and marriage, prohibit single-gender sports
and even make single-sex prisons unconstitutional.&quot;

<center><h2>IT'S TIME WE KNEW  WHAT HAPPENED TO THE<br>
CHILDREN OF TABLE 34</h2>
<p>
<h4>Family Research Council calls on Congress to support the Child
Protection and Ethics in Education Act of 1995</h4></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Fresh examination of the full
range of erroneous and fraudulent findings in the Kinsey research
is long overdue,&quot; Family Research Council Director of Cultural
Studies Robert H. Knight said Thursday in a news conference to
unveil the Child Protection and Ethics in Education Act of 1995.
Knight made his comments in the 11:30 a.m.  news conference at
2222 Rayburn as Rep. Steve Stockman (R-TX) presented the legislation.
<p>
Mr. Knight made the following statement:
<p>
&quot;Family Research Council commends Rep. Stockman  and the
approximately 40 cosponsors on the introduction of The Child Protection
and Ethics in Education Act of 1995, a bill designed to resolve
unanswered questions about the ethics and scientific integrity
of the sex studies by Alfred C. Kinsey in the 1940s and '50s.
 Despite the flaws identified by early critics of the Kinsey methodology 
and findings, the twin studies Kinsey's team authored,
on male and female sexuality, continue to provide a pseudo-intellectual
foundation for social change that has proven deeply injurious
to children and families.&quot;
<p>
&quot;The 1990 book <I>Kinsey, Sex and Fraud</I> by Judith Reisman,
Ph. D., and Edward Eichel, M.A. (Drs. Gordon Muir and John Court,
eds.) revealed a variety of serious problems with the Kinsey research.
 According to scientific fraud specialist Dr. Walter Stewart of
the National Research Council, evidence of these problems is 'compelling
. . . disturbing . . . and requires investigation.'  A review
of Kinsey, Sex and Fraud in the British medical journal The <I>Lancet</I>
concluded that the book 'demolish[es]' the foundations of the
Kinsey research, which The <I>Lancet</I> editors concluded was
'unethical [and] possibly criminal.&quot;
<p>
&quot;The<I> Lancet's</I> characterization of portions of the
research as 'possibly criminal' is based on the inclusion in the
male study of several tables compiled from information obtained
by 'nine' pedophiles.  Table 34 reports the results of orgasm
produced by adults in infants as young as a few months old.  The
current director of the Kinsey Institute, Dr. John Bancroft, now
says that there was but one pedophile engaged in this infant molestation,
but the Institute has refused to reveal his name, the names of
his child and infant victims, or anything else about the circumstances
under which this data was obtained and published.  These and other
key questions must be resolved now.&quot;
<p>
&quot;The introduction of The Child Protection and Ethics in Education
Act today takes a significant step forward in the effort to learn the full 
truth about the Kinsey research.  Given what we already know, it is unimaginable
that any reputable scientific study, any curriculum, or any public
policy today would be based on this work.  The American people
deserve a full accounting of the role that Kinsey played -- and
is still playing -- in molding the sexual ethics of our nation
and its children.&quot;

<p>
<h3>STOCKMAN BILL TO ADDRESS:</h3>
<p>
<h2>DOES DATA FROM MOLESTED<br>
CHILDREN SHAPE MOST SEX<br>
EDUCATION PROGRAMS?</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council will lend its
full support to the Child Protection and Ethics in Education Act
of 1995 to be announced by Rep. Steve Stockman (R-TX) in a news
conference <B>Thursday, Dec.7 at 11:30 a.m. in 2222 Rayburn</B>.
<p>
The bill's purpose is &quot;to determine if Alfred Kinsey's 'Sexual
Behavior in the Human Male' and/or 'Sexual Behavior in the Human
Female' are the result of any fraud or criminal wrongdoing.&quot;
 If such is found, the Congress will &quot;require an in-depth
study be performed to determine if Kinsey and his fellow researchers
employed systematic sexual abuse of children to obtain the data
tabulated in 'Table 34' and other portions of the study,&quot;
the bill states. 
<p>
The bill would also require the Government Accounting Office (GAO)
to study whether federal agencies and schools have used tax monies
to promote information on sexual behavior based upon &quot;erroneous,
fraudulent&quot; research.
<p>
FRC Director of Cultural Studies Bob Knight wrote and directed
a 30-minute documentary, &quot;The Children of Table 34,&quot;
investigating Kinsey's studies.
<p>
Knight said, &quot;After looking at the video, people are compelled
to ask, did the researchers lie about their findings, or were
children actually molested in the name of science?  It's a frightening
story, but it doesn't stop there. This research is central to
current thought on sex education for our children today.&quot;

<center><h2>STOP EFFORTS TO REPLACE MOM &amp; DAD<br>
WITH BIG BROTHER, CLEAVER SAYS</h2>
<p>
<h4>PARENTAL RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES ACT OF 1995 ON DECK<br>
AT 10 AM HEARING, DIRKSEN 226</h4></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> In the growing struggle of parents
versus the government in a war over who decides for America's
children, &quot;the need for federal legislation is becoming increasingly
apparent,&quot; said Cathy Cleaver, Director of Legal Studies
for Family Research Council, on Tuesday.
<p>
Miss Cleaver spoke on behalf of parents and in support of the
1995 Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act (H.R. 1946, S. 984).
During the 10 am hearing, Family Research Council applauded the
efforts of Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) and  Rep. Steve Largent
(R-OK) in sponsoring the act because &quot;this is a good step
toward  restoring the rights of parents to direct the upbringing
and education of their children.&quot;
<p>
In support of parents, Miss Cleaver related the following:
<p>
&quot;Consider the following: this summer, Mr. and Mrs. Waymon
Earls of Georgia were shocked to find a bag of condoms in their
13- and 15-year old daughters' room.  After repeated inquiries
of the school superintendent, they found that a school counselor
had driven the girls during school hours to a health clinic where
they were tested for AIDS and cervical cancer, and given condoms
and prescriptions for birth control pills.  Mr. And Mrs. Earls
have not been allowed to see the results of their daughters' tests.
 This type of 'parenting' by agents of the state must stop.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Tragically, there are cases of abuse and neglect that the
government agencies must address.  This legislation continues
to allow the government to intervene when it has a compelling
interest to do so.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Stable, intact families rearing children with both love
and direction have never been in shorter supply or more desperately
needed. Let's stop replacing Mom and Dad with Big Brother, and
pass the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act.&quot;

<center><h2>FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL ARGUES TO<br>
UPHOLD 1993 LAW ON<br>
HOMOSEXUALS IN THE MILITARY</h2>
<p>
<h4><i>THOMASSON v. PERRY</i><br>
HEARD IN U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, 4TH CIRCUIT</h4></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council presents oral
arguments today in a landmark case in which the U.S. Court of
Appeals, 4th Circuit will consider the constitutionality of the
Clinton's Administration's homosexual policy as an interpretation
of the 1993 law passed by Congress excluding homosexuals from
military service. FRC Attorney Melissa Wells-Petry, former Army
lawyer who has litigated the military's ban on homosexuals for
years, submitted friend-of-the-court arguments to the effect that
the dismissal from the Navy of Lt-Paul G. Thomasson, a self-identified
homosexual, should be upheld.
<p>
Technically, FRC and the Clinton Justice Department will be on
the same side of this case, however their arguments differ greatly.
The Justice Department opposes FRC's arguments, based on the intent
of the law passed by Congress, and submitted a brief attacking
their participation.  The Justice Department rests their case
on, and as their brief states, has a &quot;paramount interest
in defending the validity of Directives&quot; issued to implement
the law.
<p>
Family Research Council analyst Lt. Col. Robert Maginnis says
the recent opposition  indicates that &quot;the Justice Department's
primary motive is to uphold Clinton's promise to the homosexual
community rather than to defend a law in the military's best interests.&quot;
<p>
&quot;We hope the court will declare the regulations unconstitutional
and sustain the law of the land,&quot; Maginnis said. &quot;It
would be a tremendous act on behalf of the men and women who put
their lives on the line for their nation daily. They deserve to
serve in an environment that does not put them in unnecessarily
intimate and intrusive circumstances.&quot; 
<p>
Maginnis anticipates the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals to refer
the case to the Supreme Court.

<h2>FRC TO PRESENT ARGUMENTS IN<br>
LANDMARK CASE, <I>THOMASSON v. PERRY</I></h2>
<p>
<h3>U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, 4TH CIRCUIT TO HEAR<br>
CASE ON HOMOSEXUALS IN THE MILITARY</h3></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> In a rare occasion, Family Research
Council will present arguments on why the 1993 law excluding homosexuals
from the military should be upheld during a Tuesday, December
5 hearing.  FRC Attorney Melissa Wells-Petry, a former Army attorney
who litigated the military's ban on homosexuals, will defend the
law in the landmark case of <I>Thomasson v. Perry</I> before the
U.S. Court of Appeals, 4th Circuit, in Richmond, Va.
<p>
FRC will be in the position of defending the law passed by Congress,
and the Clinton Administration's Justice Department will take
the more liberal position of building their case on the Department
of Defense regulations implemented to enact the law.
<p>
According to Family Research Council analyst Lt. Col. Robert Maginnis,
the confusion between the law and Clinton's &quot;Don't Ask/Don't
Tell&quot; policy is a strategy designed to lead to litigation.
<p>
&quot;Military people support the ban and so do the American people,&quot;
Maginnis said. 
<p>
A survey by the American Security Council Foundation found that
99% of active duty officers said homosexuals would undermine the
cohesiveness and readiness of combat units.

<h3>HOMOSEXUALS IN THE MILITARY CASE,<br>
<i>THOMASSON v. PERRY,</i> TO BE HEARD IN U.S.<br>
COURT OF APPEALS, 4TH CIRCUIT</h3>
<p>
<h2>FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL<br>
WILL PRESENT ARGUMENTS</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council Attorney Melissa
Wells-Petry will present arguments on why the 1993 law excluding
homosexuals from the military should be upheld during a Tuesday,
December 5 hearing. Wells-Petry, a former Army attorney who litigated
the military's ban on homosexuals, will defend the law in the
landmark case of <I>Thomasson v. Perry </I>before the U.S. Court
of Appeals, 4th Circuit, in Richmond, Va.
<p>
To the surprise of court watchers, the Appeals Court granted
FRC's request to address them -- despite the objections of the
Department of Justice and attorneys for Thomasson, a self-identified
homosexual serving in the military. Ironically, Family Research
Council will be in the position of actually defending the law
-- which would seem to be the province of the Justice Department.
However, the Clinton Administration's Justice Department has taken
the more liberal position of building their case on the regulations
implemented to enact the law.
<P>
According to Family Research Council analyst Robert Maginnis,
from the beginning of the &quot;Don't Ask/Don't Tell&quot; policy,
 the strategy of the Clinton Administration  has been to set up
a confusing situation between the law and the regulations.
<p>
<B>&quot;The confusion was designed to lead to ligitation,&quot;
Maginnis said.</B>
<p>
&quot;We hope the court will declare the regulations unconstitutional
and sustain the law of the land,&quot; Maginnis said. &quot;It
would be a tremendous act on behalf of the men and women who put
their lives on the line for their nation daily. They deserve to

<h2>SENATE RESUMES DEBATE ON</br>
PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION BILL</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The U.S. Senate is expected to resume
debate on the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act (HR 1833) as early
as Monday, December 4.  Family Research Council supports the partial-birth
abortion ban and will oppose any weakening amendments to the bill.
<p>
The Senate voted November 7 to refer the bill to the Judiciary
committee for a public hearing. On November 17, the Senate Judiciary
Committee held a hearing to educate the Senators about this procedure.
 Senators heard dramatic testimony from a number of witnesses
including the President of the American Society of Anesthesiologists,
Dr. Ellison. Delivering key testimony, Ellison dispelled the claim
of an abortionist who testified last summer before a House subcommittee,
that anesthesia given to the mother as part of the procedure protects
the fetus from pain, and that it causes &quot;brain death&quot;
in the fetus. Others testifying about the procedure were former
abortion nurse Brenda Shafer, Dr. Pamela Smith, Dr. Nancy Romer,
Helen Alvare, Jeannie Wallace French, and Professor Douglas Kmiec.
No amendments were offered to the bill, and it automatically returned
to the Senate &quot;calendar&quot; November 28. 
<p>
As early as Monday, December 4th, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole
(R-KS) and Senator Bob Smith (R-NH), the prime sponsor of the
bill, may take up the House-passed bill on the Senate floor. 
<p>
The House has already voted overwhelmingly on November 1 to pass
the bill by more than a 2-1 margin (288-139).  In the Senate,
it is expected that the bill will receive support from a diverse
group of senators with various histories on pro-life votes.  FRC
will be urging Senators to oppose a series of misleading amendments
designed to gut the substance of the legislation.

<center><h2>FEDERALLY-FUNDED &quot;SAFE SEX&quot;<br>
COMMERCIALS SEND WRONG MESSAGE<br>
TO TEENS</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council Policy Analyst
Gracie Hsu made the following statement in response to the new
&quot;safe sex&quot; public service announcements released today
by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS):
<p>
<B>Flawed premise</B> -- &quot;The Family Research Council (FRC)
finds the HHS ads irresponsible in that all the ads -- with the
exception of the abstinence ad -- begin with the flawed premise
that there is nothing wrong or harmful about teenagers having
sex as long as they use a condom.  The truth is, out-of-wedlock
sex is harmful in and of itself, regardless if a condom is used:
 broken hearts, emotional regret, and greatly increased likelihood
to divorce are just some of the consequences of pre-marital sex.&quot;
<p>
<B>Doomed for failure</B> -- &quot;These ads are doomed for failure.
 Research clearly shows that condom-based approaches actually
increase the likelihood that teenagers will initiate sex.  The
only approach that has proven to be effective in protecting young
people is abstinence.  The problem with these ads is that, when
they crash and burn, they'll likely take a whole host of young
people with them.&quot;
<p>
<B>Irresponsible use of federal funds</B> -- &quot;When public
opinion polls show that a majority of adults <b>and</b> teenagers
believe that it is best to save sex for marriage, it is irresponsible
for the federal government to be using taxpayer dollars to give
its imprimatur for teens to have sex.&quot;
<p>
<B>Undermines parents</B> -- &quot;The ads, clearly aimed at teenagers
and 'Generation X,' undermine what most parents want for their
children.  These ads undercut the message that most parents explicitly
or implicitly relate to their children that sex should be saved
until marriage.&quot;
<p>
<B>FRC's position</B> -- &quot;FRC is, and always has been, committed
to protecting young people from the negative consequences of early
sexual activity (i.e., out-of-wedlock pregnancy, abortion, AIDS,
and other sexually-transmitted diseases), and to promoting the
positive benefits of saving sex for marriage (i.e., more stable
marriages, greater sexual satisfaction, fewer infertility problems).
 FRC has been a leader in educating young people about the benefits
of abstinence and heartily endorses other efforts which help strengthen
the resolve of young people to wait until marriage to have sex.&quot;

<center><h2>FRC WILL FIGHT FOR MILITARY<br>
LAW IN FEDERAL COURT</h2></center>
<p>
<b>Washington, D.C. --</b> The Family Research Council will defend
the military's homosexual law before the 4th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals on December 5.   This rare privilege comes after extensive
FRC work in articulating a case about the real impacts of  the
radical homosexual agenda in the military.
<p>
Robert Maginnis, FRC's Military Readiness Project director and
a retired Army lieutenant colonel, announced on Tuesday that the
4th Circuit which sits in Richmond, Virginia, approved FRC's motion
to make oral arguments in the case of Navy Lt. Paul G. Thomasson.
 <b>This is the first challenge to President Clinton's &quot;don't
ask, don't tell&quot; policy expected to reach the Supreme Court
next year.</b>
<p>
Mr. Thomasson, who worked for the admiral administering &quot;don't
ask, don't tell,&quot; told his commander about his sexual orientation
days after the policy went into effect.  After the Navy moved
to discharge him, he challenged the policy in federal court and
lost.  
<p>
Melissa Wells-Petry, a former Army litigator and now representing
FRC, will argue that the White House and Pentagon failed to follow
a newly enacted law when writing the &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot;
policy.  The law, enacted by Congress and signed by President
Clinton, bars homosexuals from serving in the military.  But the
regulations allow homosexuals to serve as long as they keep their
orientation private.
<p>
Mrs. Wells-Petry explains, &quot;They're definitely trying to
do what I call 'the wink' in the regulations as opposed to a clear-cut
rule.  They're trying to put as a matter of policy, 'We're going
to wink at it until it becomes flagrant.'  In our view it's just
not a workable policy.&quot;
<p>
The Military Readiness Project has aggressively filed amicus briefs
in most homosexual military cases because, as Colonel Maginnis
says, &quot;The Clinton Administration is ignoring the law and
trying to erase centuries of prudent policy in favor of allowing
homosexuals to serve in the military.&quot; 
<p>
FRC's team will join a three-sided argument with the Justice Department
defending the regulations, Mr. Thomasson's attorney asking that
the law and the policy be ruled unconstitutional and the Military
Readiness Project defending the law.
<p>
In accepting FRC's motion for oral argument, the Court acknowledges
that there is &quot;extraordinary&quot; justification for a third
party to argue.  The extraordinary situation exists because neither
the government or Thomasson is addressing the right issue.

<center><h4>ANNOUNCING FRC'S NEW T.V. SHOW:</h4>
<p>
<h2><i>&quot;STRAIGHT TALK</i><br>
FROM THE FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL&quot;</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council this month
launched a new one hour television program called, &quot;Straight
Talk from the Family Research Council,&quot; on National Empowerment
Television (NET), a cable Political NewsTalk Network. Every Wednesday
at 8 p.m., the show airs cutting edge news stories, fast-paced
discussions and commentary by President Gary Bauer, Director of
Communications Kristi Hamrick, and guest appearances by FRC policy
analysts, members of Congress, and leaders of the pro-family movement.
<p>
The show includes many different segments, such as &quot;Behind
the Headlines,&quot; an insider's look at what is happening to
the family in Washington, and &quot;Homefront News,&quot; a highlight
of what FRC has been doing to bolster the family.
<p>
Each show tackles a single issue from many sides. Topics include:
what original FRC polling shows about Americans, welfare reform,
tainted sex research, and more. 
<p>
An exciting new venture for FRC, &quot;Straight Talk&quot; reaches
into more than 11 million homes. &quot;Our dream of providing
a pro-family voice is much bigger than merely building a conservative
'speed bump' in a vast terrain of liberal reporting,&quot; Gary
Bauer said. &quot;Our vision is to help a national audience understand
not only what we believe but why we support the kind of pro-family
reforms that we advocate daily in Washington. Our aim is to make
a connection with even more of those millions of Americans who
go to work every morning worrying about the kind of world their
children are inheriting.&quot;
<p>
To learn whether your cable company carries NET: Check local listings
or call your cable carrier. If you have a satellite dish, NET
can be reached on Galaxy 7, Transponder 20. <B>Beginning December
1st, NET will change settings to Galaxy 6, Transponder 7.</B>

<center><b>SENATE SENDS PARTIAL-BIRTH TO COMMITTEE:<br>
<font size=+2>IT'S A TIME FOR EDUCATION, SAYS BAUER<br>
<p>
<i>AND: MEDIA ADVISORY FOR THURSDAY HEARING.</i></font></b></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Pro-family Americans support
the vote today because it allows more time to better educate the
Senators about this inhumane procedure,&quot; Family Research
Council President Gary Bauer said Wednesday after the Senators
voted to recommit the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act to the Senate
Judiciary Committee.  A hearing will be scheduled in committee
in the next nineteen days.
<p>
&quot;As we saw in the historic vote in the House, with members
on both side of the abortion issue voting for the ban, our representatives
acknowledged that there are limits to what can be done to the
unborn. A procedure that pulls a child into the birth canal so
that his or her brain tissue can be sucked out is blatantly unacceptable.&quot;
<p>
&quot;This ban will not affect women whose lives are in danger.
The bill is clear. And the additional time will allow the Senate
to fully consider what is being done to some children moments
before birth.&quot;
<p>
<b>MEDIA ADVISORY: FRC Director of Cultural Studies Robert Knight
will testify 9:30 a.m. Thursday before the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee, SD-342. TOPIC: The Family Privacy Act. The
bill would require the approval of at least one parent before
a minor could respond to surveys or questionnaires from federally
funded programs.</b>

<center><h2>FRC TESTIFIES IN FAVOR OF A<br>
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AMENDMENT</h2>
<p>
<b>HEARING AT 10 A.M. IN SENATE DIRKSEN - ROOM 226</b></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> At a hearing today in the Senate Judiciary
Committee, Family Research Council Director of Legal Studies Cathy
Cleaver said the following in favor of a religious liberty amendment
to the Constitution:
<p>
&quot;The Religious Liberty Amendment could be thought of as the
religious 'neutrality' amendment.  This principle of neutrality
is not new -- it is the aim and result of our First Amendment's
religion clauses properly understood.  A Religious Liberty Amendment
could restore this saving principle, so that our First Amendment
would not be used to promote the empty state religion of secularism,
but to promote true freedom, and the prospect of freedom's fulfillment
in truth, to which every American is entitled.&quot;

<center><h4>** MEDIA ADVISORY **</h4>
<p>
<h2>KINSEY SEX STUDIES ARE TOPIC OF<br>
FOCUS ON THE FAMILY BROADCAST</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday
of this week, &quot;Focus on the Family,&quot; a radio show reaching
over one million listeners with Dr. Dobson and guest Robert Knight,
Family Research Council Director of Cultural Studies, will discuss,
&quot;What happened to children in the sex studies conducted at
the Kinsey Institute on Indiana University's campus in the 1940's?&quot;
<p>
<I>The Children of Table 34, </I>a video that FRC released this
fall after three years of research and production, prompted the
broadcast. This video investigates the circumstances and people
involved in collecting the data that is revealed in Alfred C.
Kinsey's reports in 1948, <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male
</I>and in 1953, <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Female</I>. 
<p>
FRC has repeated attempts to confront the Kinsey Institute with
questions regarding this study.  Recent controversies surrounding
the study include the Institute's claim that the data gathered
for this report originated from one anonymous man. 
<p>
Knight, who wrote and directed FRC's video, said, &quot;Kinsey's
sex studies have been used as the scientific basis to justify
everything from condom distribution in schools to teaching children
how to masturbate. If indeed this influential data was gathered
by one man who molested children ages two months and up, something
must be done by the new Congress to examine this horrific, scientific
experiment and to change the course of sex education as we know
it today.&quot;

<center><h2><i>ROMER V. EVANS</i>: THE IMPACT OF A CLINTON PRESIDENCY?</h2></center>
<p>
<B>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> -- &quot;Today, pro-family Americans saw
a powerful repercussion of the Clinton Presidency,&quot; Family
Research Council attorney Melissa Wells-Petry said Tuesday, following
oral arguments in the homosexual related case <I>Romer v. Evans</I>.
&quot;Justices Ginsberg and Breyer, Clinton appointees,  led the
charge against the people of Colorado in the Supreme Court hearing
on the contentious Amendment 2 case.&quot;
<P>
Wells-Petry filed a &quot;friend-of-the-court&quot; brief on behalf
of Family Research Council and attended the oral arguments. Her
involvement follows on the heels of FRC Director of Communications
Robert Knight who testified at the trial court level on behalf
of the people of Colorado's right to make a democratically agreed
upon statement about homosexuality.
<P>
In the brief before the Supreme Court, Wells-Petry argued that
to throw out Amendment 2 and overthrow the people of Colorado's
decision was to cut off democratic options, such as legal referendum,
and make homosexuality the law of the land. 
<P>
The Clinton administration appointees were clearly aggressive
in their questioning of the   people of Colorado, Wells-Petry
noted. She made the following statement:
<P>
&quot;The Clinton appointees used 80% of the air time during the
one-hour hearing.  They sat in super judgment of the people of
 Colorado, apparently undisturbed at the prospect of substituting
their judgment for that of the over 1,524,000 Colorodans who exercised
their constitutional right to vote on this issue.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Moreover, these two justices in particular seemed completely
unconcerned about the implications, both for the law and society,
of 'discovering' a new fundamental right that obviously was created
to award homosexuals special rights even though homosexuality
does not fall under established legal analyses of classes requiring
special protection.  In fact, in this very case the lower court
held that homosexuals are not a suspect class.&quot;
<P>
&quot;In short, during oral arguments before the high court, little
was said about the bizarre impact this case could have on the
democratic process.&quot;
<P>
&quot;We have seen the future of a Clinton court,&quot; Wells-Petry
said. &quot;This is another wake up call on the implications of
the presidency. How many justices will be nominated by the next
president?  It's time for a national conversation on whether Americans
want the right to vote on the laws of the land, or to allow liberal
judges to overrule democratic decisions.&quot;

<i><font size=6><b>ROMER v. EVANS</font></i><br>
<font size=5>&quot;The Case of the Decade&quot;</font></b>
<p>
<h2>MORAL IMPLICATIONS OF SUPREME COURT<br>
DECISION WOULD RESEMBLE <i>ROE v. WADE</i></h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> -- When the U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments
for <I>Romer v. Evans </I>on October 10, it could be a historical
moment, as sweeping as <I>Roe v. Wade</I>.   Attorney Melissa
Wells-Petry, a former Army major and author of <i>Exclusion: Homosexuals
and The Right To Serve</i>, has submitted a &quot;friend of the
court&quot; brief, and has noted that this decision mirrors <I>Roe
v. Wade</I> in that &quot;it would present the same risk for public
policy disaster by foreclosing political choice.&quot; 
<p>
When the court in Colorado struck down Amendment 2, it said that
homosexuality cannot be the subject of negative public regulation,
even regulation by omission.  
<p>
In her brief, Wells-Petry said that such a decision from the U.S.
Supreme Court would provide homosexuals with &quot;'easy money'
-- a new constitutional right -- with which to buy a result they
did not earn in the marketplace of ideas. This new right allows
homosexuals to circumvent the process of obtaining a consensus
for their ideas in that marketplace of ideas. It allows homosexuals
to insulate their ideas from that market's ebb and flow.  Indeed,
no matter what ideas homosexuals advance, people never can use
the ballot box affirmatively to reject those ideas.&quot; 
<p>
Wells-Petry warned the court that such a &quot;tremendous change
in the functioning of our democracy&quot; would have as severe
an impact on society as did <I>Roe</I>. &quot;The social, political,
and jurisprudential ramifications of the judicial overreaching
of <I>Roe</I> must not be repeated through the creation of a new
fundamental right in <I>Romer,</I>&quot; Wells-Petry stated.
<p>
FRC Director of Cultural Studies Robert H. Knight testified at
the trial in Colorado and said that a gay rights ordinance violates
the free speech clause of the First Amendment of the Constitution.
 The implications of this decision would be felt across society.
FRC  Policy Analyst retired Army Lt. Col. Robert L. Maginnis stated
that this decision would even affect the military and its policy.

<blockquote>
<LI> Campaign-finance reform is back in fashion. Why? Political favors and outright corruption exist in countries with all sorts of political systems and campaign-finance laws, which suggests that financing is not the central problem. As long as big government gives politicians something to sell, some will be willing even eager to buy. The solution is to bring payments into the open. Publicize all contributions and the names and affiliations of all contributors, whether the funds are intended to get out the vote or to rent the Lincoln bedroom. Abolish public funding of campaigns. Limit the Federal Elections Commission to publicizing where the money comes from. Then, Congress can get on with the real reform or making government smaller. With less to sell, there well be fewer buyers and less money in politics.
<P>
<LI> Indeed, it's shaping up to be a February of defeats for conservatives. Republicans are likely to lose the fight over the Balanced Budget Amendment. Populists will certainly lose on term limits. And  pro-lifers (and spending hawks) may well lose an international abortion-funding vote. Defeat, as Rich Lowry points out in <I>NR</I>, Feb. 24., can be habit forming. If Republicans don't rise from their defensive crouch and set an agenda bolder than their current one, they will be unable to block the Democrats' agenda of targeted tax credits and regulation. If they do, they will find that victory can be habit-forming too.

<LI> A new-year welcome to the University of Chicago <I>Criterion</I>. The first issue (November 1996) includes article on campus affairs, book reviews, op-eds, a concert review, and not a single cheap shot or boring page. In its statement of purpose, the <I>Criterion</I> promises to "remain bound by civility and enlivened with good humor." It's off to a good start.
<P>
<LI> The eyes glaze over when politicos talk generalities about Big Government and Washington micro-management. But it is examples which enliven and persuade. Take these: 1) The U.S. National Park Service in December asked the Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Coast Guard to deny Wisconsin and Minnesota the permits needed to build a mile-long four-lane $60-million bridge over the St. Croix river. The Park Service says the bridge would "disrupt the natural flow of the river and destroy the natural scenery." Hundreds of thousands of dollars have already been spent relocating a colony of endangered mussels at the site to overcome a previous federal obstacle. 2)  The Environmental Protection Agency declared its opposition to the construction of a Western Bypass highway in northern Virginia, saying the road is unnecessary. The federal agency can stop the projectdeclared a high priority by the state of Virginia and entirely within Virginiaby withholding gas-tax money and saying that the road will "generate" traffic and worsen air quality. 3) The Federal Highway Administration is preparing formal rulemaking for the <I>Federal Register</I? establishing the types of state roads which must carry center line and edge line markings. Those poor dumb engineers in the state highway administrationsthey just can't be trusted to make sensible judgments about their own roads.

<LI>  John Chafee (R., R.I.),  chairman of the Senate Environment Committee,  has always been a staunch opponent of efforts to deflate scares on global warming, ozone depletion, and so on. But Chafee is starting to upset the greens a bit. Following recent moves by the Environmental Protection Agency to toughen clean-air standards, Chafee has pushed a highly critical congressional letter, accusing the agency of  proposing radical changes in standards without a clear scientific rationale. By shifting the focus from 10-micron dust particles to ones a quarter the size, the agency is admitting that "much of the effort to reduce the health problems . . . may have been focused on the wrong sources." Chafee adds: without "a better understanding of how small particles threaten public health, the proposed standard may similarly result in controls on the wrong sources." The EPA's own Clean Air advisory committee wrote that the agency's new standards could not be shown to be significantly more protective of public health than the old ones. But regulators make their living regulating, so why should they care?

<blockquote>






 <LI>

The Clinton Administration has submitted to Congress an "Environmental Crimes and Enforcement Act" which would allow the Justice Department to freeze the assets of a corporation accused of being a pollutereven before trialas it does with drug dealers, on the bizarre grounds that the property was involved in the crime and is therefore culpable. The burden of proof then rests on the accused to prove that his property was not involved. Of course the law is already very imprecise in its definition of a polluter. Under Superfund, the program aimed at cleaning up toxic-waste sites, property owners are held to be "polluters" if they merely own or are connected with property which is deemed to be "polluted." It is no defense to demonstrate that it wasn't you but a former owner who was responsible; under the doctrine of joint and several responsibility anyone who sent any new material to a "hazardous waste" site is liable for cleanup costs. In Pennsylvania a man served two years in jail for violating the Clean Water Act, even though he was able to prove that the pollution of the stream entered his property from an abandoned coal mine further upstream. Of course with carbon dioxide being called "the ultimate pollution" (because of its role in global warming), everyone who breathes can be presumed guilty.

<LI>Student-loan default rates have plunged to 10.7 per cent, their lowest rate ever, and less than half their 1990 level. As a result the government spent $249 million covering delinquent student loans last year, compared with $1.7 billion four years earlier. Credit Congress. In 1990 lawmakers authorized hardball tactics, including the withholding of income-tax refunds from defaulters, filing lawsuits against delinquent students, and making schools with high default rates ineligible for the federal loan program. Inevitably some deserving students will find it harder to pay tuition. But the crackdown, by shrinking a too-ample safety net, also makes it harder for colleges to raise tuition. Over the long haul, that is the only way to shrink this nut.

His solution: use "heaven-o" instead. The commissioners of Kleberg County unanimously designated "heaven-o" as the county's official greeting, and just wait till they start thinking about raisins.

 <LI>When Democrat Jim McDermott recused himself from the Gingrich case for his part in disseminating the illegal Martin tape, one of the Republicans had to drop off the House Ethics Committee in order to restore equal representation for both parties. We ask you, is that fair? The Republicans should be awarded one free wiretap in return. And, if as reported, the five committee Democrats were given a secret heads-up about the tape before the Republicans were told, they should all recuse themselves, give the Republicans five free felonies and a penalty kick, and disband.

<LI> In much of the media, after the murder of JonBenet Ramsey it became <I>de rigeur</I> to denounce beauty contests for elementary-school girls. What's going on? Frank Rich of the <I>New York Times</I> provides a clue. "Pageantry isn't a subculture," Mr. Rich announced, "it's our culture." By that he didn't mean that 6-year-olds parading around dressed as 20-year-olds is a culture in which Frank Rich feels at ease. Rather, "the children's beauty-pageant biz . . . is a Middle American phenomenon." So the death of JonBenet turns out to be merely another opportunity for bashing the Heartland. It's hard to say what's more distasteful: exploiting little live girls for the pleasure of ogling adults, or exploiting one little dead girl for the pleasure of liberal Heartland-haters.

<P> The media have taken an interest in the possible link between abortion and breast cancernow that someone has published a study debunking it. A Danish survey of over 1.5 million women, which found no connection between induced abortion and future incidence of breast cancer, has been heralded by the press as the definitive conclusion to the longstanding debate. Not so fast, warns Michael Fumento. Denmark's national abortion registry goes back only to 1973, and the risk of cancer increases with age. Thus, notes Fumento, "most of the women born late enough to have had their abortions registered are still too young to be at risk for breast cancer . . . [and] most old enough to be at risk of breast cancer were in their reproductive years before the abortion registry was begun." In other words, Dr. Joel Brind's analysis of 23 different studies, which suggests that abortion increases a woman's risk of developing breast cancer by 30 per cent, is still relevantif not to the press, then at least to pregnant young women.
<P>
<LI>   Mr. Fumento will be appearing as a guest on <I>NR Online</I> editor Chris Weinkopf's Internet radio show (<a href="http://www.grit.com">www.grit.com</a>), live, Thursday 1:15 to 1:45 p.m. EST. The interview will then be available, on demand, as of Friday morning. If you have any questions for Mr. Fumento, please e-mail them to <a href="mailto:chris@grit.com">chris@grit.com</a>.

The National Liberation Front represented a coalition of groups suffering the depredations of U.S.-supported governments in Saigon, we were told, and any support they received from the North was minimal. Well, when the wartime chairman of the NLF, Nguyen Huu Tho, who had become the vice president of Vietnam, died on December 24, the Associated Press's obituary said that Tho "led North Vietnam's political offensive against the U.S.-backed South during the Vietnam War." It also reported, matter-of-factly, that Tho had been chairman of the National Liberation Front, which was "founded in 1960 to help the Communist North overthrow Saigon." Send condolences to Hanoi.

 <LI>The committee appointed to investigate "Gulf War Syndrome" has delivered a report, concluding that it does not know what caused the high incidence of illness among Army personnel who fought in Iraq. There is some evidence that U.S. forces may have been exposed to Iraqi nerve gasa possibility that raises drastic questions about deterrence and retaliation. But another question also arises: It was four years before the Pentagon took this matter seriously, and the aroma of a cover-up, negligence, and bureaucratic muddle is strong. Another syndrome may be recognizable: CYA (Cover Your A). Or DMW (Don't Make Waves). Any military organization depends on loyalty, and if it expects loyalty from the men who fight and may die, it must return their loyalty. The Pentagon has defaulted on this duty.

Although not yet named, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and possibly Slovenia and Rumania are the leading candidates. For the Senate, it means a vote in late 1998 or early 1999 on extending NATO's defense guarantees eastward.

<LI>When the founder and leader of the Peruvian Shining Path terrorist movement, Abimael Guzman, was captured a few years ago, William F. Buckley Jr. argued that it would be foolish to keep Guzmana mass murdererin prison, since he would be bait for hostage-taking by terrorists still at large. Terrorists in Peru have killed an estimated fifty thousand people during the last decadethe equivalent of a half-million people in U.S. terms. Keeping Guzman alive is the modern equivalent of keeping Himmler alive while a Nazi movement was still active in the hills. Now a rival group of murderers, the "Tupac Amaro," has seized hostages and is trying to negotiate for the release of its comrades. A terrorist in jail is an invitation to further terrorism. They should be tried promptly and, if convicted, executed.

<LI>Feminists on the warpath over the alleged sexual abuse of female recruits at the Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland want to use the scandal to advance the agenda of women in combat, much as they used the Navy's Tailhook scandal to achieve the integration of combat vessels. They should be asked to explain how isolated instances of the mistreatment of women in the military can be remedied by the wholesale abuse of women at the hands of enemy soldiers. Meanwhile, Congress should question the wisdom of co-ed basic training. The Reagan Administration ended a Carter-era experiment with co-ed basic training when it became clear that men were not being physically challenged and women were suffering a disproportionate number of injuries. The Marine Corps's way of doing things, where men and women go through basic training separately, appears to be beneficial to women, and Congressional Republicans ought to have the courage to say so. But only a few, including Rep. Bob Livingston, are willing to question sex integration in the military. Should Republicans be allowed to serve in combat?

 a conservative Republican. The only reason I didn't vote for Barry Goldwater was because I was nine years old at the time. I am for medical marijuana because of my politics. But I'm also for it because I've had to use it.
<P>
As a political journalist, I mark the milestones of my life by election cycles. On the eve of Ronald Reagan's election I got married. On the eve of Bill Clinton's I got testicular cancer. The treatment was straightforwardoperation, followed by a rather harsh form of chemotherapy. Any chemotherapy is harsh, because all chemotherapy is poison. You're dumping poison into your bloodstream, killing millions of cells, in order to kill the thousands of malignant cells, which will not recover. Because it is poison, the body wants to get rid of it. That's why chemotherapy causes nausea. To deal with this, I took the latest anti-nausea drugs, including Zofran, and I also did self-hypnosis and mental imaging. These all worked to a point. But beyond that point, I needed extra help, and so I smoked marijuana.
<P>
I had smoked marijuana maybe ten times in college, during the Seventies. I even inhaled. I stopped because I found I didn't like smoke, or being high, or the conversation of pot-heads. I turned to it when I got cancer because marijuana gives healthy people an appetite, and prevents people who are nauseated from throwing up. None of my doctors or nurses at New York University Medical Center, or Memorial Sloan-Kettering, discouraged me from doing this. They had all had patients who had used marijuana to fight nausea, and who had reported good results. I had good results too. Because of the marijuana, my last two courses of chemotherapy were almost nausea-free.
<P>
There was only one problem-I had to become a criminal to do this.
<P>
Cancer patients are not the only people in this bind. AIDS patients who have the wasting syndrome report that marijuana gives them an appetite again. Glaucoma patients find that it arrests the deterioration of their eyes. People with chronic migraines, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis use it to relieve their symptoms. A good summary of all these experiences can be found in <I>Marihuana: The Forbidden Medicine</I>, by Lester Grinspoon MD, and James B. Bakalar. Dr. Grinspoon is a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, and the book is published by Yale University Press, so this is not something downloaded from the Internet. But any sick person who wants to use marijuana to help himself has to break the law. I'm a member of the media elite, who lives in Manhattan, so I wasn't at high risk. But plenty of sick people get arrested, and plenty of them go to jail.
<P>
There are three common arguments against the medical use of marijuana, all of them faulty.
<P>
The first is that THC, the main active ingredient in the drug, is available in a legally prescribable pill form. But the pill has problems. It's expensive. Because it's a pill, and therefore slower acting, people have trouble adjusting the dosage; they often find themselves taking too much. It also seems to cause high levels of anxiety and depression. In my case, I thought treating nausea with a pill was not a bright idea.
<P>
The second argument is that smoked marijuana has never been tested scientifically. This is not entirely true. One test was done at UCLA in 1970 for the Los Angeles Police Department, which wanted to prove that pot smoking dilated the pupils. The researchers found that it contracted the pupils; they also discovered that marijuana relieved pressure within the eyeball. This is why marijuana is useful in treating glaucoma.
But it is true that it is difficult to test marijuana. That is because the government makes it so. The case of Dr. Donald Abrams at San Francisco General Hospital is instructive. Dr. Abrams is an AIDS researcher who wants to test the efficacy of smoked marijuana in treating the wasting syndrome. For more than two years, he tried to get marijuana legally from the National Institute on Drug Abuse for his experimentsto no avail. So doctors cannot prescribe marijuana because it hasn't been tested, but doctors aren't allowed to do any tests. This is a classic Catch-22.
<P>
The third objection is that by legalizing marijuana in one area, we will be setting a bad example to a society engaged in a war on drugs. In fact we will be setting no example at all. The availability of morphine in hospitals is not the reason people smoke crack. A hairless cancer patient with an IV tube in his arm is not a come-on for a pusher.
<P>
The connection between the issue of medical marijuana and the war on drugs runs the other way. The reason we don't allow medical use is because of the spill-over of an extreme war-time psychology. <I>National Review</I> has taken a stand on the war on drugs, but it is not relevant here. If you think the war is wrong, then the ban on medical marijuana is simply one symptom among many of its excess and folly. If you think the war is right, then the ban is an irrelevant and over-zealous off-shoot, like fighting the Kaiser in World War I by changing the German names of Midwestern streets.
<P>
I want to end by addressing my fellow Republicans. My support for medical marijuana is not a contradiction of my principles, but an extension of them. I am for law and order. But crime has to be fought intelligently, and the law disgraces itself when it harasses the sick. I am for traditional virtuesI support the Christian Coalition, and I supported the Moral Majority. But carrying your beliefs to unjust ends is not moral, it is philistine. Most important, I believe in getting government off people's backs. We should include the backs of sick people trying to help themselves.
<P>
My cancer is gone now; I was lucky. God forbid that anyone in this room should ever need chemotherapy. But statistics tell us that many of us will. Let me assure you that, whatever you think now, or however you vote, if that moment comes to you, you will turn to marijuana. Extend that liberty to your fellow citizens.

<font size=+3>I</font> <font size=+1>WOULD</font> have written this review sooner, but my computer broke down. I am not sure why it went dead, but since it did so just after I punched it, I would guess that there was some sort of connection. Why did I punch my computer? To punish it, of course. I had recently gotten on the Internet. After crawling -- not surfing -- along for about an hour and a half in search of some specific item of information, I had come just within reach of what I wanted when a stupid little screen display popped up and declared that Netscape, suffering from sensory overload, had had the cybernetic equivalent of a nervous breakdown. It was then that I punched my laptop.
<P>
In <I>Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet</I>, Sherry Turkle presents us with a somewhat romanticized vision of the evolving interaction between computers and people. She notes that she has named her computer Miss Beautiful -- a sobriquet for her daughter -- and she tells of one of her students who named a computer program that organized her daily schedule after an  ex-boyfriend (``I love to see him do my menial tasks''). To me such personification is totally alien, even if I confess to feeling a little sorry for having acted aggressively against a machine that had served me irreproachably for the past year. Though I refuse to personify my computer, however, I do spatialize it. That is, as I peer into the blue, lacustrine depths of the Windows program, with its delightful frieze of parti-colored icons along the top, I feel as if I were floating in a post-modern swimming pool somewhere on Ischia or Capri. In other words, I feel at home in my computer and I am comfortable and happy there.
<P>
Still, that does not qualify me as a ``computer person,'' and I even take a little pride in not being one. This was one reason I had delayed for some time before subscribing to an Internet service. Another reason was that I failed to see what consequence this technology could possibly have for my life, why I really needed it. What finally convinced me to subscribe was the prospect of sending and receiving e-mail, not to mention a commercial in which Barry Farber seemed to suggest, if I understood him correctly, that I would essentially be able to launch intercontinental ballistic missiles from the intimacy of my bedroom.
<P>
I was soon undeceived. The first thing one notices about the Internet is that it has been vastly overrated. Though you will have heard of the Information Super-Highway, what awaits you is rather a high-tech single-lane dirt road where an excess of traffic has brought transportation almost to a standstill. Though you will also have heard about ``surfing'' the Internet, the gliding swiftness implied by that word will mean little to those who seem rather to limp or stumble than to surf. And to the extent that the surfing analogy has any validity, it is only in the sense that any moment a big wave -- as in more data than your fragile modem can handle -- will overwhelm the whole contraption.
<P>
The second thing one notices is that the Internet is the subtlest thief of time. By making you wait for each parcel of data you want, it steals a minute here and four minutes there until, before you know it, two hours of your life are gone beyond recall. And during this period of waiting, because these deposits of time are so tiny, you are unable to engage in any other activity. Add to this the fact that, once you arrive at the site, you are apt to find a poorly written document whose loopy, time-consuming graphics are as appealing as public-access cable television in all its ranting, unedited profusion. There are many polished web sites, but most of these turn out to be little more than advertisements for providers of commercial goods and services, or they are documents provided by non-profit organizations. The idea that one can surf through the shelves of the public library may one day become a reality, but we are very far from that now.
<P>
The Internet works in two ways. By typing in a web address, you can go directly to a specific site that has information that you know you want. But to surf the Internet is different. This suggests going along for the ride and not quite knowing where you are going. You do this by typing in the name of the subject or person you want to research. A moment later, the search mechanism, in my case Netscape, applies its various inscrutable criteria to come up with the nearest matches to what you seek. Naturally I began by typing in my name to see how many people on the Internet had mentioned -- dare I hope it -- my articles or my book. Here I ran into one of the most common problems with the Internet. The searcher cannot give you the object itself, but only matches of greater or lesser probability and a synopsis of each site. Thus when I entered the name James Gardner, it told me that it had found 86,754 Jameses and 23,456 Gardners and then proceeded to give examples in which the two words occurred in the requisite proximity. Unfortunately my name is not an uncommon one, and so I had to get through several entomologists and chiropractors, two naval engineers and a masseur before finding any reference to myself.
<P>
For some time I continued in this way to putter around on the information dirt road, accomplishing little and gradually coming to understand that the Internet, for all that people have said about it, is a more or less total waste of time and a not inconsiderable waste of money.
<P>
<font size=+3>A</font><font size=+1>ND</font> it was at precisely that moment that something happened which caused me suddenly to appreciate what everyone has been talking about for the last two or three years. What I understood was that the Internet can be viewed as a massive encyclopedia. But whereas all earlier encyclopedias, simply by virtue of their existing as physical objects, were in a sense dead and out of date as a precondition of their very existence, the Internet by contrast is the Encyclopedia of NOW. As it happens I am finishing up a book on fringe groups, a subject which the Internet is uniquely qualified to tackle. I found at my fingertips abundant information about flat-earthers, Andrea Dworkin, snuff films, Queer Nation, the John Birch Society, creationism, and Islamic Jihad.
<P>
Another thing the Internet teaches you is that, no matter how obscure your interests, there are other people out there in cyberspace who are as passionate about them as you are. Though I know very few people whose interest in Latin is as energetic as my own, I soon found that I could correspond in that language with a group of college men in the Netherlands as well as an old professor in Finland and someone else in South Africa. What I find important and emblematic about this fact is that the futuristic Internet can be an agent by which the past is preserved and reinvigorated.
<P>
When I understood that, I confess that I had something of a conversion regarding not only the Internet, but also the great information revolution which is said to be getting under way. As of this moment mankind is entranced by the possibilities of computing. The almost obsessive insistence with which people seem to talk of nothing else, with which the Internet haunts our business pages, publishers' catalogues, and the graphics of advertisers and television producers, suggests that something almost incalculably big is afoot. To some degree this fascination resembles the interest in the atom 50 years ago and in space exploration 25 years ago. But neither of these technologies ever really promised, and surely neither ever produced, a direct and material effect upon our daily lives. With the Internet, by contrast, there is a nervous, giddy sense that, at long last, we are approaching some kind of critical mass. There is a buzz running so loud through all the breadth of human society, an electric excitement so jolting and so unexpected, that one could be excused for thinking that we are on the verge of some great new age. And though books, if we believe the prophets of doom, are soon to vanish from the earth, there is nothing publishers seem to find more attractive or salable than volumes that promote and explain this instrument of their allegedly imminent demise.
<P>
The <I>People</I> magazine approach to the information revolution can be found in <I>Road Warriors</I>, by Daniel Burstein and David Kline. For these two investigative journalists, despite a useful introduction that reveals their deep understanding of what is at stake, the information revolution is essentially a re-enactment of earlier heroic ages of capitalist free-enterprise. But instead of the Fisks and the Goulds, we have shakers and movers ranging from John Malone and Ray Smith to Viacom, Sprint, and the Federal Communications Commission. Nevertheless, the authors are too hard-headed and rationalistic to be taken in by the euphoria of the revolution at hand, or to allow that enthusiasm to affect the tenor of their reportage.
<P>
Far different is <I>The Road Ahead</I>, by Bill Gates, the prophet, if not the Messiah, of the information movement. His book can be read, if one is cynically inclined, as an extended sales pitch for Bill Gates. But Mr. Gates, despite his open and irrepressible enthusiasm for computing, has written a surprisingly candid and useful book. For Gates, the future of computing is the future of mankind, with technology becoming ever cheaper, more powerful, and more pervasive. As he expresses it in his chirping way:
<P>
<blockquote>
I've already said I'm an optimist, and I'm optimistic about the impact of the new technology. It will enhance leisure time and enrich culture by expanding the distribution of information. It will help relieve pressures on urban areas by enabling individuals to work from home or remote-site offices. It will relieve pressure on natural resources because increasing numbers of products will be able to take the form of bits rather than of manufactured goods.</blockquote>
<P>
What makes <I>The Road Ahead</I> so surprisingly useful is that it seems to be a fair, even-handed, and sober appraisal of the situation and very clearly explains complicated ideas to laymen like myself. The author simply lays out one concept after another -- the Internet, the information super-highway, high-definition television, and fiber optics -- with the result that those of us who are not techies finally understand all the terms that have been buzzing around in our heads for the past five years.
<P>
Naturally the information revolution is not without its dissenters. Few are as dourly pessimistic as Mark Slouka in <I>War of the Worlds</I>. This book seems to me to overreach somewhat by buying into the whole virtual-reality racket -- which I predict will remain decidedly ancillary to the information revolution  -- and by supposing that this and other developments will spell the end of reality as we know it. As for the Internet itself, it ``combines the worst of television -- its addictiveness, its passivity -- with the worst of on-line communication -- its self-conscious glorification of superfice [<I>sic</I>], its pop-culture chattiness, its pointless immediacy.''
<P>
Mark Dery's <I>Escape Velocity</I> in one sense goes even further. Dery seems at once to mock and to believe recent ``post-human'' speculations that advocate or predict a literal, physical merging of man and machine into a digitized, dehumanized whole. His book is a highly detailed discussion of cyberculture: that is, those new forms of art, literature, music, and attitude that have arisen at the corners of the information revolution. In his pages we encounter all the technopagans, virtual anarchists, cyber-novelists, performance artists, and cult film-makers for whom the information revolution is a virtual Bohemia joined in cyberspace to an equally virtual, if dystopian, Wild West.
<P>
<font size=+3>T</font><font size=+1>HE</font> fixation on the future that all these books exhibit to a remarkable degree has been a fixture of Western discourse for the last two hundred years: starting with Restif de la Bretonne, and extending through Jules Verne, H. G. Wells, Arthur C. Clarke, and William Gibson. The problem with books that seek, as these do, to discuss the future is that the future really is an undiscovered country from which imaginary travelers come back bearing more outlandish tales than Sir John Mandeville with his one-eyed anthropophagi. And because anyone's guess is as good as anyone else's, there seems to be an overwhelming impulse to exaggerate in the most shameless fashion imaginable, since it is the <I>deformation professionnelle</I> of all writers to want at all costs to have something to say.
<P>
And yet futurologists, even when they are more circumspect in their predictions, always make the same fundamental mistake, whether they view the future as a light-filled, pyramid-powered Eden or as a cybernetic Hell. Indeed, it is precisely the same mistake that many historians make when writing about the remoter past. And this mistake, it seems to me, is to suppose that to change the material circumstances of life is to alter fundamentally the sense of life itself. But life as it is lived is always pretty much the same, with the same protocols of boredom and excitement, the same glare of midday and gloom of eventide, the same petty ambitions, existential doubts, and immortal longings. We can certainly create the circumstances of greater freedom or greater oppression, but the range of possible variation in life itself, in the simple, irreducible sense of being alive, is far narrower than our chattering classes usually appreciate.
<P>
At the same time, it would be foolhardy and unfair to reason from this that change never happens. We have undergone great changes in this century; and though the Internet is still in its earliest infancy, it promises to grow up quickly. From a purely technological perspective, many users of the Internet already have far more efficient modems than I have. And through Moore's Law, which states that every 18 months computers double in power as their prices drop by half, we can expect that we all shall soon be getting better Internet service for less money, which means that fewer users will feel the need to punch their laptops.
<P>
Earlier in my life, as a callow adolescent, I was so disenchanted with the paltriness of industrial civilization -- this was in the late Seventies -- that I almost felt, foolish as it sounds, that I'd like to repeal the modern age entirely. As each day passes, however, I find myself strengthened in the hope that, with the arrival at long last of the information revolution, human society will become more enlightened, more various, more efficient, cleaner, less expensive, freer, and more fun than it has ever been before. One feels privileged to be alive and conscious at this moment in history and can hardly wait to see what humankind will come up with next.

<H2>Mr. Dole's Fate.</H2>
</center> 
<P>
<center>By John O'Sullivan</center>
<P>
<center><I>Mr. O'Sullivan is the editor of</I> National Review.</center>
<P>
<center>
<B><I>This article originally appeared in the London</I> New Statesman, <I>August 9, 1996</I></B></center> 
<P>
If one had to predict the eventual verdict on the Republicans gathering in Convention at San Diego next week, it would be suicide by timidity. The GOPa conservative party in a conservative country at a conservative historical momentis facing a major defeat in November at the hands of the most distrusted President since Richard Nixon. It has reached these straits not by embracing a Pat Buchanan or a radical right agenda but by allowing the party establishment to impose a decent but ideologically flavorless moderate, apparently out-of-touch with both party and country, as its standard-bearer. And it proposes to celebrate this event, fittingly enough, by staging a Convention from which all debate, controversy and indeed politics will have been ruthlessly expunged to make room for short pep-talks, video cartoons, advertising films, and cameo appearances by political celebrities (who are, by definition, not very celebrated).
<P>
The manufactured enthusiasm in the hall, however, will be balanced by the sincere defeatism outside it. Even Republican politicians and pundits sympathetic to the GOP believe that Dole is as good as defeated already. The only question to be decided is whether he will take the Republicans in House and Senate down with him. Some even speculate that the Republican party itself is heading for a post-election crack-up in which economic conservatives ("moderates" in NewClassSpeak) will finally split from the Religious Right. After which, in the approved media version, Buchananite "America Firsters," Perotistas, supply-siders, right-to-lifers, and all the other inmates of the Right Zoo will battle endlessly to succeed the GOP , allowing liberal Democrats to regain their rightful place as the government of the country. Liberaldom, in ruins only last year, will have been restored.
<P>
If this vision seems at all plausible, it is a sour tribute to the extent of the GOP's collapse since 1994. The problem is generally assumed to be Dole the campaigner. Michael Kelly of the New Yorker brilliantly pinned him down as a "nega-candidate" who campaigns in an almost post-modern style, reciting his texts as instructed by consultants but then subverting their message with ironic ad-libs. Of his own campaign slogan, he remarked vaguely (and inaccurately) in one interview: "A Better Plan, a man for a better Americawhatever that slogan is they're working on." But Mr. Kelly points out what others have missed: there is something attractive about this unwillingness to play by the rules of a stage-managed media game. Such an assertion of integrity, subtle but unmistakable, against the cynical tactics of modern campaigning (which Clinton has embraced in the person of super-consultant Dick Morris), might even be the only way Mr. Dole could win in November.
<P>
What is killing him is his carefully-thought-out and well-executed political strategy. He has been following Richard Nixon's advice that the way to win the White House is by veering rightwards in the primaries and centerwards in the general election. This leftright analysis was always better-suited to Europe than America, but it made some sense when Big Labor confronted Big Capital across a fledgling middle class, when most Americans lived either in cities or in rural areas, when lunch-pail issues dominated both people's lives and political debate, and when there were no culture wars or fears of Balkanization because almost everyone agreed on the virtues and opportunities that together constitute the American dream. It has been rendered virtually useless by the growth of suburban America (now home to half the electorate), the rise of the Sunbelt (51 per cent of the electoral college vote), the continuing decline of labor unions (representing only 15 per cent of the workforce), the growing importance of small business, entrepreneurship and highly skilled labor (over 60 per cent of the workforce is now classified as professional or white-collar), the emergence of single-issue politics from feminism to abortion (which has helped drive blue-collar Democrats into the GOP), the demographic transformation of America by immigration from a bi-racial nation to a multi-ethnic one (in which non-Hispanic whites are projected to be a minority by 2051), and the social fragmentation and cultural anxieties these trends have fostered. 
<P>
Where once two great political blocs fought over the small strip of middle ground separating them, today political parties have to assemble a majority anew in each election from among a scattering of regional, ethnic and social groups. Psephologist Patrick Reddy has identified seven such "tribes": Blacks, new minorities (Asians and Hispanics), white liberals, working-class or populist whites, Northern rural voters, suburbanites, and conservatives. The first three groups are in the Democrats' pocket; the last three lean to the GOP; and working-class whites in recent years have been moving sharply to the Right. But all of these groups need to be won over, or at least energized, by the powerful political appeals every four years. 
<P>
So far Bill Clinton has been wooing them far more effectively than the GOP. He shored up his Democratic base among minorities and liberals by portraying Republican cuts in projected Medicare spending (which he was also proposing, though to a lesser extent) as root-and-branch attacks on social entitlements. He simultaneously made inroads into the suburbanite vote by accepting a balanced budgetwittily balanced by spending cuts that would come into effect after the end of his second term. And he appealed to both suburbanites and populist whites by rhetorical and symbolic conservatism such as his call for school uniforms and teenage curfews. Shameless though they are, such tactics would certainly have blunted a GOP attackif one had been launched.
<P>
But Bob Dole, in addition to diving towards a mythical center, has been almost entirely reactive, concentrating on issues like abortion or problems like the "gender gap" where his party is divided or the Republicans are less trusted . To grasp the effect, imagine that John Major had spent 1992 talking about the NHS and never mentioning taxes. 
<P>
In fact, as Clinton's tactics reveal, new demographics mean new issues. Most Americans (about four and a half of Mr. Reddy's seven tribes) are prosperous and believe that government is too big and too intrusive. They don't want to see middle-class entitlements eradicated, but they look at the budget and sense that they will have to be at least pruned. And anyway, with the combination of federal, state and local taxes at 31.5 per cent of GDPlow by international standards but a peacetime high in the U.S.they feel the tax bite of government more. Here, at least, the Republicans have crafted a positive appeal to their constituencies. Dole's promise of a tax cut earlier this week serves as a proxy for all of these issues. The voters may not believe that as President he would actually cut taxes by $600 billion, but they will take his pledge as a sign that he will not raise them, that he may even cut them by some amount, and that therefore he will be forced to rein government back. 
<P>
The pressing political reality of 1996, however, is that for all the talk about "downsizing" and "economic anxiety", it is the issues of moral decline, social disorder and ethnic separatism that people are really worried about. As Michael Barone pointed out in <I>The American Enterprise</I>: "Violent crime is a greater threat to most Americans than short-term unemployment. Divorce is a far greater threat than job loss to the typical person's lifetime project of accumulating wealth . . ." Immigration, racial quotas, and multiculturalism arouse similar fears, and they have the added annoyance that, unlike crime, they are the deliberate effects of government policy. But the language in which people would once have expressed such anxieties has been discredited as "racist" or "nativist" and so they complain about them in the code of "economic anxiety."
<P>
Clinton, who allegedly blames his 1980 gubernatorial defeat on voter anger at the Mariel boatlift of Cuban immigrants, has been quick to sense the importance of these issues. His symbolic conservative gestures, the administration's theatrical "crackdown" on illegal border crossing, and the crime bill, itself largely symbolic, have defused some of them. But his signing of the welfare reform bill was as far as he could go in this direction without enraging his political base among liberals, blacks, and new minorities. Dole's obvious tactic therefore is emphasize those issues where the President simply cannot endorse conservative policies. A random sample might include: restricting the powers of the federal judiciary; extending school choice, via vouchers, to parochial schools; ending race and gender preferences; seriously enforcing laws against illegal immigration but also reducing legal immigration; supporting English as the official language and, more generally, opposing the wen of multiculturalism; and in general defending the concept of an inclusive "American" identity against the second coming of hyphenation. 
<P>
Most of these issues fall into neither of the two approved conservative categories: the "social conservatism" of the religious right and the libertarianism of the economic right. But what might best be called "cultural conservatism" gets support varying from 65 to 80 per cent in opinion polls. It arouses all three of the GOP tribes, plus the swing vote of populist whites, <I>and</I> Black Americans who face competition in the labor market from low-paid immigrants. In particular, it appeals to natural Republicans disaffected from the post-Reagan GOPsecularized Protestants, Northern WASPs, environmentalists, the Planned Parenthood crowd, and above all supporters of the Reform Party. A good example is Ross Perot's challenger, former Governor Dick Lamm, who is the author of tract entitled "The Immigration Time Bomb."
<P>
The GOP has dabbled in these waters with extreme nervousness. What restrains it is mainly that its post-civil-rights leadership is afraid of being seen as "racist" or "nativist" and "on the wrong side of history." This nervousness is rational. <I>The New York Times</I>, which noted in a single detached comment on a Democratic political ad that it was "unusual" for Democrats to use "inflammatory negative images of illegal immigrants," would still be shrieking "Willie Horton" if the GOP had done anything similar. There is also an ideological element in Republican reluctance. Leading Republicans like Jack Kemp and House Leader Dick Armey are uncomfortable with non-economic "hot button" issues like quotas, and intellectually committed to the view that immigration is an unqualified economic benefit. But they are resisting the majority of their party here. And it is a fair bet that, in any post-election struggle but especially one after a Dole defeat, the Republicans will move to add cultural conservatism to the religious and economic varieties. The signs are already there in Republican fund-raising letters which highlight quotas and immigration. 
<P>
But that will be too late for Mr. Dole. If he remains committed to a campaign of blandness and Nixon's advice, he will repeat his recent experience with two issues which have eighty per cent popular backing in virtually every poll but until recently a low political salience: increasing the minimum wage and making English the official language. Dole doubtless believed, following the conventional media wisdom, that the first is centrist, and the second "right," even "extreme." At any rate, hardly anything has been heard from him on official English since the primaries (indeed, he has been visibly edging away from the similar issue of racial and gender quotas). But he did not take long to move to the center to endorse a higher minimum wage once the Democrats had raised the issue. The net effect was to deny himself a popular issue with a powerful appeal both to his natural constituencies and to working-class whites, while helping to concentrate people's attention on the minimum wage where the Democrats enjoy a natural advantage with the public.
<P>
And this on the say-so of the late Richard Nixon. It is hard to believe that the Nixon of 1968, who crafted the new Republican majority with the southern strategy and appeals to law 'n' order, would have followed his own advice so blindly. 
<P>

<h3>Rebirth, Return, Reunion:  Hungary's Euro-Atlantic Agenda</h3>

By <b>His Excellency Arpd Gncz</b><br>
President of the Republic of Hungary<br>
October 26, 1995<br>
<P>
It is a great pleasure and honor for me to be able to brief you, an audience of one of the most prestigious policy think tanks of the United States, on the principal foreign policy endeavors of Hungary. In your full-fledged democracy, the activity of research institutes devoid of the burden of day-to-day politics but dedicated to the thorough analysis of long-term processes and historical causality plays an important role beside the protagonists of politics. When it comes to shaping U.S. foreign policy, people at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue no doubt pay heed to the work of <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a> as well as the opinion of its researchers. I, therefore, address you now not only as researchers and people interested in the subject, but also as persons who have influence, to a lesser or greater extent, on the United States' foreign policy towards the Central European region, including Hungary, and thus on the success of Hungary's foreign policy objectives.
<p>
<b>Rebirth</b>
<p>
For well over 40 years Hungary, similarly to other Central European states, lived torn from the bosom of her natural European environment. In the wake of the imposition of Soviet rule, the Iron Curtain that fell across the center of Europe and along Hungary's western border hermetically isolated Central and Eastern Europe from the western part of the continent. The countries under Soviet rule were forcibly subjected to the inhumane and unnatural experiment of building communism. While east of the Iron Curtain the world witnessed the continuous destruction of human, moral, and material values, the United States and Western Europe registered never-before-seen democratic and economic progress, thus bringing about the cooperation of the community of prosperous democracies.
<p>
The non-viable Soviet regime eventually collapsed under its own weight, due in no small measure to the fact that it was simply unable to keep pace with the rate of development and the arms race dictated by the United States. It is clear today that the staunch anti-communist stance of President Reagan, accused of reviving the Cold War chill, in no way slowed the agony of the communist system; on the contrary, it reduced its duration considerably. In 1989 the zombie states of Central Europe came around from 40 years of inertia and set about building, on the ruins of communism, an open and democratic society working on the principles of a market economy. The undertaking has turned out to be a lot harder than was expected, in either East or West. The countries of the Central European region have had to come to grips with a gamut of difficulties posed by the simultaneous change of the whole political and economic system. This constitutes an unparalleled historical challenge for the region and, I daresay, the whole of the Euro-Atlantic zone as well.
<p>
The complexity of the tasks surfacing with the transformation is well illustrated by the example of Hungary. Democracy and the idea of an economy based on private property and healthy competition came as no novelty to Hungary. Perchance not all of you know that the basic principles of democracy and the thought of freedom had touched Hungary way back in the mid-19th century. Although the war of independence waged against Habsburg absolutism was lost in 1849, its ideals lived on and materialized to a large extent in the wake of the Austro-Hungarian compromise of 1867. Lajos Kossuth, leader and symbol of the Hungarians' freedom fight, is remembered to this very day as the champion of liberty not only in Hungary, but also in the United States, where his bust stands in the Capitol. It is also worth recalling that Hungary, albeit only as part of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, formed an integral part of the economy and culture of Europe at the turn of the century, and her legal system met the requirements of the age.
<p>
All the above-mentioned traditions notwithstanding, the transformation following the events of 1989 has been an extremely painful process, particularly from the point of view of the economy. Nothing characterizes better the enormity of the undertaking than the fact that transforming the structure of the economy has called for exceptional efforts even from Hungary, a country that was the first and only state in the communist bloc to introduce gradual market reforms from 1968 onwards.
<p>
The fundamental institutions of democracy -- a multi-party system, free parliamentary elections, accountable government, independent courts, and the freedom of information -- had all been created by the end of 1990. Adapting to a market economy, however, entailed negative phenomena with repercussions to date, such as galloping inflation and unemployment, the waning of whole branches of industry, and the bankruptcy of state enterprises. Although these phenomena are obviously understandable for an economist, they provoke discontent among the people. The change of structure has, nevertheless, been completed by now, and today the economy is governed by market mechanisms. The private sector now accounts for some 60 percent of production. In 1994 the economy began to register a slight growth. Over 70 percent of Hungary's foreign trade is carried on with industrially developed countries. Besides, the influx of foreign capital into Hungary in the last six years has amounted to some 9 billion U.S. dollars, more than in any other country of the region. I am pleased to see that U.S. companies lead the way in the field of investment in Hungary with an approximately 40 percent share. Such favorable changes, together with strict financial stabilization measures, are creating the bases of long-term development.
<p>
In addition to the radical transformation of home affairs and the economy, Hungarian foreign policy has also undergone change. Hungary has turned towards the West again and is determined to return to the community of Western democracies. With the experience of the past well heeded, this time the overtures towards the West do not imply burning the bridges towards the East. Hungary has a vested interest in maintaining good relations with all the countries of the region. This intention, as well as our effort directed at our Euro-Atlantic integration, enjoys the backing of all the parliamentary parties and public opinion.
<p>

<b>Return</b>
<p>
Hungary thus has irreversibly launched a program to try to catch up with the developed world politically and economically, and hopes to be able to join as soon as possible the Euro-Atlantic integrational organizations, primarily NATO and the European Union. Our integration would not be complete without our membership in the OECD and the defense organization of the European Union, the Western European Union.
<p>
Our Euro-Atlantic integration is a means to an end and a symbol at the same time. It is a means to an end because, we firmly believe, securing lasting stability and prosperity hinges on Hungary becoming a member of NATO and the European Union. Twentieth century history has proved without the shadow of a doubt that the Central European region must not be abandoned or left to wither into a grey zone. Both world wars broke out partly as a direct consequence of expansionist powers regarding Central Europe as spoils of war. We are justified in stating that Hungary and her neighbors, with the exception of some tragic states of the former Yugoslavia, have to face no external threat at the moment; therefore, her Western integration is not a matter of life and death right now. Yet it is precisely the bitter experience of the past that urges both Hungary and her neighbors to preempt even the shaping of potential crises and drop anchor firmly in the community of Western democracies. Integration is a symbol too, as it indicates as clear as daylight that Hungary, a country that holds values and pursues objectives identical with those of the Western democracies, has the right to seek her due place in the Euro-Atlantic community.
<p>
It is in the sphere of the economy that the European Union could best promote the stability of the region and Hungary. On the one hand, it is a well-known fact that economic growth and the resulting prosperity considerably reduce animosity between different countries. On the other hand, the common market system of the Union is what could make Hungary's market, small just by itself, and production capacity really viable. The integration accomplished within the European Union is at the same time the symbol of reconciliation and cooperation in Europe. Although not primarily a defense organization, the Union provides, nonetheless, some form of guarantee against both outside aggression and conflicts between member states. Integration results in a kind of mutual dependence that excludes the possibility of inner hostility while shaping a bloc that, by its mere size, may serve as a deterrent. In the wake of the change of regime, Hungary did not delay in widening and institutionalizing her ties with the European Union, and is by now linked to the organization through an association agreement. Parallel to this, domestic processes have been launched in the fields of economic policy and law harmonization, which are prerequisites of admission to the Union. Hungary made an official announcement of her intention to join in the spring of 1994 and hopes to become a full-fledged member of the Union by the end of the millennium. Allow me to focus from this point forward on NATO above all else, since it is in this organization that your country plays the leading role.
<p>
In the course of the Cold War, NATO proved that it could deter any potential outside aggression and that its members could rely on the organization's "hard" security guarantees. The engine of the alliance's success was the United States, whose brave leaders of vision realized that the security of America and the security of Europe are inseparable, and that it is worth making sacrifices in the interest of common security. Beside the actual military defense and the U.S. nuclear shield, we must not fail to remark the alliance's good influence on relations between the members, in particular on relations between France and Germany.
<p>
Although the Cold War has ended and the Soviet Union has fallen apart, history has not come to an end, as Francis Fukuyama predicted a few years ago. On the contrary, the war in the Balkans and the conflicts raging in the former Soviet republics have shown that new and less predictable dangers encroach on the peace of the Euro-Atlantic region. The circumstances may have changed, and the tasks ahead may be different, yet NATO and an active United States presence in Europe are still needed as much as ever. Hungary, having taken the initiative to dissolve the Warsaw Pact, came to the early recognition that in order to ensure her long-term security she would have to become a member of the Union and join NATO. One cannot emphasize enough that Hungary's hope of becoming a member of the alliance is in no way directed against others. In other words, Hungary would not wish to use her eventual membership to the detriment of her neighbors in the region. On the contrary, it is in our interest that other Central European countries also be able to meet the requirements set for joining and be admitted to the organization, since security can be envisaged only in a wider context. Just to give you an example, the security of Romania and Slovakia, for instance, has a strong bearing on the development and security of Hungary, and vice versa.
<p>
Speaking of Hungary's intention to join the Euro-Atlantic integration, and the future of the Central European region, the question arises:  What interest does NATO, and particularly the United States, have in expanding the organization and, thus, covering the subsequent defense expenditure?  Among the numerous reasons, allow me to mention the most significant ones.
<p>
Guaranteeing human and minority rights and ensuring conditions for a free-market economy and democracy rank among the foreign policy priorities of the United States. In order for these values to prevail without any risks in Central Europe, not only today but in the future, the stability of the region must be increased, for which the expansion of NATO presents itself as the most convenient means. In the course of the Cold War, the world would have been swept to the verge of a catastrophe in the form of another world war had the United States endeavored to insist on the prevalence, even beyond the Iron Curtain, of the values she held dear. Today American values could spread and American interests could be guaranteed without a single gunshot and without any risk of a world war.
<p>
The United States has a vested trade interest in the stability and smooth economic development of the region, seeing that this region is becoming an increasingly significant market for U.S. products and investment. Expanding NATO may constitute a lasting means of securing this market. By the same token, the mere fact of NATO membership may exert a stimulating influence on investors, ever fearful of political risks.
<P>
We are positive that Hungary's NATO membership would benefit the security structure of the organization and, indirectly, the whole region and even the whole continent, in the geopolitical sense, as:
<p><ul>
<li>It would contribute to increasing stability in the Central European region;
<p>
It would ensure NATO an access route to the Balkans, which, despite the peace process currently under way, can be expected to continue as a region of instability in the future; and
<p>
<li>The Hungarian Army would contribute, albeit only to a modest degree, to the many-sided development of the alliance's military strength and even more favorable positions.
<p>
<li>NATO membership is a foreign policy goal based on substantial social consensus in virtually all the countries of the region. The expansion of NATO would, therefore, have a favorable effect on the faith our societies have in Western values, would increase their sense of security, and would prevent the eventual upsurge of frustration, which could well emerge should the extension be prolonged for too long.
</ul><p>


<b>Reunion</b>
<p>
Now that we have reviewed what motivates Hungary to approach NATO and what interest NATO has in extension, it is worth summing up briefly what we have actually done with a view to joining.
<p>
The fact that the Atlantic alliance has recognized the need for eastward extension and has launched the preparatory process for the admission of new members is an encouraging sign for us. We particularly welcome the initiatives in this issue of U.S. politicians, both in the Administration and in Congress. We regard the Partnership for Peace initiative, outlined in the fall of 1993 and launched in 1994, as an integral part of the road leading to membership. Not forgetting her size and possibilities, Hungary for her part endeavors to make the most of the opportunities offered by Partnership for Peace by taking part in the different operations and training programs. I was thrilled to hear that the Hungarian units taking part in Operation Cooperative Nugget, held in Louisiana this summer, stood their ground excellently. The mere fact of a joint operation tells a tale in itself. Just think it over. No more than six years ago, we would have laughed at the idea of the units of a small member state of the Warsaw Pact joining American and other allied troops for a military operation somewhere along the Mississippi.
<p>
Beyond Partnership for Peace, other forms of excellent cooperation now characterize relations between Hungary and NATO and NATO member states. For Hungary it was a great honor that the North Atlantic Assembly, NATO's parliamentary organ, held its May 1995 conference in Budapest, since it was the very first time it had held its session in a non-member state. The fact that NATO intelligence aircraft, the famous AWACS, carry on their activity in Hungarian air space in connection with the crisis in the Balkans provides promising bases for our future institutional cooperation. The joint U.S.-Hungarian military rescue operation held recently in Hungary was also a success. Military and technical compatibility, cited as a precondition for admission, is considerably improved by the Hungarian Army's increasing number of defense arms purchases from American companies.
<p>
We are fully aware that in today's world, security transcends the military aspect and embraces political, economic, social, and even cultural areas. Hungary does her utmost in order to ensure that her own peace and that of the region rest on stable foundations. Joining NATO as soon as possible serves our interest, but only as part of a complex process that aims, in the final analysis, at increasing the stability of the whole Euro-Atlantic region.
<p>
Keeping this objective in mind, Hungary pays particular attention to the most all-around possible strengthening of relations with her neighbors. Hungary looks upon the Hungarian minorities living in the neighboring countries as the cement of bilateral relations and not as a source of conflict. I must emphasize at this point that relations between Hungary and neighboring Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, and Ukraine are virtually problem-free. This spring we were able to sign a basic treaty with Slovakia with a view to accomplishing comprehensive progress in our relations and regulating the situation of the minorities. The agreement has already been ratified by the Hungarian Parliament, and we hope the Slovakian legislature will soon follow suit. We have conducted negotiations with Romania for nearly a year in order to draft a similar document, but unfortunately no breakthrough has yet come during the talks. I wish to stress that signing a basic treaty, while important, is not the sole element of relations between Hungary and Romania. We strive to deepen bilateral relations in all areas regardless of whether there is or is not a basic treaty. What gives us hope for the future is that economic, trade, and military ties are developing well between Hungary and Romania. All the aforesaid goes to show that Hungary has no problem with any of her neighbors that could even remotely hold the threat of a "second Bosnia," as is occasionally alleged by some who oppose the extension of NATO.
<p>
In connection with a more comprehensive interpretation of security, I wish to mention the pivotal role of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The OSCE, among whose members the United States plays an active part, is the only Euro-Atlantic institution with wide-ranging security competence. Hungary, in her role as Chairman- in-Office, has recognized the OSCE's unique opportunities in the field of confidence building, crisis prevention, and management, and strives to make the most of them.
<p>
In 1995, under Hungary's chairmanship, the organization opened a mission in Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, and appointed three ombudsmen responsible for human rights, thus considerably enhancing the activity of the Sarajevo mission. Another mission, soon to be inaugurated in Croatia, is also to serve the comprehensive settlement of the conflict in the Balkans. These missions everywhere spare no effort to reach a peaceful settlement in the conflicts. In Chechnya this led to the signing of an agreement between the warring parties on July 30. If the guns in the Balkans are silenced for good, the OSCE is ready to undertake an increasingly active role in consolidating peace and the process of rehabilitation following the conflict. In the same manner, the OSCE provides an institutional framework for Russia to discuss Euro-Atlantic security issues. This function of the organization is expected to gain more impetus as NATO expansion materializes.
<p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Hungary did not delay in setting off on the road to Euro-Atlantic integration, and she is now doing her utmost, both in the area of preparing the country and in her foreign policy, to become a full-fledged member of NATO and the EU as soon as possible. The fact that Western democracies and integrational organizations have recognized the importance of the chance to open towards the East and are willing to cooperate with the fledgling democracies of Central Europe is a source of encouragement for us. And yet, opinions are voiced over and over again criticizing the too speedy reintegration of Hungary and her neighbors in the region and questioning the justification for NATO extension. Such opinions are fearful of accepting new responsibilities and the consolidation, not to mention the possible defense, of the Central European democracies. Any delay or uncertainty may eventually exact a high price, since there is no excluding the possibility of the situation in these fledging democracies growing critically worse due either to their own internal problems or to any unfavorable developments in the region east of them.
<p>
Our common task and responsibility is, therefore, possibly even greater than it was in 1989, when the picture was rather more simple. All the hard work of recent times may have been in vain unless Hungary and her neighbors in the region are able to drop anchor as soon as possible, and for good, in the safety of the developed democracies' haven. In conclusion, permit me to quote the great statesman, President John F. Kennedy:  "The United States will pay any price, bear any burden in defense of freedom around the world.... "<sup>1</sup> If President Kennedy's message still holds good, bearing a not-too-big burden today, for the same purpose and right on the finishing line, cannot constitute a matter for discussion. The burden must be borne.

<h3>Homer, Shakespeare, and Tolstoy: What Literature Teaches About the Collapse and Recovery of Home and Family</h3>
<p>
By <b>David Patterson</b><br>
Associate Professor of European Literature, Oklahoma State University
<p>
The second <a href="/heritage/kirk/kirklect.html">Russell Kirk Memorial Lecture</a>, October 19, 1995.
<P>
In a Heritage Foundation lecture titled "The Fraud of Multiculturalism," <a href="/heritage/kirk/kirkmem.html">Russell Kirk</a> noted that "cultural restoration, like charity, begins at home."  And he was quite right. For cultural restoration entails the restoration of what is most high, most dear, most enduring. And the ground for all such things is the home. The home is the place where our names are first uttered with love and therefore where we first discover that we mean something. It is the site where both human beings and human values first make their appearance in the world. It is the center from which we define and understand the nature of everything we encounter in the world. The home, then, is not one thing among many in a world of things; nor is it merely the product of a culture. Rather, the world of things derives its sense, and a culture its significance, from their relationship to the home. Without the home, everything else in the world or in a culture is meaningless.
<P>
Just as the home is not one thing among many, the human relationship from which it arises is not one among many. I am speaking, of course, of marriage, or, more properly, of holy matrimony. The sanctity of the home is rooted in the sanctity of marriage. And the holiness of human life is rooted in the holiness of this union through which life is born into the world. Indeed, from ancient times marriage has been a metaphor for the expression of the relation between the human and the holy. In the Christian tradition, for example, the Church is called "the Bride of Christ."  And according to the Jewish tradition, the two tablets given to Moses at Sinai signify a bride and groom, indicating that Israel is betrothed to God as a wife is betrothed to her husband. Marriage alone makes it possible to overcome a fundamental condition of exile and thus dwell in the world. Why?  Because in the union of holy matrimony the seed of the home is planted. That seed comes to life when a wife becomes a mother and a husband becomes a father; it comes into being upon the birth of a child, when the family comes into being. The home, then, might be better understood not as a place or a thing, but as an event in the life of the holy.
<p>
Viewed as such an event, the emergence of the family that constitutes the home is far more than just a biological phenomenon or even a natural wonder. A mother, for example, is not just one who gives birth, but one who emanates light, love, and compassion. Through her humanity receives a revelation of the light created upon the first utterance of Creation, the light that sanctifies all Creation. Indeed, only through the wife and mother of a household does blessing fall upon a home; for as the bearer of life she is most intimately aligned with the miracle and mystery of life. Indeed, she and the Creator of life at times share the same name. In Hebrew, for instance, the Creator is sometimes referred to as <i>Ha-Rachamim</i>, or "the Compassionate One," a term that has the same root as the word <i>rechem</i>, which means "womb." 
<p>
Similarly, the father of a family is more than the sire of some offspring. If he is a father, then he is also a teacher who by his example imparts to his children and his community something about truth, tradition, and moral responsibility -- about what there is to stand for and what we must refuse to stand for. A man, therefore, does not fully grow to manhood until he becomes a father; that is, until he becomes such a teacher and sets such an example, whether he actually sires children or not. That a father bears such a significance is demonstrated by the condition of families and communities that have been abandoned by their fathers.
<p>
Finally, the child born of the holy union of husband and wife signifies the dearness of all life and is a manifestation of holiness itself. If the world endures thanks to a direction we pursue, then it endures thanks to the child. For the child sets before us a direction and therefore a future, in which our most sublime aspirations, our most moving inspirations, and our most urgent questions might be decided. Those who have gazed into the eyes of an infant only seconds old and who have then looked up to behold the world transformed know what it means to realize, if only for a moment, what is infinitely precious. Infinity, you see, comes in small packages.
<p>
This gazing down upon the child is a looking up toward a height that elevates humanity from the realm of biology to the realm of spirituality. Here a survival of the strongest and the fittest is overtaken by a dwelling in the dearest and the highest. Without the home humanity loses this dimension of height that ordains and sanctifies all of being. Without the family we are left to a flat land that is a waste land and wander in an exile steeped in emptiness and indifference. Because the home and family have such a significance for human life, human meaning, and human values, a concern for the collapse and recovery of the home forms a significant part of much of the world's literature. For literature is not just a mirror held up to life. More than that, it is an interaction with life in the light of the truth that sustains life; it is part of the human seeking that takes us forever homeward. 
<p>
In order to illustrate this point, I have selected three literary masterpieces that address these issues in various ways. While they come from very different times and cultures, they represent a human condition that is as common to all humanity as motherhood, fatherhood, and childhood. They are the <i>Odyssey</i> of Homer, William Shakespeare's <i>King Lear</i>, and Leo Tolstoy's novel <i>Anna Karenina</i>. Let us consider, then, the various perspectives on home and family that these texts offer us. In doing so, we may see why these works, like home and family, are among the permanent things.

<p>
<b>An Exile's Movement Homeward: The <i>Odyssey</i> of Homer</b>
<p>
Most of us know the <i>Odyssey</i> as a tale of adventure, in which the hero undergoes various trials on his return to home and family from the Trojan War, a war fought over the break-up of a home. The adventures of Odysseus have a mythical quality that may at first keep his ordeals at a safe distance from us. But if we take a closer look at this tale, we discover its deeper, universal aspect precisely in its mythical features. For in myth, as Joseph Campbell has shown, a shallow mind may perceive only the local scenery, but a deeper mind encounters "all the stages of the Way from the ethnic to the elementary idea, from the local to the universal being, which is Everyman, as he both knows and is afraid to know."  In the case of Odysseus the stages of the Way lead not only from the local to the universal being, but also from exile to home, which is the dwelling place of Everyman, as he learns what there is to fear and what there is fear for.
<p>
Every tribulation that Odysseus must endure, then, entails overcoming a threat to the integrity and the sanctity of home and family. Here we shall consider a few familiar examples to make this point. Recall, for instance, what transpires in the Land of the Lotus Eaters. There, says Odysseus, anyone who ate of the lotus would "forget the way home."  What immediately comes to mind in this connection is the threat that drugs pose for every family in every home. But why, exactly, do drugs pose such a threat? 
<p>
First there are the obvious reasons:  Drugs lead to health problems, the squandering of resources, and a plummeting into irresponsibility. But Homer notes a deeper, more insidious threat to the home that underlies the obvious ones:  It is the loss of memory. In the <i>Republic</i> Plato teaches us that "we must not list the forgetful soul among the lovers of wisdom, but we require a good memory."  A good memory is the memory of the Good, which is the mark of wisdom itself. If the Good first manifests itself in the home, then wisdom entails an understanding of the significance of the home. And since the home is the place where our names are first uttered, the memory of home includes a memory of who and what we are, which is the memory of the responsibility to and for the Good that only we can meet. To be sure, to bear a family name is to bear this memory. Therefore, according to a Jewish legend, when we die and the Angel of Death comes to take us to the Holy One, we must answer a question before we can find our way to God:  What is your name?  For to know the answer to this question is to know the Good that opens up the path to the holy, which is the path that takes us homeward.
<p>
What must be remembered, moreover, as Homer indicates, is not just the home but the way home. The home is not something permanently given but something permanently sought, so that memory here is memory of a direction. And that makes it the memory of meaning. For to have meaning is to have a direction, and to have a direction is to be in motion toward a good that is yet to be fulfilled. Memory, then, orients us not only toward a good established in the past, but also toward a good to be sought in the future. And this good, in the words of Martin Buber, "is the movement in the direction of home," which is sustained by memory. Therefore, drugs threaten that movement homeward because drugs bring on oblivion, and in our world we have made oblivion into a multibillion-dollar business, not only in the drugs we peddle, but in the diversions we promote. Indeed, so dear to us is our deadly sleep that we ignore, ridicule, or even kill people who try to shake us from it.
<p>
In Homer's tale, as in our own time, then, we find that violence follows in the wake of oblivion. For after the Land of the Lotus Eaters Odysseus comes to the Land of the Cyclopians, where, says Homer, there are "no laws" and "no one cares for his neighbor."  There the Cyclops Polyphemos declares to Odysseus,
<p>
<bq>"Stranger, you are a simple fool, or come from far off, when you tell me to avoid the wrath of the gods or fear them. We do not concern ourselves over Zeus of the aegis, nor any of the rest of the blessed gods, since we are far better than they."</bq>
<P>
With these words -- and with the consistency of a logician -- Polyphemos proceeds to devour the companions of Odysseus.
<p>
The one-eyed monster here has a vision of only one thing:  a power that justifies anything -- that is what makes him monstrous. Where power is the only reality, there is no law other than the law dictated by the one in power. The monster does not act for his neighbor but manipulates his neighbor, even to the point of consuming him. And he has no regard for God because he sets himself up in the place of God, thereby regarding himself as better than God and in need of no one. Hence, he has no home that he might open to others but seals himself up in a tomb-like cave, like an animal holed up in his lair, without wife or children.
<p>
Violence toward others does violence to the home because violence is an assault on the Holy One who sanctifies the home in the sanctification of the family through holy matrimony. And because humanity comes into being with the appearance of the family, violence aimed at God is perpetrated upon humanity. "He who kills, kills God," Elie Wiesel has repeatedly said; the Eternal is eternally the victim. By contrast, those who would nurture life rather than take life enter into marriage and form a family by bringing life into the world. This nurturing of life entails not only bearing children, but also affirming the sanctity of the other human being, beginning with our husband or wife. Matrimony derives its holiness from this saying of you to another person in such a way that we attest to the holiness of the other that derives from the Holy One Himself. This relation that lies at the heart of the family makes all other relations meaningful. For this is the relation that opens up a higher truth that is opposed to power. As we see in the case of the Cyclops, without this truth that is revealed in the home there is no law or care for our neighbor. And so it is no coincidence that those who do violence to others generally come from broken homes. When homes break up bodies get broken.
<P>
The oblivion that leads to violence against others also takes the insidious form of a subtle violence done to oneself, as well as to others, in the mode of sensuality. Here, as in the case of violence, getting physical means being reduced to a purely physical, animalistic nature, as Homer's <i>Odyssey</i> suggests. After escaping from the Cyclops, Odysseus makes his way to the island where the sorceress Circe lives. There his men are tempted by the voluptuous beauty of the sorceress, who gives them fine foods poisoned with a drug "to make them wholly forget their native land," as Homer says. And she then turns them into pigs. But they had already forgotten their native land as soon as they acted on the sensual, and they had already lost their human image as soon as they succumbed to their animalistic nature. When animal instinct overtakes moral responsibility, the human form becomes the form of a pig, and the home is reduced to a sty.
<p>
In contrast to this succumbing to temptation we have the refusal to succumb on the part of Odysseus when he was marooned on the island of Calypso. There he tells the goddess,
"I know that...Penelope can never match the impression you make for beauty and stature. She is mortal after all, and you are immortal and ageless. But even so, what I want and all my days I pine for is to go back to my house and see my day of homecoming."
<p>
Like Circe, Calypso possesses all that sensual beauty can offer. But the home is constituted by the spiritual, and not by the sensual. And the difference lies in the caress. In the groping and grabbing of sensuality, we manipulate and appropriate the other for ourselves, for our own pleasure. The caress, however, is an opening and offering of the self to another, whether it is between husband and wife or parent and child. It is an instance of a contact not between skin and skin but between soul and soul -- that is what makes it spiritual rather than sensual. The caress, therefore, seeks what cannot be touched. It seeks what lies at the heart of the home, and it reveals what lives in the heart of the family. For without the loving caress, neither home nor family can come into being.
<p>
Thus the <i>Odyssey</i> culminates in a husband's caress of his wife, and it ends with his embrace of his father. His return to his family includes a return both to the one with whom he brings life into the world and to one who lies at the origin of his life. Returned to both, Odysseus returns to a responsibility for life, which means:  He returns to the family.
<P>
The threat to the family, however, comes not only from without, as in the tale of Odysseus, but also from within. This brings us to the next work we shall consider.
<P>

<b>The Undermining of a Family: Shakespeare's <i>King Lear</i></b>
<p>
<i>King Lear</i> is a drama about the premature collapse and failed recovery of a monarch's household. While Homer's epic generally unfolds in the external geography of adventure, Shakespeare's play focuses more on the internal struggle of a soul trying to regain a native ground that has crumbled out from under him. But what exactly threatens the home and family of the King and, indeed, brings them to ruin?
<p>
The home and family in this drama come to ruin as the result of a fundamental confusion about nature and natural law, where natural law may be understood much as Thomas Aquinas understands it. Natural law, he explains in the <i>Summa Theologiae</i>, is "the participation in eternal law by rational creatures," and eternal law is defined as "the rational governance of everything on the part of God."  The idea here is that God operates by design and that, since they bear the image of divine being, human beings have a responsibility to become part of that design. The rational governance of Providence implies an ordering of the world with the aim of pursuing the Good, that is, with the aim of attesting to what is most precious in life. Natural law, therefore, establishes a bond between the human being and divine being; it summons humanity to take up a path that would nurture and sanctify life, as God sanctifies life when He pronounces it to be "very good."  Inasmuch as the relation between the holy and the human finds its first expression in the home and family, the life that unfolds in this realm bears witness to a natural law expressive of a sacred aim in life.
<p>
King Lear's confusion, then, is a fundamental confusion about the life that unfolds in the home, and it is revealed in his relation to the surviving members of his family, his daughters Regan, Goneril, and Cordelia. In the play's opening scene Lear does not offer his daughters a loving embrace expressive of a higher relation, according to the family bond determined by natural law. Instead, he arranges a business transaction, whereby he tries to purchase their words of affection by offering them portions of his wealth. Two of his daughters, Regan and Goneril, are eager to exploit this confusion that undermines the family:  They exchange the testimony to life as determined by natural law for lifeless property. And so the seeds of death are sown.
<p>
The bond of love that is established by natural law to sustain the family, on the other hand, is precisely what Cordelia invokes when she declares to her father,
<p>
"I love your majesty<br>
According to my bond, no more nor less." (I.i)
<p>
It is not that Cordelia knows her place, but rather that she knows what is placed on high. Inclined toward a higher responsibility, she obeys the commandment of natural law, and not the whim of the King. But Lear insists upon the false authority of his own whims:  Rejecting Cordelia's simple affirmation of her bond, he refuses what natural law commands. Refusing the commandment of natural law, he loses his relation to the eternal law that sustains the home and sanctifies the family. And so he is left homeless, turned over to the merciless power of the elements as exemplified by the storms in the fields. There he has no dwelling place, for there he is exiled from the truth of natural law.
<p>
Usurping the authority of natural law, Lear loses his identity both as the king of a realm and as the father of a family. Here we realize that the task with which natural law confronts us is not simply to follow some rule, but to be who we are. And who we are is defined by the eternal truth that sanctifies the family. Thus, as soon as Lear violates his family by casting out Cordelia, his daughter Regan notes that "he hath ever but slenderly known himself" (I.i). For he knows himself only by the power of manipulation, and not by the truth of family relation. Once he becomes powerless in the face of his daughters' deception, Lear himself cries out, "Who is it that can tell me who I am?"  (I.iv). He does not know himself because he does not know himself as a father, and he is a father before he is a king. To know himself as a father would be to know the natural law that binds him to his daughters in truth, and not through power.
<p>
Therefore, as we recall, Cordelia alone speaks the truth, for she alone knows the bond of nature that ties her to her father and, through her father, to a higher truth. Hence, it is she, says Shakespeare,
<p>
"Who redeems nature from the general curse<br>
Which twain have brought her to." (IV. vi)
<p>
Cordelia works this redemption by restoring to Lear the relation between father and child -- and with it the higher relation -- that her sisters have undone. But this undoing was also Lear's doing. Like most of those who exchange the truth of natural law for the power of human arrogance, he reaps what he has sown. The man who had understood himself only in terms of the power he could wield is overpowered and eventually crushed by the two daughters who would wrench power away from him. 
<p>
The corruption of nature and the destruction of the family exemplified by Regan and Goneril manifests itself not only in their treatment of their father, but also in the violence that they bring down upon Gloucester by blinding him. The central figure in the play's subplot, he is a father who is betrayed by his child Edmond and who mistakenly suspects his son Edgar of betrayal. Like Regan and Goneril, it is the bastard son Edmond who is the "unnatural villain" (I.ii), as Gloucester states it, and whose villainy includes the betrayal not only of his father, but also of Cornwall and Albany, the husbands of Regan and Goneril, respectively. For part of his power play involves making promises to take up with each of these wives who are Lear's daughters. And, having betrayed their father, they are all too willing to betray their husbands and chase after Edmond.
<P>
Thus, the violation of the relation between parent and child entails the violation of the relation between husband and wife:  The family is assaulted at every turn by those who would be a law unto themselves in a usurpation of natural law. And so when Albany suspects his wife's treachery, he says to her, 
<p>
"O Goneril,<br>
You are not worth the dust which the rude wind<br>
Blows in your face. I fear your disposition:<br>
That nature which contemns its origin<br>
Cannot be bordered certain in itself."  (IV. ii)
<p>
That nature which contemns its origin -- the child who dishonors her father -- is a perverted nature that despises the family. Despising this origin of humanity, such a nature has nothing to limit its contempt for humanity. Goneril, then, divorces herself from all the limitations of natural law, which, as we have seen, is our link to the eternal law that sanctifies the family and all of humanity. Thus divorced from the family, Goneril is cut off from the origin of all that is holy in human life and ends by murdering her two sisters. And the murder of Cordelia, of course, results in the death of her father Lear.
<p>
Set in a time that came long before Shakespeare's time, this play continues to speak to us in our own time. As a commentary on our own humanity, it sheds light on the ways in which we, too, stand by and tolerate the assault on the family. It tells us, for example, something about the sickness of a society that hides away its parents to die in "homes" that are the antithesis of a home and that leaves the care of its children to people who are not their parents. It reveals to us a connection between murder and adultery, between the hand that steals, the mouth that lies, and the eye that covets. For all of these things belong to a nature that contemns its origin and therefore has nothing but contempt for the family. All of them result from the undermining of the natural law that lies at the center of the home and that links the life of the family to the life of the eternal. 
<p>
In these last five transgressions I have mentioned you will recognize the second five of the Ten Commandments. Here we may recall an ancient Jewish teaching, according to which the Ten Commandments were written on two tablets in order to designate two realms of relation. The first five commandments pertain to the relation of <i>adam la Makom</i>, or the human relation to the divine, and the second five pertain to the relation of <i>adam l'adam</i>, or the human relation to other human beings. What is of interest to the concern at hand is this:  The commandment to honor mother and father belongs to the first category. Which means:  The integrity of the family belongs to the integrity of the divine. Holding to the sanctity of the family, therefore, is prior to the sanctification of all other realms of human relation. Once Lear's daughters violate the family and destroy the home, there is no crime that they cannot commit. And justify.
<p>
Thus, the truth that comes to us through <i>King Lear</i> arises in an antiquity that long precedes it and lives in a modernity that far exceeds it. Truly among the permanent things, this truth finds another expression in a literary masterpiece that appears nearly three centuries after Shakespeare's play. Which brings us to the third work to be considered.

<p>
<b>Families Lost and Found: Leo Tolstoy's <i>Anna Karenina</i></b>
<p>
Tolstoy's masterful novel <i>Anna Karenina</i> has found its way into the popular culture through various film versions, including one starring Christopher Reeve that was made for television. Generally speaking, the popular view of the novel that has resulted from these films is that it is the tale of an exciting but tragic love affair between a frustrated housewife and a dashing young aristocrat. Like many popular conceptions, however, this is a misconception. Tolstoy's aim in his portrayal of the adulterous love affair is to expose the moral corruption that leads to the dissolution of the family. And he makes this point by contrasting Anna's love affair with Levin's marriage.
<p>
A key to the contrast that Tolstoy sets up is the figure of the child; indeed, as we have noted, it is with the appearance of a child that a family comes into being. Should anyone suppose that Anna's affair with Vronsky is exciting and wonderful, we have only to recall Tolstoy's account of how this indulgence devastates her son Seryozha. He is described as "the compass which showed [his mother and her lover] the degree of their divergence from what they knew was right, but did not want to see."  It is not as a judge, however, that Seryozha reveals to them their divergence from what is right. Rather, it is as a victim. Because he is a child, he represents a precious but fragile possibility for life; because he is a child, he embodies the meaning and direction that open up a future in which some redemption from a life void of meaning may be sought. Hence, the child is the core of home and family. And the child is just the one who is betrayed in Anna's illicit love affair.
<p>
"I love two beings only," says Anna of Seryozha and her lover Vronsky, "but the one excludes the other."  And we know which one she chooses. After she has left her family, one of Seryozha's "favorite occupations," says Tolstoy, "was keeping a lookout for his mother during his walks."  But she is almost never to be seen. Once she has a child by Vronsky, in fact, we are told that "the separation from her son...did not trouble her," since she had grown so attached to the daughter she had by Vronsky "that she rarely thought of her son."  And yet the declaration of her love for "two beings only" was made long after the birth of her daughter. This attachment too, therefore, is soon eclipsed by her preoccupation with Vronsky's love for her and with a personal happiness that is forever longed for but never realized. 
<p>
Why is it never realized?  Because in truth Anna loves no being other than the counterfeit being she has fashioned by making herself her own heroine in a romance whose outcome is determined from the start. Living with her lover in a house that is not a home and in an arrangement that is inimical to marriage, she exchanges a family life for the illusion of a love life. To her, happiness is my happiness, and not the happiness of her family. Thus, becoming a sign only of herself, and not of the significance of the other human being, Anna is drained of all significance. Like Narcissus at the pool, she gazes into the mirror of her self-styled fairy tale until, as Tolstoy says, she no longer recognizes herself. For she has lost the image of wife and mother that would be the basis of such recognition. The only action that remains for her to establish some significance in life is to take her own life. This she does without a thought for the children who would be orphaned by her action.
<p>
What is missing from Anna's love for Vronsky is precisely the love that forms the basis of the family, which is a love for the other person expressive of a higher relation. It is the love for the holy, as it is evinced by the love between husband and wife, the love that puts the holy into holy matrimony. Only when marriage rests on such a foundation can a family come into being. In <i>Anna Karenina</i> Tolstoy illustrates this point through the tale of Levin, which is the tale of a movement into life that runs counter to the story of the title character.
<p>
Modeled after the author himself, Levin is a man who is engaged in a constant struggle for meaning in life. And it is through the pursuit of family life that meaning in life finally opens up to him. In contrast to Anna, who sets up a household with a man to whom she is not married, Levin enters into marriage with Kitty under the auspices of the Church. Despite his religious skepticism at the time, he embraces the prayers said at his wedding. When, for example, he hears the words "Give unto them perfect love, peace and help, O Lord," he is struck by them, thinking, "How did they know that it is help, yes, help, that one needs?"  And when he hears the priest say, "Who unitest them that were separated and who hast ordained for them an insoluble union in love," he realizes, "How profound those words are and how they fit with what one feels at this moment!"  Thus, he sees that the words addressed to One who is above consecrate the marriage between two here below.
<p>
Levin continues to engage in a struggle for life's meaning in the face of death even after he is married. But, "thanks to his wife's presence," says Tolstoy, this struggle "did not drive him to despair:  in spite of death he felt the need for living and loving."  For his wife's presence signifies the presence of the sacred in his life, as it was invoked on the occasion of his marriage. Unlike Anna, who sought to be loved by Vronsky outside of marriage, Levin seeks to offer his love to the wife he has taken in holy matrimony, and that is what sustains him in life. Knowing his wife, he comes to know something of life's origin; moving toward life's origin, he moves toward a meaning in life that is stronger than death.
<p>
Through this love that links him to the origin of life, he joins with his wife to bear life into the world. Here too, of course, the figure of the child is crucial to the condition of the home and family. Contrary to Anna's disregard for her children, Levin sees in the birth of his child a revelation of something beyond the human. And so we read, "The birth of a son, which they promised him, but which he still could not believe in -- so extraordinary did it seem -- appeared to him on the one hand such an immense and therefore impossible happiness, and on the other hand such a mysterious event that the assumed knowledge of what was going to happen and, as a result of it, preparations as for something ordinary, something human beings themselves were responsible for, seemed scandalous and degrading to him."  Thus, upon the birth of his child -- if only for a moment -- his skepticism gives way to a deeper vision, to a higher vision, and a prayer comes to his lips in spite of himself, as though the prayer had a life of its own. All his doubts, says Tolstoy, "fell away, like dust, from his soul. To whom else was he to appeal, if not to Him in whose hands he felt himself, his soul, and his love to be?"  The vessel of this revelation?  A newborn babe.
<p>
This vision of a mystery that transcends the handiwork of humanity is precisely a vision of the family. The vision unfolds as the family emerges in a place where there had been two but there are now three. And it is the vision of the family that makes it possible for Levin to receive the meaning in life that he has sought all along, a meaning that is as essential to the soul as bread is to the body. Near the end of the novel he meets a peasant who offers him the key to what he had struggled for, expressed in deceptively simple terms:  Live for God, and not for yourself. At first these words seem so simple to Levin as to be meaningless. But then he thinks to himself, "Well?  Did I not understand those meaningless words?"  And he answers himself, "No, I understood them just as he understands them:  I understood them perfectly and better than I understand anything in life, and I have never in my life doubted it or could doubt it." 
<p>
And yet he does not fully grasp the truth of the peasant's words until he sees his wife and son nearly killed by a bolt of lightning. Seeing their lives threatened, he sees what his own life is for. What does it mean to live for God and not for yourself?  It means living for your family and thereby creating a home through which the holy may enter life and instill it with meaning. As God breathed life into the first human being, the family breathes life into all humanity. Only where such a breath is drawn can dwelling happen. And only where dwelling happens do we approach a realm called home.
<p>

<b>Concluding Thoughts</b>
<p>
While the literary masterpieces we have considered are varied in their approach to home and family, they do have a few things in common. In all three cases, for example, the assault on home and family entails a violation of holy matrimony. Recall, for example, the suitors who invade the home of Odysseus, Edmond's designs on Regan and Goneril, and Anna Karenina's love affair. And we find that when the holiness of marriage is threatened, the holiness of human life is compromised:  The suitors plot to kill Telemachus, Goneril plans the murder of Cordelia, and Anna ends by killing herself.
<p>
In all three cases, moreover, the issue of a wife's fidelity is directly tied to the presence of the mother. Because Penelope remains faithful to Odysseus, she remains a mother to Telemachus; therefore, it is thanks to her that Odysseus has a home and family to return to. Anna Karenina cannot take up with Vronsky without abandoning her child Seryozha; in contrast to her betrayal we have Kitty's faithfulness to Levin, which ultimately makes it possible for Levin to realize what is most dear in life. And in Shakespeare's play the mother is absent altogether because the devotion of a wife to a husband is altogether absent; there the absence of the mother is symbolically manifested in Lear's alienation from the earth itself when he is turned over to the chaos of the stark elements.
<p>
Similarly, all three works address the role of the father as a teacher and a witness. Odysseus is able to restore the integrity of his home, which includes a return to his own father, because he has attested to the higher relation that home and family signify. When, as in the case of Lear, that testimony is absent, the home and family collapse; Lear's tragedy is that by the time he realizes who he is as a father, the consequences of his absence as a father are already in place. And in Tolstoy's novel we find that only when Levin becomes a father does there open up for him an avenue to the Most High enabling him to recognize his responsibility for what is most sacred here below.
<p>
All three of these masterpieces also bear witness to the importance of the child to the sanctity of home and family and to the meaning of life itself. Before he relates the trials of Odysseus, for example, Homer establishes the position of Telemachus as the son of Odysseus and as the heir to his wisdom. If Penelope makes it possible for Odysseus to return to a home established in the past, Telemachus receives a legacy that posits a future necessary to the family. In the case of Lear, the presence or absence of the child parallels the presence or absence of his own identity. Lear is who he is -- and therefore might become more than he is -- only through his relation to Cordelia. In <i>Anna Karenina</i>, we recall, Anna's child reveals to her a moral path that she is summoned to follow, and Levin's child shows him the way to salvation. Indeed, in all three of these works the child bears a salvific significance.
<P>
What does all of this tell us about our own condition and the salvation that we are all in need of?  In a word, it tells us that if we are not mothers, nothing has value; if we are not fathers, we ourselves are nothing; and if we have no children, everything is meaningless. And yet, as never before, the mother, father, and child are under massive assault in our society. As in the literary works we have considered, that assault begins with an assault on holy matrimony, which is an assault on the holy itself. Divorce rates, for instance, are staggering, and they are higher among people who live together before they get married than among those who do not. Why?  Because those who live together out of wedlock have no regard for the sanctity of marriage. 
<p>
Premarital and extramarital sex, moreover, is not only tolerated -- it is romanticized and is therefore encouraged. Sex, I have been told, is a way of "getting to know someone."  No longer, then, is the sexual relation understood to be an expression of a higher relation, whereby a husband and wife join with the Creator to bring life into the world. Indeed, the last thing that most people want when they engage in sex is to become a mother or a father. Therefore, the question raised in the sexual relation is not "How do I express my devotion to God through this relation to another human being?"  but rather "Am I protected?"  And yet the more we are concerned with this protection, the more we plunge into ruin.
<p>
Because the sexual relation is central to bearing life into the world, our views on sex are directly tied to the value we place on human life. And as sex becomes more casual, motherhood and fatherhood become more corrupt. Instead of viewing motherhood as a blessing, we view abortion as a right. Women who have babies and decide to be mothers by staying home with their children are taken to be either deprived or deficient and are made to feel that they have to apologize for some transgression. As for fathers, they are held to no standards at all. Many abandon their families altogether, and when fathers are absent communities collapse into a combination of lotus eaters and Cyclopians -- those among whom the life of the other human being means nothing.
<p>
I am not speaking only of city neighborhoods where most households are headed by single mothers. No, the entire land has taken on the aspect of the Land of the Lotus Eaters. There is no evidence more convincing or more terrible to support this than the fact that the most common form of death among children between 15 and 19 years of age is the death related to drugs and alcohol. This has come to be the case not because our children have failed to learn what we teach them, but because they have learned all too well and have followed our teachings to their logical conclusions. These are the teachings that regard the family as a social unit, and not as a center of life's sanctity; that regard the ego as the center of the universe, and not as the seat of responsibility to and for the other human being; and that take morality to be a cultural curiosity, and not a means of expressing our relation to the God who summons us to be moral.
<p>
As in the case of Odysseus, violence follows in the wake of the lotus. And, of course, violence in the streets finds its way into the home. It goes by the scandalous name of "domestic violence."  Domestic violence is not the cause of the breakdown of the family; it is the result of that breakdown. For domestic violence is the outcome of a loss of the sacred in life, and the family is the primary ground for the manifestation of what is sacred. A man who understands his relation to his wife to be an expression of a relation to the Most High is far less likely to beat her than a man who has no such understanding. A father who sees that his children are a blessing from God and the basis of all there is to hold dear is far less likely to abuse them than one who has no such insight.
<P>
But we shall remain blind to this understanding and insight as long as we send women into wars, give the nod to abortions on demand, grant divorces without grounds, romanticize adultery, and accord so-called homosexual marriage the same status as a marriage that can bring children into the world. Much more than the signs of changing times, these are the signs of the loss of meaning; much more than the manifestation of cultural evolution, they are a manifestation of cultural collapse. As Abraham Joshua Heschel once said, "We have bartered holiness for convenience, loyalty for success, wisdom for information, prayers for sermons, tradition for fashion."  Which amounts to saying:  We have traded the home for the void and the family for the abyss.
<p>
Cultural restoration not only begins at home, as Russell Kirk has pointed out; it begins with the restoration of the home and of the family that constitutes the home. If home and family are indeed among the permanent things, as the literature we have discussed indicates, they require a permanent vigilance. For the permanent things are the most precious things. And nothing is more fragile than what is most precious.

<h3>The Mystic Chords of Memory: Reclaiming American History</h3>
<b>By Wilfred M. McClay</b>
<p>
<a href="/heritage/kirk/kirklect.html">The Russell Kirk Memorial Lectures</a>, Delivered December 
13, 1995
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I am delighted to be with you this afternoon and to have a role in the Heritage Foundation's worthy 
project of commemorating Russell Kirk's many contributions to American intellectual life. My own 
task today is to explore the subject of historical consciousness in America -- a subject about which, 
strange to say, Russell Kirk actually did not write a great deal, at least not addressing the subject 
directly. But he didn't need to. His entire life and work were nothing less than an extended 
elaboration of that very theme. Historical consciousness seemed to have been infused into the air he 
breathed and mixed into the soil of the ancestral land in which he chose to live. No place or thing, 
however ordinary, was too humble for him to grant it the dignity of a story. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One notices this historical tendency even in Kirk's language. It has a most peculiar lilt, which often 
charms and sometimes startles the reader with its unexpectedly fanciful and antique echoes. (As an 
example of the latter, I remember being shocked when I read Kirk describe a leading social critic as 
an exemplar of "defecated intellect" -- shocked, that is, until I looked the word up, and saw that 
Kirk used the word in an older and more etymologically informed sense than my own, strictly 
scatological understanding.) What struck many readers as mannered or affected diction in Kirk was 
actually something quite different. It was evidence of his strong conviction that words, like people, 
are living things, bearing living pasts deserving of recognition and respect. That was typical of him. 
He had the ability to make even the dullest things gleam with the luster of historical imagination. 
With all due respect to Governor John Engler, who inaugurated this series of lectures, who would 
have thought that Michigan could ever be made a name to conjure with?  Yet Kirk made his many 
readers curious to see his beloved "stump country" and to explore the tiny burg of Mecosta. 
Although his Gothic and Romantic tastes drew him to old European cathedrals, Roman ruins, and 
other such haunted sites, he was not prone to sigh, in the perennial complaint of American writers 
such as Hawthorne and Henry James, that America was too new or raw or commerce-minded to be 
the stuff of art. On the contrary, Kirk knew how to see monuments, and ruins, everywhere he 
looked. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;What others called "junk" Kirk thought of as "cultural debris," which is a short way of saying that 
Kirk took a long view of the disorders of our contemporary American world, seeing them in light of 
the thousand follies and disorders that have come before us in the human procession. Historical 
consciousness gave him a broad, capacious vision, which always insisted that the civilization we 
enjoy has deep living roots. Those roots of American order extend back in time not only to 18th-
century Philadelphia, but further back, to London, Rome, Athens, and Jerusalem. Virtually 
everything he wrote testified to his intense awareness of the immanence, inescapability, and 
indispensability of the past, and not only the past of the previous generation or two, but the distant 
past -- the past of the Law and the Prophets, of Solon, Cicero, Augustine, the English constitution, 
Montesquieu, Burke, Lincoln. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Kirk's career, then, went against the American grain, and it did so in two different ways. In the first 
place, he was an intellectual genuinely at ease in America. He may have fancied himself a 
Bohemian Tory, but he was never that most tiresome of bores, "the alienated American 
intellectual," a restless species that grazes in herds of independent minds. He knew he was fortunate 
to live in a country free and prosperous enough to permit him a career as an independent writer, and 
he never forgot that fact. But at the same time, he was never an uncritical celebrant of American 
culture. He loved his country, but he did not idolize it. Instead, he held it accountable to a 
transcendent standard, against which he often found it seriously wanting. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In particular, Kirk lamented the deification of progress, the cult of absolute equality, the advance of 
the Leviathan state, the licentiousness of the autonomous self, the transvaluation of values, and 
other such modern abstractions that have transformed and eroded the American republic. While he 
vehemently opposed ideology in all its forms, including conservative ideology, he at the same time 
lamented Americans' fixation upon short-term, practical, problem-solving, results-oriented, and 
utility-maximizing thinking in place of a deeper reflection upon the proper ends of things. Kirk, 
then, was trying to do something characteristic of traditionalist conservatives: fight on two fronts at 
once. He was defending the American way of life against its cultured despisers -- while at the same 
time challenging many elements of that way of life by holding it up to its classical and Judeo-
Christian antecedents. He comforted the afflicted and afflicted the comfortable -- and sometimes 
they were the same people. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Kirk was not the only one to act this way. Many American conservatives feel caught in a similar 
bind. Most of them are dyed-in-the-wool patriots, and yet they wonder whether the very America 
they so ardently defend is only too willing to sell its birthright for a mess of pottage -- or, for the 
more ideologically inclined, a pot of message. Even here at Heritage, which is a very busy, worldly 
place, teeming with clever people and clever ideas addressing themselves to the immediate concrete 
policy questions and debates of the day, one is likely to encounter that very American question: Of 
what use is historical consciousness? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The dangers inherent in this characteristically American attitude are wonderfully illuminated by a 
joke I heard the other day, which with your indulgence I will retell -- not only because it bears 
directly upon the point, but because storytelling seems a very Kirkean way to get at a Kirkean truth. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The tale begins with a tourist, wandering through the back alleys of San Francisco's Chinatown, 
where he comes upon a little antique shop, filled with curious pieces of statuary and other art 
objects. What especially catches his eye is a beautifully wrought, life-size bronze statue of a rat. He 
asks the elderly shopkeeper for the rat's price. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"The rat costs twelve dollars," says the shopkeeper, "and it will be a thousand dollars more for the 
story behind it."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"Well, you can keep the story, old man," responds the tourist, "but I'll take the rat."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;After buying the rat, the tourist leaves the store, carrying his newly acquired statue under his arm. 
As he crosses the street in front of the store, he sees two live rats emerge from a sewer drain and fall 
into step behind him. He looks nervously over his shoulder and starts to walk faster. Soon more rats 
appear and begin to follow him. In a few minutes rats are coming out of every sewer, basement, 
vacant lot, and landfill, forming themselves into swarms and packs and massing in step behind him. 
People on the street point and shout at him as the pursuing rats force him into a trot, and then a dead 
run. But no matter how fast he runs, the rats, now squeaking and squealing grotesquely, stay right 
behind him. By the time he reaches the water's edge, the line of rats trailing him extends back for 
twelve city blocks. Finally, in desperation, the tourist leaps as high as he can up onto a lamppost 
and hugs it by one arm while, with the other, he flings the bronze rat far out into the waters of San 
Francisco Bay. To his amazement, the hordes of rats race right by him and follow the statue, 
surging over the breakwater and leaping into the Bay -- and then promptly drowning. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Whereupon the tourist hurries back up to the antique shop. When he appears at the door, the 
shopkeeper smiles knowingly and says, "Ah, yes, sir. So now you've seen what the statue can do, 
and you've come back to find out the story?" 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"No, no, no," replies the tourist excitedly. "Now I want to buy a bronze statue of a lawyer!"
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There's nothing more rich with cultural meaning than humor. Clearly the main point of this joke is 
its hardwired animus toward lawyers. But there's another point, too. The tourist in this story is a 
man interested only in immediate results, and things, and in what those things can be deployed to 
do. He couldn't care less about "knowing the story."  And the punch line assumes that we pretty 
much agree with him. If the statue eradicates lawyers, who cares how it works?  A picture may be 
worth a thousand words, but no story is worth a thousand bucks. Such is the characteristic 
American attitude toward the past -- You can keep your story, old man; I'll take the rat. But the 
tourist makes a completely unwarranted universalistic assumption -- that all bronze statues from 
this shop will have the same effect. How can he know that, until he has heard "the story?"  His lack 
of interest in "the story" is not only philistine; it is foolish. Hasn't he learned that you get what you 
pay for?  Yet this is the sort of mechanistic attitude, which has rightly been called "crackpot 
realism," that Kirk always had to battle -- as do all of us who care about the American past and 
about the state of our historical consciousness. For you can't really appreciate the statuary of 
American political and institutional life, or know the value of American liberty and prosperity, 
unless you pay the price of learning the story. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Of course, we also now have another, very different, problem: that the older "story" of the 
American past is increasingly regarded, especially by our academic historians, as nothing but a 
story of rats, which is another way of saying that the struggle to reclaim historical consciousness in 
contemporary America has to occur on two different fronts, too. It is one thing to believe the past is 
unworthy of our attention. It's another thing to assert that it is unworthy of our respect. We now 
confront both of these attitudes at once, and it is hard to say which is the more threatening. It is 
alarming to have our suspicion confirmed, most recently by a Department of Education survey of 
22,000 American schoolchildren, that our young people are learning next to nothing about 
American history. But it is equally alarming to contemplate what passes for historical study in the 
academy, the arena in which our leaders are educated. There the reign of identity politics and 
political correctness has, if anything, only fortified its hold in recent years. It sometimes seems that, 
to paraphrase the old blues song, if it wasn't for bad history, we wouldn't have no history at all. 
Indeed, it is a melancholy thing to reflect, as I sometimes do, that the only consolation to be had for 
the execrable courses our students endure is the fact that they won't remember them after they 
graduate. Unfortunately, though, they may not remember any of the good stuff either. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It's time, then, to recover some fairly basic truths. Historical consciousness is to civilized society 
what memory is to individual identity. One cannot say who or what one is -- one can't say one is 
anyone, or anything, at all -- without some selective retention of experience and source of 
continuity. One cannot learn, use language, pass on knowledge, raise offspring, or even dwell in 
society without the aid of memory. Without memory there are no workable rules of conduct, no 
standard of justice, no basis for restraining passions, no sense of the connection between an action 
and its consequences. There can be no sense of the future, as a moment in time we know will come, 
because we remember that other tomorrows have come, too. And there can be no recognition of the 
sacred, no act of consecration or devotion to the unseen -- for nothing exists but the proximate and 
the sensate. A culture without memory will necessarily be barbarous, no matter how 
technologically advanced and sophisticated, because the daily drumbeat of artificial sensations and 
amplified events will drown out all other sounds, including the strains of an older music.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In our day, even the academic study of history has begun to yield to such barbarism. For an 
increasing number of younger historians, the whole point of studying the past is to "prove" that all 
our inherited institutions, beliefs, conventions, and normative values are arbitrary -- mere "social 
constructions" in the service of ignoble power -- and are therefore utterly without legitimacy or 
authority. In this view, it is absurd to imagine that the study of the past could have any purpose 
beyond serving the immediate needs of the present -- and anyone who thinks otherwise is either 
disingenuous or stupid. The very idea of being enlarged or drawn out of ourselves by encountering 
the strangeness of the past -- and the strange familiarity of the past -- now seems quite beside the 
point. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Kirk's view of the matter was different, first of all because, for him, the past was a land of 
enchantment, pervaded with flitting shadows and ghostly presences. But it was also the source of 
what little real solidity there is to be found in the world. The study of the past, he believed, should 
cause us to recognize the ways that the past has authority over us. For historical consciousness, as 
he understood it, is not merely an awareness of the past and of one's own connection to it. It is the 
cultivation of respect for what cannot be seen, for the invisible sources of meaning and authority in 
our lives -- for the formative agents and foundational principles that, although no longer tangible, 
have made possible what is worthy in our own day. To borrow from the language of religious faith, 
the tutelage of historical consciousness teaches us what it means to walk by faith, and not only by 
sight. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;We see, then, that historical knowledge and historical consciousness are two very different things; 
and the acquisition of historical consciousness, properly understood, will have to be something 
different from the academic study of history -- though the latter does not preclude the former. The 
acquisition of historical consciousness means learning the discipline of memory, which is far more 
than a matter of personal memory -- though that is, of course, where it begins and ends. Historical 
consciousness means learning to appropriate into our own moral imagination, and learning to be 
guided by, the distilled memories of others, the stories of things we never experienced firsthand. It 
means learning to make these things our own, learning to look out at the world we experience 
through their filter, learning to feel the living presence of the past inhering in the seeming inertness 
of the world as it is given to us. Of course, discernment between and among memories is of great 
importance. Not all are worth preserving, and not all are reliable. Here is where the practice of 
professional historians has been especially valuable, in preserving so much that would otherwise be 
lost and in ferreting out the evidence for certain propositions while uncovering the faulty basis for 
others. But the advocate of historical consciousness is likely to give preference to those memories 
whose importance and reliability have been established not merely by a select committee of the 
American Historical Association, but also by the passage of time. To repeat, historical knowledge 
and historical consciousness are different things, and the latter can never become the province of a 
historical priesthood.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;An outside observer cannot easily tell when an individual's vision of reality itself has been 
transformed. No one else can see with another person's eyes, feel with another person's heart. But 
let us imagine a visitor to the battlefield at Gettysburg who knows the history of that battle and war, 
knows the text of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, and knows something of subsequent American 
history -- not only knows these things, but has digested and internalized this knowledge. That 
visitor will experience something very different on his visit from what an uninformed eight-year-
old child will see. What the educated observer sees when he gazes at the modest grassy bump of 
Cemetery Ridge will be, in a sense, more real than what the unimpressed young child sees, even 
though they are looking at the same thing. Such an example undercuts the positivistic notion that 
we live in a world of inert facts to which we impute values. Insofar as we are historical, 
remembering creatures, we inevitably participate in the meanings that we apprehend -- a mysterious 
form of participant knowledge that is, as John Lukacs argues, something very different from mere 
subjectivity. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Part of what makes our visitor different, too, is the fact that he comes to Gettysburg as a part of 
what sociologists call a "community of memory."  His reactions are not determined merely by his 
idiosyncratic impressions, though he may well have had some, or by his extensive knowledge, 
however detailed it may be. Instead, he is one of many people who remember what happened in 
that place, and in some way he is connected to all of them, to all who are bound together by 
remembrance of that story. In the end, communities and nation-states are constituted and sustained 
by such shared memories -- by stories of foundation, conflict, and perseverance. The leap of 
imagination and faith, from the thinness and unreliability of our individual memory to the richness 
of collective memory, that is the leap of civilized life; and the discipline of collective memory is the 
task not only of the historian, but of every one of us. Historical consciousness draws us out of a 
narrow preoccupation with the present and with our "selves," and ushers us into another, larger 
world -- a public world that "cultures" us, in all the senses of that word.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Historical consciousness is, then, part of the cement that holds America together and makes us 
willing to strive and sacrifice on her behalf. One might think of the Gettysburg Address as an 
exemplary text in this respect, since it sought to give meaning to the suffering of the present 
precisely by reference to the visionary sacrifices of the Founders. Instead of deconstructing the past 
in the name of the present, it reinterpreted the present by reference to the past. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;An even better example, however, is Lincoln's first inaugural address, from which the haunting 
phrase in my title, "The Mystic Chords of Memory," is taken. To understand what sort of appeal 
Lincoln was making with these words, we need to recall the setting in which the address was given 
in March of 1861. In the wake of Lincoln's election to the presidency in 1860 without the support of 
a single Southern state, seven states from the Deep South had already left the Union, and the crucial 
border states were on the verge of doing so as well. The Union that Lincoln so greatly cherished 
seemed to be dissolving before his eyes. With this inaugural speech, Lincoln began his attempt to 
counter this disintegration. He made it clear that, so far as he was concerned, the union of states 
under the Constitution could not be broken, for it was meant to be a perpetual union, rather than 
being revocable at the whim of a single state or combination of states. The speech takes a variety of 
turns, offering legal, political, moral, and prudential reasons for its case. Its tone is by turns both 
conciliatory and stern. But with its final clinching paragraph -- added (it is said) at the suggestion of 
William Henry Seward -- the speech soars to immortal heights: 
<p><blockquote>
	&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I am loath to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. 
Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The 
mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to 
every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus 
of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our 
nature.
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is a rich, complex, intricately balanced sentence, built around a delicate musical image. The 
"chords of memory" will eventually be "touched" by our better angels -- one can almost envision 
them plucking the strings of a harp -- and once those memories have been made vibrant, they will 
elicit other sympathetic vibrations, the intervals and overtones that energize and "swell the chorus 
of the Union."  These are "mystic" chords, which means that they must come from a divine, 
mysterious source; and these mystic chords somehow have the power to link "every battlefield and 
patriot grave" to "every living heart and hearthstone" in the land. When they are sounded, the 
mystic chords have the power to connect past and present, inner and outer, private and public, 
household and polity, locality and nationality in a single harmonious whole. During times of 
confusion and crisis, such as the nation was then facing, it could find composure and direction in 
recalling the Spirit of '76 and the Founders' heroic sacrifices. Citizens will draw strength and 
comfort from associating their love of the nation with the same warm devotion that attaches them to 
their own hearths.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For Lincoln, though, the battlefields and patriot graves deserved our reverence not simply for 
sentimental reasons, or out of reverence for our ancestors' great sacrifices, but because of the cause 
for which they sacrificed. It would not have been enough had they merely died for the 19th-century 
equivalent of baseball, hot dogs, apple pie, and Chevrolet. They died, as Lincoln expressed it in the 
Gettysburg Address, in order that government of the people, by the people, and for the people "shall 
not perish from the earth."  They died, he asserted, to sustain the possibility of a nation "dedicated 
to the proposition that all men are created equal."  The mystic chords of memory, then, also draw us 
back to first principles and to an understanding of America as a nation self-consciously founded, at 
a distinct moment in time, with particular ends in view. From this perspective, the United States is a 
nation with a uniquely creedal sense of national identity -- a nation, as Chesterton put it, with the 
soul of a church. In this view, one becomes an American less by <i>descent</i> than by 
<i>consent</i>.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Thus, Lincoln's oratory offered two different effects of invoking the mystic chords of memory -- 
first, as reminders of an inherited way of life and, second, as reminders of a set of universal 
propositions. This duality is at the heart of a longstanding debate about the nature of American 
institutions, and indeed it now presents itself at the heart of contemporary debates about 
multiculturalism, immigration, and national identity. Is America a transnational nation, founded 
upon certain abstract and universalistic principles which it both exemplifies and promotes?  Or is it 
a civilization built upon a series of specifically Western European, and largely British, historical 
accretions with language, laws, customs, conventions, institutions, and belief systems arising 
organically out of those particular legacies?  Such questions are exceedingly difficult to answer 
with finality, and the balance between them may remain contested for as long as the United States 
stays in business as a country. It is hard to imagine either one of the perspectives they represent 
ever being excluded from our sense of national identity.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Now let me turn to the possibility of "reclaiming" the American past, alluded to in my subtitle. 
What is meant by this?  First, a recognition that genuine historical consciousness ought to be the 
common possession of all. Quite simply, a democratic nation needs a democratic history. By this I 
do not mean the sort of fashionable history that ignores politics and constitutions and intellectual 
elites and insists upon viewing the past exclusively "from the bottom up."  There is in fact a kind of 
unconscious scorn buried in the assumptions behind such writing -- as if political and intellectual 
history is beyond the common people's means, and as if no one could be expected to be interested 
in anything that does not involve them directly. Surely, however, such assumptions are false. 
Instead, we need to encourage serious historical writing that is sufficiently accessible to shape and 
deepen the public mind. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Here, too, one will need to battle on two fronts, challenging both the ignorance of the public and the 
malfeasances of the scholarly establishment. The American public has to want to reclaim its 
history, and it will have to be willing to work at it and overcome the tendencies so well illustrated 
by the rat joke. But that willingness will come far more easily if something can be done about the 
combination of political ideology and professionalization that has enveloped historical writing in 
recent years. The dangers of ideology are fairly obvious; but the dangers of exclusive 
professionalization are nearly as great. Though the professionalization of historical writing has been 
a source of many great improvements in our historical knowledge, it has wounded our historical 
consciousness. The time may have come to rethink the matter.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The recent dust-ups over the Enola Gay exhibit at the Smithsonian and the National History 
Standards are revealing in this respect. In both cases, the American public reacted decisively, and 
negatively, to what it saw as efforts by anointed experts to hijack the American past and transpose 
the mystic chords into a minor key. What has been most notable in both episodes has been the 
surprised and outraged reactions of the historical profession (or more precisely, of its spokesmen). 
The responses have run the gamut: astonishment, shock, fury, wounded dismay, dripping 
condescension. And I regret to say that even now I do not think my colleagues quite grasp what has 
happened to them. It has long been fashionable in academe to talk about who "owns" history and to 
make very democratic noises whenever the matter is under discussion. But all the while, it seems as 
if the professional historians have not doubted that <i>they</i> own it, or at least deserve to, and if 
one could take control of the American Historical Association and other professional organizations, 
one could transform history in a manner nearer to one's heart. They now have discovered that what 
flies in the hermetic world of academic scholarship will not fly with the great American public. In 
the Enola Gay episode in particular, the use of a public, and publicly funded, commemorative 
exhibition to put forward a revisionist interpretation of the American war effort in 1941-45 crossed 
a line, and the public would not tolerate it. And they were right not to.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Let me hasten to add that I am not saying history ought to be all comforting myth. Nor am I 
suggesting that historians should never challenge conventional wisdom. On the contrary; we badly 
need such challenges. But surely this does not mean historians enjoy <i>carte blanche</i> 
protection against being themselves challenged in turn, particularly when they choose to address 
sensitive public issues. Indeed, the public has a responsibility to offer such counterchallenges, 
whenever appropriate, to test and ventilate the findings of academicians. That is part of what it 
means to have a democratic history and democratic discourse. Yet it was precisely the mounting of 
such challenges that most offended the historical clerisy: The <i>effrontery</i> of all those World 
War II veterans, thinking they knew something important about the war that had escaped the 
attention of the Smithsonian's baby-boomer curators!  The future may well bring many, many more 
such acts of effrontery as the public's patience with the follies of higher education wanes -- and, 
may it be hoped, as their interest in reclaiming the past waxes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It will, however, take more than challenging academic revisionism to accomplish much along these 
lines. The two fronts I spoke of before symbolize two problems that are, in fact, mutually 
reinforcing. Revisionism would have little power in a country that was less ignorant of its past. The 
docu-slanders of Oliver Stone would be laughed out of court. So would the childish fantasies of 
<i>Dances with Wolves</i>. Hence, in engaging the second front, we must resist the temptation to 
blame others, to play the game of anti-anti-Americanism, and instead face up to our weaknesses. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In this connection, it seems to me that Russell Kirk was right to stress that technological progress 
and the unhindered market are not the answer to everything. Notwithstanding their many blessings 
and benefits, one cannot ignore the pathologies and casualties they engender -- and the loss of 
historical consciousness has been one of them. We live in a culture of such ceaseless, turbulent 
change -- economic, social, technological -- that for many of us it seems almost ridiculous, and 
certainly quixotic, to be speaking of chains of continuity linking generations past with generations 
to come. Indeed, the emerging postmodern understanding of the self counsels that it is fruitless, and 
even unhealthy, to seek continuity and consistency within one's self. Better to be a protean self, 
hanging loose, refashioning one's identity as changing circumstances dictate. Postmodernism is 
itself symptomatic, the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of a pervasive tendency within our society. It 
may be crackpot realism of the worst sort to think we can go on this way very much longer, 
particularly if it is true that the social problem at the bottom of all others -- the disintegration of the 
family -- is ultimately a problem of discontinuity between the generations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Our popular culture conspires in a thousand ways to reinforce our sense of discontinuity and 
generational isolation. Consider, to take but one example, what has happened to professional sports 
in our time. When I was a boy, professional sports formed a central part of my life. They provided a 
tremendous source of common experience linking me not only with my own friends, but with my 
father and mother and members of their generation. I had a typical American boy's fascination with 
baseball statistics and delighted in my then-extensive knowledge of them. I did not realize it at the 
time, but those statistics were also a source of historical consciousness. For to enter seriously into 
the world of baseball statistics is to become aware of a world much larger and longer than your 
own, to see all major-league baseball players competing in one great continuum of slugging 
percentages, earned-run averages, and stolen bases. One becomes a kind of historian. I learned to 
care not only about the active players I followed, like Boog Powell and Brooks Robinson, but about 
long-gone players my parents had followed, like Dizzy Dean, Stan Musial, Joe DiMaggio; and that 
was a wonderful bond between us. I will always have a soft spot for the St. Louis Cardinals, even 
though I grew up following the Baltimore Orioles, because the Cardinals had been my parents' team 
when they were young. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I do not have any such soft spot, however, for the Indianapolis Colts. Nor do I expect to care much 
about the Baltimore Browns football team. When I was a boy, I was well aware that professional 
sports was a business. But I could never have imagined the degree to which it is now little else. We 
now have not only the free agency of players, but the free agency of franchises; and the rules, 
materials, schedules, game sites, players -- everything about the game -- are considered plastic and 
subject to revision. This is the triumph of utility-maximizing over all else, and I cannot help but 
think professional sports will ultimately be undone by it. In my own case, there is no magic left, 
and I am relieved that my own son has no interest in professional sports. Another chain of 
continuity broken.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Even so, there will always remain the irreducible lure of seeing excellence in performance, a 
healthy antidote to the cult of victimization and self-pity that has swept our culture. But one cannot 
feel that lure without first having a consciousness of the larger historical context which so engaged 
me as a boy, that universe of statistics and records. After Cal Ripken, Jr., broke Lou Gehrig's 
consecutive-game record this past year, he spoke some very simple but hauntingly appropriate 
words which captured this fact perfectly. As you may remember, there was some feeling that 
Ripken ought not break the record, that to do so robbed Gehrig of his distinction. But Ripken knew 
that the opposite was true: that he best honored Gehrig by competing with him. If Gehrig were 
looking down on this, Ripken said, he would not be thinking about the record; he would instead 
reflect that here was "an example of what is good and right about the great American game."  It was 
a simple, wonderful statement -- one that, in its own way, sounds the mystic chords of memory, 
stretching from every batter's box and bleacher seat to every hearth and TV room in this broad land. 
It recognizes that a determination to achieve and a reverence for the past are by no means opposites. 
But of course, Ripken would never have used the words he did had there not been so much that is 
neither good nor right about the great American game in its present condition.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I have delved into the example of baseball, but I could have picked any number of features of our 
popular culture -- our popular music, our extreme geographical mobility, our disintegrating 
families, our declining churches and voluntary associations, our mania for the bulldozer and the 
wrecking ball. Indeed, I think there is a growing recognition of these problems across the 
intellectual spectrum. It is important, however, to formulate the problem rightly. It is not the 
<i>commodification</i> of all things (to use a trendy, overused word) but the <i>fungibility</i> of 
all things, which is to say their <i>impermanence</i>, that afflicts us -- the fungibility of 
marriages, lovers, jobs, habitations, even genders. It is not just that all things are for sale, but that in 
the process all things are being made commensurable and interchangeable, and therefore ultimately 
homogeneous. An odd goal for a world that professes to prize diversity but is in fact frightened by 
it. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;All of which should give added force in our minds to Kirk's permanent emphasis, in season and out 
of season, upon "the permanent things."  But it should also remind us that the recovery of historical 
consciousness is not merely an intellectual matter, a matter of rereading the great books and 
reemphasizing the roots of American order, as Kirk called them. It is also a very concrete matter, a 
matter of taking stock of the way we live, of what our pastimes and pleasures, our families and our 
marriages, our habits and our aspirations all say about our sense of connection to the past -- and, 
therefore, about ourselves. Karl Marx insisted that the past did not deserve our reverence; it was 
nothing but a snare. "The tradition of all the dead generations," he declaimed, "weighs like a 
nightmare on the brain of the living."  He was wrong about that, as about so much else. But too 
many of us live, whether we know it or not, as if we believed he was right. Perhaps it is time for 
that to change.

<H2>Third Generation</H2>
<hr><p>

The term Third Generation describes a generation of conservatives whose primary purpose in Washington is to roll back the liberal policies of the last 60 years. First Generation conservatives were the intellectuals, including Russell Kirk, Bill Buckley, and James Burnham. Far removed from power, these intellects drew the philosophical map for later generations. 
<p>
The crushing defeat of Barry Goldwater in 1964 sparked the Second Generation of conservatives -- men and women dedicated to putting conservatives in office.  The Third Generation of conservatives emerged from Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in 1980.  Liberals, discredited intellectually by the First Generation, and defeated politically by the Second, were dismayed as swarms of young conservative activists came to Washington to chip away at their centralized power.
<p>
In January of 1984, The Heritage Foundation initiated the Third Generation project to identify young conservative leaders and bring them together in an informal setting to discuss the issues challenging them today and in the future.  Since then, Third Generation members have met every other Wednesday night for lectures and refreshments in Heritage's Lehrman Auditorium. 
<p>
While the initial goal of the Third Generation project was, and is, to identify and network young conservatives, its importance to the success of conservative policies runs much deeper. As a speaker said several years ago, "the central mission of the Third Generation is to continue to build the lines of communication between the various interests within our movement and develop a set of signals so that we can all move in one direction, to accomplish a common objective the rebuilding of America along the principles established by this country's founders."

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>

	Tax reform is gaining momentum. Lawmakers from both parties are proposing sweeping changes in the income tax system, such as the Armey-Shelby flat tax (the most widely known of the proposed reforms), a national sales tax, the Nunn-Domenici USA tax, the Gephardt 10 percent tax, and a value-added tax.1 Almost every Republican presidential candidate endorses some form of radical tax reform, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) and Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) asked former Congressman and housing secretary Jack Kemp to chair a commission to recommend how best to reform the tax code. 
<p>
	 Each of the tax reform proposals assumes that the existing income tax system is fundamentally broken and cannot be fixed without a complete overhaul. But they achieve this in significantly different ways. The question is, which approach would be best for taxpayers and the economy?

*Grade contingent on permanent repeal of the current federal income tax
<p>

	When evaluated based on nine different criteria, including the degree to which they lower tax rates, simplify the system, address the bias against savings and investment, and treat taxpayers fairly, the plans based on the flat tax model developed by Stanford University Professor Robert Hall and Hoover Institution Senior Fellow Alvin Rabushka score highest.2 Direct consumption taxes also fare well, but proposals that more closely resemble the current system are graded the lowest. <p>	 Since no tax system is perfect, this grading scale is somewhat subjective:  A for reform as close to the ideal as possible,3 B for significant improvement over the current system, C for no significant effect one way or the other, D for a plan (or a feature of a plan) demonstrably worse than today's tax code, and F for significantly worse than today's tax code.<p>	In order to understand these grades, it is necessary to identify what is wrong with the current system and then to determine how each reform plan addresses each of these flaws.<p><b>WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE CURRENT SYSTEM</b><p>	Today's tax code has few defenders. Former Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Shirley Peterson states that there is nothing logical about the way the code is constructed now.4 As House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt points out: <p><blockquote>	 It has become a test of legal brainpower, an accountant's decathlon, a treasure hunt for hidden deductions and buried tax breaks. Our tax code has become a dense fog of incentives, inducements, and penalties that distort the most basic economic decisions, constrain the free market, and make it hard for Americans to run their own lives. The Internal Revenue Service has become a symbol of what is wrong with American government.5</blockquote><P>	And Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole has summed up many of the problems with the current system, noting:<p><blockquote>	During much of the past century, tax policy has been a primary tool with which government has wielded power, fed the bureaucracy, an
d redistributed wealth.... Any fair system would not penalize, but instead reward people for working harder, investing wisely, and saving more. It would eliminate the lobbyist-drafted loopholes that benefit the few, but force the rest of us to pay.6</blockquote><p>	The current income tax system is both anti-growth and discriminatory. Its problems, while seemingly endless, fall into several broad categories:<p><b>High tax rates</b> -- Under present law, a successful entrepreneur will pay more than 40 cents of each additional dollar earned to the federal government. This burden can rise to over 50 cents when state income taxes are included and to more than 80 cents when estate taxes are added. These excessive rates penalize productive economic behavior and reduce incentives to work, create wealth, and take risks.
<p>
<b>Complexity</b> -- The large number of forms, regulations, and rulings forces many Americans to pay professionals to fill out their tax forms. According to the Tax Foundation, annual compliance costs total nearly $200 billion (in addition to the taxes paid to Washington and the loss in economic growth caused by excessive rates).7<p><b>Multiple taxation</b> -- Some forms of income, particularly from savings and investment, are subject to as many as four levels of tax. For example, a dollar of capital income could be subject to corporate income, personal income, capital gains, and estate taxes. This combined burden becomes confiscatory and undermines incentives to save and invest.<p><b>Social engineering</b>  -- Politicians have turned the tax code into a bewildering system of special preferences, penalties, and deductions. Some income is taxed more than once, while other income is not taxed at all. Such complexity is inevitable in a tax system that rewards those with expensive lawyers and accountants and allows lawmakers to micromanage the economy while collecting large campaign contributions from donors seeking to change or preserve sections of the tax code.
<p>


<b>THE COMPETING TAX PLANS</b>
<p>
	While there is widespread agreement on what is wrong with the tax system, there is considerable debate over which plan best solves these problems. The following are the key features of the major tax reform proposals currently under consideration:
<p>
<b>Armey/Shelby flat tax</b> -- Based on the Hall/Rabushka flat tax, H.R. 2060 and S. 1050, sponsored by House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey (R-TX) and Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL), would replace the current personal and corporate income tax system with a simple 17 percent tax on all income. With the exception of a generous family allowance, all labor income is taxed at the individual level. Taxes on business income (such as interest, dividends, capital gains, and rents) are withheld and paid at the business level. Both businesses and individuals would fill out postcard-sized returns. 
<p>
<b>National retail sales tax</b> -- This proposal would replace the personal and corporate income taxes with a sales tax. Many details remain unknown, such as what tax rate would be applied and what goods and services, if any, would be exempted. As of publication, there is no legislation to create a national sales tax, although Representatives Dan Schaefer (R-CO) and Billy Tauzin (R-LA) may introduce a bill shortly. 
<p>
<b>Value-added tax</b> -- This tax, known as the VAT, is similar to a national sales tax, except that it is levied on the additional value created at each stage of production. For example, instead of a 25 percent retail sales tax on purchases at a furniture store, the VAT would tax the logs as they go to the sawmill, the lumber as it goes to the furniture manufacturer, the furniture as it goes to the store, and the same furniture as it is sold to the consumer. The net effect, however, is the same:  a 25 percent tax on the value of the retail sale. There currently is no legislation to replace income taxes with a VAT, although House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer (R-TX) intends to introduce some type of direct consumption tax.
<p>
<b>Nunn/Domenici USA tax</b> -- Sponsored by Senators Sam Nunn (D-GA) and Pete Domenici (R-NM), the Unlimited Savings Account tax (S. 722) creates the equivalent of an unlimited Individual Retirement Account (IRA) and replaces the current rate structure with a three-rate structure that includes a top rate of 40 percent. Some deductions are lost or curtailed, and at least one new deduction is created. The corporate income tax is replaced by a VAT.
<p>
<b>Gephardt 10 percent tax</b> -- This plan, introduced by House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-MO), broadens the tax base by eliminating such preferences as deductions for charitable contributions and state and local taxes and taxing the value of fringe benefits. The proposal also replaces the five current tax brackets with five new brackets ranging between 10 percent and 34 percent.
<p>
<b>Specter flat tax</b> -- Using the same model as the Armey/Shelby flat tax, Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA), in S. 488, proposes a slightly higher rate and lower personal allowance in order to maintain limited deductions for charitable contributions and the full deduction for home mortgage interest.
<p>
	Other tax reform proposals are expected in coming months. Senator Connie Mack (R-FL) may introduce a version of the flat tax which presumably will have many of the same economic benefits as the Armey/Shelby legislation. Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) is rumored to be preparing a tax reform bill, though no details are available and his decision to retire may alter those plans. Finally, as the tax reform debate heats up, the Administration might introduce its own plan. The President has said that he finds the flat tax appealing, and Chief of Staff Leon Panetta introduced flat tax legislation as a Member of Congress in 1983. The White House also has expressed interest in the value-added tax,8 although it is unlikely that the Administration would support a VAT as a replacement for the income tax.<p>	<b>GRADING THE TAX PLANS</b><p>	While each reform has an overall grade, it is particularly useful to see how the different proposals address specific flaws in the current system. The grades in the following section indicate the extent to which different tax plans reflect nine important principles of sound tax policy.
<p>
<b>Low Rates</b> 
<p>
	Low tax rates ensure that taxpayers have little incentive to hide, shelter, and underreport income. Because willingness to work, save, invest, and take risks is tied to the expected rewards of such behavior, the lower the tax rate(s), the higher the level of economic growth.
<p>
Armey/Shelby flat tax: <b>A</b>
<p>
	The flat tax popularized by the House Majority Leader begins with a 20 percent rate that phases down to 17 percent in the third year.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Assuming a low rate and with income not taxed directly, the penalty on the creation of wealth would be minor.9<p>Value-added tax:  <b>A</b><p>	As with the national sales tax, a VAT with a low rate would have minimal impact on working, savings, and investment.<p>Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>D</b><P>	The top tax rate in the USA tax is 40 percent, even higher than in current law. To make matters worse, it applies to taxable incomes as low as $24,000 for a family of four.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>C</b>
<p>
	Like the current system, the Minority Leader's plan has five separate rates. These rates are slightly lower than in current law, but the expansion of taxable income and the income levels at which the different rates apply offset this minor improvement.
<p>
Specter flat tax: <b>A-</b>
<p>
	The Specter plan's low 20 percent flat rate would stimulate increased work, savings, and investment when compared with current law, although it could be even lower if the remaining deductions were scrapped.
<p>


<b>Simplicity </b>
<p>
	The current income tax has more than 400 different forms, requires more than one billion 1099 forms (tracking interest and dividend income), and necessitates more than five billion hours of effort each year.10 While individuals rightly complain about the costs of simply compiling information, calculating their taxes, and understanding forms, compliance costs for business are twice as high.
<p>
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>	
<p>
	The current system's plethora of documents, paperwork, and complex record-keeping would be greatly simplified by two postcard-sized forms, one for individuals and one for business.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>B</b>
<p>
	Compliance costs for individuals would disappear, though retail businesses would bear an increased burden because they would be responsible for collecting the tax and complying with reporting requirements.
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>B+</b>
<p>
	Individual compliance costs would vanish, as would the daunting complexities of the corporate income tax, but businesses would have to maintain detailed records to calculate their share of tax liability as goods and services travel through the production process.
<p>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax: <b> B-</b>
<p>
	Since the burden of the corporate income tax is even worse than a VAT, compliance costs for business would fall under a USA tax. Individual compliance costs could rise relative to the current system, however, because of requirements for tracking deposits and withdrawals into the unlimited IRA.
<p>

Gephardt 10 percent tax: <b>C+</b>
<p>
	The corporate income tax remains the same, but many deductions for the personal income tax are eliminated. This would lead to slightly lower compliance costs for individuals.
<p>
Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b>
<p>
	With the exception of tracking home mortgage and charitable contributions, the Specter version of the flat tax, like the Armey/Shelby version, also significantly reduces compliance costs.
<p>


<b>Savings and Investment</b> 
<p>
	By double-taxing, triple-taxing, and sometimes even quadruple-taxing income from capital, the current system significantly hinders capital formation. This reduces the quality and quantity of machinery, equipment, and technology in the economy and lowers wages by reducing the amount workers can produce.
<p>

Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	All income is taxed, but only subject to one level of tax. The current multiple taxation of capital income is eliminated. While this would boost savings and investment compared to current law, the effect would be to make the tax code neutral, neither encouraging nor discouraging savings, investment, or consumption.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	By not taxing income directly, the retail sales tax removes the bias in the existing system against savings and investment.
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Like the sales tax, the VAT addresses the capital formation problem by ending income taxation altogether.
<p>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax: <b>B</b>
<p>
	While the USA tax eliminates the bias against savings and investment caused by multiple taxation by providing an unlimited IRA, it dampens incentives to save and invest by imposing sharply graduated rates.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>D-</b>
<p>
	The Minority Leader's plan not only retains the existing anti-savings, anti-investment features of the current system, but also makes the tax code even more hostile to savings and investment by including provisions such as an increase in the tax rate on capital gains.
<p>
Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b>
<p>
	As with all flat taxes based on the Hall/Rabushka model, there is no bias against capital formation. The continuation of certain deductions, particularly the mortgage interest deduction, does result in a mild distortion of market forces.11<p><b>Social Engineering</b><p>	The tax code today rewards some types of activity, everything from putting a child in daycare to buying a home. Other behaviors, however, such as savings and investment, are penalized harshly. Particularly disturbing is the ability of special interests to add special preferences to the tax code on behalf of wealthy clients.
<P>
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	The only preference in the pure flat tax is a family allowance. Government would not attempt to steer economic decisions or try to penalize or reward different types of behavior.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Presuming it would apply equally to all goods and services, the retail sales tax would get government out of the business of micromanaging private decisions. There is a danger, of course, that politicians would impose higher rates on unpopular goods and services (tobacco, caviar, imports) while granting lower or zero rates to others (food, shelter, health care).
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Like the sales tax, a pure VAT ends government favoritism and efforts to subsidize certain industries or activities. The same caveat -- the potential for discriminatory rates -- applies.
<p>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>B</b>
<p>
	Some deductions are eliminated, but this is offset by the creation of new ones such as a deduction for educational expenses. The USA proposal, however, does end the current code's explicit penalties on savings and investment.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>B-</b>
<p>
	With the exception of the home mortgage interest deduction, special preferences in the tax code are eliminated. The Minority Leader's plan even taxes fringe benefits. Existing penalties on savings and investment, however, are made even worse by increasing the capital gains tax.
<p>
Specter flat tax: <b>A-</b>
<p>
	Except for continuing limited individual deductions for mortgage interest and charitable contributions, the Specter version of the flat tax takes government officials out of the business of picking winners and losers.
<p>


<b>Intrusiveness/Civil Liberties </b>
<P>
	In part because of the code's numbing complexity, but also because of legislative directives, the IRS engages in tax collection activities that many believe are abusive. A simple tax code, with easily understood rules that apply to everyone, would solve much of this problem. Because all tax systems ultimately are based on coercion, and thus are accompanied by police powers for the taxing authority, the highest grades are given to proposals that minimize the scope and opportunity for intrusion.
<P>

Armey/Shelby flat tax: <b> A</b>
<p>
	By dramatically reducing the complexities of the current system, this plan would leave taxpayers with less reason to fear the IRS. For individual taxpayers, the only possible areas of controversy are the size of one's family and the amount of labor income earned (taxes on capital income are withheld and paid at the business level). Whatever problems remain -- including how the self-employed handle deductions, particularly if they work out of their homes -- would be a fraction of those that exist now.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Small businesses will not appreciate collecting taxes for the federal government, but the level of intrusion resulting from a properly designed sales tax is small compared with the current system. This is particularly true in states that already impose sales taxes.
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	In its pure form, the VAT should minimize most tax collection abuses. Businesses would need to maintain records, but the impositions on privacy would be small compared with the current system.12<p>Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>C</b>	<p>	Much of the current tax system is left in place. Moreover, the government will require detailed financial records from individuals who lower their tax burden by saving.<p>Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>C</b><p>	Some deductions disappear, presumably reducing the potential for disputes with the IRS, but the multiple taxation of savings and investment becomes more pervasive, a step that will create more conflicts between citizens and tax authorities. The net effect is probably zero.
<P>
Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b>
<p>
	Simple and straightforward, the Specter flat tax should eliminate most abuses. Retention of certain limited deductions, however, requires record-keeping and creates opportunities for IRS intrusion into taxpayers' personal affairs.
<p>


<b>Fairness</b>
<P>
	Fairness in the tax system should mean equal treatment. Any special treatment, either preference or penalty, violates this principle. All taxpayers -- and all income -- should be treated equally.
<P>
	
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	All taxpayers pay the same rate, and all income is taxed once. The only exemption is the zero bracket amount (personal allowance) based on family size.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>A</b>
<P>
	All taxpayers presumably will pay the same rate, and all goods and services presumably will be taxed. As with the flat tax, there probably will be some mechanism to eliminate any tax liability for those with low incomes.
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>A</b>
<P>
	Like the retail sales tax, the VAT theoretically should apply equally to all taxpayers and not discriminate by charging different rates. Also, there likely will be a process by which to offset the tax burden for the poor.
<p>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>C-</b>
<p>
	Maintaining steeply graduated rates means that the law will not apply equally to all taxpayers. Government would continue to interfere with economic decisions by granting preferential treatment to certain activities. Also, the estate tax would remain, applying double taxation to the affected income.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>D-</b>
<P>
	Like the USA tax, the Gephardt proposal includes steeply progressive rates that explicitly impose special penalties on certain citizens. Compounding this error is its exacerbation of the current code's multiple taxation of capital income. The only provision that precludes a failing grade is the elimination of some deductions.
<p>
Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b>
<P>
	This proposal has all the fairness of the Armey plan, with the exception of modest deductions for mortgage interest and charitable contributions.
<P>

<b>Downside Risk</b>
<p>
	While many tax reform proposals are conceptually attractive and would boost the economy if enacted, they should not be examined in a vacuum. The long-term ability of each tax to retain these theoretical benefits must be considered.
<p>
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>B</b>
<P>
	Just as lawmakers began raising rates after the 1986 tax reform act, future Congresses could undo a flat tax. One advantage of a pure flat tax, however, is that any changes would be obvious to voters. 
<p>
 The worst that could happen is that policy might drift back to where it is now, but a constitutional amendment requiring a supermajority to raise tax rates would address this concern.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>F</b>
<p>
	The great risk with a retail sales tax is that politicians might adopt a direct consumption tax, but never get around to abolishing the income tax. Also, if state experience is any indication, a sales tax might be manipulated so that some products are exempted while others are subjected to punitive rates. A constitutional amendment explicitly barring an income tax would solve this problem.
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>F</b>
<p>
	All the risks inherent in a retail sales tax exist with a VAT. The European experience shows that it gives politicians an incentive to have both a direct consumption tax and an income tax.13 Moreover, the VAT is applied at arbitrary and uneven rates in most countries. As with the sales tax, a constitutional change could resolve this concern.
<p>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>F</b>
<p>
	The USA proposal replaces the corporate income tax with a VAT. Therefore, concerns that the government might have two major revenue sources are not just theory, but reality. The risk also exists that the corporate income tax either would never be abolished or would be recreated.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>C</b>
<p>
	In a sense, there is not much downside risk with the Gephardt plan because the proposal is not an improvement over current law. On the plus side, the plan creates no new taxes and would require a referendum to increase taxes in the future.
<p>
Specter flat tax:  <b> B-</b>
<p>
	Like the Armey/Shelby proposal, the Specter flat tax is haunted by the evidence since the 1986 tax reform act. Because the Specter version explicitly accepts the notion that policymakers should impose tax preferences because it preserves certain deductions, the risks are somewhat higher that the tax code could be skewed even further.
<p>

<b>Evasion </b>
<p>
	Support for any tax system and its long-term viability depends on how the law works. If there are opportunities for individuals to evade taxes -- and if enough of them take advantage of those opportunities -- the public will view the law as corrupt. Moreover, the loss of revenue will encourage politicians to raise rates on those who do comply with the law, thereby encouraging still more evasion. The downward spiral of higher rates followed by more evasion could be endless.
<p>
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Because of its low rate, this tax provides minimal incentives for evasion. Moreover, by taxing business income at the source, it eliminates the need for more than one billion 1099 forms and simplifies enforcement considerably.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>D</b>
<p>
	The evidence suggests that retail sales taxes higher than about 10 percent are subject to widespread evasion.14 Indeed, almost every country with a VAT originally had a sales tax but changed once rates crept above that level because of problems with complexity and compliance.15<p>Value-added tax:  <b>B+</b>	<p>	A VAT does allow the government to enforce much greater compliance than is possible under a sales tax because the tax is collected at each stage of the production process and there is no need to track whether a product is being sold at retail or wholesale.<p>Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>B</b><p>	The high tax rates in the USA tax will increase incentives to use the underground economy. Moreover, because there will be no tax on income put into savings (and no taxes levied on funds withdrawn from savings), there could be incentives to find ways to manipulate this system.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>C</b>
<p>
	Evasion is not likely to change significantly under the Minority Leader's plan. Eliminating certain deductions could reduce evasion opportunities, but increasing the multiple taxation of capital income will increase incentives to hide or underreport income.
<p>

Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b>
<p>
	Retaining limited deductions and taxing at a slightly higher rate could cause a modest reduction in compliance compared to a pure flat tax since there would be an opportunity to exaggerate deductions.
<p>


<b>International Competitiveness</b> 
<p>
	In a world where capital funds react quickly to changes in a nation's business climate, a tax system that rewards entrepreneurship will attract increased investment and job creation. A system that penalizes growth with high tax rates and imposes multiple levels of taxation on capital income, by contrast, will suffer from capital flight. In addition to their effects on growth, international provisions in the current code are a major source of complexity. Unfortunately, as Chart 4 illustrates, America has undermined its ability to compete by raising tax rates while most of our competitors have been cutting tax rates.
<p>
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	By eliminating the multiple taxation of capital income, all flat taxes based on the Hall/Rabushka model will trigger a surge of new investment and jobs in the United States. By ending the complex practice of taxing American companies and individuals on their foreign income (already taxed in the country where it is earned), the flat tax model will lower compliance costs dramatically and encourage more U.S. firms to enter the global market.
<p>
National retail sales tax:   <b>A</b>
<p>
	Replacing the current, deeply flawed income tax with a direct consumption tax will boost international competitiveness, increase investment, and stimulate job creation. However, the benefits result from ending the income tax, not from imposing the sales tax. Some proponents argue that a sales tax would help the economy and the balance of trade, because it would be levied on goods and services coming into the country while exports would be exempt. This would not create a competitive advantage for America.16 Products sold in America, whether foreign-made or domestic, would be subject to the U.S. sales tax. Likewise, products sold in other countries, whether domestic or American-made, would be subject to applicable sales taxes or VATs in those countries.
<P>
Value-added tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	As with the retail sales tax, a VAT will attract foreign investment and encourage job creation. As noted above, these benefits do not flow automatically from a direct consumption tax. VATs and other sales-based taxes simply create level playing fields. Their benefits stem from elimination of the income tax.
<P>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>B</b>
<p>
	Like the Armey/Shelby flat tax, the USA tax largely ends the complex practice of taxing businesses on income earned overseas. It also eliminates most multiple taxes on capital income, a reform that would encourage foreign investment. Unfortunately, some of these incentives would be offset by high marginal tax rates.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>C</b>
<p>
	Because the current tax system penalizes growth with high tax rates and imposes multiple levels of taxation on capital income, it is extremely destructive to international competitiveness. The Minority Leader's proposal might exacerbate this problem somewhat by expanding the multiple taxation of capital income.17<p>Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b><p>	With a low rate and no tax burden on foreign income because it already is taxed by the nation where it is earned, the Specter flat tax would boost growth and attract capital from overseas.<p><b>CONCLUSION</b><p>	The current income tax system demands comprehensive reform. High rates punish success, excessive complexity drains productive resources, and punitive taxation of capital income retards savings and investment. Of the many proposals have been offered to correct these flaws, reforms based on the Hall/Rabushka flat tax are the best. The flat tax replaces the current five-tiered punitive rate structure with a simple, fair 17 percent rate. The current system's plethora of documents, paperwork, and complex record-keeping is replaced by two postcard-sized forms, one for individuals and one for business. 
<p>
	 Direct consumption taxes like the retail sales tax and VAT theoretically achieve similar results, though such proposals also risk creating major new sources of tax revenue for the federal government. If these proposals were made contingent on enacting a constitutional amendment barring income taxes, this concern would disappear. Finally, plans that attempt to preserve features of the current system, such as the USA tax and the Gephardt 10 percent tax, fall short of the goal. By maintaining a discriminatory system of graduated rates, these plans fail the critical tests of growth, simplicity, and fairness.

<h2>External Relations Department</h2>
<hr>
<p>
Founded in January 1995, the External Relations department handles Heritage's outreach to the business community, to other policy organizations, and to the nation's governors and state officials. 
<p>
External Relations is headed by Heritage Vice President <a href="/heritage/staff/gaynerl.htm">Lew Gayner</a>, who directs department activities with the assistance of his managers: Bridgett Wagner, director of <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/business.html">Business Relations</a>; <a href="/heritage/staff/atwood.htm">Tom Atwood</a>, director of Coalition Relations; and the Project on Federalism and the States director, <a href="/heritage/staff/seay.htm">Doug Seay</a>.
<p>
To reach their target audiences, Gayner and his staff  sponsor Washington Policy Roundtables, bi-monthly forums for Washington-based corporate representatives; the Physicians Council, a coalition of doctors who advocate health care reform based on consumer choice and competition; the <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/rban.htm">Resource Bank</a>, Heritage's networking arm to other public policy groups in the U. S. and abroad; and <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/gov_for.htm">The Project on Federalism and the States</a> which works to directly involve governors and state and local government officials in national policy decisions.
<p>
Gayner also directs Heritage's Corporate Associates, a program of conferences, briefings, and special publications for the Foundation's major corporate donors; co-sponsors the American Trader Initiative Advisory Council, a coalition of business and public policy leaders who advise Heritage on trade issues; and hosts bi-annual National Security Symposiums for the defense industry.  In addition, External Relations hosts monthly working group meetings with congressional staff and provides private briefings for business executives at Heritage and at corporate headquarters.

<TITLE> A Tyranny of the Judiciary?
 -- November 1996 Insider - Heritage</TITLE>

<h3>November, 1996 <i>Insider</i></h3></center> 



<CENTER><h3> A Tyranny of the Judiciary?
</h3></CENTER><HR>
<P>
<dd>	Consider the many conservative policy proposals which have been enacted recently, or are on your "wish list." Think about the tremendous popular support many of these plans enjoy. . . .Then realize that the courts have overturned some of these programs already and may well derail numerous others. 
<P>
<dd>
	The combination of litigious, liberal advocacy groups and a judiciary too often willing to make law, rather than interpret the Constitution threatens to negate many of the gains conservatives have made in the war of ideas and at the ballot box. As soon as a program such as school choice or the California Civil Rights Initiative passes, a lawsuit is immediately filed to prevent its implementation. 
<P>
<dd>
	What we seem to get in many cases is a tyranny of judges -- <I>de facto</I> rule by jurists whose power is unchecked and who see fit to mold society to suit their own personal concepts of justice. Most often, this judicial activism reinforces the reigning liberal orthodoxy which has taken hold of American legal institutions.
<P>
<dd>
	As conservatives prepare to wage many crucial battles in the courts, the Federalist Society has built a network designed to overcome legal abuses and to return America to a legal system which operates according to the design of the founders.
<P>
<dd>
	The Federalist Society advances traditional legal principles such as limited, constitutional government; individual freedom and responsibility; traditional values; and the rule of law. Our 22,000 lawyers, law students, academics, public officials, and other concerned citizens actively forward these ideals locally and nationally.

<P>
<dd>	The Society's 145 Student Division chapters at law schools across the country and 60 Lawyers Division chapters in major legal centers provide us with a grass-roots community presence nationwide.
	<P>
<dd>The combination of our strong local base and our national stature allows the Federalist Society to promote the serious inquiry which generates solutions to vital legal and policy questions. Our members are increasingly involved in every stage of the public policy process from recognizing political opportunities to building intellectual and academic support to winning legislative debates. 
<P>
<dd>	We aim to involve in the public policy discussion Citizen-Lawyers who will fight the legal and policy battles crucial to our principles. Today, there is much of this work to be done.
<P>
<dd>
	The following list of activities highlights some of the ways in which the Federalist Society is forwarding its goals:
<P>
<dd>
	Our <b>E.L. Wiegand Practice Groups</b> create a national network of active attorneys dedicated to traditional legal principles. The 15 topics covered by the Practice Groups include: Civil Rights, Constitutional Law, Corporate Law, Criminal Law, Environmental Law, Free Speech, Intellectual Property, Litigation, and Religious Liberties. By mobilizing our members in this manner, we will have a large impact on the development of law in each of these areas.
<P>
<dd>
	The Society's <b><i>Pro Bono</i> Resource Network</b> links Federalist Society lawyers with like-minded groups and individuals needing legal assistance. Through this outreach, our members use their professional talents on behalf of the principles in which they believe.
<P>
<dd>
	The <b>ABA Watch Project</b> centers around a semi-annual <i>ABA Watch</i> newsletter, the first of which was released in August at the American Bar Association convention. This periodical publicizes the activities of the ABA. In so doing, we expect to generate a great deal of discussion about the organized bar and the fears of many that it has become a left-wing advocacy group.
<P>
<dd>
	Of course, the Society's core programs -- local chapter meetings, national and regional conferences, and publications -- will continue to promote traditional legal principles. 
	<P>
<dd>
In sum, the Federalist Society educates the legal community and the general public about the proper role of the legal system, activates legal professionals on behalf of conservative causes, and provides assistance to friendly local, state-wide, and national groups.

The Heritage Foundation Asian Studies Center<hr>
<P>
John Dori, Research Associate of the Asian Studies Center at The Heritage Foundation, and Richard Fisher, Senior Policy Analyst of the Asian Studies Center at The Heritage Foundation, have compiled the 11th annual U.S. and Asia Statistical Handbook. The authors note that U.S.-Asia trade grew dramatically in 1995. The rise in exports to Asia outpaced the growth of exports to all other regions of the world. To help policy makers and the public understand the key issues facing the world's most dynamic region, the Asian Studies Center has compiled key social, political, economic, and military statistics on the United States and 33 countries in East of South Asia. this year's edition includes a chart summarizing the findings of Heritage's Index of Economic Freedom. 91 pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto:Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org,</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.heritage.org">http://www.heritage.org</a>.

 by John Hillen<br>
<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1096, The Heritage Foundation<hr>
<p>
John Hillen, Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, argues that the United States must enact a staged removal of U.S. and NATO military forces from Bosnia in order to avoid a likely decades-long military commitment to the region. Specifically, according to Hillen, the U.S. should keep only a limited number of support troops in Bosnia in 1997, and there should be no U.S. ground troops in a new follow-on implementation force. The follow-on implementation force should be European-led, and eventually lead to European responsibility for the regional peacekeeping burden. All U.S. troops should be removed by 1998, for, according to Hillen, America's main purpose in NATO is not to police ethnic conflicts in Europe. The peacekeeping responsibility should come under such European organizations as the Western European Union or the Organization for the Security and Cooperation in Europe after NATO's departure.  11 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto:Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org,</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.heritage.org">http://www.heritage.org</a>.

<B><a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/asc143.html">Building a Better U.S. Partnership With Australia</a>,</b><br>
 by Robert O'Quinn<br>
<I>Asian Studies Backgrounder</I> No. 143, The Heritage Foundation<hr>
<P>
Robert O'Quinn, Policy Analyst at the Asian Studies Center of The Heritage Foundation, argues that the United States should build a better partnership with Australia to protect its economic and security interests in the Asia-Pacific region. Australia has recently become a major player in the region. This has been due to Australia's efforts over the past ten years to deregulate its economy and dismantle its extremely protectionist trade policies that nearly brought the country to economic ruin by the 1980s. Australia has embraced the dynamic Asian market and reoriented its diplomatic and economic ties toward Asia and the United States. O'Quinn notes that the U.S. cannot duplicate the diplomatic, economic, and military ties that proximity and diplomacy have presented to Australia. To secure vital American interests in the Asia-Pacific region, according to O'Quinn, Washington should cooperate with Canberra on trade and security issues. Specifically, the President should: ask Congress to end the dairy, agriculture export subsidy, and sugar programs that have prevented further trade liberalization in Australia; ask congress to allow intracoastal-coastal shipping to use foreign-built, foreign-operated, or foreign-owned vessels to reduce logistics costs for American firms; ask Congress for fast-track authority to negotiate trade agreements free of contentious environmental and labor standards issues; ask congress to take further steps all around to liberalize trade, especially in areas of conflict between the U.S. and Australia; and strengthen U.S. military ties to Australia by offering to sell Canberra <I>Tomahawk</I> long-range cruise missiles and by including Australia in the development of a future Asian missile defense network. 15 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto:Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org,</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.heritage.org">http://www.heritage.or

<B>Trashing Free Trade: The Basel Convention's Impact on International Commerce</B>, <br>
by James Sheehan<br>
Competitive Enterprise Institute<hr><P>
James Sheehan, Research Associate at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, discusses international hazard waste regulations and their impact on international commerce. The Basel Convention was signed in 1989 to create a global regulatory regime to control trade in hazardous wastes. It has three primary objectives: 1) reduce transboundary movements of hazardous wastes to a minimum; 2) ensure that hazardous wastes be treated and disposed of as close as possible to their source of generation; and 3) minimize hazardous waste generation at source. Sheehan argues that global hazardous waste regulation does nothing to change the root causes of environmental degradation. He notes that illegal dumping of waste is most often a problem in countries where there is little private property, and unresponsive or corrupt government bureaucracies. International trade  does not directly cause environmental degradation, and international trade controls cut off developing countries from important materials and supplies that only international markets can supply. Many developing countries see environmental demands by industrialized nations as new forms of protectionism designed to close markets. Sheehan argues that the U.S. should refrain from further active participation in the Basel Convention. According to Sheehan, the U.S. should reject even the possibility of global trade regulation and an export ban. Free trade and government controls are incompatible concepts. He concludes that developing countries must stand firm against the green trade restrictions of the Basel Convention. 22 pp.  CONTACT: Competitive Enterprise Institute, 1001 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Suite 1250, Washington, D.C. 20036, 202/331-1010, fax 202/331-0640.

<I>Hoover Essays</I>, Hoover Institution<hr>
<P>
In this essay, Peter Duignan and Lewis Gann, Senior Fellows at the Hoover Institution, write about the consequences of the collapse of the Soviet Union. The authors note that the fall of the Soviet Union represented the downfall of a secular religion. Economically, politically and militarily, Soviet communism was a failure. They argue that Gorbachev was an unwitting agent of decolonization, and that Yeltsin represents the architect of Russian reconstruction.  42 pp. CONTACT: Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University Press, Stanford, CA  94305-6010, 415/723-3373, fax 415/723-1687, Internet 	<a href="http://www-hoover.Stanford.edu/index.html">http://www-hoover.Stanford.edu/index.html</a>.

<B>ESTIMATING OSHA COMPLIANCE COSTS</B>,<BR> 
BY HARVEY JAMES<BR>
<I>Policy Study</I> No. 135, Center for the Study of American Business<hr>
<p>
According to a study by economist Harvey James, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) imposes greater regulatory compliance costs to the economy than previously estimated. Based on regulatory impact analyses (RIAs) commissioned by OSHA of 25 major rules issued by the agency after 1980, he estimates that manufacturers in 1993 paid an additional 46,300 each year on average per firm for the 25 OSHA regulations established since 1980. James's analysis has revealed some interesting facts, including: Construction firm spending exceeds $700,000 annually per firm to comply with just one hazardous waste operations regulation; OSHA rules on air quality and process safety are the most costly in the manufacturing sector with costs exceeding $9,000 and $36,000 a year per firm, respectively; the cost of compliance with OSHA's lead standard is nearly $400,000 a year for affected manufacturers; and OSHA's study of the economic impact of proposed Comprehensive Occupational Safety and Health Reform Act (COSHRA) projects total compliance costs at over $10 billion a year. James argues that in order to expose the full impact of OSHA regulations, a reliable survey of compliance expenditures needs to be established. He proposes a survey similar to the Pollution Abatement and Control Expenditures (PACE) reports made annually by the Census Bureau for the EPA. James concludes that there is reasonable basis for establishing a regulatory budget for OSHA. 29 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630, fax 314/935-5688.

<b>The Last Monopoly: Privatizing the Postal Service for the Information Age</b>, <br>
Edited by Edward Hudgins<br>
Cato Institute<hr>
<p>
The Cato Institute presents a collection of essays on returning mail delivery to the free market. The first chapter is by U.S. Postmaster General Marvin Runyon. He tries to make a case that there is a national consensus to keep government in the business of delivering the mail, but that the right amount of deregulation will allow the U.S. Postal Service to compete on equal footing with other couriers. He maintains that universal mail service "backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government," is necessary to bind the nation together. James Cambell looks at the creeping expansion of the postal monopoly. Peter Ferrara argues that their are inherent problems with a postal monopoly that have meant rates as much as 50 percent higher than they would be if competition were allowed. Stephen Gibson, Executive Director of the Bionomics Institute illustrates how the Information Age is bypassing the "Machine Age Postal Service." Economist  Thomas DiLorenzo and Richard Geddes contribute essays on "Natural Monopoly Myths" and "Patterns of Private Delivery," which undermine the case for privatizing the assets of the USPS and thereby moving postal services entirely into the free market. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher proposes converting the USPS into an employee stock-ownership company. And Douglas Adie, author of Monopoly Mail, proposes breaking up the U.S. Postal Service, into regional divisions that would then be sold off. 138 pp.  CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, E-mail <a href=:mailto: cato@cato.org ">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet <a href=" http://www.cato.org">http://www.cato.org</a>.

<b>What to Do About Universal Service Subsidies: Support for High-Cost Areas</b>,<br>
 by Wayne Leighton<br>
<I>Issue Analysis</I> No. 39, Citizens for a Sound Economy<hr>
<P>
Wayne Leighton, Senior Economist for Citizens for a Sound Economy, discusses the issue of Universal Service Subsidies for high-cost telephone service areas. The 1996 Telecommunications Act continues, and potentially expands, current universal service subsidies to high-cost telephone servicing areas. The Federal State Joint Board and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) have been granted considerable authority under the Act to significantly expand the current arrangement of subsidies. Leighton argues that a more limited approach could be taken by relegating more authority over universal service issues to state-level regulators and that subsidies should be brought to a minimum. The size of universal service subsidies, according to Leighton, should be based on the most accurate cost estimates. Methods for cost estimates based upon historical costs tend to inflate the amount of actual expenses incurred, while hypothetical estimates rely on a regulator's calculations. He concludes that for high-cost markets, competitive bidding may offer the most effective way to determine the minimum amount needed to provide a universal service subsidy. This would still guarantee the same quality of service to high-costs areas, while at the same time bringing competition to the market. This competition will drive costs down and efficiency up. 18 pp. CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H Street, N.W., Suite 700, Washington, DC 20005-3908, 202/783-3870, fax 202/783-4687, Internet <a href="http://www.cse.org/cse">http://www.cse.org/cse</a>.

compiled by Ron Utt and Dan Hickey<br>
<I>F.Y.I.</I> No. 123, The Heritage Foundation<hr>
<p>
Ron Utt, Senior Fellow at The Heritage Foundation, and Dan Hickey, Special Assistant to The Heritage Foundation's Vice President for Domestic Policy Issues, have compiled a third report on instances of waste and excess in government spending. Utt and Hickey list the names and phone numbers of the people in charge of each government agency where the financial abuses took place. Cases of waste and excess includes: 1) The expenses from the widespread misuse of Vice President Al Gore's recommendation that government agencies make greater use of credit cards; 2) 93 percent failure of the Housing Authority of New Orleans (HANO) units in maintenance inspections, while 16 new Ford LTD Crown Victoria passenger vehicles were purchased for the central office staff despite the availability of only one pickup truck for HANO maintenance crews; 3) Massive subsidies for such absentee ranchers and farmers as Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam, and celebrity news reporter Sam Donaldson; 4) Amtrack's proposed use of $40 million in taxpayer money to set up costly new service between Boston and Portland, Maine, that will take longer than existing inexpensive private bus service; 5) Information from internal Agency for International Development (AID) reports that shows that up to one-third of the total funds spent on some projects are lost through gross misuse such as contributing to parties, gifts, obituaries in newspapers, flowers, tips, radios, conference prizes, and new clothes for Bank employees to wear to a population development conference; and finally, 6) Cases of food stamp abuse such as that by a Tennessee woman with assets valued at over $350,000 receiving $27,000 in food stamps and welfare benefits over a three-and-a-half-year period, and another instance where food stamps were used to by caviar. Finding room for tax relief can begin with eradicating such flagrant waste as the examples listed in this paper. 4 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-49

<B>Federal Revenue Estimates: What's Wrong; What Should be Done</B>,<br>
 by Michael Schuyler and Norman Ture<br>
<I>Fiscal Issues</I> No. 10, Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation<hr>
<p>
Michael Schuyler, IRET Senior Economist, and Norman Ture, President of IRET, examine key deficiencies in federal procedures for estimating how tax changes affect government revenue. According to the authors, failings in current procedures, notably the insistence that tax changes do not affect the overall economy, systematically mislead policy makers, resulting in tax policies that may cost the American public hundreds of billions of dollars yearly. Schuyler and Ture call for correcting the deficiencies in the current estimating methodology. 70 pp.  CONTACT: IRET, 1300 19th Street, N.W., Suite 240, Washington, D.C. 20036, 202/463-1400, fax 202/463-6199.

<b>The Case for an Across-the-Board Tax Rate Reduction</b>, <br>
by Bruce Bartlett<br>
<I>Policy Backgrounder</I> No. 140, National Center for Policy Analysis<hr>
<p>
Bruce Bartlett, Senior Fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis, puts forth the case for reducing tax rates across the board. He points out that total taxes as a share of the GDP were the highest in U.S. history in 1995 -- 31.3 percent. American paid $151.1 billion more in federal taxes than if federal receipts had remained at their 1992 level of 19.2 percent of GDP. Reducing individual income tax rates across the board by 15 percent would lower federal receipts as a share of GDP to what they were in 1992. The across-the-board tax cut would not solve the tax problem. A tax reduction must be accompanied by spending reduction. As long as federal spending consumes over 20 percent of our national output, it will be impossible to lower taxes as much as is needed. 13 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N.

<b>The Moral Case for the Flat Tax</b>,<br>
 by Steve Forbes<br>
<I>Imprimis</I> Vol. 25, No. 10, Hillsdale College<hr>
<P>
Former Presidential candidate, Steve Forbes puts forth a moral case for the Flat Tax. Forbes stresses how the current tax system leads to political, civic and cultural corruption. The current tax code is mind-numbing and complex, according to Forbes, and the leading source of corruption in Washington. Lobbyists and special interest groups are the largest private sector industry in Washington. Over half of them work to convince politicians to manipulate the tax code in their favor. A flat tax would close all loopholes and throw the lobbyists and special interests out of work. An unfair tax code and excessive taxation leads to civic corruption by taking away a citizen's sense of self-reliance and integrity. Many Americans view the current tax structure as "legalized plunder." Forbes points out that this has a corrosive impact on an individual's sense of responsibility and trust, two necessary components for society to thrive. Despite the trillions in American taxpayer money that has been spent in the name of "compassion," there is more crime, more illegitimacy, more illiteracy, more drug abuse, more broken families, and more members of the permanent underclass than ever before. A flat tax that exempts the poorest citizens would help end the cultural corruption that has resulted from failed big-government programs. Forbes concludes by arguing that the federal government cannot provide the moral influence necessary to preserve families, reawaken faith, restore values, solve social problems and create prosperity. 5 pp.  CONTACT: Hillsdale College, Hillsdale, MI 49242, 800/437-2268.

<B>Do Automobile Fuel Economy Standards Work</B>,<br>
 by Michael Sykuta <br>
<I>Policy Study</I> No. 133, Center for the Study of American Business<hr>
<p>
Michael Sykuta, a Research Associate and lecturer in business administration at the Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business, argues that automobile fuel economy standards do not work. According to Sykuta, corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards have not achieved their original objective of reducing gasoline consumption. He finds that the United States consumed 40 percent more gasoline than when the CAFE law was passed in 1975. His findings offers evidence that  freeze, if not a repeal, of CAFE standards should take place. Proponents of CAFE regulation argue that standards must be increased to further reduce the consumption of gasoline and its environmental side-effects. However, Sykuta found the following: average passenger vehicles on the road today are 59 percent more fuel efficient than the average cars of 1975 and continued through 1982, not because of CAFE standards, but because changes in product designed that began prior to 1975 as a response to prevailing market forces; the average fuel economy of the total U.S. fleet continued to rise after 1982 as the older and less efficient cars were slowly replaced with the newer more efficient cars, however the average fuel economy of all cars has leveled off in recent years; and, CAFE regulations have not achieved the goal of reducing American consumption of foreign oil. Sykuta reasons from his data covering a 44-year period (1951-1994), that average gasoline consumption per car is most significantly related to the price of gasoline and to the average fuel efficiency of the total U.S. fleet, not just new cars. He argues that, at least through 1982, the price of gasoline, not CAFE standards themselves, is the key determinant of average fuel efficiency. He concludes that federal government attempts to reduce gasoline consumption with a mandated fuel-economy standard shows no sign having an impact on the amount of gasoline consumed on a per vehicle basis. Overall, Cafe regulations have only served to create additional bureaucratic burdens on automobile ma
nufacturers. 22 pp.  CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630, fax 314/935-5688.

<b>Community-Run Fisheries: Avoiding the "Tragedy of the Commons"</b>, <br>
 by Donald Leal<br>
<I>PERC Policy Series</I> No. 7, PERC<hr>
<p>
Donald Leal, PERC Senior Associate, discusses how coastal communities can avoid overfishing. He presents several cases where fishing territories have been effectively protected and fish populations preserved through community-run fisheries. Leal mentions early native Alaskan fisheries, and today's ZECs (zones of controlled exploitation) in Quebec. In the examples, he shows that fishing areas can be protected from overfishing with minimal government involvement. Citing studies on well-managed, commonly-owned property, he illustrates that well-defined boundaries, a strong community tradition, and absence of government interference can preserve resources and avoid the "tragedy of the commons." He concludes that government has failed to regulate fishing successfully, and that a self-regulated fishery is an idea whose time has come. 27 pp. CONTACT: Political Economy Research Center, 502 S. 19th Avenue, Suite 211, Bozeman, MT  59715, 406/587-9591, fax 406/586-7555.

<b><a href=" /heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/bg1097.html">How State and Local Officials Can Combat Violent Juvenile Crime</a></b>,<br>
 by James Wootton and Robert Heck<br>
<I>State Backgrounder</I> No. 1097/S, The Heritage Foundation<hr>
<p>
James Wootton, President of the Safe Streets Alliance, and Robert Heck, a former Justice Department official, have prepared a study on how state and local officials can fight violent juvenile crime. Wootton and Heck argue that a high-tech approach might be the answer. six percent of hard-core juvenile offenders, or "superpredators" commit up to 63 percent of all violent juvenile crime. According to Wootton and Heck, state and local law enforcement officials should build computerized case files on these criminals and make the information available to every public agency that deals with youth-police, prosecutors, courts, parole officers, schools and social workers. There is already a similar system set up in more than 150 communities across the United States and Canada called Serious Habitual Offender Comprehensive Action Program (SHOCAP). SHOCAP enables state and local law enforcement officials to identify, target, arrest, and incarcerate violent teenage criminals. Wootton and Heck mention that Congress can aid efforts to fight juvenile crime with such legislation as the Violent and Repeat Juvenille Offender Act of 1996, and the Violent Youth Predator Act of 1996. Ultimately, they argue, violent juvenile crime must be fought by smart, tough and tenacious officials at the state and local level with the most efficient and sophisticated resources for tracking the violent habitual offender.  17 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto:Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org,</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.heritage.org">http://www.heritage.org</a>.

<b>Legal Services for the Poor: Is Federal Support Necessary?</b><br>
 by David Wilkinson<br>
<I>Alternatives in Philanthropy</I>, Capital Research Center<hr>
<P>
David Wikenson, former Utah Attorney General, and the first Inspector General of the Legal Services Corporation (1989-91), questions whether the federal government should spend $283 million to fund legal services. The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) is a federally funded agency designed to support legal services organizations that serve the poor. Conservative critics of LSC have charged that LSC funds are improperly used to challenge electoral redistricting plans, represent illegal aliens and drug dealers, and bring class action lawsuits against laws made by elected officials. Liberal supporters of LSC argue that LSC-funded organizations spend most of their resources representing the poor in routine legal cases such as land-lord-tenant disputes. Whatever the case may be, Wilkinson argues, there are adequate private and non-federal resources currently available to meet the legal needs of the poor. Legal service providers receiving LSC funds also receive at least $324 million from private and other public sources. Furthermore, there are an additional 1,350 providers of legal services to the needy who receive no government funding and whose budgets total over $200 million. On top of that there are 400,000 to 600,000 lawyers who perform an estimated 24,000,000 hours of pro bono work each year valued at $3.3 billion. Wilkenson concludes that if Congress is serious about balancing the budget and reducing the role of the federal government, then it may want to reconsider the next LSC budget. If LSC were abolished, there would still be at least a half billion dollars available each year for legal services for the needy. 5 pp.  CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, 202/393-2600, fax 202/393-2626.

<b>Factories Behind Bars</b>,<br>
 by Morgan Reynolds<br>
<I>Policy Report</I> No. 206, <hr>
<P>
Morgan Reynolds, NCPA Senior Fellow, calls for putting prisoners to work. Currently there are unnecessary legal restrictions keeping tens of thousands of prisoners from doing productive work behind bars. Reynolds proposes repealing the laws that restrict trade in prison-made goods. He also proposes recruiting private-sector businesses to supply jobs, once the restrictive laws are abolished. America's prison population is projected to grow to 1.6 million in the next decade. Only about half of all prisoners do any kind of work at all and most of that is part-time work on prison upkeep. According to Reynolds, it should be possible to create jobs for one of every four prisoners during the next five to ten years. If just 60 percent of prisoner earnings were allocated to compensating taxpayers, this would save about $2.4 billion annually, or slightly less than 10 percent of the cost of prison support. Reynolds points out that there is no reason why prisoners shouldn't help to pay for their own upkeep instead of having taxpayers pay for it all. Beyond taxpayer relief, productive work for prisoners would alleviate idleness in prison life, and increase the likelihood of responsible behavior upon the prisoners release. 29 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N.

<b>Reforming Public Education in Wisconsin: Moving from Bureaucracy to Accountability</b>,<br>
 by James Cibulka<br>
<I>Report</I> Vol. 9, No. 7, Wisconsin Policy Research Institute<hr>
<p>
James Cibulka, Professor and Chair of the Department of Education Policy, Planning and Administration at the University of Maryland, examines what has happened to educational reform in Wisconsin. He finds that Wisconsin's Department of Public Instruction (DPI) is still bogged down with outdated "command-and-control" principles. He points out that while private sector organizations have undergone a "management revolution" achieving much greater efficiency, DPI has not reorganized itself to promote high student performance, local initiative, and accountability for high performance at all levels. Cibulka offers recommendations for improving DPI in three general areas: 1) greater regulatory flexibility; 2) improving accountability policies; and 3) a new approach to state leadership and a state-level partnership. He concludes that a new focus on high performance can be achieved within a system with a tradition of strong local initiative. He calls for a new model for education administration that is a state-local partnership. 23 pp. CONTACT: Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, 3107 North Shepard Avenue, Milwaukee, WI  53211, 414/963-0600, fax 414/963-4230.

<b>A National Survey of Americans' Attitudes Toward Education and School Reform</b><br>

The Center for Education Reform (CER) has conducted a nationwide poll of Americans' attitudes toward education and school reform. The poll shows 70 percent of the public supports school choice options, including tax-funded scholarships to allow poor parents to send their children to private, public or parochial school of their choice. This survey confirms data released earlier this year by the Public Agenda Foundation and disputes the results of a recent National Education Association (NEA) poll which claims to show public opposition to school choice and support for a federal role in education. CER's poll asked what size the role of the federal government should play in education. 50 percent of the respondents said "minor," and 24 percent said "no role." Overall, 93 percent of the respondent said that public schools need to be improved.  9 pp. CONTACT: The Center for Education Reform, 1001 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Suite 920, Washington, DC  20036, 202/822-9000, fax 202/822-5077.

<b>1996 Georgia High School Report Card for Parents</b><br>

The Georgia Public Policy Foundation (GPPF) has released a "report card" on Georgia public schools. It provides a ranking of every school district in the state. This study attempts do the following: a) analyze the issues that GPPF thinks Georgia parents care most about; b) reduce the available statistical information to a concise and understandable form; c) isolate data from Georgia's public high schools only; and d) issue a publication that is accessible and easily comprehensible to the state's general population. The criteria that they used for ranking the schools were the Test of Achievement and Proficiency (TAP), Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) scores, the percentage of students completing a college preparatory curriculum (versus a less vigorous curriculum), dropout rates, and, the number of weapons violations per 100 students. GPPF argues that parents are entitled to know about the quality of their children's schools. For the majority of parents, assessing the quality of a school is a mystery shrouded in unfamiliar terms and endless data. GPPF says that this report should be used to open dialogues between parents, teachers, administrators, government officials, and civic organizations. 35 pp. CONTACT: Georgia Public Policy Foundation, 2900 Chamblee-Tucker Road, Building Six, Atlanta, GA 30341-4128, 770/455-7600, fax 770/455-4355.

<b>The End of Welfare: Fighting Poverty in the Civil Society</b>,<br>
 by Michael Tanner<br>
Cato Institute<hr>
<p>
Michael Tanner, Director of Health and Welfare Studies at the Cato Institute, discusses the corrosive effect of U.S. welfare policy, despite its good intentions. He points out that since the start of the War on Poverty in 1965, the federal and state governments have spent more than $5.4 trillion to end poverty. Despite the enormity of this 'investment' the result has been, primarily, more poverty. He argues that our welfare system is unfair to all. Taxpayers must pay the bill for failed programs. Society is hurt when its mediating institutions of community, church and family are increasingly pushed aside. Most of all, argues Tanner, the poor are hurt with welfare by being trapped in a system that destroys opportunity for themselves and destroys hope for their children. Welfare should be judged on its results, not its intentions. Despite the acknowledgment from all sides that the system has failed, Tanner argues, both liberals and conservatives, continue to believe that government can solve the problem of poverty. Tanner maintains that the answer to poverty does not lie with government. He argues that a new paradigm to fight poverty must be based on civil society instead of government or political society. Civil society, "while stressing self-reliance and individual initiative, would also provide a vigorous network of private, localized, nonbureaucratic charities that are far more capable than is government of helping those people who need temporary assistance." Tanner also criticizes the recent welfare reform legislation. According to him, welfare cannot be reformed, and instead, should be ended. He explains why liberal and conservative welfare reform won't work, and he elaborates on how civil society can replace welfare. This book also includes an appendix listing and describing major welfare programs. 225 pp.  CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, e-mail <a href="mailto: cato@cato.org ">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet <a href=" http://www.

<b>The Tenth Amendment: The Promise of Liberty: Strategies to Restore the Balance of Power Between the Federal and State Governments</b>
American Legislative Exchange Council<hr>
<p>
With this paper, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), has put forth strategies to restore the balance of power between the federal and state governments that is implied with the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In October of 1995, ALEC and other organizations, held a national federalism summit to look at ways to restore the Tenth Amendment. The result of the summit was four proposals which, they believe, merit further consideration. 1) Set up a mechanism to provide the people of the states, through their legislatures, the power to require Congress to reconsider laws or regulations that interfere with state authority. 2) Set up a mechanism that would allow the states to propose specific amendments to the U.S. Constitution subject to ratification by the United States Congress. 3) Set up statutory remedies and/or constitutional reforms to address the problems of conditions attached to federal spending grants, regulations and mandates. 4) Passage of a federalism act to enhance the political safeguards and give states a more effective voice in congressional deliberations. For each of these proposals ALEC recommends the following: 1) The National Government of the People Amendment, which would allow state legislatures to repeal intrusive federal legislation and regulations; 2) The States' Initiative, which would empower the People through their state legislature to ratify constitutional amendments that enjoy broad support but that Congress has failed to propose; 3) The Accountability in Government Initiative, which would end the three intrusive federal practices of regulatory mandates, unfunded mandates, and the imposition of impermissible conditions on federal spending grants; and 4) The Federalism Act, which would directly address discrete aspects of the current imbalance between the federal and state governments. 17 pp. CONTACT: American Legislative Exchange Council, 910 17th Street, N.W., 5th floor, Washington, DC  20006, 202/466-3800, fax 202/466-3801.

<b><a href="/heritage/library/categories/govern/bg1094.html">From Meany to Sweeney: Labor's Leftward Tilt</a></b>,<br>
 by Ken Weinstein and August Stofferahn<br>
<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1094, The Heritage Foundation<hr>
<P>
Ken Weinstein, Director of the Government Reform Project at The Heritage Foundation, and August Stofferahn, Research Assistant at the Government Reform Project, examine organized labor's use of compulsory membership dues to finance their leadership's political agenda. An activist labor movement was a major force in the last election, and may be the most significant new force in American politics. However, Weinstein and Stofferahn point out, much of labor's new agenda has nothing to do with workplace issues, is not generally supported among rank-and-file union members, and is outside of the mainstream of American politics. In the past few decades, organized labor has moved from a relatively centrist political force into a powerful, high-spending lobby for liberal special interests and big government. Weinstein and Stofferahn document labor's move to the left. They illustrate how organized labor has come to be dominated by government employee unions, instead of the traditional industry-based unions. Specifically, they show how the AFL-CIO have drastically departed from American Federation of Labor founder, Samuel Gompers', rule of separating labor from partisan politics. Organized labor has recently taken stances on issues that have nothing to do with collective bargaining and workplace conditions. For example, in 1995 the Director of Community Services for the AFL-CIO led a campaign to force the Boy Scouts of America to include homosexuals and atheists. Organized labor leadership has also taken stances on abortion, racial and gender preferences, welfare and the federal budget. This paper also goes into detail about the epitome of labor's leftward shift and blatant political partisanship, the National Education Association. In their conclusion, Weinstein and Stofferahn, point out that politicking and other non-collective bargaining activities cost the average union member hundreds of dollars per year in dues. They argue that unions should not finance their political activities with compulsory membership dues. The
re is judicial precedent from the 1988 Supreme Court Case <I>Communication Workers of America v. Beck</I>, that declared that union members are entitled to a refund of the portion of their dues used for purposes other than collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment. 12 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto:Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org,</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.heritage.org">http://www.heritage.org</a>.

<b>What About the Religious Left? Politics  Motivates and Bankrolls The Interfaith Alliance, Americans United Works to Keep Religion Out of Public Square</b>
<I>Organization Trends</I>, Capital Research Center<hr>
<p>
In recent years the mainstream media has thoroughly covered the "religious right," often times generously quoting those eager to bash them, and implying that their rising influence may corrupt the American political system. <I>Organization Trends</I> points out that left-leaning churches and religious leaders have been involved in American politics long before there was a Christian Coalition. This issue focuses on two groups, the Interfaith Alliance (TIA), and Americans United for the Separation of Church and State. Calling itself a "faith-based" group, TIA engages in the same activism with similar methods as the Christian Coalition. The Interfaith Alliance distributed the same type of voter guides that earned the Christian Coalition criticism for excessive religious influence. Yet, TIA's guides, which ranked liberal candidates better, caused no such outcry. This 501(c)(4) organization was started with Democratic party money, and a look at the organization's leadership and activities uncovers its position clearly within the left of the political and cultural spectrum. This issue also covers the activities of another group having to do with religion and public life, Americans United for the Separation of Church and State. TIA, a self-proclaimed "mainstream faith-based" group, is ironically allied with this group that is dedicated to eradicating the public expression of religion. In September, Americans United launched a national campaign to deter churches from distributing Christian Coalition voter guides, and warning churches that doing so could threaten their tax-exempt status. The issue concludes by observing that TIA apparently has no agenda of its own, other than bashing the Christian Coalition. TIA is most often quoted in the media as a "religious" organization denouncing the Christian Coalition. The author suggests that the liberal left only has a use for TIA because of the activism of religious conservatives. 6 pp. CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20005,

<b>The Adoption Option: Compassion that Works</b>,<br>
 by Ken Connor and Camille Godwin<br>
<I>Outside the Lines</I> No. 7, Foundation for Florida's Future<hr>
<p>
Ken Connor, Chairman of the Board of Care Net, which represents the largest network of crisis pregnancy centers in North America, and Camille Godwin, an attorney in Tallahassee, FL, promote the option of adoption in the situation of a "crisis pregnancy." They argue that adoption can be a "win-win" situation for the people affected. The child gains a loving, stable and secure home, the adopting parents win by becoming parents of the child for whom they have longed, and the biological parents obtain the relief from the burdens of an unexpected or unwanted child. Connor and Godwin say that this makes it in the public interest to encourage and facilitate the adoption process. They discuss the current adoption procedures in the State of Florida, the obstacles to adoption, and the disadvantages of foster care. Connor and Godwin put forth several legislative and public policy suggestions to improve the adoption and foster care system: streamline judicial proceedings, increase access to information about adoption, reduce the financial obstacles for prospective parents, remove race as an obstacle to adoption, promote community-based responses to adoption and foster care issues, and encourage employer-based initiatives to promote adoption. They conclude by arguing that adoption must become a priority public policy issue. 14 pp.  CONTACT: Foundation for Florida's Future, 3399 Ponce de Leon Boulevard, P.O.

<dd>The cover story of this issue, <a href="/heritage/p_review/nov96/shokraii.html">"Free at Last: Black America Signs Up for School Choice</a>," by Nina Shokraii, examines the growing support for school choice amongst African-Americans. Most black political leaders actively oppose vouchers and charter schools, yet their constituents are looking more and more to options other than decaying public schools ---which have a disasterous record of teaching black children. Shokraii, Director of Outreach Programs at the Institute for Justice, documents the school choice movements in black communities in Milwaukee and Cleveland, and charter school movements in California and Michigan. It is quite evident that standards, discipline, and parental involvement of private or charter schools are bringing more black parents to fight for schools choice. Shokraii concludes that school choice and charter schools are becoming the civil rights movement of the 1990s.

Novemember 1996<hr><p>
<dd>
A notable article in this month's issue of <I>Crisis</I> discusses the bad economics of the pastoral letter of America's Catholic bishops, <I>Economic Justice for All</I>. Michael Joyce, President and CEO of the Bradley Foundation, contrasts <I>Economic Justice for All</I> with Pope John Paul II's <I>Centesimus Annus</I>. At the core of the comparison is how the respective writings proscribe ways to help those in need. Joyce points out the bishop's pastoral has much to say about the needy, but nothing to say to them. The letter calls for "an economy that truly respects persons," and even proposes measures to be taken by government as specific as a Targeted Jobs Tax Credit Act. It calls for reforming social sytems in order to secure dignity for the needy, yet it never lists an action or task for the needy themselves. Joyce argues that <I>Centesimus Annus</I> cannot be read without a clear sense that the human person, made in the image and likeness of God, is not quite so subordinate. While the Pope acknowledges that there is a need for political, economic, social, and cultural commitment to the poor, he maintains that the decisive commitment must be made within the heart and conscience of the human person and not depend on asking government or other institution to solve the problem. 60 pp.  CONTACT: 800/852-9962.

<B>Competitive Enterprise Institute</B><HR>

<P>
In October, the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) filed a First Amendment challenge to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms' (ATF) ban on statements concerning the cardiovascular benefits of moderate drinking on alcoholic beverage labels and advertisements. A substantial body of research has shown that moderate alcohol consumption significantly reduces the risk of heart disease, the leading cause of death in adults. While these findings are now widely accepted and have been incorporated into the federal government's new edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, ATF still prohibits their inclusion on products or advertisements.
<p>
CEI had petitioned ATF in 1995 to allow such statements, and included the following suggested language: "There is significant evidence that moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages may reduce the risk of heart disease." ATF did not respond to the petition. Consumer Alert, a non-profit consumer advocacy group with an interest in the free flow of information to its members and a supporter of the CEI petition, is also a party.
<p>
CEI is relying on an extensive body of Supreme Court precedent protecting so-called commercial speech. Most recently, two Court decisions, <I>Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co.</i> and <I>44 Liquormart Inc. v. Rhode Island</I>, held that information on alcoholic beverage labels and ads is protected by the First Amendment against government restrictions.

<b>Flooding Farm Reveals Government Double Standard</b>
<p>
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is guilty of using double standards when it comes to its dealings with small farmer Roy James, according to Defenders. Mr. James's farm abuts the Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge (Tyrrell County, North Carolina). A drainage problem in the refuge causes the farm to flood. Due to the flooding, Mr. James loses at least 40% of the productivity of his farm every year, and suffers further losses from erosion and the cost of paying to have the water pumped off the land. FWS admits to causing the flooding, but simply refuses to resolve the problem.
<p>
Mr. James offered to exchange land with FWS, but FWS declined because the land "does not have significant enough wildlife values to be advantageous." So after two years of flooding, Mr. James had the U.S. Soil Conservation Service draw up specifications for a dike. He built the dike with some fill from the refuge land. Ironically, when the government's land was physically invaded, FWS took immediate action, threatening to sue Mr. James for damages. In fact, Mr. James was forced to compensate the federal government in order to avoid litigation, but has yet to receive a dime from the government for its years-long physical invasion of his land. Defenders is now representing Mr. James seeking damages on his behalf.
<p>
<b>Last Developer in Is a "Rotten Egg"</b>
<p>
A wetland designation by the Army Corps of Engineers has derailed investment-backed expectations of the owners of industrial-zoned property in Centerville, Utah, leaving a handful of property owners with no economically beneficial or productive use of their property.
<p>
The land at issue was purchased by several investors in the early 1970's. The local government zoned the area industrial and encouraged its development as an industrial park. By pooling their resources, the landowners built public roads and other infrastructure, and began to develop their individual lots. After half the lots were develop and Mr. Smith began developing his lot, the Army Corps ordered him to cease because the land, according the government, is now "wetland."
<p>
In fact, however, Mr. Smith's dry land is only wet when rain water runs off the adjacent developed parcels onto his undeveloped parcel. Now that the parcel has been declared a wetland, Mr. Smith faces the unfair reality of not being able to make any beneficial or productive us of his property.
<p>
<b>Sales Contract Canceled Due to Government Interference</b>
<p>
Anyone who still claims that wetland designations do not diminish land values should look closely at the case of <I>Robbins v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</I>. In 1976, Mrs. Robbins purchased as investment property, 34 acres in Paris, Tennessee to fund her retirement. The land is zoned commercial and lies along the main highway leading to the "Lands Between the Lakes" Park, a popular national tourist destination. Following her husband's death in 1994, Mrs. Robbins decided to sell the property. She had no problem finding a buyer, and the parties executed a sales contract. The purchaser deposited one third of the sales price in escrow to secure the purchase.
<p>
Three days later, the buyer canceled the contract because unbeknownst to Mrs. Robbins, the land is now deemed "wetland." In spite of the fact that the property is surrounded by commercial building and directly abuts a highway, the U.S. Army Corps determined that the property exhibits the characteristics of federal jurisdictional wetlands.
<p>
Mrs. Robbins has asked Defenders to seek compensation for the property on her behalf. Her just compensation claim is based on the fact that the federal wetlands delineation interfered with her contract for sale, reduced the property to nominal value, and destroyed its development potential and marketability.
<p>
<b>97% Open Space Is Not Enough</b>
<p>
Teton County, Wyoming is 97% public land, consisting of Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park and state lands. Only 3% of the county is privately owned: 1.5% is held by large ranchers and 1.5% (the only developable land in the county) is held by landowners whose families typically hold the land to subdivide for future generations.
<p>
Michael Shidner is one of those property owners. He owns 35 acres, which he planned to divide three ways. Under the latest Teton county comprehensive plan, however, Mr. Shidner will  not be able to subdivide unless he places a conservation easement over 70% of his property. In addition, he must agree to cluster the homes, since the area is considered winter habitat for endangered species.
<p>
Defenders will argue in a lawsuit that the permit conditions violate the Supreme Court's holding in <I>Dolan v. City of Tigard</I>, which requires conditions to be "roughly proportional" to the burden created by the proposed us of the property. The permit condition faced by Mr. Shidner far exceed the burden that a few homes would create in a county that is already 97% open space.

<b>Religious School Choice in Vermont</b>
<p>
On August 26, 1996, IJ filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Chittenden Town School District against the Vermont Department of Education and its commissioner. The Department had denied general state aid to the District because it was prepared to pay tuition to a religious high school among other schools its students attend. (Vermont towns that have no public high schools send all their students to whatever school, public or private, their parents choose.) The issue is whether religious schools can be included in the tuition program.
<p>
The District withdrew its preliminary injunction request and agreed not to pay tuition to the religious schools until it received a favorable ruling from the Superior Court. The Department agreed to send the aid to the District and expedited discovery in the case. The judge stated he would issue his ruling quickly after discovery and briefings were complete. IJ hopes for a declaratory judgment in the District's favor this fall.

<b>Landmark Continues Milwaukee School Choice Defense</b>
<p>
Representing State Representative Annette "Polly" Williams and low income families, Landmark Legal Foundation continues its defense of the Amended Milwaukee Parental Choice Program. The amended program allows families access to religious private schools under the nation's first school choice plan, which Landmark successfully defended in 1991 and 1992. Landmark, joined by other school choice advocates, recently filed papers asking a Wisconsin state court judge to declare the amended program constitutional. The judge likely will rule against the religious school access provision, however, and the issue is certain to be determined in the Wisconsin Supreme Court, hopefully prior to the 1997-98 school year.

<b>Landmark to Appeal Ruling on State-Created Insurance Company</b>
<p>
Landmark Legal Foundation will ask the Missouri Supreme Court to declare unconstitutional a Missouri state-subsidized insurance company. Representing Casualty Reciprocal Exchange ("CRE"), Landmark will tell the Court that the Missouri Employers Mutual Insurance Company ("MEMIC") also unfairly competes with private insurance companies and is a risk to taxpayers because of important financial reserve requirements from which it was exempted by Missouri Director of Insurance Jay Angoff, also a defendant in the lawsuit.
<p>
MEMIC, in its most recent quarterly report, disclosed that it underestimated its 1995 year-end losses and related expenses by more than $11,000,000. 
<p>
MEMIC was created in 1993 by the legislature, which provided MEMIC a $5 million taxpayer-financed loan for the company's startup capital. MEMIC also was given the authority to revenue bonds for additional capitalization -- both in direct violation of Missouri's Constitutional provisions prohibiting the use of state funds for private loans and investment.

<b><i>Adarand</i> Set for Oral Argument</b>
<p>
The landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in <I>Adarand Constructors, Inc v. Pena</I>, won by MSLF on June 12, 1995, has reached the final stage before the Colorado federal district court. The Supreme Court returned the case to Colorado after it "alter(ed) the playing field" regarding the standard to be used in reviewing race-based decision making by Congress. Overturning two earlier decisions, the Supreme Court held that the "strict scrutiny" standard applies to Congress. With the completion of briefing by both parties, the case is scheduled for oral argument on December 20.

<b>Michigan Property Owners Seek Supreme Court Review</b>
<p>
Two lake front property owners in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan have asked the Supreme Court to review a lower court holding left undisturbed by the 7-7 split of the entire U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. In <I>Stupak-Thrall, et al. v. United States of America, et al</I>., the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) denied two lake front property owners the right to use the entire surface of Crooked Lake, as Michigan law permits them. This despite the language of applicable federal law that "valid existing rights" are protected. On behalf of the property owners, who MSLF have represented since they first filed their lawsuit, MSLF sought Supreme Court review asserting that the USFS has rendered the "valid existing rights" language "meaningless" and that the federal government's use of the Property Clause to regulate private property is contrary to Supreme Court precedent.
<p>
<b>Babbitt's Park Service Goes Back to Drawing Board</b>
<p>
After MSLF's victory on behalf of commercial climbers, the National Park Service (NPS) has obtained the permission of the Wyoming federal district court to return to the drawing board to determine how it may implement President Clinton's Executive Order regarding regulating federal land for Native American religions. MSLF had obtained a preliminary injunction preventing the NPS from closing Devils Tower in northeastern Wyoming to commercial climbing. Regardless of the NPS decision, MSLF will return to court to seek damages for its client and to prevent other Establishment Clause violations within the Monument.

<b>Clinton Plan to Empty Idaho Reservoir in Jeopardy</b>
<p>
The National Marine and Fisheries Service plan to empty a reservoir in northern Idaho, ostensibly to "save" the salmon was dealt a blow in federal district court when the court requested further briefing on whether the specific statute creating the dam controlled over the general Endangered Species Act (ESA). The controversy is in Clearwater County, Idaho, where the government is seeking to drain a reservoir created by Congress for power generation, recreation, and timber transport. The government says those purposes are subservient to the command of the ESA.

<p>
<b>Local Law Enforcement Conscripted into Federal Service</b>
<p>
Named after former White House Press Secretary James Brady, the Brady Act requires a five-day waiting period for handgun purchases and background checks on gun buyers during that period to determine whether there is any legal reason to stop the sale. Theoretically, this law addresses the salutary purpose of keeping guns out of the hands of would-be robbers and murderers. But in reality, the Brady Act goes far beyond that purpose and conscripts local law enforcement officers into federal service, forcing them to compromise their local responsibilities by engaging in time-consuming, costly, and futile paper work for the federal government. What is more, no financial reimbursement is made.
<p>
Background checks under Brady go beyond felons. The law also applies to anyone who may be "otherwise prohibited by law from buying a gun." That means local sheriffs and chiefs of police must search through medical records to determine if a gun buyer has ever been committed to a mental institution or is an illegal drug user who has evaded arrest. Law enforcement officers must also check the records of fugitives, dishonorable military discharges and expatriate citizens. Civil court records must also be checked for restraining orders imposed on spouses in domestic relations cases. As if impressing local officers into federal service was not enough, the law includes an unconscionable provision that could subject them to fine or imprisonment or both for failing to make a "reasonable effort" to complete the work for the federal government.
<p>
The Brady Act's unfunded mandate was the "last straw" for Ravalli County, Montana, Sheriff Jay Printz and Graham County, Arizona, Sheriff Richard Mack, both of whom are being shut into their offices and tied to their desks to complete the background check requirement. These law enforcement officials would much rather devote their resources to protecting the citizens than doing bureaucratic paper work-of questionable efficacy-for the federal government.
<p>
Both Sheriffs Printz and Mack sued and won trial court rulings striking down that position of the Brady Act requiring background checks. In both cases, the lower courts agreed that the law illegally commandeered local officials for a federal program. However, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed those decisions ruling that the Brady law's background check requirement is constitutional and its intrusion upon state sovereignty minimal. The sheriffs' appeals are now before the U.S. Supreme Court. Pacific Legal Foundation is arguing that the federal government has no constitutional authority to force local law enforcement officers to carry out a mandate that materially impairs their ability to serve the local citizens whom they were hired to protect.
<p>
<b>Farmers Forced to Advertise Competitor's Products</b><br>
<I>Glickman v. Wileman Brothers & Elliot, Inc.</I>
<p>
According to Thomas Jefferson, "to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of ideas which he disbelieves is sinful and tyrannical." So why does Wileman Brothers & Elliot, Inc., a peach and nectarine grower in California, pay lots of hard-earned money to help pay for a generic advertising message that says its competitors' fruits are as good as its own? Because the federal government is forcing this grower to.
<p>
Government "marketing boards," which essentially are agriculture cartels made up of farmers appointed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, have vast discretionary powers and can punish farmers who don't abide by their edicts. One of the boards' dubious functions is to force farmers to subsidize generic advertisements that extol the virtues of certain commodities in general. Remember the dancing raisins, "Got Milk?" and "It's the Cheese" ads? Such campaigns were financed through mandatory fees paid by individual growers. According to <i>Forbes</i> magazine, commodity boards for agricultural products have raked in over $750 million a year from U.S. farmers through coerced contributions. (The government pays out an additional $90 million of taxpayers' money for overseas promotions.) In California, about 50 such boards collect some $125 million from growers yearly.
<p>
Where do government bureaucrats get the idea in the first place that it is their job to tell business owners how to promote their own products? Forcing producers of agricultural commodities to pay for generic commercial ads is antithetical to the principle of free market enterprise. It is also a blatant violation of the constitutional free speech right not to be forced to pay for messages with which one disagrees. This is why Pacific Legal Foundation is helping Wileman Brothers & Elliot challenge the government's mandatory fee program in the U.S. Supreme Court. Pursuant to federal regulations and marketing orders, Wileman must pay an assessment for a generic advertising program with which it disagrees. Moreover, the payments reduce Wileman's ability to pursue its own individual advertising program.
<p>
PLF argued to the U.S. Supreme Court last week to strike down the government's "marketing order" that assesses small farmers to pay for government-concocted advertising programs.

<b>Supreme Court Hears Oral Arguments in Parents' Rights Case</b>
<p>
The Supreme Court has heard oral arguments in a case that could have a considerable impact on parents' rights. In <i>M.L.B. v. S.L.J.</i>, the court will consider whether a state court can condition an appeal for the termination of parents' rights on their ability to pay court costs in excess of $2,000.00.
<p>
In the case, a Mississippi lower court terminated a mother's parental rights to her 7 and 9-year-old children. She appealed the case to the state Supreme Court but could not afford to pay the costs involved. The court refused to waive the fee and dismissed her case. The Supreme Court must now decide if parents' rights are, in fact, fundamental liberties.

<b>California's Policy Restricting Employees' Religious Expression Unconstitutional Says Ninth Circuit</b>
<p>
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that a California state agency's policy against religious advocacy and display of religious artifacts is unconstitutional. The ruling reverses the finding of the lower court.
<p>
The Rutherford Institute represented state employee Monte Tucker, who placed "By Monte Tucker, SOTLJC" in a computer screen program he designed. The acronym stands for "Servant of the Lord Jesus Christ." Tucker's supervisor threatened him with suspension if he refused to remove the acronym. The department then issued a policy forbidding religious advocacy during work hours and storage or display of any religious artifacts except n closed offices.

<b>The Rutherford Institute to File Class Action Suit Against Dept. Of Health 
and Human Services</b>
<p>
The Rutherford Institute has filed a class action lawsuit against Donna Shalala and the Department of Health and Human Services for allowing county officials to profit from depriving disabled foster children of their rightful monies.
<p>
The suit alleges that the Department of Health and Human Service has violated federal law by failing to follow the Social Security Act's mandates to ensure that foster children receive their rightful benefits. This policy has in essence encouraged Contra Costa County to prevent handicapped children from being adopted in order to keep funds intended for foster children. The suit claims that he violations occurring in Contra Costa County are indicative of foster care in other counties nationwide.

<b>Commercial Free Speech Defended</b>
<p>
In <I>AAA v. Kessler</I>, a lawsuit brought by a consortium of advertising groups challenging the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) regulations of tobacco advertising, WLF filed a brief arguing that the regulations imposed by FDA violated the First Amendment rights of advertisers and the adult public. FDA's regulations, announced on August 28, 1996, and set to begin taking effect in early 1997, impose sweeping restrictions on tobacco advertising, including: (1) requiring black and white, text-only advertisements in all media, i.e., billboards, print media, point of purchase, and direct mail, except on those locations or print media that are "adult-only;" (2) prohibiting billboards within 1000 feet of schools or play areas, effectively eliminating all billboards in urban areas; and (3) banning the use of any tobacco brand name in sponsoring any cultural, sporting, or musical event, and on all types of secondary product, such as t-shirts, umbrellas, lighters, etc. WLF argued that the regulations are unlawful because the government has available to it several obvious and non-speech related methods to attack the problem of youth smoking. Moreover, even if some restrictions on advertising could be lawful, the broad and sweeping restrictions imposed by FDA are not "narrowly tailored" to the harm they were intended to address and would primarily restrict the free speech rights of adults. FDA cannot properly, for example, ban the use of tobacco brand names to sponsor all sporting or cultural events when many of these events have minimal, if any, children in attendance. WLF's clients on the brief include race car drivers, Mario Andretti, Don Garlits, Al Unser, Rusty Wallace, and Cale Yarborough, U.S. Representatives Richard Burr, Cass Ballenger, Howard Coble, and David Funderburk, and U.S. Senator Lauch Faircloth.
<p>
<b>Excessive Antitrust Penalty Challenged</b>
<p>
WLF filed a brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit arguing that a $10 million fine imposed on a family-owned bakery company that kept its bread prices below the national average during the relevant period should be set aside as grossly excessive and unlawful. In <i>United States v. Mrs. Baird's Bakeries</i>, the evidence was undisputed that, during the time of the alleged pricing conspiracy, Mrs. Baird's bakery held prices steady and, indeed, even reduced its prices on several occasions. Despite this, Texas federal Judge Jerry Buchmeyer imposed the maximum statutory fine, one of the largest antitrust fines in U.S. history. Mrs. Baird's is now in bankruptcy. In its brief, WLF argued that there was little evidence of price fixing, and that the district court misapplied the Sentencing Guidelines in imposing the maximum fine.
<p>
<b>Objection to HUD's Rulemaking</b>
<p>
WLF filed formal comments with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) requesting that HUD immediately rescind an interim rule that would abolish the right of respondents in fair housing complaint proceedings to obtain discovery from witnesses and the complaining party. The interim rule is procedurally and substantively defective on a number of grounds. HUD flagrantly violated the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) and its own policy by not publishing the interim rule as a proposed rule for public comment. WLF also took strong objection to HUD's primary rationale for abolishing rights of respondents, namely that it would expedite the investigation process. WLF research discovered that the main cause of delay is <i>agency</i> inefficiency; it takes HUD, on average, 53 days from the time a housing complaint is filed until HUD even <i>begins</i> an investigation.

<b><i>Consumer Product Safety Commision Monitor</i> Launched by Consumer Alert </b>
<p>
Consumer Alert has launched a new publication called <i>CPSC Monitor</i>. It is a series of fax newsletters covering the activities of the Consumer Product Safety Commision (CPSC). The purpose of the series is to educate the public about CPSC actions that negatively impact consumers. With this publication, Consumer Alert hopes to scrutinize CPSC which has greatly expanded its original mission under the Clinton Administration. CPSC has deviated from its original mission with more recalls that have needlessly scared consumers and increased the cost of consumer products.

<b>Lecture Series to Examine the Impact of Religious Conviction on Politics</b>
<p>

The Foreign Policy Institute, Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) and the Ethics and Public Policy Center will sponsor a lecture series to examine "The Impact of Religious Conviction on the Politics of the 21st Century." All lectures will be held at SAISin Washington. The purpose of the series is to assess evidence of a worldwide resurgence in religious belief and to reflect on the implications of such a development at the end of the current millennium. Specifically, the project will address the following questions: What are the origins of the revival of religious fervor at the end of the 20th Century? How far and how long will this revival go? What are the chief elements of the critique of the secular order mounted by the various religions and ethical traditions enjoying a resurgence of popularity? To what degree are the religion-based critques rooted in common assumptions and compatible responses to the perceived shortcomings of secularity? What are the implications of this phenomenon particularly as they relate to international politics: prospects of war and peace, economic development, and the definition of human rights and social justice?

<TITLE>Third Wave of Think Tanks -- October 1996 Insider - Heritage</TITLE>
<center><img src="/heritage/thf_log2.gif"><br><p>
<h3>October, 1996 <i>Insider</i></h3></center> 



<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Third Wave of Think Tanks<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER><HR>


<P>
<dd> Tip O'Neill once said &quot;All politics is local.&quot; He was
correct, but failed to mention an important corollary, that all
policy is local too. That's why we have formed the Allegheny Institute
for Public Policy -- the nation's first think tank devoted exclusively
to bringing free market solutions to local government.
<P>
<dd> Market oriented think tanks have come in three distinct waves.
In the 1970s, they began operating in Washington and laying the
intellectual groundwork for the Reagan revolution. In the 1980s,
in keeping with Reagan's revived spirit of federalism, conservative-movement
dollars and energies started working in the states as well. Intellectual
capital was &quot;block granted,&quot; as a number of entrepreneurial
policy analysts left Washington to found the second wave of policy
research groups. These state-based think tanks went on to provide
the intellectual infrastructure for the reinvention of state governments
in places like Tommy Thompson's Wisconsin, Tom Ridge's Pennsylvania,
Bill Weld's Massachusetts, and John Engler's Michigan. These groups
put welfare reform, charter schools and school choice on the public
policy map.
<P>
<dd> The time has come for a third wave -- the formation of locally-oriented
think tanks.  As dollars devolve from Washington to local governments,
taxpayer accountability should devolve as well. It would be ironic
if at the same time sound economic principles are revived in Washington,
that government programs might avoid accountability to these principles
by escaping to local bureaucracies still mired in the 1960s model
of big government.
<P>
<dd> Even before the devolution revolution, more dollars were spent
by local governments than by states or the federal government.
As devolution progresses this will become more true. Even federal
and state programs are frequently administered by local governments,
or by local subdivisions. Domestic government programs are ultimately
applied at the local level.
<P>
<dd> Although the Allegheny Institute is the first of this third wave
of local policy advocacy, it is unlikely to be the last. After
less than one year in business, we were approached by a group
from California interested in forming a similar organization modeled
after the Allegheny Institute. Due to the hard work of founder
Don Blake and others, and a little guidance from us, California
now has the benefit of the Table Mountain Institute near Sacramento.
Requests for help in starting local think tanks have come from
other places even farther away than Sacramento-Nigeria and Italy
for example. In addition we have received requests for advice
from several state think tanks that wish to start local policy
projects in their home states. Furthermore, our ideas have been
cited by all three local network television affiliates, all the
local radio news outlets and talk shows, and the local newspapers,
as well as the CBS radio network, and national newspapers such
as <I>USA Today</I> and the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>.
<P>
 <dd>Why all the attention? It has come largely because of our close
involvement in the restructuring of the government of Pittsburgh's
Allegheny County. This county, the second largest local government
between New York and Chicago, was under the rule of liberals for
over 60 years. In the last election, two conservatives won on
a privatization and deregulation platform. The crown jewel of
their platform was a 20% tax cut their first day in office.
<P>
<dd> The only way to make large tax cuts that work is to force the
bureaucracy to compete with the private sector to see who can
achieve the most efficient service delivery. This form of privatization
is sometimes called managed competition. Drawing upon research
by the Reason Foundation, we have published extensive research
on the benefits of privatization. In fact, there are over a dozen
privatization initiatives being implemented right now in Allegheny
County, including the only privatization of a property-assessments
department in the country and the first full privatization (sale)
of an airport in U.S. history.
<P>
 <dd>It's not just about privatization, but about harnessing markets
in other ways. We are engaged in the creation of a pilot program
for electricity de-regulation. We estimate that a full-scale electric
utility consumer choice program could add 5 or 6% to the regional
domestic product. In addition, we are working with the county
economic development department to quantify the amount of burden
placed on the economy by local government, with a view toward
a streamlined business-friendly permitting process.
<P>
 <dd>It's not just about markets either, it's also about culture.
Working with Robert Woodson of the National Center for Neighborhood
Enterprise we are helping to shift social service programs from
the political society to the civil society, to remove a permissive,
redistributive, liberal, social-service bureaucracy and replace
it with a flexible, results-oriented, low-cost provider network.
<P>
 <dd>Less a &quot;think tank&quot; and more a &quot;do tank,&quot;
the Allegheny Institute is taking the conservative intellectual
revolution to the laboratory of real life. Not satisfied with
having produced 30 full-length reports (and 40 editions of our
Newsfax) in our first year and a half of operations, the Allegheny
Institute has set out to prove not only that &quot;ideas have
consequences,&quot; but that <I>conservative</I> ideas actually
work at the local level.

<P>
Heritage Policy Analyst John Sweeney argues that since Mexico's
economic meltdown in 1994, both the Clinton Administration and
the 104th Congress have allowed America's once-respected leadership
role in Latin America to erode. The Administration and the Congress
have been reluctant to put expansion of NAFTA on the fast track
and instead have allowed the tremendous foreign policy successes
of the Reagan and Bush administrations to fall apart. If this
retreat is allowed to continue, writes Sweeney, U.S. economic
and security interests in the region could suffer a &quot;sustained
decline.&quot; 15 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage

by Joshua Muravchik

<I>On the Issues</I>, American Enterprise Institute<HR>

<P>
Joshua Muravchik, Resident Scholar at the American Enterprise
Institute, argues that the Clinton Administration's foreign policy
is misguided and that this has lead to the erosion of American
military supremacy. According to Muravchik, Clinton's foreign
policy has been a &quot;jumble of improvised responses to crises
and to foreign and domestic political pressures and calculations
of electoral advantage.&quot; The author writes that Clinton nearly
doubled his proposed defense cuts so he could appear to look like
he is reducing the budget deficit, while not having to reduce
domestic spending. A symbol of Clinton's low priority given to
defense is his order for sharp reductions in the development of
strategic defenses. Muravchik also argues that Clinton's policy
with China, North Korea, Serbia, and Somalia, have substantially
hurt America's credibility abroad. Overall, Muravchik concludes,
Clinton's tenure as Commander and Chief has narrowed the wide
margin of security that came about with the demise of America's
Cold War rival. 4 pp. CONTACT: American Enterprise Institute,

<B>The World Bank's Procurement Myth, <BR>
</B>by John Thibodeau
<P>
<I>Foreign Policy Briefing</I> No. 43, Cato Institute<HR>

<P>
John Thibodeau, Director of Research at Probe International, a
Canadian environmental group, reports that the World Bank's soft-loan
window, the International Development Association (IDA), is losing
many contributions due to its failed projects and the bank's increasingly
risky loan portfolio. The United States recently decided not to
contribute any new money to IDA in 1997, with any future funding
beyond that uncertain. Thibodeau argues that the World Bank has
launched a misleading public relations campaign to convince Congress
and the American public that U.S. taxpayers' contributions to
IDA are beneficial to the American economy. The World bank says
that such contributions are returned in the form of contracts
for U.S. companies. In reality, Thibodeau points out, U.S. firms
receive only about $0.23 in contracts for each $1.00 the United
States contributes to IDA. The IDA gets billions of taxpayer dollars
for bad projects and pork-barrel contracts for a few American
firms. Thibodeau concludes that Congress and lawmakers from other
donor countries should see through the World Bank's desperate
attempt to seek more funds and refuse to waste their constituent's
tax dollars on IDA in 1997 and beyond. 17 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute,

<B>The Innovation Age: A New Perspective on the Telecom Revolution,
</B><br>
by Peter Pitsch
<P>
Hudson Institute<HR>

<P>
Peter Pitsch, Adjunct Fellow at the Hudson Institute, and the
former Chief of Staff and Chief of Planning at the Federal Communications
Commission, shows why the United States cannot maintain its preeminent
position in information technology unless it reforms a number
of outdated regulatory restraints. Pitsch shows how artificial
regulations on a market, such as telecommunications, stifles the
progress and productivity that innovations were designed to stimulate.
Pitsch illustrates the superiority of a market-based approach
to regulation, and uses the theories of Austrian school economists
Hayek and Schumpeter to point out the flaws of planned economies.
Overall, Pitsch creates a positive image of what the future can
hold with an open-road policy toward the telecom industry. 120

<B>Lights Out on Federal Power: Privatization for the 21st Century,
</B><br>
by Michael Block and Rep. John Shadegg
<P>
<I>Future Insight</I>, Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation<HR>

<P>
Michael Block, Senior Fellow at the Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation,
and John Shadegg, United States Congressman from Arizona, urge
the privatization of federally owned power facilities. Power Marketing
Administrations (PMAs) were created during the New Deal to provide
a supply of inexpensive power to impoverished rural areas. Block
and Shadegg argue that demographic changes since the 1930s mean
that many of the areas deemed in need of subsidized power are
no longer rural or undeveloped. They argue that PMAs force taxpayers
to provide subsidized power to the rich, and they distort and
hinder competition and productivity in the electric energy market.
Block and Shadegg outline how the federal government should sell
three PMAs. Selling off this large source of frozen assets would
generate nearly $4.5 billion, and help reduce the budget deficit.
Finally, to overcome interest-group oppostion to PMA privatization,
they propose that the current consumers of PMA power be given

<I>Regulatory Reform Project</I>, <BR>
Competitive Enterprise Institute<HR>

<P>
Clyde Wayne Crews, CEI Fellow in Regulatory Studies, illustrates
that compliance with federal regulations, which are officially
off-budget, have quietly expanded into costs greater than the
entire GNP of Canada. According to Crews, regulatory costs absorb
almost 20% of the average family's after-tax budget. Politicians
can avoid accountability for more expenses to taxpayers by passing
mandates and regulations that transfer costs to business and consumers
and are not reflected in the budget. Crews warns that a Balance
Budget Amendment may pressure Congress to push even further regulations
that put costs off-budget. He calls for Congress to establish
rules that new agency regulations require Congressional approval,
and to establish a limited regulatory budget. Overall, Crews calls
for making regulatory costs as transparent as direct taxes, and
ensuring that Congress bears direct accountability for every dollar
that agency regulations cost voters. 23 pp. CONTACT: Competitive

<B>A Revolution in Regulation: New York Must Treat Employers as
Customers to Compete for the Growth and Jobs We Need</B>
<P>
Public Policy Institute of New York State<HR>

<P>
New York's regulatory bureaucracy is a primary reason that the
state has an image of being hostile to business-and a record of
losing jobs to other locations. In addition to the hassle of overwhelming
amounts of red tape, these regulations can hurt or even shut down
businesses by imposing prohibitive fees, fines and taxes. Employers
must be treated as customers if New York is to compete for the
jobs and growth it needs, according to the Public Policy Institute.
The Institute recommends several steps to achieve regulatory reform,
arguing that key draft regulations should be rewritten before
they become additional burdens to companies. Also, needless regulatory
costs imposed by the Labor Department and the workers' compensation
system should be eliminated. Overall, the report recommends the
laws that limit the powers and responsibilities of regulators
should be enforced, and innovative use of new technologies to
achieve regulatory goals should be allowed to happen. 67 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Regulatory Costs in Profile, </B><br>

<P>
<I>Policy Study</I> No. 132, Center for the Study of <BR>
American Business<HR>

<P>
Thomas Hopkins, Adjunct Fellow at the Center for the Study of
American Business, illustrates the vast extent of regulatory costs
in virtually every segment of the U.S. economy. 60 different federal
agencies enact and enforce countless regulations that result in
hidden compliance costs of $668 billion annually. In this book,
Hopkins presents estimates of annual private-sector compliance
costs with federal regulation for 1977 through 2000, and focuses
on the differences in compliance costs among firms. The figures
show that regulatory compliance costs facing all U.S. businesses
rose by $10 billion or more annually in the four years ending
in 1992 after a decade in which such costs generally moved downward.
With the figures presented in this book, Hopkins hopes to bring
a better understanding of the scope and incidence of compliance
costs to help facilitate a more rational debate about the role
and effects of government agency regulations. 25 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Capital Versus Labor? The Dubious Economics of Class Conflict,

<P>
<I>Hudson Briefing Paper</I>, No. 195, Hudson Institute<HR>

<P>
Alan Reynolds, Director of Economic Research at Hudson Institute,
responds to the recent mood of hostility toward investors, property
owners, and corporate managers in recent press commentary on the
U.S. economy. Such hostility, according to Reynolds, seems to
be an encouragement toward class warfare between &quot;workers&quot;
and &quot;shareholders.&quot; He argues that the data contradicts
the assertions that workers and shareholders are  natural adversaries.
He points out that workers benefit only when productivity increases,
and that productivity depends on capital investment, which depends
on saving. It is punitive tax policies that explain the recent
sluggish productivity growth that has brought stagnation in employee
wages and compensation. Overall, Reynolds argues, the economy
needs more, not less capital, and the only way to end the stagnation
of employee wages is to decrease punitive tax rates against saving
and investing. 9 pp.  CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center,

<B>An Analysis of the Dole-Kemp Tax Cuts, <BR>
</B>by Gary Robbins and Aldona Robbins
<P>
<I>Issue Brief</I>, Institute for Policy Innovation<HR>

<P>
Gary Robbins and Aldona Robbins, Senior Research Fellows at the
Institute for Policy Innovation, examine the proposed Dole-Kemp
tax cuts. Their analysis finds that the Dole-Kemp plan would boost
the U.S. real growth rate by roughly one-half a percentage point
over the next six years. They scored the proposed tax plan using
both static and dynamic methods. After adjusting for greater incentives
to work, save and invest, the economy, according to Robbins and
Robbins, would be 4.5 percent larger than it would have been without
the tax cuts, and would produce about 2.8 million new jobs. The
growth would offset 35 percent of the $551.3 billion static revenue
loss between 1997 and 2002. A standard distributional analysis
shows that 60 percent of the Dole-Kemp tax cuts would go to taxpayers
earning under $100,000. They also found that although the people
with the lowest 20 percent of incomes pay less than one percent
of federal income taxes, they would receive the greatest percentage
boost of after tax income in higher wages. 16 pp.  CONTACT: The

In 1988, the Washington Research Council made a systematic review
of Washington's state taxes, and found the tax system to be fundamentally
sound. Since then, however, there have been a number of changes
in tax rates and bases. This paper, updates WRC's review of the
state tax system using five criteria: economic neutrality, fairness,
administrative simplicity, transparency, and stability. The report
 also provides a history of Washington's state taxes, including
a list of major tax events from 1889 to the present to show how
the state's tax structure has changed over the years. 20 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Public Subsidies, Private Gain: Stop Violating the Oregon Constitution,
</B><br>
by Professor Dale Rubin
<P>
<I>Fiscal Insight</I>, No. 13, Cascade Policy Institute<HR>

<P>
Dale Rubin, Professor of Law at Willamette University, examines
how public subsidies lead to private gain, and how this procedure
violates the Oregon Constitution. He points out that legislators
explain that public expenditures that directly benefit private
individuals, such as professional sports teams, are legal because
they are extended for a &quot;public purpose.&quot; Rubin argues
that this response is simply wrong. He explains that the Public
Purpose Doctrine was not made in order to provide legislators
an excuse to spend taxpayer dollars on whatever project they choose.
In fact, the Oregon Constitution contains clear and unambiguous
clauses that explicitly prohibit the legislature and political
subdivisions from giving any aid to private individuals or corporations.
Rubin argues that the courts' misuse of the Public Purpose Doctrine
has made it possible for public entities to spend public dollars
on almost any private project despite a specific constitutional
prohibition. Rubin argues that the constitutional provisions prohibiting
the commingling of public and private funds have been rendered
meaningless by modern court decisions. 11 pp.  CONTACT: Cascade

<B>The Prisoners of Charity: Welfare 'Reforms' in New York Have Done Little to Break the Cycle of Dependency</B>
<P>
Public Policy Institute of New York State<HR>

<P>
The Public Policy Institute finds that welfare reforms in New
York have done too little to break the cycle of dependency of
its recipients. After Congress enacted legislation in 1988 intended
to move welfare recipients into the workforce, New York took an
expensive detour to implement legislation that emphasized &quot;back-to-school&quot;
rather than &quot;back-to-work.&quot; These programs were a failure
and caused the percentage of welfare recipients in the job market
to actually drop. The Public Policy Institute argues that in order
for any welfare-to-work strategy to be successful it, must incorporate
programs that make work pay. They also argue that private sector
jobs need to be made to look more attractive compared to welfare
benefits. While raising the minimum wage reduces the number of
entry level jobs, lowering welfare benefits could send more people
into the shelter system-at a greater cost financially and personally.
Instead, the Institute suggests a &quot;fill-in-the-gap&quot;
approach that allows more wages to be kept before welfare benefits
are reduced. They conclude that overall successful reforms will
begin when it is acknowledged that the poor want to, and can,
take responsibility for their future. The report includes a foreword
by United States Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 47 pp. CONTACT:

During the Spring of 1996, the Goldwater Institute conducted its
second annual Charter School Survey. The first survey was directed
at parents. The latest survey was aimed at charter school teachers.
Arizona is home to approximately 30 percent of the nation's 350
charter schools. Approximately 16,000 students will attend such
a school during the 1996-97 school year. The results of this survey
tell a great deal about these charter schools, including teachers,
school and classroom configurations, teaching methods, parental
involvement, and students receiving instruction. Additionally,
the survey describes why educators are choosing to teach in charter
schools and offers a glimpse of charter school organization and
school development. 40 pp. CONTACT: Goldwater Institute, Bank

<B>Competition, Choice, and the Structure of Public Education</B>
<P>
<I>Dialogue</I> No. 16, Pioneer Institute<HR>

<P>
This paper is the transcript of a forum sponsored by the Pioneer
Institute on the state and direction of the Boston Public School
System. The forum included these four panelists: James Peyser,
Executive Director of the Pioneer Institute, and member of the
State Board of Education; Neil Sullivan, Executive Director of
the Boston Private Industry Council; Kristen McCormack, charter
school founder and former head of Federated Dorchester Neighborhood
Houses; and Edwin Melendez, Member of the Boston School Committee,
and Director of the Mauricio Gaston Institute at the University
of Massachusetts/Boston. In the opening remarks given by James
Peyser, the failure of school reform is blamed on the underlying
structural defect of public schools-the monopoly power of school
districts. He also argues that spending priorities have been out
of line. While real per-pupil spending has rise by 53 percent
from 1967 to 1991, only 4 percent of it went to regular education-the
core of schools. He argues that public school education priorities
have been driven by politics rather than the needs of the students,
the desires of parents, or the strategies of educators. Peyser
lays out a plan for structural reform of the Boston Public School
System in which there will be a system of schools, rather than
a unitary school system, that will place parents, students and
educators at the center, and will end the political and bureaucratic
constraints that have made past reform efforts fail. 11 pp. CONTACT:

in School,</a> </B><br>
by Dorothy Hanks
<P>
<I>F.Y.I.</I> No. 120, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
Dorothy Hanks, Research Assistant at The Heritage Foundation,
examines how the Milwaukee School Choice Program, enacted in 1990,
has helped poor children succeed in school. Milwaukee's program
was the nation's first publicly funded school choice program,
and gave low-income parents vouchers to send their children to
private schools. Hanks relays the findings of a recent assessment
of the program by Professors Jay P. Greene of the University of
Houston Center for Public Policy, and Paul E. Petersen of Harvard
University's Program in Education Policy and Governance. Their
study reveals that the reading scores of choice students were
3 to 5 percentile points higher in their third and fourth years,
respectively, than those of comparable low-income public school
students. On math scores, Greene and Petersen found that choice
students were 5 and 12 percentile point higher for the third and
fourth years respectively. Hanks explains, in detail, how the
study was performed, and how it corrected the methodological errors
of previous studies on the subject of school choice. She also
lists a number of other bodies of research that back up the Houston-Harvard
analysis on the value of private schools among urban poor and
minority students. In the conclusion, Hanks emphasizes that the
success of Milwaukee school choice is now a matter of record,
and that it is time for state legislators and members of Congress
to allow low-income children to escape the failing urban public
schools. 5 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation,

Despite the presence of serious flaws in current environmental
laws, conservatives have failed to develop a coherent vision of
how these laws ought to be reformed, writes John Shanahan, Environmental
Policy Analyst at the Heritage Foundation. Instead, the debate
about reform usually results in conservatives being falsely characterized
as &quot;anti-environmental.&quot; Shanahan offers an examination
of how conservative critics of our existing environmental policy
can better emphasize the good intentions of present law, and at
the same time, argue for elimination of the sometimes senseless
and oppressive regulations that burden the economy. He shows how
liberal policies have brought little in return for exorbinant
costs, and calls for tapping into the powerful forces and positive
incentives of the market and property ownership-incentives that
reward responsible behavior. Shanahan concludes that Americans
can protect the environment more effectively while simultaneously
increasing economic freedom and growth. 11 pp.  CONTACT: Chris

The issue of term limits will be on fifteen different state ballots

Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute, argues that term limits are
needed, but, that the only way to achieve them is by a constitutional
amendment. Since Congres is unlikely to voluntarily approve one,
Term-limits supporters need to convince 34 states to call for
a convention to draft an appropriate amendment. Bandow believes
that if the states call for a convention that it would encourage
Congress to propose an amendment, in the same way that the Seventeenth
amendment came about.  16 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts

Barry Maley, Director of the <I>Taking Children Seriously </I>program

change makes marriage less necessary and easier to end. In this
paper, Maley looks at ways to give marriage greater legal support
without creating undue obstacles to divorce. He advocates introducing
fault into divorce settlements as a way to indirectly re-enforce
the institution. &quot;Fault&quot; in divorce proceedings is where
one party-for reasons such as violence, substance abuse or child
neglect-is at fault in the marriage and that this should therefore
be taken into account in a divorce settlement. Maley concludes
that this reform would create clear standards of marital conduct
and give incentives for standards to be observed. 32 pp. CONTACT:

Cindy Silver, a lawyer in Vancouver, British Columbia, examines
family autonomy and the Canadian Charter of Rights. She observes
that a radical restructuring of the roles and relationships of
the family and state has developed. The state is taking an evermore
active role in protecting child rights as defined under the United
Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Silver discusses
the impact on the family of state attempts to both define and
protect &quot;the best interests of the child.&quot; She reviews
certain recent cases that deal with the state superseding parental
rights over a child, and calls for affirming the importance of
the family by, once again, giving explicit recognition within
the Canadian constitution. Finally, she lauds a recent Canadian
Supreme Court decision that renewed recognition of the family
and provided a much-needed balance to the administrative and judicial
polices of the state in cases involving the parent-child relationship.

<B>Settlement Reached on <BR>
Behalf of VCU Professors</B>
<P>
CIR represented six male professors who sued Virginia Commonwealth
University for sex discrimination arising from a 1992 &quot;women-only&quot;
pay raise. After the trial judge granted VCU summary judgment
on the basis of a regression analysis that purported to show a
pay imbalance between the sexes, the full Fourth Circuit Court
of Appeals reversed. The <I>en banc</I> court said that a question
existed as to whether the regression analysis actually established
a pay imbalance and remanded the case for trial.
<P>
The day before the September 23 trial date, the parties negotiated
a settlement. VCU promised not to adjust pay in the future without
considering merit, but demanded that the financial details of
the settlement remain confidential. The professors stated that
they were very satisfied with the terms of the settlement.
<P>
<B>CIR Represents Class Objecting <BR>
to Proposed Settlement</B>
<P>
In September, a class of non-black Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms (BATF) agents moved to intervene in <I>Stewart v.
Rubin</I>. The initial case was filed as a class action lawsuit
in 1990 on behalf of all African-American Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms agents. The plaintiffs charged the BATF's Office
of Criminal Enforcement with discrimination against African-American
agents in its hiring and promotion practices. The parties reached
a proposed settlement that received the preliminary approval of
District Court Judge Royce Lamberth on July 9, 1996.
<P>
Under the proposed settlement, the class of African-American agents
will receive a multi-million dollar cash settlement. Further,
African-American agents will be eligible for promotion pursuant
to an informal procedure that will be distinctly different from,
and far less rigorous, than that applicable to all other agents.
<P>
CIR, on behalf of non-black BATF agents, is challenging the race-conscience
relief provided for in the proposed settlement on the ground that
it is unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment. Specifically,
there is  no evidence of present effects of past discrimination
and the remedy is not narrowly tailored to meet a compelling government
interest.

<B>Due Process Due Private Contractors</B>
<P>
The United States Supreme Court has been asked to hear a due process
case, in which the Department of Defense (DOD) arbitrarily canceled
a lucrative contract for default, without holding a hearing mandated
by federal law.
<P>
In <I>DCX v. William J. Perry, Secretary of Defense</I>, a defense
contractor was hired to manufacture lighting equipment for the
government, and had hired a subcontractor (the only subcontractor
with the necessary technology) to test the equipment. However,
the government intervened in the testing schedule and forced the
subcontractor to test other systems with a higher priority. The
delay resulted in DCX being in default on contract. DOD then abruptly
canceled the contract.
<P>
In taking that action, DOD did not follow its own regulations
requiring it to assess the circumstances and determine whether
the default was excusable. Under the government's own regulations,
the assessment must be made prior to terminating a contract. DCX
sued, alleging that by not applying the regulations, DOD violated
DCX's due process rights. Had a hearing been held, DCX would have
shown: 1) the government was responsible for the delay; 2) DCX
would still be able to meet the contract delivery date; and 3)
termination of the contract would bankrupt several small businesses
that subcontracted with DCX. The federal trial and appellate courts
held for the government, and DCX has now petitioned the Supreme
Court to review the case.
<P>
In its <I>amicus curiae</I>, Defenders urged the Court to review
the case on the ground that under the Due Process Clause of the
Fifth Amendment, government must act fairly when it deprives a
person of property, which in this case consists of contract rights.
<P>
<B>State Corners Market By Infringing Private Property Rights</B>
<P>
Defenders is co-counsel to Mr. Taylor who owns property surrounded
by the Cass Scenic Railroad in Pocahontas County, West Virginia.
Mr. Taylor decided to build a restaurant and souvenir shop to
service the hundreds of tourists to the Railroad. At present,
the only concession stand in the park is operated by the state.
Fearful of the competition from Mr. Taylor's proposed shop, the
state decided to simply block the only access to the property
across the state land. On the day construction was to begin, the
state locked the gate to the public access road, and has refused
to allow Mr. Taylor entry onto <I>his own property</I>. Since
then, the state has proceeded to take any action it desires on
the property without the consent of the owner, including removing
trees and altering its elevation.
<P>
Defenders plans to file a lawsuit in federal district court in
West Virginia, alleging the state: 1) unconstitutionally deprived
Mr. Taylor of his right to use and enjoy his private property
in violation of the United States and West Virginia constitutions;
2) tortuously interfered with Mr. Taylor's economic advantage
by preventing him from establishing his business; and 3) unlawfully
trespassed on private property.

<B>Report on School Choice Cases</B>
<P>
Ohio - The parties are briefing the case in the Court of Appeals.
The IJ brief is due on October 29th. Jeanne Allen of the Center
for Education Reform has agreed to coordinate an <I>amicus</I>
brief on behalf of pro-school choice groups. IJ expects oral argument
later this fall, and a decision most likely in the spring.
<P>
Milwaukee - IJ is briefing the non-religion state constitutional
issues in trial court, with a resolution expected later this fall.
 The court granted the NAACP's motion to consolidate its lawsuit,
which it filed in August, with the ongoing cases. The NAACP repeats
the same allegations, but adds a racial segregation claim. The
court will hold that issue until resolution of the current issues,
and we expect appeals to follow the next ruling rather than awaiting
resolution of the segregation claims.  The IJ's goal is to move
the litigation along swiftly, winning on as many issues as possible
at this level.  So far, the NAACP's efforts to derail the case
have not succeeded.
<P>
Vermont - As expected, the ACLU joined the lawsuit challenging
Chittenden's decision to pay tuition at religious schools. At
a status conference on October 1, the trial judge ordered the
state not to withhold education aid from Chittenden, and directed
Chittenden not to pay religious school tuition pending a ruling
on its merits. The court directed the parties to stipulate the
facts, and indicated it would expedite the case and render a decision
later this fall. That means the case should be in the Vermont
Supreme Court this winter, and possibly in the U.S. Supreme Court
as early as next year.

<P>
<B>NELF Enters Declaratory Jurisdiction Dispute</B>
<P>
NELF has entered a case which threatens to undercut the usefulness
of the federal declaratory judgment law. A declaratory judgment
is a method of obtaining judicial determination of rights and
wrongs before a matter has reached the stage of ordinary litigation.
Businesses often use this procedure to eliminate uncertainty.
<P>
The case involves a looming patent dispute between EMC Corporation
and Norand Company. Norand sent EMC a letter claiming EMC was
infringing its patents and suggesting EMC pay it millions in licensing
fees. Negotiations broke down and EMC filed suit in Boston seeking
a declaratory judgment that there was no infringement. A district
court judge found that the dispute was not sufficiently ripe to
confer jurisdiction. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit, which hears patent-related appeals, affirmed, but on
different grounds. It found jurisdiction but held that trial judges
have almost total discretion to decide whether to hear declaratory
actions, even when statutory jurisdiction is conceded.
<P>
NELF filed an <I>amicus</I> brief in its own name supporting rehearing
which argued that declaratory actions are a valuable way to remove
uncertainty. By giving judges broad discretion not to hear such
cases, the court undercut that process and may have introduced
subjectivity into the judicial process. Judges can now avoid types
of cases they do not want to hear and, may choose to hear cases
which interest them and for which they may have preconceived views.
This conflicts with the ideal of a neutral, objective judiciary.
While rehearing has been denied, NELF is supporting EMC in seeking
review by the U.S. Supreme Court.
<P>
<B>NELF Files Brief in Connecticut <BR>
Property Tax Case</B>
<P>
On behalf of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association,
NELF has filed a brief in a test of whether that state's courts
will continue independent reviews of appeals from local tax authorities.
The case involves Hartford's taxation of copiers owned by Xerox
Company. The assessor used &quot;book&quot; value as the basis
for taxing the copiers, rejecting Xerox's evidence as to their
true market value, the statutory basis for local taxation. A Superior
Court judge affirmed the city's decision.
<P>
NELF's <I>amicus</I> brief to the Connecticut Supreme Court argued
that the judge erred by looking only to whether the assessor's
decision was &quot;reasonable.&quot; NELF argued that, because
of the inherent conflict between assessors' duties to apply the
law and to maximize tax revenues, courts can and must independently
determine all necessary issues including determinations of value.
Ceding that power to assessors could leave taxpayers vulnerable
to arbitrary and even malicious misassessments.
<P>
<B>NELF Defeats Effort to Tax Non-Profit <BR>
Legal Groups</B>
<P>
In a case with ramifications for all non-profit firms, NELF has
defeated the City of Boston's effort to levy taxes upon NELF's
Boston office. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled
that Boston violated state law when it denied NELF the tax exemption
statutorily allowed to all non-profit organizations.
<P>
The case began in 1991 when Boston reject NELF's first application
for exemption for its Boston office. Possibly referring to NELF's
successful challenge to a Boston ordinance, a city bureaucrat
sneered that the city would not &quot;feed the hand that bites
it.&quot; NELF appealed to the Appellate Tax Board and eventually
went to Superior Court. The city's position throughout was that
NELF was &quot;too political.&quot; While conceding that NELF
is non-partisan and completely avoids electoral politics and lobbying,
the city claimed NELF's work in the courts was an impermissible
effort to &quot;change the law.&quot; Eventually other property-owning
legal foundations headquartered in Boston were caught up in the
dispute when NELF's attorneys pointed out the hypocrisy of taxing
NELF while exempting groups with different missions.
<P>
The Court's decision resolves this matter. It stresses NELF's
essentially conservative role. Courts apply law, they do not make
it. By pursuing cases, NELF is not seeking to make new law; it
is trying to uphold the law as it already stands. The Court also
rejected Boston's claim that NELF serves too small a fraction
of the community to be entitled to exemption. It held that NELF's
legal work benefits the public as a whole and so NELF meets the
statutory test for a charitable organization.
<P>
By rebuffing Boston here, NELF not only protected its own interest
but also set a precedent that will limit future government attempts
to extract revenue from non-profits or to coerce them into tailoring
their missions to fit government's wishes.
<P>
<B>NELF Files Brief for Realtors in <BR>
Large Lot Zoning Case</B>
<P>
On behalf of the Greater Boston Real Estate Board, NELF filed
an <I>amicus</I> brief with Massachusetts' highest court, urging
adoption of guidelines on how to review local zoning rules which
impose large minimum lot sizes. The case comes from Martha's Vineyard
where the town of Edgartown bars new housing on lots smaller than
three acres, substantially reducing the supply of affordable new
housing and imposing significant limitations on landowners' rights
to use their property. NELF's brief argued that the court should
require lower courts to give special scrutiny to large lot zoning
because of its negative impact on migration into the town and
because of its devastating effect on owners of lots under minimum
size.

<B>WASHINGTON LEGAL FOUNDATION</B><HR>

<P>
<B>Texas IOLTA Program Derailed</B>
<P>
The Washington Legal Foundation scored a major victory when the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit unanimously ruled
on September 12, 1996 that Texas' Interest On Lawyer's Trust Accounts
(IOLTA) program is subject to First Amendment and Fifth Amendment
takings challenges. In <I>Washington Legal Foundation v. Texas
Equal Access to Justice Foundation</I>, the court of appeals took
bar authorities to task for arguing that the interest generated
on clients' funds that are pooled before the funds are disbursed
to them is not the property of the clients. Comparing this fund
raising scheme to alchemy, the court ruled that interest always
follow the principal regardless of the amount generated. IOLTA
programs generate approximately $150 million<B> </B>annually nationwide,
which is used to supplement Legal Services Corporation funding
for activist groups. Texas bar authorities, along the American
Bar Association and other groups, are expected to seek Supreme
Court review of this precedent-setting decision, which conflicts
with a First Circuit decision also litigated by WLF.
<P>
<B>Superfund Law Challenged</B>
<P>
WLF filed a brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
Circuit in <I>U.S. v. Olin Corporation</I> seeking to uphold a
lower court decision that ruled that the 1980 Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), or Superfund
law, does not apply to discharges of hazardous wastes that occurred
before the law went into effect, and that if it did, the law as
applied would violate the Commerce Clause because there was no
showing how the inactive site affects interstate commerce. WLF's
clients in the case include U.S. Senators Bob Smith, Lauch Faircloth,
Larry Pressler, Alan Simpson and Representatives Michael Oxley,
Bob Livingston, Joe Barton, Sonny Callahan, Jack Fields, Jimmy
Hayes, John Hostettler, Enid Greene, and Bill Goodling.
<P>
<B>Junk Science Challenged in the Courtroom</B>
<P>
WLF filed a brief in the Supreme Court of Nevada in <I>Mahlum
v. Dow Chemical Co.</I>, arguing that Dow Chemical should not
be held liable for alleged injuries caused by silicone breast
implants made by Dow-Corning, a separate legal entity. WLF argues
that not only is there no credible evidence showing that the silicone
implants caused any harm, but that in any event, Dow Chemical,
which had nothing to do with the manufacturing or testing of the
silicone, should not be held liable because of a lack of legal
causation between the injuries and Dow Chemical. Rather, the plaintiff's
attorneys were simply trying to obtain money from Dow Chemical
because Dow Corning had filed for bankruptcy under the crush of
implant lawsuits.
<P>
<B>Sex Offender Law Defended</B>
<P>
WLF filed a brief in the U.S. Supreme Court in <I>Kansas v. Hendrick</I>
seeking to uphold state laws that impose preventive detention
on dangerous sex offenders after they complete their original
sentences. WLF filed its brief on behalf of Kansas state legislators,
asz well as Kansas's entire House of Representatives delegation
-U.S. Representatives Sam Brownback, Jan Meyers, Pat Roberts,
and Todd Tiahrt, as well as .

<B>Young America's Publishes Briefs on Social Security and Financial
Aid, and 3rd Edition of <I>The Myth of the Robber Barons</I></B>
<P>
The latest two issue briefs from the Young America's Foundation
provide information on the issues of social security privatization
and reform of the student financial aid system, two issues important
to college-aged students. These two briefs will provide information
that will allow conservative students to challenge liberal professors,
fellow classmates, and slanted editorials on the two subjects.
 
<P>
YAF has also published the 3rd Edition of <I>The Myth of the Robber
Barons,</I> by Burt Folsom, Visiting Fellow at the Mackinac Center.
First published in 1987, the book was widely praised and is now
assigned in scores of colleges and universities throughout the
United States. The book challenges the liberal interpretation
of the rise of big business that is found in many textbooks on
American history.

<B>Grove City College Rejects Department of Education Demands</B>
<P>
Grove City College in western Pennsylvania has announced that
it will end its participation in the Federal Stafford and Federal
PLUS loan programs at the end of the current academic year. The
college will replace the Stafford/PLUS loans for its students
with a privately financed loan program. Current regulations require
that Grove City sign a complex participation agreement that subjects
it to federal government oversight, and also to furnish audited
financial statements to the federal government. According to the
school this move reflects its long-standing principles of remaining
independent and free from government intrusion in the operation
of the College.

<B>Free Congress Foundation Video Tape: &quot;America the Bankrupt.&quot;</B>
<P>
The Free Congress Foundation has released a new video tape hosted
by the former Governor of Delaware, Pete DuPont, entitled &quot;American
the Bankrupt.&quot; The tape examines the &quot;true&quot; national
debt. The problems highlighted in the tape include: a national
debt that is spiraling out of control, a Medicare program that
will go bankrupt in 2001,  Social Security fraud, massive growth
in entitlement spending, a welfare system that doesn not work,
and soaring tax rates. The tape also features commentary by Senator
Larry Craig, Senator Don Nickles, Rep. Mark Neuman, OMB Director
Alice Rivlin, and several other economic experts. CONTACT: Free

<B>National Tax Limitation Foundation's State/Local Government
Fiscal <BR>
Restraint Project</B>
<P>
The National Tax Limitation Foundation (NTLF) has initaited a
project to review and analyze state and local government fiscal
restraint mechanisms. The maturation of the tax limitation movement
at state and local levels, and the devolution/block granting of
functions from Washington to the states convinced NTLF to undertake
this project. NTLF is seeking to create a systematic body of knowledge
that can illustrate what types and combinations of fiscal restraint
devices work best to control state/local government taxes and
spending. This will provide a unique, permanent body of data and
analysis that NTLF hopes will enable policy makers to shape state/local
government institutions in a more fiscally responsible fashion.
NTLF plans to work with key players in each state: state policy
councils, ALEC legislative leaders, tax research groups, fiscaly
conservative academics and taxpayer advocacy organizations and
activists.  CONTACT: National Tax Limitation Foundation, State/Local

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Reviewing the Revolution: Conservative
Successes in the 104th Congress<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER><HR>
<P>
Buoyed by the dramatic outcome of the 1994 elections,
conservatives had high expectations for the incoming Congress.
For the first time in 40 years, conservatives assumed key leadership
roles in both chambers. Particularly encouraging were the members
of the incoming House freshman class, many of whom had based their
successful campaigns on the Contract With America and its bold
commitment to reforming Congress and reducing the size and scope
of government.
<P>
Considering President Clinton's many vetoes of major
legislation, conservatives have achieved amazing success in transforming
government and the way Congress does business. Despite setbacks
and retreats, the 104th Congress has fulfilled conservative's
hopes in several key areas by beginning a revolutionary reversal
of failed liberal policies in such areas as welfare, agriculture,
and regulation.
<P>
The successes of the 104th Congress are particularly
significant when measured against the records of previous Congresses.
While this Congress adopted significant government reforms with
only narrow majorities, the New Deal and Great Society Congresses
had large liberal majorities. Moreover, the legislation passed
by those lawmakers was championed and signed by liberal Presidents.
Although the revolution remains to be completed, conservatives
should appreciate the progress that has been made.
<P>
No assessment of the 104th Congress would be complete
without a recognition of what could have been accomplished if
the President had not vetoed critical legislation. The most important
accomplishment of this Congress was a balanced budget bill which
would have eliminated the deficit by the year 2002 while mandating
$245 billion in critical tax reductions. American families would
have benefited from a $500 per child tax credit.
<P>
This legislation not only represented the first balanced
budget in 26 years, but also contained significant reforms in
government programs which would have returned power to states
and communities. In spite of the President's opposition, Congress
succeeded in reducing discretionary spending for the first time
since 1969. As submitted, the President's FY 1996 budget would
have raised the deficit to $211 billion; Congress deserves the
taxpayers' appreciation for cutting the Administration's projected
deficit nearly in half.
<P>
Perhaps the most notable achievement of the 104th
Congress was its overhaul of the nation's welfare system. While
the President twice vetoed welfare reform bills, he indicated
that he would sign a third which differed from the first two bills
only in minor respects. This historic legislation ends the federal
entitlement to welfare, contains real work requirements and time
limits, and fights illegitimacy. President Clinton promised to
&quot;end welfare as we know it.&quot; But it was conservatives
in Congress who made this promise a reality.
<P>
In many other areas, Congress succeeded in adopting
conservative, commonsense alternatives to liberal approaches advanced
by the Clinton Administration and its allies on Capitol Hill.
Congress restored funding for important national security programs
that were slashed by the Administration and its allies in Congress.
Lawmakers deregulated telecommunications, stemmed the tide of
costly federal mandates, and gave the President the line-item
veto.
<P>
Conservatives in the last Congress stopped the Clinton
health care bill that would have led to socialized medicine; this
Congress passed a scaled-down version of health care reform that
had as its primary goal enhancing portability of health insurance.
However, Congress did not address the flawed tax treatment of
employment-based health insurance that produces costly distortions
in the health care market, undermines consumer choice, and restricts
access to health insurance.
<P>
Congress has more work to do to complete work on
other conservative objectives. Lawmakers failed to pass legislation
to end racial preferences. They were unable to end government
funding for left-wing political activities. They failed to close
down the Energy, Education, Commerce, or Housing Departments.
The National Endowment for the Arts and the Legal Services Corporation
live on. But Congress did achieve cuts in all of these programs
that were unthinkable before 1994.
<P>
It took 60 years to build the modern welfare state,
and it will take more than just two years to do what is needed
to reform it. The 104th Congress, has taken significant steps
to reduce the size of the federal government and to empower states,
local communities, and individuals. President Clinton has stated
that &quot;the era of big government is over.&quot; The 104th
Congress has actually done something to turn this rhetoric <BR>
into reality.<BR>

A Challenge to the U.S., <BR></a></B>by Richard Fisher
<P>
<I>Asian Studies Center Backgrounder</I>, No. 142, The Heritage
Foundation<HR>
<P>
China's moves to expand and modernize its air force poses the
first major challenge to the U.S. post-Cold War strategy in Asia.
With China's commitment to build a world class air force, Richard
Fisher, Senior Policy Analyst at the Heritage Foundation, argues
that the United States must proceed with programs to guarantee
American air superiority in Asia. According to Fisher, the U.S.
should: sustain funding for the F-22A jet fighter; maintain 12
Navy aircraft battle groups; develop an air-superiority fighter
for the Navy; accelerate development of a helmet-sighted missile
and make advance U.S. air-to-air missiles available to U.S. allies;
develop advanced versions of the F-16 and F-18 for allied and
friendly Asian air forces; and ask Russia and Israel to curtail
sales of advanced combat aircraft and related technology to China.

<P>
Ariel Cohen, Salvatori Fellow in Russian and Eurasian Studies
at the Heritage Foundation, scrutinizes the fall of the Soviet
Union on the grounds that it was an empire. Prior to the downfall
of the Eastern Block, Sovietologists held no consensus that the
USSR was an empire to begin with. This is one reason why the fall
was so surprising. In theory and writings on empires, however,
there was abundant evidence that the USSR was soon going to collapse.

Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution,
and Jongryn Mo, Hoover National Fellow, predict that the North
Korean military and the leaders of heavy industry, will be the
powers who will control North Korea's destiny for the next few
years. The authors expect that North Korea will enter a period
of political instability and Kim Jong-Il will become little more
than a figurehead. The authors conclude that North Korea will
not likely improve its economy or stabilize its government in
the next few years. 19 pp. CONTACT: Hoover Institution Press,

<B>Antiproliferation of the 21st Century, <BR>
</B>by Kerry Herron
<P>
<I>Strategic Review</I>, Vol. XXIV, No. 3, United States Strategic
Institute<HR>

<P>
Kerry Herron, retired U.S. Air Force Colonel, and Associate Director
for Security Studies at the University of New Mexico Institute
for Public Policy, examines the issue of &quot;full spectrum antiproliferation&quot;
as a nuclear deterrent in the post-Cold War world. Full-spectrum
antiproliferation presents an alternative to nonproliferation
and systematic deterrence. Herron explains that full spectrum
antiproliferation integrates: 1) polices that are designed to
slow and limit the number of states with nuclear weapons; 2) procedures
intended to reduce the nuclear dangers among proliferates by promoting
nuclear deterrence, nuclear surety (safety, security, and use
control), and responsible management of nuclear materials while
reducing the risks of nuclear terrorism; and 3) reactive capabilities
and policies for reducing risks associated with nuclear crises
that are not deterred or otherwise prevented. Herron believes
that full-spectrum antiproliferation is the best way to deal with
the world's current situation with nuclear missiles. According
to Herron, this policy &quot;recognizes the value of both prevention
and deterrence in coping with the challenges of nuclear proliferation,
and provides for their integration into policy options consistent
with a comprehensive proliferation strategy.&quot; He concludes
that twentieth century prescriptions are inadequate for twenty-first
century problems.  10 pp. CONTACT: United States Strategic Institute,

<B>The Nuclear Black Market</B><BR>
<P>
<I>CSIS Task Force Report</I>, Center for Strategic and International
Studies<HR>

<P>
CSIS's <I>Global Organized Crime Project</I> (GOC) was established
to develop short- and long-term strategies to deal with the threats
to U.S. national security in the post-Cold War era posed by global
organized crime. This report, produced by the Nuclear Black Market
Task Force, one of seven groups that make up GOC, focuses on the
supply, illicit trafficking, and demand for nuclear weapons and
weapons usable uranium and plutonium, from the Former Soviet Union
(FSU). The task force presents a bleak picture of poorly protected
storage sites for Russia's more than 1,500 tons of weapons-grade
fissile material guarded by demoralized and underpaid guards.
This creates a situation where terrorist groups or corrupt security
personnel, and even rogue states could obtain the components needed
to build a nuclear device. The current situation is ripe for struggling
nuclear workers to be tempted to steal or sell materials. Partly
as a result of dismantlement, the current trafficking trends have
upward trends. The potential for an accident or use of smuggled
nuclear materials is likely to increase. On a brighter note the
Task Force reports that certain trends are favorable. For example,
improvements in the material protection, control, and accountability
programs in the FSU is progressing, albeit slowly. Also the number
of deployed warheads has been reduced, transit states are starting
to use technical detectors, and the international community beginning
to respond to the problem. The Task Force has developed policy
recommendations in policy, organization, technology, legislation,
and international instruments. They recommend that U.S. policy
makers do the following: apply performance measures' aim for sustainability;
implement cooperative programs for material destruction and removal
of weapons from the FSU; develop bilateral safeguards with Russia;
consider exchanges on science-based stockpile stewardship with
Russia; encourage and enhance opportunities for bilateral cooperation
of law enforcement on a case-by-case basis; robustly support intelligence
efforts; pursue and prosecute nuclear smugglers to the fullest
extent of the law; and declare common policies on nuclear black
marketing and extradition with like-minded governments. 50 pp.

<B>The Prophets of Doom: The Security Threat of Religious Cults,<BR>
</B>by Andrew Hubback
<P>
<I>Occasional Paper</I>, No. 67, Institute for European Defence
and Strategic Studies<HR>

<P>
Andrew Hubback, a freelance writer and a commentator on security
affairs, examines the potential terrorist threat of some religious
cults. A recent example of such violence was the nerve gas attack
on the Tokyo subway by the Japanese religious cult <I>Aum Shinrikyo</I>
(Search for the Supreme Truth). The <I>Aum Shinrikyo</I> attack
was only part of growing trend of violence by religious cults
directed at forces of authority within states and targeted at
the general public. Religious cult terrorism introduces a new
aspect to terrorist warfare-their violence is as inspired by religion
as much as politics. Even the most violent secular terrorist groups
have eschewed such cruel weapons as nerve gas because they believe
such an attack would be counter productive to their political
cause. As recent peace settlements in certain hotspots in Central
America, the Middle East and Southern Africa have shown, former
terrorist groups have some common interests with their enemies.
Some fanatical apocalyptic religious cults have no such rational
ends as peace with those they see as their enemies. Hubback briefly
surveys violent cults throughout history and illustrates the recent
increase in cult terrorism. He then goes into detail about several
groups including <I>Aum Shinrikyo</I>, The Christian Identity
movement and the Oklahoma City bombing, and other international
cults such as the Order of the Solar Temple. He concludes with
suggestions on how to counter religious cult terrorism. He says
the first and most important step that should be taken is to recognize
the threat in the first place and be on guard. According to Hubback,
the security services of democracies should devote the necessary
resources to collecting intelligence on &quot;subversive, anti-social
and potentially violent cults. The authorities must be prepared
for a pre-emptive strike not only to protect the general public,
but to protect innocent cult members as well.  44 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Developing a Consensus for the Future: A Report of CSIS U.S.
China Policy Task Force</B><BR>
<P>
Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies<HR>

<P>
In 1994 the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies (CSIS)
established the U.S. China Policy Task Force, co-chaired by Senators
Max Baucus (MT), Frank Murkowski (AK), Chuck Robb (VA), and Representative
Jim Kolbe (AZ), Harold Brown, a CSIS counselor, and Lawrason Thomas
of the Amoco Corporation. The Task Force has addressed several
issues affecting U.S.-China relations including: U.S.-China economic
and commercial relations; political issues including human rights;
domestic developments in the PRC, Hong Kong, and Taiwan; regional
security; and cross-strait relations. U.S.-China relations have
developed to a point where disputes over individual issues pose
a threat to the overall relationship between the two nations and
prevent a consistent and coherent bilateral policy. This report
covers four elements that the Task Force believes U.S.-China policy
should revolve around; 1) developing a new consensus to reestablish
executive branch leadership and bipartisan congressional support
in regards to the priorities of U.S.-China relations; 2) a new
consensus that reflects &quot;value propositions&quot; to promote
U.S. interests and give direction to the overall relationship;
3) striving within U.S. politics and policy to accommodate both
pragmatism and idealism; and 4) the new consensus should hold
a firm U.S. position concerning cross-strait relations that acknowledges
that Chinese on the mainland, and in Taiwan, maintain that there
is only one China. The rest of this report covers the issues of
economic and commercial relations, political and human rights
issues, and bilateral and regional security relations, with specific
recommendations. 93 pp. CONTACT: The Center for Strategic and

to Regulation, <BR></a></B>by Angela Antonelli
<P>
<I>F.Y.I.</I>, No. 116, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
Angela Antonelli, Deputy Director for Economic Policy Studies
at the Heritage Foundation, shows that the 104th Congress has
made several strides toward cutting regulatory red tape and began
to return common sense to regulation. However, she points out,
alarmists have been successful in convincing the American people
a reformed regulatory system would have disastrous consequences.
According to Antonelli, this Congress has a solid record of reforms
that will create a more flexible and less burdensome regulatory
system that will cost less and achieve the same or higher levels
of public health, safety, and environmental protection. 11 pp.

<br>
by John Barry 
<P>
<I>Committee Brief</I> No. 27, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
John Barry, Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, calls for
the privatization of the two largest housing-related government
sponsored enterprises (GSEs), Federal National Mortgage Association
(Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie
Mac). Ongoing hearings on the subject have brought forth the diverse
opinions of different federal agencies over whether federal sponsorship
of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is necessary or not. Barry points
out that Congress is now considering privatization while at the
same time defending its oversight role. Barry says that Congress
should keep in mind two important facts to guide its decision
concerning the two GSEs: 1) Congress is ultimately responsible
for safeguarding the interests of taxpayers-so congressional oversight
of these GSEs is necessary if they remain government sponsored
as and place the taxpayer at risk; 2) the original mission of
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, establishing an efficient secondary
mortgage market, has been fulfilled-so Congress should end their
sponsorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Barry includes other
reasons for breaking the links between Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac, and the federal government: government intervention in the
mortgage credit markets is no longer necessary with the increased
availability of mortagages to all potential home buyers; the vast
size of the housing GSEs, due to federal guarantee, is a dangerous
presence in the capital markets; and the mixed private/public
nature of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac constitutes a conflict of
interest. 6 pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation,

</B>by Ken Weinstein and Thomas Wielgus
<P>
<I>Backgrounder</I>, No. 1087, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
In the 1988 case <I>Communications Workers of America v. Beck</I>,
the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that workers are entitled a refund
of the portion of their dues used for purposes other than collective
bargaining, contract administration, and grievance processes.
In 1992, President Bush issued an executive order requiring that
federal contractors post notices to inform workers of their Beck
rights. However, the Clinton Administration has rescinded this
order and has cooperated with union officials to keep workers
from knowing about these rights. The Worker Right to Know Act
is currently under consideration in Congress. The bill would require
unions to get permission from their members in order to use mandatory
dues for politicking or other activities outside of collective
bargaining. Weinstein and Wielgus argue that The Worker Right
to Know would enable union workers to exercise their rights freely.

<B>Competition in Electric Power: Strategies for Reform,</B>
<br>
by Doug Bandow
<P>
<I>Policy Report</I>, No. 14, John Locke Foundation<HR>

<P>
Doug Bandow, Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute, discusses deregulation
of the electric utility industries. Until the 1970s, it was assumed
that electric utilities were natural monopolies, and that electrical
service could not be provided through competitive markets. However,
examples of successful deregulation in the airline, banking, broadcasting,
energy, telephone and other utilities have made it less far fetched
to call for a similar deregulation of electric power. Steps toward
electric power deregulation have slowly been made since the disastrous
economy of the late 1970s shed light on the problems with electric
industry monopolies. In 1992 Congress mandated wholesale competition.
And by 1994 California and other states have even moved toward
retail competition. Bandow stresses the point that this process
of moving toward increased competition in the electricity industry
will not be without its difficulties. The complicated structure
of the system now as an enforced monopoly, with its state and
federal power subsidies, special regulatory impositions on utilities
for non-energy purposes, ownership restrictions of power companies,
and control of power grids, means that none of the issues can
be solved in isolation. Bandow calls for a federally planned and
enforced program to eliminate subsidies, contracts made under
the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) of 1978, non-energy
requirements, restrictions enforced under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act (PUCHA) of 1935, and control over access to transmission
grids while limiting stranded costs. This whole process will be
complicated politically and any change will generate opposition
from some interests. Bandow stresses that utilities deregulation
will be a significant factor in improving Americans' quality of
life in the early 21st Century. He concludes by saying that the
federal government, states, industry, consumer groups, and other
interests should work together to create a true market for electric
power that will provide Americans with better services at lower
costs. 62 pp.  CONTACT: The John Locke Foundation, P.O. Box 17822,

<B>Understanding Electricity Deregulation in Pittsburgh,</B>
<br>by Jake Haulk
<P>
Allegheny Institute<HR>

<P>
Jake Haulk, Research Director at the Allegheny Institute, discusses
how the deregulation of the nation's electric utilities holds
extremely large potential benefits in terms of lower prices and
higher quality of service for consumers. According to Haulk, regulation
as it is currently practiced is no longer appropriate for the
U.S. economy. &quot;Regulation encourages too much capital spending,
provides no inducement to cut costs and results in huge and wasteful
expenditures on litigation of prices and other regulated activities.&quot;
Steps have already been taken to ease the transition to deregulation.
For example, Haulk points out, federal agencies have mandated
that transmission grids of all competition at the wholesale level
will be open to all qualified generators. Retail deregulation
will soon follow this introduction of competition at the wholesale
level. Haulk also says that all customers will be able to choose
among a number of suppliers and have a choice of service levels
and price schedules in the new competitive system. Transmission
and distribution companies will be separately owned and probably
still regulated, but the generators and retail marketers will
be free to operate in a profit maximizing manner. He conservatively
estimates that a typical local residential customer in Allegheny
County will save about 30 percent, or $350 per year on electric
bills. 16 pp. CONTACT: Allegheny Institute for Public Policy,

<B>Promise and Peril: Implementing a Regulatory Budget,</B>
<br>
by Clyde Wayne Crews
<P>
<I>Regulatory Reform Project</I>, Competitive Enterprise Institute
<HR>

<P>
Clyde Wayne Crews, Fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute,
discusses the implementation of a Regulatory budget. He examines
the pluses and minuses of requiring Congress to set enforceable
limits on the amounts that federal agencies can force private
citizens to spend on federally mandated rules and regulations.
According to Crews, there currently exists a breach between rulemaking
and accountability. What he calls &quot;regulation without representation.&quot;
Congress loves to take credit for such legislation as the Clean
Air Act, but then blames the federal agencies, whose powers they
drastically increased with such legislation, for being &quot;out
of control.&quot; Meanwhile, the federal agency bureaucrats are
not accountable to voters. A regulatory budget would require Congress
to set and enforce cost caps on the regulations that the agencies
impose. Prioritizing what regulations bring the greatest benefits
and sensible protection would be a responsibility of Congress
and the agencies. Congress will become more accountable to the
voters for the costs and results of regulatory policy. Crews calls
for a few other steps to be taken to ensure that a budgeting effort
remains manageable and accountable. He calls for the establishment
of a regulatory cost freeze and the implementation of a &quot;Regulatory
Reduction Commission&quot; to address the existing $647 billion
regulatory enterprise; employing separate budgets for economic
and environmental/social regulation; and the controlling of hard-to-measure
indirect costs by abandoning the regulatory methods that most
often generate them. 28 pp. CONTACT: Competitive Enterprise Institute,

<B>How the Market Self-Polices Against Predatory Pricing,</B>

<P>
<I>Antitrust Reform Project</I>, Competitive Enterprise Institute
<HR>

<P>
Donald Boudreaux, Professor of Economics at Clemson University,
and Andrew Kleit, Professor of Economics at Louisiana State University,
argue that market forces are more effective than antitrust laws
in preventing monopolies from occurring. Kleit and Boudreaux argue
that economic research shows that predatory pricing is not likely
to result in a monopoly. Rival competitors have the incentive
and the ability to withstand a predatory price war. They maintain
that customers and suppliers of the predatory prices often have
the incentive and ability to thwart predatory efforts. Some elements
of antitrust law serve to thwart market forces of policing against
predation. Lawful 'private policing' strategies such as minimum
resale price maintenance, maximum resale price maintenance, and
price discrimination are rendered unlawful as a perverse consequence
of antitrust law. Antitrust prohibitions then increase the costs
of private firms of protecting themselves from monopoly. 20 pp.

<HR>

<P>
In a joint publication, the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution,
and the Institute for Policy Innovation, present a list of the
top ten worst government regulations. In the introduction, Robert
Kasten, former Senator from Wisconsin, and Chairman of the Center
on Regulation and Economic Growth for the Alexis de Tocqueville
Institution, points out that government regulators frequently
far exceed the original intent of Congress when enforcing regulation.
Without &quot;sunset&quot; provisions, regulations stay in effect
even after they have become obsolete or outdated. To compile this
list, IPI and AdTI asked leading policy experts to write a brief
article on what they believed exemplified the worst regulations
from Washington. Kasten proposes that the regulations would be
perfect candidates for Congressional overhaul or elimination during
the next &quot;Corrections Day.&quot; Those ten regulations are:
the federal wetlands policy; the 60-40 rule; off-label drug use
regulations; the federal peanut program; the FDA's slow approval
process; Superfund; Environmental Tobacco Smoke; The Delaney Clause;
Discipline of special education students; and Toxic Release Inventory.

<B>The Impact of Enterprise Zones, <BR>
</B>by Terry Van Allen<HR>

<P>
Enterprise Zones are set aside low-income areas that have reduced
tax and regulatory barriers in order to stimulate economic development,
investment, and opportunity. Terry Van Allen, Director of Research
Initiatives at the University of Houston-Clear Lake, examines
the issue of how Enterprise Zones affect employment. He argues
that Enterprise Zones have a major impact on reducing unemployment.
His study also shows that vast majority of the new entry level
jobs go to the residents of the low-income zone, contrary to the
claims of critics. He also dispels the myth that most businesses
relocate to Enterprise Zones from other communities. Instead,
the evidence shows that most of the businesses in Enterprise Zones
have either been expanded or newly created from &quot;within&quot;
the designated communities. He also counters the argument that
the cost of providing tax incentives is too high. Van Allen argues
that poverty areas already have low tax revenues and high welfare
costs, so the benefits far outweigh the costs. The analytical
model that Van Allen has created projects that the designated
poverty areas on average can reach employment rate parity with
the surrounding more-prosperous communities within twelve years.
He recommends that the Clinton Administration and Congress increase
the number of Enterprise Zones and provide for capital gains tax
incentives within Enterprise Zones. 145 pp. CONTACT: Austin &amp;

<B>Is New York City Killing Entrepreneurship? </B><br>
by William Mellor
<P>
Institute for Justice<HR>

<P>
The Institute for Justice examines how New York City has made
it hard for self-employed entrepreneurs to pursue productive livelihoods.
New York's regulatory system is filled with entrepreneurs who
find that if they were to comply with the law, they would have
to abandon their way of making an honest living. The underground
economy in New York City now may represent as much as 20 percent
of the city's overall economy. This report looks at the government-created
barriers of licensing and permitting laws and public monopolies,
and their effect on entry-level entrepreneurship in New York.
They illustrate how obstacles to enterprise created by government
often times far exceed any legitimate exercise of government authority
to regulate in order to protect health and safety. IJ also focuses
on the tragedy, as well as the heroic efforts of those who try
to earn an honest living, despite the burden of senseless rules
and requirements whose main purpose seems to be to limit competition
in particular occupations. Finally, IJ makes recommendations for
how to create easier legal entry into entrepreneurial endeavors.

</B>by Bill Beach
<P>
<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1091, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
As long as governments have been collecting taxes, the death of
well-to-do individuals has been a lucrative moment for tax collectors.
The manifestation of such a tax today is the estate tax. Except
the estate tax effects more than just the wealthy, with the hardest
hit being small business owners. Bill Beach, John M. Olin Senior
Fellow in Economics, puts forth the case for repealing the estate
tax, and identifies it as the &quot;worst tax of all.&quot; According
to Beach, the social and economic costs of the estate tax far
exceeds the revenue that it brings to the government. Growing
evidence shows that the estate tax: reduces economic growth, and
hurts the incomes of the people that wealth redistribution was
intended to aid; it increases the cost of capital, this slows
down research and development and the investment in machines that
would increase worker productivity instead-and thus wages; it
keeps the interest rates on home loans and other major purchases
unnecessarily high; and it does not raise very much money-and
may, in fact, cost government and taxpayers more in administrative
and compliance fees than it raises in revenue. Using two leading
econometric models, a Heritage Foundation study found that the
repeal of the estate tax would have a large and beneficial effect
on the economy. According to the analysis, if the tax were repealed
this year, over the next nine years: America's economy would average
as much as $11 billion per year in extra output; an average of
145,000 additional new jobs could be created; personal income
could rise by an average of $8 billion per year above current
projections; and the deficit would actually decline with the revenues
generated by extra growth. Beach points out that that estate tax
has few friends other than tax attorneys. 30 pp. CONTACT: Chris

</B> 
<br>
by Dan Mitchell
<P>
<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1090, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
Dan Mitchell, McKenna Senior Fellow in Political Economy, explains
how dynamic scoring should be used to modernize the revenue-estimating
process. Dynamic scoring recognizes that tax policy effects the
economy, as opposed to static analysis, which assumes that tax
changes have no impact on economic growth. Mitchell argues that
dynamic scoring, if used properly, can help bring about sound
tax policy by reducing the politically unpleasant side-effects
of tax cuts. Static analysis does not take into account the fact
that a larger economy created by easing a tax burden brings in
larger revenue to government coffers. Politicians usually support
the idea of cutting taxes. However, they are afraid of being blamed
for the higher deficits that static analysis predicts will happen
with tax cuts. Mitchell lists several points that policy makers
should consider when taking steps to modernize the revenue-estimating
process: learn from history that static scoring overestimates
how much revenue will be generated by a tax increase, while underestimating
the revenue feedback that pro-growth tax changes will generate;
realize that dynamic analysis is not perfect, as opposed to static
analysis which is guaranteed to give the wrong answer; tax cuts
that have a greater effect on behavior, such as a capital gains
tax cut have a greater revenue feedback effect; policy makers
should insist that taxpayers get full disclosure on whatever model
and methodology is used by revenue estimators at the Joint Committee
on Taxation and the Treasury Department; have the goal of tax
policy be the maximization of growth, not tax revenue; and include
the estimated private and governmental compliance costs of taxation.
Mitchell concludes by saying that dynamic forecasting is based
on a proper understanding of how the economy works, and that history
has shown this approach to be more realistic. 17 pp. CONTACT:

This report from Cato presents an objective, comparative analysis
of the spending and tax policies of 46 state governors. Stephen
Moore, Director of Fiscal Policy Studies, and Dean Stansel, Fiscal
Policy Analyst at the Cato Institute, constructed a 14-variable
index of fiscal performance and applied it to the records of each
governor who took office before 1993. The authors then graded
each of the governors on their fiscal conservatism. George Pataki
of New York, Steve Merrill of New Hampshire, and Fife Symington
of Arizona, received the grade of &quot;A.&quot; Gaston Caperton
of West Virginia, Tom Carper of Delaware, Lawton Chiles of Florida,
and George Voinovich of Ohio received &quot;F's.&quot; A significant
trend that was uncovered by the study was that states have become
more fiscally conservative since 1994, and the new governors as
a class tend to be more fiscally conservative than those elected
before 1993. 84 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts

<B>Accounting for Growth: Incorporating Dynamic Analysis Into
Revenue Estimation, <BR>
</B>by Gary Robbins and Aldona Robbins
<P>
<I>Policy Report</I> No. 138, Institute for Policy Innovation
<HR>

<P>
Gary Robbins, John M. Olin Senior Research Fellow at the Institute
for Policy Innovation, and Aldona Robbins, Bradley Senior Research
Fellow at the Institute for Policy Innovation, examine the issue
of &quot;dynamic analysis.&quot; Dynamic economic analysis is
the process of estimating economic changes that occur because
of changes in tax policy. It does not assume that all economic
behavior and variables remain the same if tax laws or government
expenditures change. Robbins and Robbins used dynamic analysis
with three hypothetical changes: a per capita tax of $5,200; an
elimination of the capital gains and dividend taxes on individuals;
and a uniform rate for individual and corporate income taxes of
19 percent, all with a commonly accepted baseline of 2.5 percent
annual growth from 1996 to 2010. They found that the head tax
raises GDP 22 percent above baseline by 2010. By removing individual
capital gain/dividend taxes raises GDP 8.5 percent, and the 19
percent uniform rate puts real GDP 7.5 percent above baseline
by 2010. Their use of dynamic analysis suggests tax reform aimed
at growth can increase annual output roughly 10 to 15 percent.
This boost would lead to more jobs, higher incomes, and an expanded
tax base which would bring higher revenues, not losses. 19 pp.

<B>The Hidden Heir: How Estate Taxes Are Swallowing up Family
Businesses And Farms-And How We Can Stop It</B>
<P>
Public Policy Institute of New York<HR>

<P>
The Public Policy Institute of New York examines the detrimental
effects of New York's state-level estate and gift taxes. With
federal estate taxes, and the additional burden of New York state's
top rates reaching 76 percent, owners of family businesses and
farms are often times forced to flee New York when they retire,
taking valuable assets with them. Most states do not add to federal
estate taxes, but simply take some of the tax that otherwise would
go to the federal government. New York collects the most revenue
of the states that do levy estate or inheritance taxes and has
the highest top rates on inheritance to children. Contrary to
the nationwide trend of states repealing their death taxes, New
York has been expanding its estate tax. This paper argues that
New York must reduce its rates, reduce the burden of the state
gift tax; conform estate tax credits to the federal level; and
make policy changes that can ease the transfer of family businesses
from one generation to the next. Finally, this paper argues that
New York could go further than a reduction in disadvantages, and
create an actual incentive for family businesses to locate in
New York state. By establishing a New York Sate Family Business
Fund, the fund could loan family businesses and farms money to
pay federal estate taxes. It would be capitalized with a small
share of exiting estate revenue flow-so that revenues from the
rich would pay for keeping family businesses and their jobs in
New York. 27 pp. CONTACT: The Public Policy Institute of New York

<B>Public-Private Promises #1: Three Rivers Stadium,</B><br>
by Grant Gulibon
<P>
<I>Report</I>, No. 96-14 Allegheny Institute<HR>

<P>
In light of the proposal to build a new government subsidized
baseball stadium in Pittsburgh, Grant Gulibon, Research Associate
at the Allegheny Institute, examines the rosy promises made in
a similar proposal approximately thirty-five years ago for Three
Rivers Stadium. Gulibon's report examines the claims used to justify
the construction of Three Rivers Stadium and contrasts them with
the stadium's actual performance since its opening. He found:
the original estimated cost of the stadium was $13.8 million,
while its final cost is estimated to be between $52 and $62 million;
the 83.5 acre site where the stadium was built was estimated to
cost $10 million in 1958, re-estimated to cost $21.72 in 1962,
but ultimately cost $45 million; Three Rivers Stadium was to be
a &quot;self-financing&quot; project which would not require city
or county operating support, but, has run up a $43 million deficit,
and has received operating subsidies for the Allegheny County
Regional Asset District; very little of the predicted private
development plans for the area surrounding the stadium exists
due to a lack of market demand; Through 1991 the city had over
$100 million on the stadium, still owes $40 million on the bonds
floated for the original construction, and had provided $27.1
million in subsidies for stadium operating deficits over the same
time period; deficits continued even after the stadium authority
hired a private management group to manage Three Rivers in 1982;
and St. Louis' Busch Stadium, four years older than Three Rivers
and nearly identical in size and design, privately financed and
has been privately owned and operated since it opened, was completed
under budget, has turned a profit each year since it opened, and
has been cited by baseball officials as one of the model facilities
in operation today. 19 pp. CONTACT: Allegheny Institute, 7 Parkway

<B>Restoring Opportunity to Arkansas: Changing a &quot;Tax and
Spend&quot; State to a &quot;Save and Invest&quot; State,</B>
<br>
by Stephen Moore and Dean Stansel
<P>
Arkansas Policy Foundation
<P>
Stephen Moore, Director of Fiscal Policy Studies at the Cato Institute,
and Dean Stansel, Fiscal Policy Analyst at Cato, discuss how changing
the tax policy in the state of Arkansas, would restore opportunity
to the state. In Arkansas, tax and spending has exploded over
the past fifteen years. Moore and Stansel list several examples
of Arkansas' heavy taxation: state spending is 50% higher than
it was in 1980-and spending has risen 12% faster than state income
in the same period; if the state budget had only grown at the
rate of personal income growth, Arkansas could both balance its
budget and give every family in the state a $1,000 tax rebate;
Arkansas' high tax burden is 15% above the national average, and
is weakening the state's competitiveness with other states; spending
priorities have been radically rewritten since 1980, from traditional
state responsibilities such as education, highways, and hospitals
to less productive and more redistributive goals such as welfare,
public health, and debt service; and that the state budget has
been growing at an annual rate more than twice that of inflation.
To solve these tax problems, Moore and Stansel offer the following
spending restraints and tax cuts: a 25% cut in personal income
tax rates, eventually to become a 5% flat tax to deliver economic
growth; indexation, which prevents state government from benefiting
through inflation; eliminate the state capital gains tax on new
investment, to have a giant impact on investment and job growth;
enact a one-year budget freeze to allow the rest of the state
to catch up; and finally, implement a constitutional budget cap
that prevents growth of spending from rising faster than the growth
rate of the state population plus inflation. Moore and Stansel
conclude that such measures have led to stunning economic success
in states as  different as Massachusetts, Michigan, and New Jersey.

<B>Taxation and Economic Performance, <BR>
</B>by W. Kurt Hauser
<P>
<I>Essay in Public Policy</I>, Hoover Institution<HR>

<P>
Kurt Hauser, President of a San Francisco investment management
firm, argues that increased tax rates do not raise the desired
additional revenues. In his essay he shows that the economy as
a whole tends to perform worse following a tax increase. Reduction
in tax rates, however, tends to make the economy perform more
favorably. Hauser notes that economists have debated for the past
two centuries over whether or not higher rates of taxation leads
to increased levels of government revenues. More recently, he
points out, the revenue generation forecast for the tax increase
of 1990 and 1993 fell short of the mark. According to Hauser,
higher tax rates tend to reduce the tax base because of the disincentives
that they cause to work, produce, save, or invest. There are also
incentives to hide, shelter, and underreport income when tax rates
are raised. Policy makers still continue to believe that increases
in marginal tax rates will raise revenues without the adverse
effects on economic growth, job creation, or standard of living.

<B>Operating on American Health Care: Will Free Market Reforms
Survive? </B>
<P>
<I>F.Y.I.</I>, American Legislative Exchange Council<HR>

<P>
This issue of <I>F.Y.I.</I> examines how free-market reforms concerning
health care have grown since the failure of the Clinton health
care proposals. According to ALEC, states are repealing the bad
reforms associated with Clinton Care, such as, community rating,
guaranteed issue, price controls, and managed competition. States
are now busy dealing with the massive managed-care systems and
protecting patient's rights. Instead of the centralized systems
of Clinton style reforms, states are moving toward market solutions
that allow choice to the patients and better overall care. !8
states have enacted laws allowing for medical savings accounts
(MSAs). Also in this issue, Dr. Merrill Mathews, Health Policy
Director at the National Center for Policy Analysis, discusses
solving the portability problem. He says that the problem should
be resolved without costing the federal government additional
money or distorting the health insurance market. States should
provide risk pools for uninsurable individuals. Kim Pacelli, ALEC
Research Assistant, briefly examines how states might reform Medicaid
programs if block grants are granted to states. More than 40 states
have already sought waivers from the federal government. 19 pp.

<B>Multicultural Mental Health: Does Your Skin Color Matter More
than Your Mind? <BR>
</B>by Sally Satel and Greg Forster
<P>
<I>Policy Brief</I>, Center for Equal Opportunity<HR>

<P>
Sally Satel, a psychiatrist and lecturer with the Yale University
School of Medicine, and Greg Forster, Policy Analyst at the Center
for Equal Opportunity, examine a new mental health field called
&quot;cultural competence&quot; or &quot;multicultural therapy.&quot;
According to Satel and Forster, this movement threatens to discredit
traditional therapy and replace it with identity politics. This
concept of therapy sees human behavior as primarily culture-dependent.
So according to the theory of this practice doctors and patients
will experience mistrust and miscommunication if they are of different
racial or ethnic groups. It also assumes that white therapists
are racist. San Francisco General Hospital has the most prominent
cultural competence program in the United States. The doctors
in the mental health unit there specialize in different patient
groups-blacks, Asians, Latinos, gays/lesbians/bisexuals, women,
and HIV-positive. The city of San Francisco has even created a
racial specialization for non-doctor health professionals: African
American Health Services Specialists. The authors argue that no
one believes that race and culture are irrelevant to mental health,
but that muticultural therapy seeks to establish rigid rules of
treatment based on stereotypes and groupthink. They conclude that
the patient is a human being, not a cultural puppet, and that
multicultural approach to psychotherapy spends more energy separating
patients into groups than treating them. 19 pp. CONTACT: Center

<B>Waiting Your Turn: Hospital Waiting Lists in Canada,</B>

<I>Critical Issues Bulletin</I>, Fraser Institute<HR>

<P>
Cynthia Ramsey, Health Economist at The Fraser Institute, and
Michael Walker, Executive Director of The Fraser Institute, present
the Institute's sixth attempt to examine and document the extent
to which waiting lists are being used as a way of adapting to
the conflict between limited budgetary allocations and the potentially
unlimited demand for free health care. This year's results show
that Canadians waited longer in 1995 than in 1994 to receive medical
treatment. They found that patients in 1995 waited longer-10.2
weeks from referral by a general practitioner to a specialist
until the receipt of treatment-compared to 9.7 weeks in 1994.
They also found that the number of people on surgical waiting
lists and the amount of time they are waiting for the treatment
varies from province to province. Patients in Prince Edward Island
wait almost two months longer for surgical procedures than people
in Quebec. Fraser's survey measured what specialists consider
to be clinically reasonable amounts of time to wait for surgical
procedures. In almost every instance, the responding specialist
thought that patients were waiting too long for treatment. Ramsey
and Walker conclude that a plausible explanation for the waiting
times is that governments are using them as a way to control health
care expenses by rationing access to health care.  58 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Repairing the Ladder: Toward a New Housing Policy Paradigm,
</B>
<br>by Howard Husock
<P>
<I>Policy Study</I>, No. 207, Reason Foundation<HR>

<P>
In this report, Howard Husock, Reason Foundation Adjunct Scholar,
examines the reasons why housing policy for the poor has not worked.
He lays out an overall plan and specific details for an new housing
policy paradigm that is based on ongoing, already successful initiatives.
He argues that the problems of public housing and related subsidy
programs is partly a result of a fundamental misunderstanding
of the role which housing plays in social and economic life. He
also argues that replacement policies that emphasized subsidized
rentals risk creating a new generation of problems and complications,
including the further undermining of the social structure of civil
society in poor neighborhoods. According to Husock, housing must
be seen as more than a physical good, and viewed as part of a
social system. or &quot;housing ladder.&quot; The housing ladder
concept relies on the notion that to best serve the most people,
the fullest range of privately owned housing types must be built.
The desire of the occupants of housing to move up the ladder from
one type to another, and the need to protect the value of one's
housing investment, plays a key role in maintaining the social
fabric of neighborhoods, especially very poor neighborhoods. Husock's
concept of the housing ladder comes from historical data that
indicates that private, owner-occupied housing has played a key
role in the lives of those of modest means. He uses examples of
private, public and nonprofit initiatives which have begun to
build or facilitate the construction of the housing that regulation
or deep subsidy programs have made difficult to build in recent
years, that can lead the way to a new housing paradigm. 66 pp.

<P>
Abraham Ellis, a New York City attorney, illustrates that Social
Security is just another entitlement program, not an insurance
system. He also shows that the Trust fund is an &quot;economic
house of cards.&quot; The payments are continuously being raised
regardless of a retiree's contributions. Meanwhile, the receipts
from the Social Security tax go into general government revenue.
Ellis points out, that in the event of a real economic crisis,
the government would have trouble meeting its obligations to elderly
Americans that depend on it. According to Ellis, Social Security
is unfair to prudent young people who could produce much more
for retirement by investing the amount that goes into social security
taxes. Overall, Ellis shows that Social Security is just another
way for getting additional taxes from the people. 208 pp.  CONTACT:

that Social Security either is in trouble today or will be in
trouble within the next 20 years; 60 percent of all Americans
under the age 65 believe that Social Security will not be there
for them when they retire; voters reject most traditional Social
Security reforms such as raising the retirement age, raising payroll
taxes, or reducing benefits; and approximately two-thirds of voters
would support privatization of Social Security, and transforming
it into a privatized mandatory savings program. 7 pp. CONTACT:

the New York Association of Scholars and the Empire Foundation

the State University of New York. They discovered a nationwide
trend in whereby students take an odd mixture of courses that
do not build on previous knowledge, while avoiding more fundamental
and serious subjects. For example, one campus mandates that students
take courses in physical education while at the same time does
not require courses in history, literature, philosophy, arts,
English composition, mathematics or science. In addition, intellectual
permissiveness and political correctness are running rampant on
these campuses with courses such as, &quot;Literature of Sports,&quot;Deviance,&quot;
&quot;Love and Sexuality,&quot; and &quot;Stage Combat.&quot;

<B>Charter Schools in Action: What Have We Learned?</B><br>

<P>
Hudson Institute<HR>

<P>
Finn, Manno and Bierlein report their findings from the first
year of a two-year Hudson Institute study of U.S. charter schools.
The report focuses on the schools' start-up problems, solutions
to those problems, and the policy environments in which such schools
are most apt to thrive or falter. Start-up problems, not surprisingly,
include financial burdens and regulatory and political hurdles.
Among the many recommendations the writers make are setting up
charter schools to be legal entities in their own right, giving
charter schools the same per pupil operating funds that conventional
public schools receive, and using the charter model to develop
ways of holding all public schools accountable for their results.
Hudson suggests that charter schools may be the most vibrant force
in American education today and notes that the current demand
for charter schools far outweighs the supply. 127 pp.  CONTACT:

<B>The New Paradigm on Environmental Enforcement: Environmental
Audit Privilege and Immunity Legislation,</B>
<br>by R. Kinnan Golemon and Laura Wolf
<P>
<I>The State Factor</I>, Vol. 22, No. 1, American Legislative
Exchange Council<HR>

<P>
R. Kinnan Golemon, a prominent expert in the field of Environmental
Law, and Laura Wolf, an environmental lawyer in Austin, present
a new paradigm for environmental enforcement. For the last twenty-five
years environmental regulation has focused on the &quot;command
and control&quot; model. Golemon and Wolf argue that this model,
which has developed an extremely complicated regulatory scheme,
is outdated and needs to change. They believe that a new environmental
regulatory model should focus on and encourage voluntary compliance.
Goleman and Wolf present &quot;audit privileges and penalty immunities&quot;
as part of the solution. These give an incentive for regulated
entities to conduct environmental audits without the fear of major
sanctions. The audits will promote candid, effective discussions
within the regulated entities to help find the causes of, and
the solution to, environmental noncompliance. They will also remove
the incentive to not identify or hide noncompliance so that the
problem can be solved in the most constructive possible way. 13

<B>Privatizing the Public Lands, <BR>
</B>by B. Delworth Gardner
<P>
<I>Focus on Utah</I>, No. 1, Sutherland Institute<HR>

<P>
B. Delworth Gardner, Professor Emeritus of Economics at Brigham
Young University, argues that the federal government should dispose
of its public land in the West, and permit private parties to
own and control the land itself. According to Gardner, private
management is superior to public management in conserving resources.
In economic markets, the future generations are represented by
entrepreneurs who will profit from, and are most interested in,
conserving resources for their future use. She continues by stressing
that consumers and taxpayers are the beneficiaries if market products,
in this case, land use user fees, are priced at competitive levels.
Although some public management products appear to be free or
subsidized, taxpayers must pay for such things as the lobbying,
campaign contributions, propaganda, and court costs that are incurred
in order to influence public decisions. Privatization and market
allocation at a price would make it so each consumer would pay
for what he gets. Resources would be more productive, and products
would increase in variety in order to be tailored toward consumer
tastes. If private entrepreneurs marketed hunting and fishing
privileges, they would manage the resources more efficiently and
more successfully. Private firms also have a greater incentive
to stop undesirable managerial behavior than government bureaucrats.
Finally, Gardner argues that the federal government should gradually
dispose of the public lands, and they should try alternative ways
for privatizing the public lands, such as long-term competitive
leasing of public lands to private groups. 17 pp. CONTACT: Sutherland

John Tottie, Senior Economist for Tax and Budget at Citizens for
a Sound Economy, examines the $47 billion in research and development
(R&amp;D) spending by the Department of Energy (DOE)-supposedly
for the benefit of taxpayers and the U.S. economy. In the early
days of the 104th Congress, DOE published &quot;Success Stories:
The Energy Mission in the Marketplace,&quot; highlighting what
the department thought were its successes in applied energy research
and development. The 22 page report seems like an attempt to fight
off the much needed reductions in the bloated spending by DOE
on R&amp;D. Tottie argues that the private industry that stands
to benefit from the R&amp;D spending, not taxpayers, should be
responsible for the costs associated with developing scientific
knowledge that has specific commercial applications.  8 pp. CONTACT:

<P>
The Competitive Enterprise Institute commissioned <I>The Polling
Company</I> to perform a nationwide poll of 1,000 registered voters
nationwide. They found that most Americans support environmental
protection, but are not activists. They also found that most Americans
support a greater role for state and local governments in environmental
policy, and that state and local governments are better suited
at addressing environmental concerns than the federal government.
According to the survey, most Americans see devolution, regulatory
reform, and property rights as being consistent with environmental
protection. Also, Americans see nothing anti-environment about
alternative approaches to environmental policy. CEI argues that
the challenge for supporters of environmental regulatory reform
is to articulate a vision for the future of environmental policy
that combines the public's concern for environmental protection
with their preference for limited government policies. Americans
have come to realize that extensive federal bureaucracies are
not necessary to advance environmental protection, and that pursuing
environmental reform is not &quot;anti-environment.&quot; 25 pp.

<B>A New Environmental Tool? Assessing Life Cycle Assessment,
</B> 
<br>
by Mark Duda and Jane Shaw
<P>
<I>Contemporary Issues Series</I>, No. 81, Center for the Study
of American Business<HR>

<P>
&quot;Life cycle assessment&quot; (LCA) is a process that attempts
to measure the total environmental impact of a product and its
manufacturing process. Mark Duda, Fellow at the Political Economy
Research Center (PERC), and Jane Shaw, a Senior Associate of PERC,
discuss the reasons why this procedure should not be used to shape
public policy. According to Duda and Shaw, LCA is useful to companies
that want to know whether the raw material they use might become
scarce or become environmentally harmful. When companies use LCA
their data is generally reliable and their goals are usually clear.
If such procedures were used for public policy and regulatory
purposes, argue Duda and Shaw, it would require that practitioners
use data from a wide range of sources and then translate this
data into environmental impacts. The averages and aggregates produced
would be inaccurate and would not describe the differences between
one product and another. According to Duda and Shaw, it is hard
to translate resource consumption and emissions data into actual
environmental impacts. For example it does not take into consideration
the environment in which production occurs. Overall, they conclude,
LCA makes sense for individual firms, which use it to plan how
they will respond to environmental regulations and to the environmental
concerns of their customers. If LCA information is collected at
the industry level it is not sufficiently accurate for making
broad public policy decisions.  20 pp. CONTACT: Center for the

<B>A Turf Fight for Indoor Air Quality Protection, <BR>
</B>by Dwight Lee
<P>
<I>Contemporary Issues Series</I>, No. 79, Center for the Study
of American Business<HR>

<P>
Dwight Lee, an Adjunct Fellow for the Center for the Study of
American Business, discusses the bureaucratic turf war over the
control and regulation of indoor air. The Occupational Safety
and Health Administration (OSHA) has jurisdiction over workplace
safety and is in a fight with the Environmental Protection Agency
over jurisdiction of indoor air quality (IAQ) in the workplace.
The agency that is able to gain control over IAQ will be in a
good position to expand its budget and power. According to Lee,
EPA and OSHA are using the political issue of tobacco smoke to
muscle for their larger budgets. OSHA has made a proposal to ban
smoking in all work sites under its jurisdiction. According to
Lee, OSHA's position relies on flawed and biased studies that
emphasize that indoor pollution can be addressed by singling out
particular pollutants such as tobacco smoke. In reality, indoor
air pollution is a general problem that cannot be effectively
dealt with by singling out particular pollutants. Lee argues that
OSHA ignores cost saving alternative approaches, ignores the advantages
of market incentives and exaggerates the benefits of regulation.
Overall, it exploits the politically contentious issue of tobacco
to grab for more power. Lee concludes that the only argument that
can be made for OSHA IAQ regulation is that it would be no more
inefficient than EPA regulation.  16 pp. CONTACT: Center for the

Bruce Yandle, an Adjunct Fellow at The Progress &amp; Freedom
Foundation, Andy Barnett, Associate Professor of Economics at
Auburn University, and Mark Brandly, a doctoral candidate in economics
at Auburn, call for the creation of Environmental Innovation Areas
(EIAs). EIAs will recognize that different regions face different
environmental and pollution problems. Different regions should
be given flexibility to meet clean air requirements in ways that
are best suited for their particular area, instead of the top-down
command and control system that we currently have. Yandle, Barnett
and Brandly call for an end to federal fuel taxes that discriminate
against alternative fuels. With EIAs, states and regions could
design fuel taxes that encourage the appropriate use of cleaner
burning fuels for their area. Changing the laws that discriminate
against alternative fuel vehicles will be a lower cost way to
improve automobile efficiency and a reduction in American reliance
on imported petroleum than Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE)
standards. 57 pp. CONTACT: Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation,

<B>The Privatization Process: A Worldwide Perspective,</B>
<br>
Edited by Terry Anderson and Peter Hill<HR>

<P>
The editors of this collection of essays, Terry Anderson, Executive
Director of PERC (the Political Economy Research Center), and
Peter Hill, a Senior Associate of PERC, argue that the 1980s and
1990s will be remembered in history as the era of privatization.
The trend of privatization, which was in part, inspired by the
collapse of the former Soviet Union, is being hotly debated throughout
American government. This book is a collection of original essays
by distinguished scholars that examine the potential benefits,
as well as the possible pitfalls, of national and global privatization.
This book also provides several perspective on how privatization
can best be achieved. With the support of empirical evidence,
the various authors asses the institutional changes and economic
impact of this worldwide trend. 270 pp. CONTACT: Rowman &amp;

by Bob Moffit and Ed Meese
<P>
<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1089, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
Bob Moffit, Deputy Director of Domestic Policy Studies at The
Heritage Foundation, and Ed Meese, former Attorney General of
The United States and Ronald Reagan Distinguished Fellow at The
Heritage Foundation, present twenty-one steps that public officials
can take to support their local police. Moffit and Meese draw
upon the success of former New York City Commissioner of Police
William Bratton's short tenure, in which serious crime dropped
36 percent, including a 44 percent drop in auto theft and a 45
percent drop in murder. A reduction in crime does not depend upon
new cars or computers, more officers and bigger budgets. What
is most important, this paper says, is solid personnel management
and a clear mission for combating crime and disorder, with support
from the public, the state and the courts, and the press. Moffit
and Meese give the following suggestions for specific ways that
local officials can strengthen their police forces through their
own efforts: police should have a more back to basics role; police
should combat minor &quot;disorder&quot; crimes that provide an
environment for more serious crimes; raise the standards for who
can become a police officer; improve police compensation; target
hot spots; and reduce caseloads for detectives, among other suggestions.
Moffit and Meese call on the federal government to: block the
appointment of federal judges who demonstrate an insensitivity
to public safety; review federal statutes dealing with crime,
and repeal the ones that impinge on the legitimate authority of
local and state law enforcement officials; review the impact of
the <I>Miranda</I> ruling; and pursue ways through enterprise
zones to revitalize inner-city neighborhoods among other suggestions.
Overall, states and localities need maximum flexibility to combat
violent crime. 37 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage

<I>Government Integrity Project Report</I>, No. 10, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
Ken Weinstein, Director of the Government Reform Project at the
Heritage Foundation, reports that under the Clinton Administration
a string of federal grants have continued to subsidize the Laborers'
International Union of North America (LIUNA) even as government
investigators were uncovering evidence of organized criminal influence
in the union. Weinstein argues that restrictions or elimination
of grants to politically active groups such as unions should be
seriously considered by Congress. Meanwhile, Congress should act
immediately to: require that relevant grantmakers at certain federal
bureaus testify about their knowledge of allegations of criminal
infiltration of LIUNA; prohibit organizations whose officers have
records of criminal wrongdoing from receiving federal grants;
renew efforts to restrict lobbying by federal grantees; and order
a General Accounting Office investigation into LIUNA's handling
of federal grants. Weinstein concludes by pointing out that it
is bad enough that mandatory dues from union members are used
to pay for corruption and political activities, tax payers should
not have to pay as well. 9 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The

<B>Civil Right and Sexual Behavior: An Analysis of the Employment
Non-Discrimination Act, <BR>
</B>by Paul Mero
<P>
<I>Insight</I>, Family Research Council<HR>

<P>
Paul Mero, a political consultant and congressional staffer, examines
how the Employment Non-Discrimination Act might lead to the adoption
of the entire homosexual rights agenda. He argues that organized
homosexuality, the political pragmatic side of the homosexuality
movement, has narrowly worded this bill as a calculated risk that
the final determination of this legislation will rest on some
very fundamental notions about homosexuality <I>per se</I>, and
whether or not mainstream America will accept these notions. According
to Mero, the narrowly worded language of the legislation is very
ambiguous and includes the curious term &quot;bisexual.&quot;
Mero says this term is one of the calculated risks with which
organized homosexuality is testing mainstream America. &quot;Bisexual,&quot;
is a person that has sex with both men and women. Unlike the word
&quot;lesbianism&quot; or &quot;homosexuality,&quot; which some
of the public can accept as possibly genetic traits, bisexuality
cannot be taken seriously, according to Mero. He argues that amending
the 1964 Civil Rights Act with the word &quot;bisexual&quot; would
be the same as society granting its crowning approval of promiscuous
sexual activity and to renounce marriage and traditional mores.
It would be no different than implying that promiscuity is a genetic
trait. Or it seriously confuses behavior with orientation. Mero
concludes by showing how organized homosexuality has exploited
the Hate Crimes Bill to further their agenda. They did it claiming
victimhood, confusing homosexuality with innate human properties
such as skin color, using bogus studies to support quantitative
claims of discrimination, winning the endorsement of former &quot;conservative&quot;
Republicans, and taking the media along for the ride with their
disregard for facts. Many of the same components exist for the
Employment Non-Discrimination Act. 17 pp. CONTACT: Family Research

<B>Feminist Jurisprudence: Equal Rights or Neo-Paternalism?</B>
<br>by Michael Weiss and Cathy Young
<P>
<I>Policy Analysis</I> No. 256, Cato Institute<HR>

<P>
Cato Associate Policy Analyst, Cathy Young, and University of
Houston Law Professor, Michael Weiss, argue that the rise of feminist
jurisprudence has gone far beyond the original and widely supported
goal of equal treatment for both sexes. According to Young and
Weiss, the new feminist legal theory agenda is to redistribute
power from the &quot;dominant class&quot; (men) to the &quot;subordinate
class&quot; (women), while such key concepts of Western jurisprudence
as judicial neutrality and individual rights are declared to be
patriarchal fictions designed to protect male privilege. Some
feminist-initiated legal reforms have addressed real wrongs such
as the inadequate protection for victims of domestic violence.
However, say Young and Weiss, feminist legal theory has resulted
in increasingly loose and subjective definitions of harassment
and rape, dangerous moves to eviscerate the presumption of innocence
in sexual assault cases, and a broad concept of self-defense in
cases of battered wives. The authors conclude that Courts and
legislatures should not limit individual rights and reaffirm the
fundamental principle of the classical liberal origins of the
movement for women's rights: equality before the law regardless
of gender. 63 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts

by Christine Olson and Robert Rector
<P>
<I>Issue Bulletin</I>, No. 228, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
According to Christine Olson, Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation,
and Robert Rector, Senior Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation,
The American Community Renewal Act of 1996 (H.R. 3467) will promote
the moral renewal and economic revitalization of America's most
poverty-stricken urban and rural areas. The bill is sponsored
by Representatives J.C. Watts (OK) and James Talent (MO). It will
use tax incentives, regulatory relief, innovative school reform
pilot projects and homeownership incentives for areas of high
rates of poverty, crime, welfare dependency, joblessness, and
poor schools. Olson and Rector argue that the bill will achieve:
increased job creation; small business expansion and formation;
moral renewal; expanded educational opportunities; greater private
philanthropy to aid the poor; and greater participation by religious
organizations in providing services to the poor. This bill gives
Congress and the Administration an opportunity to change the way
the federal government has been involved in community development
over the last 30 years. The bill realizes that what our nation's
poorest communities need more than larger benefits checks from
the government is economic conditions that enable depressed communities
to become more profitable places for work and businesses. Olson
and Rector conclude that this bill represents an excellent opportunity
to make a bipartisan stand for children by tackling the root causes
of poverty, crime, and illegitimacy. 18 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain,

<br>by Pat Fagan and Wade Horn
<P>
<I>Issue Bulletin</I>, No. 227, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
Pat Fagan, William H. G. FitzGerald Fellow in Family and Cultural
Studies at The Heritage Foundation, and Wade Horn, Director of
The National Fatherhood Initiative, illustrate how Congress can
protect the rights of parents to raise their children. They argue
that the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act, introduced
by Senator Charles Grassley (IA) and Representative Steve Largent
(OK), will give parents superior standing over government and
its agencies in their children's education and in the protection
and formation of their children's moral character. Fagan and Horn
point out that the bill will declare that parents' rights to direct
the upbringing of their children are fundamental rights which
government can curtail only under conditions of &quot;compelling
interest&quot; and under &quot;strict guidelines&quot; of judicial
procedure, legal terms which guide courts in their decisions.
Overall, they say, the rights of parents as a group are disregarded
or endangered in too many cases by government officials. According
to Fagan and Horn, because of the persistent danger to the fundamental
rights of parents from state court rulings, professional associations,
government bureaucracies, the educational establishment, and international
agencies and bodies, parental rights need codification into law.

John Walters, President of the New Citizenship Project, and James
O'Gara, Director of Research for the New Citizenship Project,
call for President Clinton to exercise leadership in the war on
drugs. They report that he has a poor record in this area. Interdiction
efforts and prosecution for illegal drugs are down, illegal drug
usage and emergency room admissions are up. Walters and O'Gara
argue that part of the problem has been not appointing effective
leaders in key positions to articulate and enforce a strong antidrug
message, and inappropriate reductions in staff at agencies dedicated
to fighting drugs on the front lines. They call on Congress to
focus federal efforts on law enforcement and programs that work,
and fund only those rehabilitation programs that have a track
record of success. One way to do this is to allow funding for
drug counseling and rehabilitation programs provided by religious
organizations. Walters and O'Gara conclude that American taxpayers
deserve presidential leadership on this issue, and the complexity
of the issue is not an excuse for ineffective policy and lack
of serious effort. 15 pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage

Edward Lazear, Hoover Senior Fellow, discusses how the culture
wars in America threaten our ability to absorb new immigrants,
and to benefit from the diversity already present in the United
States. He argues that much of the conflict of the culture wars
in America is generated by government policies that reduce the
incentives to become assimilated and emphasize the differences
in the population. Some examples that Lazear lists are: education
in one's native language; unbalanced immigration policies that
result in large and stable ghettos, welfare availability; and
encouragement of a multilingual society by allowing citizens to
vote in languages other than English. Lazear explores patterns
of cultural assimilation and makes recommendations on policy related
to immigration, education, and language that may lead to an end
of the culture wars. 32 pp. CONTACT: Hoover Institution Press,

<B>Federal Drug War Ignoring Great Ally: Faith-Based Treatment,
</B><br>
by Robert Maginnis
<P>
<I>Insight</I>, Family Research Council<HR>

<P>
Robert Maginnis, Senior Policy Analyst at the Family Research
Council, illustrates how the government is actively discouraging
some of the most effective programs from drug treatment. Faith-based
drug treatment programs have consistently produced the highest
&quot;cure&quot; rates in the country for treating drug abusers.
State and federal agencies have tried to shut down several faith
based drug treatment centers because their practitioners did not
have proper medical qualifications This is despite the fact that
faith-based treatment has had much higher success rates at a fraction
of the cost of government endorsed centers. Maginnis says that
there are two differing schools of thought on the root causes
of drug addiction. Government agencies mostly believe that it
is a disease and should be treated as such. Faith based treatment
sees addiction as beginning with a moral problem and that treatment
requires an acceptance of moral absolutes. Maginnis says that
as far as drug treatment goes, one size does not fit all. Therefore
a diversity of treatment alternatives, including low cost taxpayer-free
and faith based programs must be available. The government should
not try to fight the drug war alone when the local faith community
can play a vital role in prevention and treatment. 12 pp. CONTACT:

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS</FONT></B>
<HR>
<P>
<B>Violence Against Women Act Declared Unconstitutional</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>CIR won a victory on July 26, 1996, when U.S. District
Judge Jackson L. Diser ruled that the Violence Against Women Act
(&quot;VAWA&quot;), was an impermissible exercise of Congressional
authority under the Commerce Clause and the Enforcement Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment. In<I> Brzonkala v. Virginia Polytechnic
and State University</I>, CIR represents Antonio Morrison, a Virginia
Tech football player, who was sued, along with two teammates and
the University itself, by a female who formerly attended the school.
The July 26th Order granted CIR's Motion to Dismiss the case based
on VAWA's unconstitutionality.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>At issue in the <I>Brzonkala</I> litigation was the
section of VAWA providing a federal tort remedy for crimes of
violence motivated by an animus toward the victim's gender. Although
the Department of Justice and the National Organization for Women
argued that VAWA was constitutional because of (i) the enormous
impact gender-based crimes have on the national economy and interstate
commerce and (ii) Congress's power to enforce the Equal Protection
Clause, the court disagreed. Judge Kiser ruled that the Supreme
Court's recent decision in <I>Lopez v. United States</I>, striking
down the Gun-Free School Zones Act as beyond Congress's Commerce
Clause power, undermined the arguments of DOJ and NOW. Finding
extensive similarities and few distinctions between the School
Zones Act and VAWA, Judge Kiser held that the latter was also
unconstitutional.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As for the Enforcement Clause claim,  Judge Kiser
points out, VAWA attempts to compensate women who are victims
of violent acts because of their gender, not because of the states'
denial of their Equal Protection.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>CIR to Represent School Board in Supreme Court</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>CIR, along with Michael Carvin of Shaw, Pittman,
Potts and Trowbridge, represents the Bossier Parish School Board
in <I>Reno v. Bossier Parish School Board</I>, a Voting Rights
Act case which should be argued during the Supreme Court's fall
1996 term. This is expected to test a question left unanswered
by the Court in its major Voting Rights decisions of last term:
whether a local government may be forced to create racially gerrymandered
districts.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Bossier Parish is a rural district of northern Louisiana,
with a minority population of about twenty percent. Because of
the highly scattered nature of the minority population, every
voting subdivision in the parish currently has a white majority.
This has not prevented African-Americans from winning local elective
offices in the past.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In 1993, the Bossier Parish School Board unanimously
accepted a new voting map with twelve districts, all of which
had white majorities. The district lines were based upon nonracial
considerations; an identical plan had already been approved for
use in other elections. Nonetheless, the Justice Department refused
to dilute minority voting strength. This refusal was based in
part on the development by the NAACP of an alternate map, which
would include two oddly-shaped (but majority-minority) districts.
The Justice Department has taken the position that the Voting
Rights Act requires a system of race-based proportional representation,
or, alternately, that the failure to embrace a gerrymandered map
is proof of racist intent.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Professor Sues Bowling Green State University
for Sex and Race Discrimination</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In <I>Hartman v. Trustees of Bowling Green State
University</I>, CIR is representing Dr. John Hartman, a white
male professor, who has sued Bowling Green and the Accrediting
Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications for
discrimination against him based on his race and sex. The Complaint
was filed July 1, 1996 in Federal District Court in Ohio.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In 1994, in response to an advertisement, Dr. Hartman,
a tenured professor of Mass Communications at Central Michigan
University, applied for a faculty position that would involve
teaching a class on diversity in media at Bowling Green. Despite
Dr. Hartman's excellent credentials, Bowling Green hired a less
experienced black female without a Ph.D. This hiring decision
came on the heels of the Accrediting Council's withdrawal of full
accreditation from the Bowling Green School of Journalism because
the percentages of women and minorities on its faculty were less
than those in the general population.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Ohio Civil Rights Commission previously concluded
that there was probable cause to believe that Bowling Green discriminated
against Dr. Hartman in this matter.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Columbia Union College Sues Maryland Officials
for Religious Discrimination</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In June CIR, along with Co-Counsel R. Hewitt Pate,
Sarah C. Johnson and Mark B. Bierbower of Hunton &amp; Williams,
filed a complaint on behalf of Columbia Union College in Federal
District Court in Maryland. The Complaint alleges First and Fourteenth
Amendment violations, and violations of the Religious Freedom
Restoration Act.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Columbia Union is a private college affiliated with
the Seventh-day Adventist Church that applied for funds from the
State of Maryland through the Father Sellinger Program. The Maryland
Higher Education Commission denied the fund request stating that
Columbia Union was &quot;pervasively sectarian.&quot; The Commission
has granted funds to Catholic schools such as Mount St. Mary's
and Loyola University, schools which, although &quot;sectarian,&quot;
are apparently not pervasively so. Columbia Union met all the
other requirements necessary to participate in the program and
asserts that the denial of funding by the Commission constitutes
discrimination on the basis of its religious beliefs and speech.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>CIR wins reversal in Fourth Circuit in <BR>
<I><B>Smith v. VCU</B></I></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In <I>Smith, et al v. Virginia Commonwealth University</I>,
CIR is representing five male professors at VCU who claimed sex
discrimination when the school gave an en masse raise to female
professors in 1992. On May 10, 1996 an <I>en banc</I> panel of
the Fourth Circuit issued a decision reversing a district court's
grant of summary judgment for the University. The opinion of the
court obtained the support of six judges with three judges concurring
and five dissenting.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The <I>en banc</I> decision rejected VCU's attempt
to justify the raises with a regression analysis showing pay disparity
between the genders. The court said that there was an issue of
material fact whether some of the factors excluded from VCU's
study-like performance, productivity and merit-skewed the results
and permitted a false finding of &quot;gender disparity.&quot;

<HR>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>High Court to Decide Who Can Sue Under ESA</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments on November
13, 1996 in <I>Bennett v. Spears</I>, to determine whether a property
owner may assert an injury to an economic interest or constitutionally
protected property right under the citizens suit provision of
the Endangered Species Act (ESA).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Petitioners are two individual ranchers and two irrigation
districts in southern Oregon who rely on water from a series of
federally-operated reservoirs known as the Klamath Project. The
U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
determined that a minimum level of water needed to be maintained
in the reservoirs to preserve endangered fish species that inhabit
the reservoirs. However, maintaining this water level threatened
Petitioners' beneficial and productive use of their property by
making the supply of irrigation water irregular.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Petitioners filed a &quot;citizen's suit&quot; under
Section 11(g)(1) of the ESA, challenging the decision on the ground
that the government failed to consider economic factors in making
the decision. The federal district court dismissed the suit, and
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding
that the petitioners' economic interest did not fall within the
&quot;zone of interests&quot; protected by the ESA.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Defenders has argued that Congress specifically included
economic factors among those to be considered in making decisions
under the ESA. Furthermore, protecting private property rights
and economic interests is an integral part of species conservation.
Therefore, economic interests are within the &quot;zone of interest&quot;
protected by the ESA and petitioners should have standing to bring
a citizen's suit to protect those interests.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Federal Pressure on Local School Board Violates
Constitution</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In <I>Sakaria &amp; Hillman v. Dare County (North
Carolina) Board of Education</I>, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
orchestrated the condemnation of private beachfront property for
wetland mitigation, by backing a county school board into a corner
over a required wetland permit. The owners of the property that
is being condemned are now petitioning the United States Supreme
Court to review their case.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Petitioners Elpis Sakaria and Mr. and Mrs. Hillman
each purchased a residential beachfront lot on Cape Hatteras Island,
North Carolina, to build a retirement home. Adjacent to the lots
is the local school. In 1988 the School Board needed to expand
the school's athletic field, to qualify the school for accreditation.
The Board owned 12.5 acres next door, enough for the expansion.
However, the Army Corps delineated 3 acres &quot;wetland,&quot;
and arbitrarily required the Board to create 1.84 acres of wetland
for each acre of wetland used to expand the field.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>From 1988 to 1992, the Army Corps rejected 41 sites
suggested for mitigation. With time growing short to obtain accreditation,
the Board &quot;negotiated&quot; an outcome with the Corps: the
Corps would grant a permit if the application included creating
a .5-acre wetland on the Sakaria and Hillman properties. The Board
filed the permit application, and immediately began to condemn
the private property. The property owners challenged the validity
of the condemnation of their property on Fifth and Tenth Amendment
grounds, but so far have been unsuccessful in court.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Defenders will file a brief <I>amici curaie</I> supporting
a Petition for Writ of Certiorari before the United States Supreme
Court arguing that 1) coercion by the Army Corps of the county
school board to carry out a federal objective at the local level
violates the Tenth Amendment and 2) a state agency violates the
Fifth Amendment when it uses its power of eminent domain to accomplish
a federal purpose unrelated to its narrow grant of eminent domain
authority.<BR>

<B>Hog-Wild Regulators Jeopardize Family Farm</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Warren family has been raising hogs in Chesapeake,
Virginia for three generations. But Earl Warren's livelihood is
now at risk because of a new city ordinance enacted specifically
to regulate him out of business.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>For over sixty years, the Warrens have operated a
traditional feed-lot hog farm. Over time, urban expansion has
moved into rural areas and now surrounds their farm. The Warrens,
however, have been able to adapt up until now by simply down-sizing
their operation.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Recently, the city has grown more aggressive in its
effort to make Chesapeake hog-fee, and adopted a new swine control
ordinance in April of 1992. Despite Mr. Warren's good faith attempts
to conform his hog-farming practices to the ordinance, many of
its mandates are arbitrary and have nothing to do with public
health and safety-making full compliance impossible. Indeed, the
farm has continued to comply with applicable environmental standards.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>If Mr. Warren does not fully comply, however, he
faces being shut down as a &quot;public nuisance.&quot; This flies
in the face of the U.S. Supreme Court's admonition in <I>Lucas
v. South Carolina Coastal Council</I> that a legislature cannot
simply decree a historically lawful use of property a &quot;nuisance&quot;
without compensation being paid to the owner. In a lawsuit filed
against Mr. Warren on March 30, 1995, the city has openly stated
in court that its goal is to permanently close down the farm.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Even though the city is suing Mr. Warren, it has
not yet met its own burden of demonstrating that the farm is a
nuisance according to Virginia common law. Defenders' attorney
Barry C. Hodge is defending Mr. Warren in Circuit Court in Chesapeake.
A trial was held on September 8, 1995, but the court has stayed
its decision to hear further evidence as to the feasibility of
complying with the ordinance.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>In 1950, a right-of-way was sold to the gas company
across what is now the Drain's property to install an eight-inch
gas pipeline. The agreement did not specify the width of the right-of-way,
therefore full use was made of the property over the years. A
shed was built six inches from the line in 1962, and the Drains
installed their modular home seven and a half feet from it in
1992.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In April of 1993, however, Columbia Gas informed
the drains that their buildings encroached on the company's newly
claimed fifty-foot right-of-way, and later sued the Drains to
force them to move the buildings. According to Columbia, the Drains
cannot put any structures-including fences and trees-within twenty-five
feet of either side of the pipeline. The new easement affects
one-third of their property.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Columbia Gas bases its authority of federal pipeline
safety standards. Columbia asserts that these regulations allow
it to claim a fifty-foot right of way without having to purchase
the Drains' property through eminent domain. Federal regulation,
however, does not require a gas company to maintain a fifty-foot
right-of-way. Another inconsistency is that many other property
owners have buildings within the claimed easement boundaries who
have not been force to move them under pressure from the gas company.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>With Defenders serving as co-counsel, the Drains
filed a counterclaim alleging Columbia Gas's action was an unconstitutional
taking of their private property. After a three-day non-jury trial,

Rights Violation</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Petitioner, Mrs. Evelyn Smith, earns a living by
renting four townhouses she owns in Chico, California. Due to
her religious beliefs, she refused to rent a townhouse to an unmarried
heterosexual couple. The couple complained to the California Fair
Employment and Housing Commission, which found Mrs. Smith guilty
of unlawful &quot;marital status discrimination&quot; under state
law and prohibited Mrs. Smith from excluding heterosexual unmarried
couples from her property, even though &quot;heterosexual couples&quot;
is not a constitutionally protected class. The California Supreme
Court affirmed the decision, stating that Mrs. Smith could have
avoided the conflict &quot;by selling her units and redeploying
the capital in other investments.&quot; Mrs. Smith has petitioned
the United States Supreme Court to review the decision, on the
basis that the California law violates her First Amendment right
to religious free exercise and her Fifth Amendment property rights.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Defenders presented the Fifth Amendment argument
in its brief to the Court supporting Mrs. Smith's petition for
review, that the California law violates Fifth Amendment rights.
Specifically, the law deprives Mrs. Smith of her right to exclude
others, which is among the property rights protected by the Fifth
Amendment Just Compensation Clause, and which has been identified
by the United States Supreme Court as one of the most fundamental
aspects of property ownership.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Challenge to Large-Lot Zoning on Chappaquiddick</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court will hear
a challenge to a local zoning by-law that imposes a three-acre
minimum to build on residential lots on Chappaquiddick. The purported
public interest underlying the three-acre minimum was environmental
protection.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Petitioner Herring Creek Farm owns 215 acres of residential
property on the Island and had planned to develop it with homes
on one-acre lots for low- to moderate-income families. At trial,
Herring Creek showed that the three acre minimum did not advance
the stated environmental goals and further that the large lot
sizes makes home ownership nearly impossible for middle- and lower-income
families. The trial court upheld the by-law. This appeal to the
highest court in the state followed directly from that decision,
bypassing the intermediate appeals court due to the interest in
the high court in establishing statewide guidance on this issue.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Defenders argued as <I>amicus curiae</I> supporting
Herring Creed that the zoning restriction is constitutionally
invalid because it fails to &quot;substantially advance&quot;
the government interest in protecting the environment. The United
States Supreme Court has held that a law that derogates from private
property rights is invalid if the law does not substantially advance
the goal sought to be achieved by the law. Oral argument is currently
scheduled before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.<BR>

<B>Indians Claim Right to Harvest Shellfish on Private Property</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Years before Washington became a state, the United
States purchased by treaty from 16 Northwest Indian Tribes the
right to use the beach and surrounding upland in Puget Sound.
Under the treaties, the Tribes retained their right to take &quot;fish&quot;
from all customary locations not staked off or occupied by settlers.
The State of Washington later took title to the tidelands and
sold them to private citizens. These private landowners have &quot;seeded&quot;
the tidelands to create new shellfish beds, and have harvested
the shellfish, enjoying exclusive use and quiet enjoyment of the
tidelands for over a century.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Now the United States-on behalf of the Tribes-is
suing the State of Washington, claiming that the Tribes' right
to &quot;fish&quot; includes the right to harvest shellfish even
on privately owned tidelands. The United States has offered no
payment of just compensation for its destruction of these private
property rights on behalf of the Indian Tribes. The outcome of
this case between the federal and state governments will affect
200,000 private property owners. The federal district court decided
the case in favor of the Tribes. The case is now before the United
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Defenders filed a brief <I>amicus curiae</I> in the
Ninth Circuit on behalf of 65,000 members of the Upland Property
Owners of Washington (UPOW), which has intervened in the lawsuit.
Defenders advanced three property rights arguments. First, the
United States' claim to fishing rights for the Tribes constitutes
a physical invasion of private property and second, destroys the
private owners' investment-backed expectations in the tidelands.
Third, Defenders argued that the government's position in this
case violates the Equal Footing Doctrine, which requires that
any state admitted to the Union must be granted all rights and
privileges given to the original thirteen states.<BR>

<B>Milwaukee School Choice Action</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As expected, Wisconsin Circuit Court Judge Paul Higginbotham
in August refused to lift an injunction preventing Milwaukee school
children from attending religious schools in the choice program,
and ruled that the program violates the religion clause of the
Wisconsin Constitution. However, the judge dissolved the remainder
of the injunction, meaning that at least 300 more youngsters will
be able to attend nonsectarian schools this year.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The ruling followed four hours of testimony and three
hours of oral argument. Former Milwaukee Public Schools superintendent
Howard Fuller led off with testimony on why the choice program
is essential not only to expand opportunities for minority and
economically disadvantaged kids, but to foment needed reform in
the public schools.  Zakiya Courtney testified on the real-world
effects of the program and the injunction. Two parents, Pilar
Gonzalez and Val Johnson-representing hundreds of others-offered
personal perspectives on what private schools have meant for their
children and economic burdens the families face in keeping them
there. Harvard professor Paul Peterson testified on his recent
study finding substantial academic gains among choice students.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Unfortunately, it was clear that Judge Higginbotham,
though moved by IJ's witnesses' testimony, found the religious
school aspect of the program untenable. He concluded that the
Wisconsin Constitution is more prohibitive than the First Amendment,
and that the program's &quot;primary effect&quot; is to advance
religion.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>But Judge Higginbotham was not persuaded that the
plaintiffs showed a reasonable likelihood of prevailing on their
other state constitutional claims, so he lifted the rest of the
injunction on the enrollment caps. That means the number of eligible
students increases from 1,500 to 15,000; and that schools may
enroll up to 100 percent of their students from the choice program
(up from 65 percent.) Last year, about 1,500 choice students were
enrolled in nonsectarian schools in the choice program. This year,
about 1,900 applied to nonsectarian schools. They now will be
able to attend, which also somewhat relieves the pressure on the
PAVE program to provide scholarships.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>On the litigation front, IJ will attempt to extricate
the religion issues from the remainder of the case and seek an
immediate appeal of that portion of the judge's ruling. The non-religion
issues are schedule for three rounds of briefs and argument before
Judge Higginbotham over the next three months. Also, on the eve
of the hearing, the NAACP filed a lawsuit claiming the expanded
program promotes racial segregation. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Religious School Choice in Vermont</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The IJ will file a lawsuit this week against the State of Vermont
on behalf of the Chittenden school board. The board voted to include
religious high schools among those available to students at public
expense. (Vermont towns that have no public  high schools pay
tuition for students at neighboring public high schools or private
schools.) Contending that tuition payment at religious schools
chosen by parents violates the First Amendment, the state has
cut off all education funds to the town, even though the portion
that would be allocated for religious high school tuition constitutes
only two percent of the town's education funding.</FONT><BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The IJ will seek a preliminary injunction in state
court, arguing that (1) including religious schools among the
options does not violate the First Amendment, (2) exclusion of
religious schools violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act,
and (3) the cutoff of state funds exceeds the state's authority.

<B>Landmark Legal Foundation Blasts Senate Ethics Committee</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Landmark Legal Foundation, co-counsel to former RTC
criminal investigator L. Jean Lewis, who last year testified before
the Senate Special Committee investigating Whitewater, blasted
the Senate Ethics Committee for its failure to sanction Maryland
Senator Paul Sarbanes and the Whitewater Committee's minority
chief counsel, Richard Ben-Veniste, for their use of a private
letter written by Lewis, which was &quot;undeleted&quot; from
a computer diskette.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The Ethics Committee completely abdicated its
responsibility to Ms. Lewis and to all Americans. Senators and
Senate staffers are not above the law,&quot; said Landmark President
Mark R. Levin, who filed the ethics complaint on Lewis's behalf
last December. &quot;They are not free to behave as rogue federal
police violating the privacy rights of witnesses appearing before
Congress. Nor are they free to take a witness's personal property,
which they did in this case.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Lewis's 22-page personal letter, which was unrelated
to Lewis's work in investigating Madison Guaranty Savings and
Loan and the Whitewater Development Corporation, was apparently
retrieved by computer technicians from a computer diskette Lewis
produced in response to the Senate Whitewater Committee's subpoena
for information relevant to her investigative work. Since her
letter was not subject to the Whitewater Committee's subpoena
as it fell outside its subject matter and time frame, when Senator
Sarbanes and Ben-Veniste retrieved it from the diskette they violated
Ms. Lewis's Fourth Amendment privacy rights.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Astonishingly, the Ethics Committee did not
talk with Ms. Lewis or her counsel at any time during the nine
months following the filing of the complaint, though it apparently
interviewed Senator Sarbanes and Ben-Veniste to return to Ms.
Lewis her personal property; and, it offered no explanation or
justification for its summary dismissal of our complaint,&quot;
declared Levin. &quot;When the Constitution can be so easily trampled,
when an individual's rights can be so easily ignored, and when
Ethics Committee members close their eyes to these abuses, there
is something terribly wrong in the U.S. Senate.&quot;<BR>

Whether Students' Rights to Free Speech Includes Giving Religious
Messages At Graduation Ceremonies</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>On August 14, 1996, the Eleventh Circuit Court of
Appeals reheard oral arguments in the case of <I>Adler v. Duval
County School Board</I>. This case is on appeal from a decision
of a federal district court in Florida which held that a school
board policy permitting students to determine what type of graduation
message they would give does not violate the Constitution, even
if that message includes religious speech. Arguments were presented
to the Eleventh Circuit in March 1995 on this case. The court
did not hand down a decision, but instead has asked to hear further
argument.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The case began in May 1993 by challenging a school
board policy allowing the graduating senior class to elect to
have two minutes of uncensored speech to open or close the graduation
ceremonies. If the students chose to utilize the two minutes,
they would then elect a fellow student to address the class. The
content of the message was to be determined by the student addressing
the class and was not to be censored by the school. The school
policy allowed students to give any type of message, from poetic
speech to religious speech. During the 1993 graduation ceremonies
of the 17 schools in Duval County, 6 senior classes chose either
no message or a secular message, while the remaining 11 chose
a religious message.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The ACLU brought suit on behalf of 3 students against
the Duval County School Board arguing that this policy allowed
religious messages or prayer and thus violated the First Amendment.
Liberty Counsel, a religious civil liberties legal defense organization,
intervened on behalf of 11 students to defend the school policy,
arguing that the free speech rights of students was at stake.
If the school board were to lose the case, the students' free
speech rights would be taken away.<BR>

Idaho have just as much right to sue regarding violations of federal
environmental statutes as do organized environmental groups says
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. In a decision
reversing a federal district court ruling, the appeals court held
that rural residents of the timber producing area have legal standing
regarding environmental issues despite the fact that their primary
concern is economic. In addition, the court held that statutes
governing the management of national forests are dedicated to
timber harvesting activities and that the local resident may sue
to challenge U.S. Forest Service decisions reducing allowable
timber harvests.<BR>

<B>MSLF Help Stops U.S. Forest Service</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A property owner in northern California says the
willingness of MSLF to provide her legal assistance brought an
almost immediate concession from the U.S. Forest Service (USFS),
even before MSLF filed a single document. For years, the USFS
had used the property of Kate Novoa without permission. Yet when
she objected, the USFS asserted that it had an easement over her
land. Remarkably, the USFS never produced documented proof of
its alleged easement. When Ms. Novoa advised USFS officials that
MSLF was willing to provide her legal assistance, the USFS suddenly
discovered that it had no easement over her land and agreed to
end its use of her property.<BR>

<B>Forest Service Ignores Facts - Locks Out Miners</B>

doing, they have ignored the fact that the proposed area does
not meet the requirements of federal regulation that the area
be &quot;virgin&quot; and &quot;unmodified&quot; by act of man.
In addition, the area contains numerous mining claims of which
the federal government is well aware. Remarkably, none of the
federal documents supporting the creation of the Hoosier Ridge
NRA addresses the fact that the are is neither &quot;virgin&quot;
nor &quot;unmodified&quot; or the fact that mining claims are
present. As a result, MSLF filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Park

Board of Land Appeals (IBLA) has ruled that self defense may not

a grizzly bear when confronted in his own yard, was convicted
of a violation of the ESA despite his plea of self defense. An
Administrative Law Judge ruled that although Shuler reasonably
feared for his life (the necessary precedent for the use of deadly
force), he could not claim self-defense since he was at fault
for introducing himself into &quot;the zone of imminent danger.&quot;
The IBLA upheld that remarkable ruling, declaring that since Shuler
knew a grizzly bear was outside, he should not have left his house.
Since the IBLA's ruling conflicts with the law on self-defense
(a homeowner may confront an armed intruder on his own property),
MSLF will file a lawsuit in federal court.</FONT>

plan hit a roadblock in Vermont's Act 250. A jurisdictional opinion

to adopt its subdivision rules. That let the state-wide Board
assert authority over the project.<BR>

while they were on strike. The case involves a labor dispute at
Yankee Gas. The company offered a raise but announced a plan to
later change medical benefits. The union did not immediately strike,
but refused to commit to staying on the job during negotiations.
Realizing that would leave its operations at the union's mercy,
Yankee put its offer into effect. The union promptly struck and
its members filed for unemployment benefits.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The state ordered benefits paid to the workers because
it felt portions of Yankee's offer were inferior to the prior
contract. Yankee appealed. NELF's <I>amicus</I> brief with the
Superior Court, in the name of the Connecticut Business and Industry
Association argued that the refusal to commit to staying on the
job prevented the union from claiming a lockout. The judge agreed
and reversed the order to pay unemployment benefits. He also noted
that the state should have reviewed the final offer to see if,
viewed as a package, it was inferior to the expired contract.

<B>NELF Helps Win Spink Case</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In a case hailed by the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>
as &quot;an important victory for employers,&quot; the U.S. Supreme
Court has ruled that a company may require workers to waive their
right to sue for age discrimination as a condition for receiving
special early retirement benefits.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The decision in <I>Spink v. Lockheed Corp.</I> overruled
a lower court which had allowed the worker to sue Lockheed as
a fiduciary under ERISA, the federal pension law.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>NELF in its own name filed an <I>amicus </I>brief
with the Court, which argued that the fiduciary standard should
not and could not apply to a company's dealings with its own employees.
Use of that standard would require companies to put employees'
interests above shareholders, in violation of corporate law. The
Court's decision eliminates that risk and restores management's
flexibility in obtaining voluntary employment reductions.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>NELF Enters Class Action Fray</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>NELF has joined with Lawyers for Civil Justice, a
Washington-based public interest group asking the U.S. Court of
Appeals in Philadelphia to reconsider a decision which overturned
a settlement of a millions of prospective asbestos-related cases.
In this, <I>Georgine v. Amchem</I>, the District Court used a
Rule 23 class action to approve a single settlement in one &quot;case&quot;
which disposed of millions of individual cases. Notwithstanding
the proposed settlement, the Court of Appeals reviewed the class
action settlement to see if the underlying &quot;case&quot; could
have met requirements of Rule 23. Because it did not, the court
vacated the settlement.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Unless reversed, the consequences of this decision
on business and the judicial system will be dramatic and negative.
Instead of one comprehensive and fair settlement that resolves
the issue and caps businesses' exposure, there will be years of
litigation with inconsistent judgments, enormous legal expenses
and a lack of predictability. The upshot will be that, while some
plantiffs may get more money, many will get less, far more money
will be spent on legal fees and kept by plaintiffs' lawyers, and
courts will be crowded with hundreds of thousands of complex,
repetitious cases.<BR>

<B>NELF Help Bring Massachusetts Tax Law Into the 21 Century</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Massachusetts' Supreme Judicial Court has acknowledged
the &quot;assistance&quot; received from an <I>amicus</I> brief
prepared by NELF in a tax case which tested whether the state's
tax coded can be adapted to modern manufacturing techniques. The
case, <I>Houghton-Mifflin Co. v. Commissioners of Revenue</I>,
involved whether a major publisher, which had subcontracted a
number of physical tasks like binding while continuing to perform
high technology work like organizing texts and designing CD/ROMS,
was entitled to retain its manufacturing status. Manufacturing
status provides a business with significant tax incentives to
increase investment and employment.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>NELF's brief, filed on behalf of Associated Industries
of Massachusetts, argued that continuation of the exemption in
this case was reasonable application of the 1930's-era law to
today's changed conditions.<BR>

<B>Court Allows Second Bite at the Apple</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>California Assemblyman Tom Bates (D-Berkeley) is
fighting tooth and nail to get a &quot;second bite at the apple.&quot;
He and a handful of his supporters have filed suit in federal
court trying yet again to strike down term limits. Furthermore,
Bates' bid to undo the state term limits is being given a sympathetic
ear by a federal trial court that is disregarding PLF's precedent-setting
victory in <I>Legislature v. Eu</I> and is heading down its own
path requiring the validity of Proposition 140 to be litigated
through the court system all over again!<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The court has refused to dismiss the lawsuit and
has given Mr. Bates great latitude to make up arguments for keeping
his suit alive. For instance, the Berkeley lawmaker has argued
that since he was not individually named as a party to the first
Proposition 140 lawsuit, he was not bound by it. Well, Mr. Bates
may not have been named in that prior suit, but an investigation
of documents filed with the Fair Practices Commission revealed
that he helped underwrite it.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Public records show that Mr. Bates spent $12,000
trying to defeat Proposition 140 at the ballot box, and when that
failed, he paid another $1,000 directly to the law firm that represented
the Legislature in the California Supreme Court for the purpose
of supporting the first challenge to state term limits. In addition,
a subpoena of that law firm's billing records revealed that not
only did Tom Bates help finance <I>Legislature v. Eu</I> litigation,
but 39 of his colleagues who were not parties to that case also
contributed to the lawsuit- to the tune of $229,000! With this
information  in hand, PLF went back to federal court demanding
again that Mr. Bates be bound by the first lawsuit and that his
suit be dismissed.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In spite of Mr. Bates' obvious involvement in the
prior case, the federal court decided that he could start the
case all over again in her court because in her opinion his contribution
was too small a sum to buy him &quot;control&quot; over the prior
lawsuit. The court would not accept that 58 legislators challenged
Proposition 140 in 1991 by either lending their names to the complaint
or by opening their pocketbooks, with nonparty legislators underwriting
 half the lawsuit. Instead the court has permitted the lawmaker's
lawyers to recruit two Democratic Assemblywomen, Barbara Friedman
and Martha Escutia, as additional plaintiffs in the lawsuit.

<B>Voting Districts Drawn by Race Rules Unconstitutional</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In another victory for equal protection, the United
States Supreme Court held on June 13, that election districts
in Texas and North Carolina that were drawn along racial boundaries
are unconstitutional. PLF argued in both cases that race is an
inappropriate criteria for drawing lines for congressional districts
and that the interests of all Americans are ill-served by political
boundaries that isolate minority voters in so-called &quot;majority-minority&quot;
districts.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Texas' 18th, 29th, 30th and North Carolina's 12th
congressional districts were oddly configured and bizarre in their
geographic configurations. There was nothing compact or contiguous
about the districts in question which were drawn for the sole
purpose of assuring the election of black representatives, while
completely disregarding traditional districting principles. In
both cases, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed with the arguments made
by PLF which has long advocated individual rights over group rights
and the necessity for government to act in a color-blind manner,
both in the context of &quot;affirmative action&quot; programs
and in the context of the Voting Rights Act. The Supreme Court
also rebuffed the Department of Justice's continuing attempts
to coerce states into a &quot;max-black&quot; scheme of maximizing
the number of minority districts, even when there is no compelling
reason to do so.<BR>

<B>Fate of Santa Monica Rent Control Before State Supreme Court</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Under the pretext of &quot;helping the poor and the
elderly&quot; the Santa Monica rent control bureaucrats have been
taking rental property owners to the cleaners while expanding
the scope of regulation and control of rental properties throughout
the city. And yet, despite the economic and social harms it causes,
rent control remains a source of long-term security and prosperity
for the bureaucrats and huge administrative staffs need to keep
the program operating.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Using 1980-1990 census data from Berkeley, Santa
Monica, and Cotati, a California Apartment Association-PLF Rent
Control Project study reveals the damaging impact rent control
has on housing and people-particularly the poor, minorities and
the elderly. The study proves the bureaucrats wrong, rent control
does not accomplish what was originally intended, and this is
evidence that cannot be ignored.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The CAA-PLF Rent Control Project fired its first
salvo in the war against rent control on March 16, 1994, against
the City of Santa Monica. That suit charged, among other things,
that Santa Monica's rent control ordinance effects an uncompensated
taking of private property in violation of the U.S. Constitution.
In addition to showing that the rent regulations fail to advance
any legitimate governmental interest (and therefore are unconstitutional),
the suit challenges the local rent board's bizarre accounting
practices and determined whether owners receive a &quot;fair return.&quot;
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A trial court threw out PLF's lawsuit claiming the
rent control board had a &quot;rational basis&quot; for imposing
its restrictions. Under this weak standard, rental property owners
have little hope of successfully challenging such measures as
unconstitutional takings. Fortunately, the California Court of
Appeal overturned that trial court decision in this case, ruling
that courts must not take challenges to rent control too lightly
and instead must examine such cases with a higher level of scrutiny.
In so holding, the court unanimously rejected the idea-urged by
the Rent Control Board and accepted by the trial judge-that courts
must uphold rent ordinances if they can imagine any conceivable
rational basis for enactment.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The court determined that if rental property owners
can prove that a rent control law has denied them economically
viable use of their land or fails to substantially advance a legitimate
government interest, then that law &quot;goes too far.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In so ruling, the Court of Appeal ordered the trial
court to conduct a full trial and hear PLF's damaging evidence.
Greatly disturbed by the prospect of having to defend its rent
control regime and accompanying socialist policies, the city sought
refuge in the California Supreme Court where the case presently
sits.<BR>

<B>SLF Again Mounts Legal Assault on City of Atlanta &quot;Domestic
Partnership&quot; Ordinance</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The city of Atlanta in September enacted a &quot;domestic
partners&quot; ordinance, allowing for non-married<B> </B>partners
of City employees to receive healthcare and other benefits. SLF
filed suit in local superior court challenging the constitutionality
of the ordinance. A similar ordinance was enacted in 1993, and
SLF's lawsuit against the City in that case was successfully decided
by the Georgia Supreme Court. The Court held that the City ordinance
defined specifically both &quot;dependence&quot; and &quot;family&quot;
for purposes of justifying the extension of employee benefits
in a manner which conflicted with the state constitution and statutes
and was therefore unconstitutional and void.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In the present case, the City ordinance similarly
defines &quot;dependent&quot; in a manner which SLF attorneys
contend conflicts with state law. In a press conference held in
Atlanta in September to announce the lawsuit, SLF President Matthew
J. Glavin told the press corps, &quot;Atlanta has once again crossed
the line drawn by the General Assembly and the Georgia Supreme
Court by attempting to recognize relationships not recognized
at the state level. We trust that this lawsuit will once and for
all put an end to the City's illegal efforts.&quot; <BR>

<B>FDA's Dr. Kessler Ordered to Give Deposition</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>WLF scored a major victory in its ongoing litigation
against Dr. David Kessler and the Food and Drug Administration
regarding the FDA's ban on dissemination of vital medical literature
to doctors on the off-label use of FDA approved drugs and devices.
In <I>WLF v. Kessler</I>, the U.S. District Court for the District
of Columbia recently denied Dr. Kessler's attempts to prevent
WLF attorneys from taking his deposition regarding this clearly
unconstitutional FDA policy of censorship, and ordered him to
appear for a two-hour deposition. Justice Department and FDA attorneys,
however, are seeking to appeal that decision.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>WLF Represents Congressmen Seeking to Uphold &quot;3/5 Rule&quot;
on Taxes</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>WLF recently filed a brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the D.C. Circuit in <I>Skaggs v. Carle</I> on behalf of 22
U.S. Senators and Representatives who are defending the constitutionality
of the House's recently adopted &quot;3/5 Rule&quot; on taxes.
The rule, which requires a three-fifths vote rather than a simple
majority to raise taxes, is under attack by several Democrats
in the House and a variety of liberal organizations.  WLF's brief
argues that the plaintiffs claims are not justiciable and the
Constitution imposes no restraints on the House of Representatives'
power to adopt procedural rules.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Supporting Tort Reform for Municipal Governments</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>WLF recently asked the U.S. Supreme Court to throw
out a huge tort award imposed on an Oklahoma county because one
of its deputy sheriffs allegedly used excessive force when pulling
a motorist from her car during a traffic stop following a high-speed
chase. WLF argued in <I>Bryan County v. Brown</I> that while public-sector
employees can be sued under the Civil Rights Act of 1871 if they
violate someone's constitutional rights, a municipality should
not be held liable for the actions of its employees unless those
actions were taken pursuant to some established municipal policy.
WLF urged the Court to reject the lower court's determination
that such a policy can be found to exist based simply on the municipality's
alleged negligence in hiring the deputy sheriff. WLF argued that
plaintiffs should be required to demonstrate that the municipality
repeatedly has made negligent hiring decisions.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>WLF Demands Probe of FDA's Contacts with Plaintiffs' Bar</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>WLF recently demanded that HHSs Inspector General
launch an investigation of meetings between senior FDA officials
and members of the plaintiffs' bar. FDA officials have had repeated
contacts with plaintiffs' lawyers who are pushing FDA to take
action unfavorable to the many pharmaceutical and medical device
companies who are targets of class action lawsuits. WLF recently
determined through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit that FDA
has been failing to keep written records of all such meetings,
as it is required to do by law. WLF is demanding that the Inspector
General investigate the full extent of the violations by senior
FDA personnel. WLF charges that by attempting to hide their meetings
with plaintiffs' lawyers, FDA officials create the impression
that the agency has become beholden to a politically powerful
interest group, at the expense of the health and safety of the
American people.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>High Court Sides with WLF in First Amendment Challenge to FEC
Rule</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Supreme Court in late June struck down a Federal
Election Commission rule that restricted party committees in making
independent expenditures in connection with congressional elections.
The ruling in <I>Colorado Republican Fed. Campaign Comm. v. FEC</I>
was a victory for WLF, which had represented eight Members of
Congress as well as former Senator Eugene McCarthy in the case.
The High Court accepted WLF's argument that the First Amendment
prohibits restrictions on the type of independent political speech
(i.e., campaign spending not directly controlled by a candidate)
at issue in this case.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Court Once Again Says No to Racial Gerrymandering</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Supreme Court in late June struck down racially
gerrymandered congressional districts in North Carolina and Texas,
holding that the Equal Protection Clause prohibits using race
as the predominant factor in drawing electoral lines. In the Texas
case, <I>Bush v. Vera</I>, WLF had represented Linda Chavez's
Center for Equal Opportunity and several Members of Congress who
opposed dividing the electorate along racial lines. WLF argued
that racial gerrymandering is unnecessary to permit blacks and
Hispanics to compete in elections on an equal footing and promotes
divisiveness between people of different races.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Commercial Speech Rights Supported</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>WLF continued its strong advocacy of commercial speech
when it argued this month in the Maryland Court of Appeals (that
state's highest court) that Maryland may not constitutionally
restrict the right of businesses to advertise going-out-of-business
sales. Maryland imposes strict licensing requirements on all such
advertising and has been attempting to fine a furniture store
that advertised a liquidation sale without first jumping through
all necessary bureaucratic hoops. WLF argues in <I>Jakanna Woodworks,
Inc. v. Montgomery County</I> that the First Amendment bars Maryland
from attempting to suppress advertising that the State does not
claim is false or misleading and that calls attention to activities
that are fully legal (indeed, that are not even subject to regulation
in Maryland).<BR>

</FONT></B></CENTER>
<hr><P>
<font size=3> 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;




	On almost every indicator of child well-being, children today fare worse than their counterparts just a generation ago. The reason: the dramatic rise, over the last thirty years, in the number of children living in fatherless households.  Indeed, children growing up without fathers are more likely to fail at school or to drop out, engage in early sexual activity, develop drug and alcohol problems, and experience or perpetrate violence.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The National Fatherhood Initiative was founded three years ago to counter the growing problem of fatherlessness by stimulating a broad-based social movement to restore responsible fatherhood as a national priority. With the support and involvement of such notable Americans as former U.S. Education Secretary <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William Bennett</a>, actor James Earl Jones, and pollster George Gallup, we developed the following three-part strategy for ensuring that more children grow up with a loving father. <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

First, we are pursuing an aggressive public education campaign highlighting the importance of fathers to the well-being of children and communities.  In fact, NFI has netted nearly 20,000 media mentions over the past two years. In addition, we have developed, in conjunction with the Ad Council, a national public service announcement (PSA) campaign to raise the awareness of every American that fathers make unique and irreplaceable contributions to the lives of their children, and that collectively we need to support and encourage men to be good and responsible fathers. One of these ads has appeared nearly a half dozen times in <i>USA Today</i>. In partnership with Radio America, we have also developed a series of two dozen radio PSAs featuring such prominent Americans as former HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, Senator Dan Coats, General Colin Powell, Senator Bill Bradley, Congressman and former Seattle Seahawk Steve Largent, and Penn State football coach Joe Paterno.
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Second, we are organizing coalitions of national and local community leaders committed to creating a culture that values and supports good fathers. In October of 1994, we convened the first ever National Summit on Fatherhood in Dallas, Texas, where hundreds of our nation's civic, business, and philanthropic leaders gathered to begin building a national consensus on the need to quickly reduce father absence. We then organized and hosted an interfaith leadership summit on fatherhood in June 1996. This summit attracted dozens of representatives from various faiths who discussed ideas for encouraging, both individually and collectively, engaged fathering.  Additionally, we are partnering with national civic organizations, including United Way of America and Boys and Girls Clubs of America, to stimulate local voluntary efforts toward father-friendly community building.
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
We are also increasingly working with the nation's governors.  For example, NFI was recently awarded a contract by the Virginia  Department of Health to implement a state-wide fatherhood promotion campaign as part of Governor George Allen's citizen empowerment initiative.  As the coordinator of this effort, NFI developed a series of state-specific PSAs, hosted local fatherhood forums throughout the state, and developed a resource center to assist grassroots organizations and individuals to implement local fatherhood promotion efforts.

In addition to our work in Virginia, NFI has been asked to provide consultation and advice to such diverse governors as William Weld of Massachusetts, Roy Romer of Colorado, Pete Wilson of California, and Birch Bayh of Indiana, as each seeks to find ways to promote, rather than discourage, responsible fatherhood through state policy initiatives. To help support our state policy work, NFI recently co-authored a document entitled "Seven Things States Can Do To Promote Responsible Fatherhood." Published by the NGA's Council of Governors' Policy Advisors, this report has been widely disseminated to state and local government officials.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Third, we are taking our pro-fatherhood message directly to individual men.  Through the skill building and community resource materials, we provide information on how men can become better fathers, and how local communities can promote, encourage, and support fathers.  One of our most successful publications, Father Facts, contains national data on trends in fatherhood, as well as research documenting the negative consequences of father absence.  We also publish a resource catalogue containing books, tapes, and other fatherhood products.
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There is substantial evidence that our efforts are beginning to bear fruit. Whether reflected in stadiums filled with Promise Keepers, the streets of our nation's capital inundated with Million Man Marchers, or news stories highlighting the connection between absent fathers and such diverse social ills as crime, educational failure and welfare dependency, fatherhood is in the air. Virtually everyone-from Dan Quayle to Bill Clinton-now agrees: fathers matter, and they matter a lot more than many had previously realized.
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The job, however, is only half done.  Though few still argue seriously that fathers are superfluous, the number of children growing up in father absent households continues to rise.  This year, more than a million children will experience the divorce or separation of their parents. An additional 1.3 million babies will be fathered out of wed-lock. Overall, nearly 2.5 million children will join the ranks of the fatherless.
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Certainly, much has been accomplished.  But we must not delude ourselves into believing that the struggle to renew fatherhood has been won. Far too many children grow up in homes without fathers. The most important battles are still before us.  Achieving attitudinal change may be hard; but behavioral change is even harder.  And that is what our children need most of all.

<b>Neoisolationism and Global Realities,</b> by Murray Weidenbaum<p>
<i>Policy Study</i> No. 130, Center for the Study of American Business<p>
Murray Weidenbaum, Director of the Center for the Study of American Business, argues that the U.S. cannot revert to isolationist policies in the post-Cold War era given the current and strong trends towards globalization. To support his argument, Weidenbaum presents eight major points which illustrate the increasingly strong movement towards globaliliztion. First, he states that existing technology and international competition have already made America part of the global marketplace. Second, he points to the fact that U.S. businesses are increasingly participating in the international economy given the potential high profits and growth rates. Third, he presents the argument that with growing numbers of cross-border alliances, transnational enterprises are becoming more and more common. Then, Weidenbaum argues that the booming economies and little government regulation in some foreign countries, have made it so the rewards of foreign investment far outweight the risks of political instability. The fifth point is the attraction the diversifying of investments internationally holds to businessmen seeking to minimize their vulnerabiltiy to regional recessions. Next he points out that the U.S. can not ignore the rise of China and other Southeastern Asian countries as Economic powerhouses; it must be prepared to compete with them both in the U.S. and Asian markets. Similarly, the continued process of economic unification in Western Europe and the growing strength of Germany, also demands a U.S. presence in the global marketplace. Finally, he argues that given the United States strong economy, too much potential for further growth exists in the international sphere that would be lost should the U.S. choose to follow an isolationist course.  Weidenbaum concludes by asserting that protectionism does not work and that as the twenty-first century approaches, private enterprises, not government, will lead the U.S.'s movements on the global stage. 16pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington Univers

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/natsec/fyi103.html">Flawed Intelligence Report No Guide for Missile Threat</a>, by <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a><p>
<i>F.Y.I.</i> No. 103, The Heritage Foundation<p>
In his assessment of the U.S. intelligence community's 1995 report on America's need for a missile defense system, Senior Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation Baker Spring argues that given a host of inconsistencies, the report should not be used by members of Congress to help them determine their votes on the Defend America Act.  The act would commit America to the deployment of a missile defense system by 2003, but the intelligence community's report asserts that the U.S. is under no real threat of a missile attack in the near future.  Spring writes, however, that the authors of the assessment: 1) fail to address the threat posed by long-range missiles in China and Russia; 2) write off Alaska and Hawaii as territory to defend against missile attack; 3) are overly optimistic about how long it will take rogue states to develop long-range missiles; 4) unwisely downplay the potential impact of foreign assistance on the missile threat to America; 5) underestimate the impact of space launch vehicle development on missile proliferation; 6) are completely unrealistic about the potential sale of long-range missiles and space launch vehicles; and 7) inexplicably dismiss the threat of accidental or unauthorized launches against the U.S. Baker concludes by raising questions about the legitimacy of the report, noting that the General Accounting Office has launched an investigation to determine if the Clinton Administration intervened in the production of the report. 4pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/natsec/bg1083.html">Will Clinton Pay the Price for America to Remain a Global Power,</a> by <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a><p>
<i>Backgrounder</i> No. 1083, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Baker Spring, Senior Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, writes that the Clinton Administration is underfunding its own proposed force structure for America's military by approximately $130 billion.  According to Spring, this coming shortfall will leave the United States with two options: 1) increase defense spending to match America's current level of international commitments; or 2) renege or partially withdraw from existing U.S. security commitments.  While opponents of defense spending have argued that with the Cold War over the U.S. no longer needs to have a defense budget three times the size of any other nation (as it currently does), Spring disagrees. He holds that the American military's distance from the areas to which it is committed and must project power, the high technology weaponry it uses in order to limit casualties, and its volunteer rather than conscription troops all demand higher levels of spending.  Spring also argues that reneging on security commitments could open the door to a host of international conflicts that a down-sized U.S. military could not deal with. In order to resolve the funding shortage, Spring calls for a large scale debate in Congress to alert the American people to the problem and ultimately lead the U.S. to be capable of meeting its global security commitments. 11 pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<i>F.Y.I.</i>  No. 104, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Ariel Cohen, Senior Policy Analyst for The Heritage Foundation, outlines a report written by advisors of Communist Party Leader and former Russian presidential candidate Gennady Zyuganov. The authors of the report, proponents of hard-line communist doctrine and advocates of more aggressive military posturing, make a number of suggestions which, if adhered to, could prove profoundly disturbing for the United States. Such possibilities include: 1) Russia adopting a nuclear deterrence posture for perceived non-nuclear threats; 2) maintaining the conception of the U.S. and NATO as Russia's enemies.; 3) reorganizing Russia's military into a series of smaller but highly mobile units; and 4) preparing to reconquer by force the New Independent States of the former Soviet Union. Cohen cautions that regardless of the election's outcome, the views expressed in the report reflect those of many highly placed officials in Russia's government and military and could influence policy in the years to come. 11pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a>

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/trade/asc141.html">Why Renewing MFN for China Serves U.S. Interests,</a> by <a href="/heritage/staff/yates.html">Stephen J. Yates</a><p>
<i>Asian Studies Center Backgrounder</i> No. 141, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Stephen J. Yates, Policy Analyst for the Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center, contends that revoking China's Most Favored Nation trading status would be directly contrary to the United States' interests in Asia.  China's human rights abuses, weapons proliferation, and a host of other problems have prompted many in Congress to call for the denial of MFN to China. But Yates argues that  such a revocation is not in accordance with either the MFN's historical or contemporary purpose. MFN, rather than being the extension of special trading privileges, is more aptly described as the normal trading status.  According to Yates, the termination of normal trade relations with China would have serious consequences. Rather than revoke MFN, Yates outlines a policy which he holds to be more consistent and cohesive than that carried out so far by President Clinton. This policy, whose aim is to promote both democracy and improved U.S. Chinese relations, includes: 1) renewing China's MFN status; 2) inviting China's president to the White House for a full state visit; 3) following a more broad-based strategy towards Asia; 4) using policy tools better suited to the problem; and 5) repealing or amending the Jackson-Vanik amendment. 12pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a>

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/trade/lect566.html">China: Friend or Enemy?</a> by Hon. Barbara Hackman Franklin<p>
<i>Lecture</i> No. 566, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Barbara Hackman Franklin, former Secretary of Commerce examines the relationship between the United States and China in light of China's growing economic, geographic and military importance.  Despite China's increasing commitment to free market principles, Franklin sees human rights, trade deficits, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and intellectual property rights as obstacles to improving ties between the two countries. Even with these difficulties, however, Franklin believes the U.S. must continue to strengthen its relationship with China. Only by doing so can the U.S. help to strengthen the democratic and free market ideas currently gaining strength in China. She argues that the current U.S. policy lacks consistency and direction. Her remedy for this problem is the adoption of a strategic framework, outlining the goals, objectives, and expectations for the United States' relationship with China.  Included in this framework would be actions such as granting China permanent Most Favored Nation status and bringing the country into the World Trade Organization.  Franklin concludes by asserting that only by strengthening its economic and political ties with China, can the U.S. help direct the course China will take in the years to come. 9 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org</a>

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/lect562.html">Entering the Pacific Century,</a> by Senator Jesse Helms<p>
<i>Lecture</i> No. 562, The Heritage Foundation<p>
United States Senator Jesse Helms calls for a shift in America's policy towards Asian nations, condemning the Clinton Administration for its indecisiveness and lack of priorities.  Helms believes continued support for political and economic freedom should be first on America's Asian agenda.  He asserts that the U.S. must use a firmer hand in dealing with the People's Republic of China, refusing to tolerate China's flagrant abuses of human rights and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.  Helms also argues that the U.S. must encourage Japan to take a leadership role in the international community commensurate with its economic standing. Facilitating dialogues between North and South Korea, and India and Pakistan figure significantly in Helm's agenda for U.S.-Asian relations. Finally, Helms cautions that the U.S. must pay close attention to Russia's dealings with Asian nations and work closely with states in ASEAN in order to promote democracy in Vietnam, Burma, and Laos.  According to Helms, the U.S. must adopt a more cohesive Asian policy if it is to be prepared for the emergence of Asia as the focal point of political and economic power in the near future. 20pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org</a>.

<b>Terrorism: The Failed Response,</b> by Geoffrey Lee Williams and Alan Lee Williams<p>
<i>Occasional Paper</i> No. 66, Institute for European Defense and Strategic Studies<p>
Geoffrey Lee Williams, Professor of International Relations at the University of Cambridge, and Alan Lee Williams, Director of the Atlantic Council of the United Kingdom, argue that although the power to terrorize with weapons and violence as a means to an end has a very long tradition, modern terrorists are distinguished from their predecessors by an adherence to ideology. Marx, Lenin, and Mao all considered violence to be useful only as an instrument for the advancement of the revolution. However, they were wary of the use of terror because the shedding of innocent blood could alienate "the masses." The authors also offer definitions in order to provide distinction between the various terms and euphemisms for terrorists. In addition, they encourage governments to cooperate in order to avoid further violence. 55pp.  CONTACT.

<b>Privatization 1996,</b> edited by John O'Leary<p>
<i>Tenth Annual Report on Privatization</i>, Reason Foundation<p>
In this annual report, the Reason Foundation provides a comprehensive account of privatization of government assets, enterprises, and public services. The first section focuses on trends towards privatization in the public sector at the federal, state and local levels. The next area of analysis examines the politics of privatization, looking especially at the experiences of Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith and New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman. Then, the report examines tools which will enable the government to understand the trends of activity based costing, contract monitoring techniques, and the use of competition within government.  This year's survey also covers contracting trends such as education privatization, solid waste management, and emergency medical services.  The final section of analysis looks at infrastructure trends, examining how industries as diverse as air traffic control, electric power, and corrections facilities are making the transition towards privatization.  68pp.  CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S.

<p><b>Designing Comprehensive Privatization Programs for Cities: Pittsburgh,</b> by John Stainbeck and Paul Kengor<p>
<i>Allegheny Institute Report</i> No. 96-14, Allegheny Institute and Reason Foundation<p>
John Stainback, President and CEO of Privatization for America, and Paul Kengor, Research Fellow for the Allegheny Institute, examine the challenges faced by city governments struggling with falling revenues and rising expenditures. Their solution centers around a comprehensive city-wide privatization program. The program involves nine different types of privatization for a city's assets, services, facility operations, debt, and infrastructure. The plan relies on government involvement in the creation and implementation of the privatization process. In an attempt to strengthen their governing ability and improve the quality of services provided to their citizens, city officials work to determine the types of privatization their situation demands, the level of control they want to maintain, and the assets they are willing to put into play.  Stainback and Kengor caution that while some risks do exist, they are still far outweighed by the benefits comprehensive privatization holds. These include: 1) reduced government costs; 2) generation of non-tax revenue; and 3) improved capabilities of developing and financing infrastructure. 46pp.  CONTACT: Allegheny Institute for Public Policy, Suite 612, 7 Parkway Center, Pittsburgh, PA 15220-3703, 412/937-4526, fax 412/928-1501

<b>Power Struggle</b>, by Kerry Jackson<p>
<i>FYI</i> May 8, 1996, American Legislative Exchange Council<p>
Kerry Jackson, Editor of <i>FYI</i>, examines the current move towards deregulating the electric power industry.  According to Jackson, while some consumer groups and utility companies have reservations about opening up the electric power market to competition, the move toward deregulation grows stronger everyday, particularly among industry insiders. As Jackson points out, legislators in approximately 30 states are devising legislation that would provide the best service to consumers, but in a low-cost, competitive market. ALEC is addressing the issue with its Energy, Environment, Natural Resources, and Agriculture Task Force. Jackson concludes that competition within the electric power industry will lower costs for consumers and offer them the best form of consumer protection possible. 4pp.  CONTACT: American Legislative Exchange Council, 910 17th Street, N.W., 5th floor, Washington, DC  20006, 202/466-3800, fax 202/466-3801.

<b>Reinventing Air Traffic Control: A New Blueprint for a Better System,</b> by Robert Poole and Viggo Butler<p>
<i>Policy Study</i> No. 206, Reason Foundation<p>
Robert Poole, President of Reason Foundation, and Viggo Butler, Chairman of United Airports Limited, Inc., assert that the Federal Aviation Administration: possesses a bureaucratic subculture; is subject to external micromanagement; and suffers from conflicts of interest between safety regulation and air traffic control operation.  In order to solve this problem, they set forth a plan by which a system of user fees would replace the current airline ticket tax and general aviation fuel tax. The authors believe that doing so would cure many of the FAA's structural weaknesses, leading to improved air safety, fewer flight delays, and shrunken operating costs. The new fee structure would be determined by aircraft weight and distance flown, and would exempt smaller, private aircrafts from most fees and taxes. To determine the fee structure, Poole and Butler recommend the development of a new user-controlled, not-for-profit Air Traffic Control corporation. Modeled after the ATC board which will soon assume control of Canada's air traffic control, the board would be set up and controlled by the government, air traffic controllers, airlines, and business aircraft owners. The new ATC system would be funded entirely by user fees and would be subject to arms length regulation by the FAA. Poole and Butler conclude that if the United States follows the example of not only Canada, but also Germany, Britain, and Switzerland, the fundamental problems of the system can be solved.19pp  CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S.

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/bg1085.html">Senator Pressler's Bold Proposal for Spectrum Freedom,</a> by <a href="/heritage/staff/thierer.htm">Adam D. Thierer</a><p>
<i>Backgrounder</i> No. 1085, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Adam D. Thierer, Alex C. Walker Fellow in Economic Policy at The Heritage Foundation, examines Senator Larry Pressler's staff discussion draft intended to enforce a complete overhaul of the United States' wireless spectrum regulatory policy. Thierer asserts that the Senator's reform proposal is badly needed because the current system suffers from a host of problems, including a resistance to change and a lack of respect for First Amendment rights. According to Thierer, Pressler's plan would: 1) provide spectrum flexibility; 2) expand and make permanent the auction and allocation process; 3) create a second broadcast spectrum solution; 4) prohibit FCC spectrum standard-setting or construction mandates; 5) demand release of more publicly held spectrum; 6) transfer all spectrum responsibilities from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration to the FCC and block grant public safety spectrum to the states; and 7) require a spectrum report to monitor progress. While Thierer, on the whole, endorses Pressler's proposal, he lists four changes which he believes would improve upon the initial plan. These include: holding outright, unambiguous auctions for all spectrum uses and users;  ending "public interest standard" regulation and guaranteeing equal First Amendment protections for all media, whether print or electronic; ending protectionist policies in spectrum technologies; and  de-licensing the entire spectrum. 11 pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a>

<b>A Free Market Solution to Groundwater Allocation in Georgia,</b> by Terry L. Anderson and Pamela S. Snyder<p>
<i>Issue Analysis,</i> Georgia Public Policy Foundation<p>
Terry Anderson, Executive Director of Political Economy Research Center (PERC), and Pamela Snyder, a PERC Research Assistant with, discuss the overuse of the Floridian aquifer system by groundwater pumpers in Georgia. Anderson and Snyder write that the state's use of regulation to reverse overdraft of the aquifer is not being welcomed with open arms, but, in the absence of well-defined property rights to groundwater, water users "race to the pumphouse" to capture their share of the resources before someone else does. The authors offer a market-based alternative to proposed government regulation, calling for privatization of the Floridian aquifer system in Georgia on a regional basis by defining quantified groundwater rights and allowing their transfer among users. 20 pp.  CONTACT: Georgia Public Policy Foundation, 2900 Chamblee-Tucker Road, Building Six, Atlanta, GA 30341-4128, 770/455-7600, fax 770/455-4355.

<b>California's Fiscal Condition,</b> by Tom McClintock<p>
<i>Briefings</i> No. 1996-51, Claremont Institute<p>
Tom McClintock, Director of Economic and Regulatory Affairs at the Claremont Institute's Golden State Center for Policy Studies, writes that, despite some positive signs, the California economy is still not stable. Attributing California's recession in the early 1990s to dramatic tax increases, McClintock points to a growing state debt, deferral of pension loans, and several bookkeeping anomalies as key indicators of impending economic difficulties. With these economic weaknesses, he holds that California is ill-repared to deal with its crumbling infrastructure. Noting that while spending per capita had increased significantly over the past twenty years, California is now providing fewer-and poorer-quality services to its citizens. Based upon this, McClintock concludes that California's problems stem not from how much revenue the state is receiving but rather how that revenue is spent. To remedy this problem, McClintock suggests two fundamental shifts in how California's policy makers allocate the budget: 1) restoring the state's constitutional restraints requiring a balanced budget, prohibiting borrowing, and limiting spending growth; and 2) downsizing the state bureaucracy and incorporating more competitive, free market oriented principles into the provision of goods and services. 9pp.  CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 250 West First Street, Suite 330, Claremont, CA 91711, 909/621-6825, fax 909/626-8724, e-mail <a href="mailto: 2026935@mcimail.com">2026935@mcimail.com</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.claremont.org">http://www.claremont.org.</a><p>

<b>Small Business Survival Index: Ranking the Environment for Entrepreneurship Across the Nation,</b> by Raymond J. Keating<p>
Small Business Survival Foundation<p>
Raymond J. Keating, Chief Economist for the Small Business Foundation, examines the impact of a variety of taxes on small businesses on a state by state basis.  Asserting that how a government manages issues of investment and entrepreneurship is a vital economic matter, he concludes that high taxes and burdensome regulations will significantly reduce incentives for entrepreneurs to engage in high risk ventures. The end result of this process, according to Keating, is the restraint and diminishment of economic growth.  In order to provide both entrepreneurs and legislators with a more comprehensive understanding of the comparative degree to which their state promotes investment and growth, Keating ranks and measures some of the major costs imposed on entrpreneurship, investment, and businesses in each state.The Index surveys nine major government related costs imposed on small businesses and entrepreneurs. The taxes compared include: personal income taxes; capital gains taxes; corporate income taxes; property taxes; sales taxes; and death taxes. The survey also looks at the impact of unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation costs, and the total crime rate on small businesses.  Using these nine factors to shape his analysis, Keating summarizes the climate of each state for investment and small business opportunities.  13pp.  CONTACT.

<b>Social Security: Facing the Facts,</b> by Mark Weinberger<p>
<i>Project on Social Security Privatization</i> No. 3, Cato Institute<p>
Mark Weinberger, a partner in the law firm Washington Council, P.C., singles out Congress for their failure to address Social Security reform in the midst of the budget debate. Weinberger shows that the Social Security program could begin going bankrupt as early as 2113. He attributes this problem to the combined impact of the "graying of America," combined with increased costs and higher standards of living. To remedy this situation, Weinberger asserts lawmakers have four options: 1) reduce benefit payments; 2) increase the program's funding; 3) run up the federal debt; or 4) restructure the program so that people can save money in private accounts yielding higher returns. It is the fourth option, Weinberg endorses, concluding that it has the best potential for averting a potential crisis. 10pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, e-mail <a href="mailto: cato@cato.org">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.cato.org">http://www.cato.org.</a><p>

<b>Empowering Workers: The Privatization of Social Security in Chile,</b> by Jos Pinera<p>
<i>Cato's Letters</i> No. 10, Cato Institute<p>
Jos Piera, President of the International Center for Pension Reform and Co-Chairman of the Cato Project on Social Security Privatization, is the former Chilean Minister of Labor and Social Security. During his tenure from 1978-1980 he oversaw the privatization of the Chilean pension system. In this paper, Piera discusses the international trend of bankrupt pension systems, how he successfully privatized the Chilean pension system, and how the new Chilean system has increased the productivity of capital and thus the rate of economic growth in its economy. This paper sheds light on how Americans might solve the immenent crisis in their own Social Secutity system. 18pp.  CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, e-mail <a href="mailto: cato@cato.org">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.cato.org">http://www.cato.org.</a><p>

<b>Private Means, Public Ends: Volunteerism vs. Coercion,</b> edited by J. Wilson Mixon, Jr.<p>
Foundation for Economic Education, Inc.<p>
This collection of twenty-six essays, Edited by J. Wilson Mixon, Jr., Professor of Economics at Berry College, challenges the assumption that the government is the best institution to provide basic services such as policing, a transportation infrastructure, and education.  In his introduction, Mixon argues that while the trend towards privatization is gaining support, most people still endorse government involvement in activities as diverse as mail delivery and banking.  But it is because of the government's long standing involvement in these services, Mixon asserts, people have forgotten that private initiatives are also capable of meeting society's many needs.  In fact, as one essay, authored by Henry Hazlitt, concludes, private, voluntary means are actually more effective in serving the community than forced government initiatives.  Other selected essays by Barbara Dodsworth, William R. Allen, and William Dickneider focus on the relationship of government funding and art.  Clint Bolick and Raymond J. Keating write against regulation of the communications industry, while Hannah Lapp and Scott Payne make the case for increased privatization of education.  The revitalization of private charity rather than public welfare is discussed by authors including Gerald Wisz, Robert Peterson, and David T. Beito.  Finally, the deregulation and privatization of banking, transportation, and law enforcement, are the focus of essays by Richard Syll, William B. Irvine, and Nicholas Elliott.    CONTACT.

<b>The Uncertain Hand: Hong Kong Taxis and Tenders,</b> by Christopher D. Hall<p>
Hong Kong Center for Economic Research<p>
The history of taxi regulation in Hong Kong shows that the uncertain regulation is the major source of risk in that business, according to Christopher Hall, Senior Lecturer in the School of Economics and Finance at the University of Hong Kong. After World War II, the taxi business in Hong Kong was basically a cartel of more expensive brand name operators controlled by the police as if it were a private enterprise with public monopoly rights. By the mid-1960s the burgeoning transport-bureaucracy introduced public auctions to allocate licences and, in effect, stripped the police of their power to control the business. The illegal taxi trade grew soon after. In 1985, the current de facto arrangement came about in which licence holders have gradually gained control of the taxi business. Hall argues that the taxi business would be a safe investment if regulation change, real and suggested, did not create so much uncertainty. 266 pp.  CONTACT: Hong Kong Center for Economic Research, School of Economics, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong, 852/2547-8313, fax 852/2548-6319

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/tp14.html">Creating a Financial Services Industry for the 21st Century Part One: Tear Down the Walls,</a> by <a href="/heritage/staff/barry.html">John S. Barry</a><p>
<i>Heritage Talking Points</i> The Heritage Foundation<p>
John S. Barry, Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, condemns the current financial regulatory system which mandates the forced separation of financial services.  According to Barry, historically barriers were created between commercial and investment banking because of fears of high risk losses and conflicts of interest. But he argues that these fears are groundless, that in fact banks engaging in investment activities are less likely to fail than those that did not. He also asserts that integrated banks are less likely to succumb to conflicts of interest than purely commercial or investment banks. Having addressed the major arguments against bank integration, Barry outlines the following plan for modernizing America's financial services industry: 1) repealing the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956; 2) repealing the Banking Act of 1933; 3) eliminating federal regulatory barriers to integrated financial service provision; and 4) allowing commercial companies to offer financial services such as individual savings and checking accounts, consumer lines of credit, and diversified investment services. Barry holds that the implementation of these suggestions will benefit both American businesses and consumers, providing them with more profitable investment opportunities, easier access to capital, reduced costs, and a more stable financial services sector. 17pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a>

<i>F.Y.I.</i> No. 102, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Mark Wilson, Rebecca Lukens Fellow in Labor Policy at The Heritage Foundation, and Angela Antonelli, Heritage Deputy Director for Economic Policy, illustrate that the real problem behind workers' declining take-home pay is not a low minimum wage, but rather the hidden costs of government mandates, taxes, and regulations. According to Wilson and Antonelli, government mandated benefits, ranging from unemployment insurance to workers compensation, dramatically increase the cost to employers to hire and keep workers on their payrolls. They also point out that growing numbers of government regulations increase the cost of employing workers and in the long-run drive down productivity, further escalating costs. Wilson and Antonelli assert that if Congress truly wants to increase wages and job opportunities for American workers they should not raise the minimum wage. Rather, they should focus on reducing the costs of employing workers by cutting payroll taxes; cutting the capital gains tax; enacting significant regulatory reform; and increasing the skills of the workforce. 10pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a>

<b>How Corporate Welfare Won: Clinton and Congress Retreat from Cutting Business Subsidies,</b> by Stephen Moore and Dean Stansel<p>
<i>Policy Analysis</i> No. 254, Cato Institute<p> 
Stephen Moore, Director of Fiscal Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, and Dean Stansel, Cato Fiscal Policy analyst, demonstrate that the federal government currently spends $75 billion a year on direct subsidies to business. Despite that last year both Congress and the Clinton Adminstration pledged to attack this pervasive corporate safety net, the study finds that those promises have been largely unfulfilled. The study reveals that many corporate subsidy programs were reduced minimally, or not at all. In addition, the Clinton Administration has shown itself hostile to even the modest corporate welfare cutbacks proposed by Congress. In fact, the Administration's 1996 budget actually requested a slight increase in spending. The report concludes that an unwillingness to reduce the corporate social safety net undermines the rest of the government downsizing agenda. 29pp.  CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, e-mail <a href="mailto: cato@cato.org">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.cato.org">http://www.cato.org.</a><p>


<b>Georgia Jobs Tax Credits: Needed Incentives or Needless Subsidies?</b> by Dr. Steve Morse<p>
<i>Issue Analysis,</i> Georgia Public Policy Foundation<p>
Dr. Steve Morris, a member of the Academic Advisory Board at the Georgia Center for Public Policy, argues that tax incentives passed in Georgia in 1994 to attract business were unnecessary and fail to address the real needs of Georgia's businesses. According to Morse, while such actions sound good in theory, in reality they have been proven to do little to affect a state's overall economic development. He bases his arguments on over thirty years of studies showing that most tax incentive programs simply give unnecessary tax incentives to businesses to do what they would have done anyway. Morse believes that if Georgia wishes to remain economically competitive in the coming years, it must abandon its current agenda of unnecessary tax incentives and adopt a policy which  focuses on factors businesses find truly important when making location decisions.  These factors include: 1) the availability of an educated and trainable workforce; 2) low taxes; 3) a high quality of life; 4) first-class research and development facilities; and 5) non-burdensome regulations. 9pp.  CONTACT: Georgia Public Policy Foundation, 2900 Chamblee-Tucker Road, Building Six, Atlanta, GA 30341-4128, 770/455-7600, fax 770/455-4355.

<b>How Title XI Ship Subsidies Sink the Taxpayer,</b> by John S. Tottie<p>
<i>Issue Analysis</i> No. 28, Citizens for a Sound Economy<p>
John S. Tottie, a Policy Analyst at Citizens for a Sound Economy, argues that the 60 year old Title XI Federal Ship Financing Guarantee Program, which guarantees loans for a wide variety of vessels and shipyard modernization projects, has accumulated $1 billion in loan defaults. Tottie posits that the case against Title XI is the case against entrenched political pork. Because the Title XI loans have a "subsidy value" and the resources available for investment are not unlimited, the government's favoritism of the shipbuilding industry also means that other goods and services that consumers want will be less plentiful. Tottie continues that any defense of Title XI must explain why the government, and not the American people, should decide how scarce economic resources are to be allocated. In conclusion, Tottie believes Title XI should be repealed. 16pp.  CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H Street, N.W., Suite 700, Washington, DC 20005-3908, 202/783-3870, fax 202/783-4687, Internet <a href="http://www.cse.org/cse">http://www.cse.org/cse.</a>

<b>White House Tax Theories,</b> by Alan Reynolds<p>
<i>Hudson Briefing Paper</i> No. 191, Hudson Institute<p>
Alan Reynolds, Director of Economic Research at Hudson Institute, critically anaylzes <I>The President's Council of Economic Adviser's 1996 Economic Report</i> assertion that changing tax rates have had no discernable effect on work effort, productivity, savings and economic growth. Reynolds debunks the myths presented by the CEA report which declares that the reduction of tax rates in the early 1980s was responsible for the large budget deficits that have persisted since. The Economic Report also states that whereas the impact of tax policy on savings is ambiguous, the ability of decreasing fedeal budget deficits to increase national savings is perfectly clear. Reynolds argues that the report does not bolster its finding with facts, and dismisses inconvenient truths as though they have become politically incorrect, in effect asking Americans to disregard scientific method in favor of naked politics and raw emotion. 16pp.  CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

<i>Backgrounder</i> No. 1084. The Heritage Foundation<p>
Robert Rector, Senior Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, dispels some of the myths and misconceptions associated with welfare and children. He argues that children are suffering simply because the U.S. welfare system has failed. Furthermore, the system has failed because the ideas upon which it was founded are flawed. Rector writes that flawed assumptions that children in families with higher income do better in life, and that welfare can easily raise family income, amount to the false conclusion that welfare is good for children. Rather, Rector points out, welfare has detrimental effects on cognitive capabilities, negatively effects the long term employment and earning capacity of young boys, and promotes illegitimacy. Rector concludes that those truly concerned with the welfare of children must seek a radical transformation of the welfare system aimed not at increasing welfare spending and enrollment, but at reducing dependency and illegitimacy. 14pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>Unintended Consequences: How Government Policies Hurt Oregon's Poor,</b> by Martin L. Buchanan<p>
<i>Fiscal Insight</i> No. 12, Cascade Policy Institute<p>
Martin Buchanan, Policy Analyist for the Cascade Policy Institute, argues that government policy at many levels is actually hurting Oregon's poor families in four ways. In order to escape poverty, families or individuals must surmount four barriers which Buchanan likens to four Berlin Walls. These barriers consist of taxes on the poor, obstacles to employment and enterprise, forced purchases of certain services, and higher prices for the poor. The paper also recommends several government actions to help poor Oregonians at the federal, state and local levels. Buchanan believes that the interests of the poor align well with the general interest and if these burdens are lifted from the poor, the burdens will lighten for all. 12pp.  CONTACT: Cascade Policy Institute, 813 S.W.

<i>Backgrounder</i> No. 1081, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Ronald Utt, Visiting Fellow at The Heritage Foundation, reports on Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros's plan to introduce the benefits of market competition into the public housing industry despite efforts to hinder the plan by an alliance of moderate Republicans and liberal Democrats. However, with the support of House reformers and leaders, in conjunction with bold intervention by the federal courts, Utt believes, there is a good chance that these needed reforms in America's New Deal housing policies will survive the lobbying efforts of a public housing industry determined to preserve its costly taxpayer-supported monopoly over housing for the poor. Utt argues that this clash over housing reform is far more than a dispute over spending levels. Rather, the dispute concerns how government should help the poor. 13pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>The Value of Welfare: Cato vs. CBPP,</b> by Michael Tanner and Naomi Lopez<p>
<i>Briefing Papers</i> No. 27, Cato Institute<p>
Michael Tanner and Naomi Lopez of the Cato Institute reviewed the Center on Budget and Policy Priority's critique of the Cato study comparing the benefits available from entitlement programs with income available from work. Tanner and Lopez maintain that a review of the original study published by Cato and the criticisms in the CBPP study reveals that the Cato study remains an accurate appraisal of the level of welfare benefits. The study, by Tanner and Lopez, states that the CBPP report fails to account for the values of non-cash welfare benefits such as Medicaid. In addition, the Cato study's inclusion of housing benefits more accurately reflects the work vs. welfare tradeoff for long term welfare recipients. Turner and Lopez conclude that with the exception of a small error in the calculation of the values of food stamps in five states, the criticisms of the Cato study are unfounded. 29pp.  CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, e-mail <a href="mailto: cato@cato.org">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.cato.org">http://www.cato.org.</a><p>

<b>Replacing Welfare in Wisconsin,</b> by Andrew Bush<p>

Andrew Busch, Assistant Professor of Political Science at The University of Denver, examines Wisconsin's new welfare reform program. This new program, "Wisconsin Works" (W-2), is a work-based system which tries to help parents establish their own means of long-term support, primarily through work. The focus of W-2 will be with its financial and employment planners (FEP's), who will help families plan and execute employment strategies. The idea behind W-2 is that consistent employment is the way out of poverty, and finding a job for unemployed parents is only the beginning of the process-showing them how to keep a job is the real aim. 8pp. CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

<b>A Working Solution to the Welfare Crisis: The Full Employment Model of Welfare Reform,</b> by Peter S. Barwick<p>
Commonwealth Foundation<p>
Peter S. Barwick, Research Associate for The Commonwealth Foundation, posits that thirty years after the inauguration of the Great Society, it is clear that the welfare state has failed to deliver on its promise to end poverty. In fact, there is now a broad consensus that welfare programs have contributed substantially, if unintentionally, to a worsening of the plight of the poor by undermining the two-parent family and a commitment to work. Barwick presents the Full Employment Model as a promising and fully developed proposal for reforming the current welfare system. The merits of the reforms are detailed and the improvements of the current system are underscored. Advantages cited by Barwick include an end to welfare as an entitlement and the provision of practical work experience. However, Barwick acknowledges and explores important questions raised by the Full Employment Model such as the cost and the role of the bureaucracy. 12pp.  CONTACT: The Commonwealth Foundation for Public Policy Alternatives, 3544 North Progress Avenue, Suite 101, Harrisburg, PA  17110, 717/671-1901, fax 717/671-1905.

<b>Challenging America's Inverted Health Priorities,</b> by Elizabeth M. Whelan<p>
<i>Priorities</i> Vol. 8 No. 1, American Council on Science and Health<p>
This speech by Elizabeth M. Whelan, President of the American Council on Science and Health (ACSH), relates that her top priority at ACSH involves helping Americans distinguish between real and hypothetical health risks, and to separate the leading causes of disease and death from the leading causes of unnecessary anxiety. She argues that the purpose of public health measures, whether carried out at EPA, the FDA, in Congress, or in the private sector, should be the prevention of premature disease and death. She rejects the notion that public health efforts should have hidden goals which might include harassing industy, alarming people about nonrisks, banning useful, subtances or advancing other social and political agendas. Whelan posits that the nation's health priorities are inverted because health issues are pushed to center stage, squandering limited public health resources. Examples include the mother who worries about the alleged carcinogin Alar in applesauce, but fails to buckle her child into a car. She suggests that the influential factors creating inverted health policies include the enormous political and economic clout of the manufacturers of the leading cause of preventable death, cigarettes ,and the contamination of the public health profession by an ideologically fueled form of political correctness that chills open dialouge. 10pp.  CONTACT.

Courtney LaFountain, Environmental Researcher at the Center for the Study of American Business, offers nine fundamental questions that readers should ask when evaluating a story about a new risk. LaFountain's concern focuses on press coverage of studies of three possible environmental health risks to show that many of these points are not addressed in media coverage of risk-based research. The author suggests that journalists have a tendency to report the political or human interest side of a risk, rather than the technical or scientific side. Her nine point plan for the analysis of information involves inquiries which are directed toward correcting false information and disclosing the whole story on partial reporting. Cases she applies her nine point plan to include the major news coverage of the Savitz-Loomis Study, the Long Island Breast Cancer Study and the Greenpeace Chlorine Study. 24pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630, fax 314/935-5688.

<b>FDA Reform, Take One: Chairman Kassebaum's Bill,</b> by Michael F. Cannon<p>
<i>Issue Analysis </I>No. 27, Citizens for a Sound Economy<p>
Michael F. Cannon, Health Care Policy Analyst at Citizens for a Sound Economy, discusses Nancy Kassebaum's Food and Drug Administration Performance and Accountability Act of 1996. Cannon believes the proposal addresses the FDA's obstruction of doctors' and patients' efforts to obtain badly needed treatments, the rise in health care costs, and violations of the First Amendment. These proposals include such measures as refocusing the FDA's mission and balancing the agency's safety and efficacy standards against the needs of the seriously ill. The bill would also allow FDA accredited private firms to review product applications on behalf of the agency and would shorten the time it takes to bring drugs, medical devices and biologics to market, where they may help patients. Though not without shortcomings and with several provisions yet to be added to the bill, Cannon believes the Kassebaum Bill will enable doctors and patients to obtain new treatments faster, and at a lower cost, than under the current regulatory regime-without compromising patient safety. 9pp.  CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H Street, N.W., Suite 700, Washington, DC 20005-3908, 202/783-3870, fax 202/783-4687, Internet <a href="http://www.cse.org/cse">http://www.cse.org/cse.</a><p>

<b>Medical Savings Accounts: The Singapore Experience,</b> by Thomas A. Massaro and Yu-Ning Wong<p>
<i>NCPA Policy Report</i> No. 203, National Center for Policy Analysis<p>
Thomas Massaro, Harrison Foundation Professor of Medicine and Law, analyzes Medical Savings Accounts in Singapore and has revealed a system which offers individuals access to care while holding down costs. According to the study, the island city-state spends only 3.1 percent of its gross domestic product on health care, lower than other Asian nations and well below the United States at 154 percent. In addition, Singaporeans have access to the most modern technology, including CAT scans, bypass surgery and organ transplants. Moreover, there is very little waiting in Singapore, either to see a doctor or to obtain high technology services. Massaro argues that the fact that people are spending their own money, rather than a third party insurer, has helped to curtail Singapore's health care costs. Also, because people are free to exercise choice in the medical marketplace, providers of care have strong incentives to maintain quality. The study concludes that if Medical Savings Accounts were available in the United States, prudent buying would begin to chip away at the high price of care and might significantly reduce it. 19pp.  CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N.

<b>Immigration and America's Cities: A Sign of Economic Health,</b> by Stephen Moore<p>

Moore's study of America's 85 largest cities, using Census data over a 15-year period, which demonstrates that high levels of immigration are generally associated with cities that have more positive economic indicators. The study finds that, compared to cities with the fewest immigrants, cities with the highest proportion of immigrants in 1990 had on average: 15% higher per capita incomes; 90% lower tax burdens; 130% higher job growth; 17% lower crime rates; and 17% lower poverty rates. 48pp. CONTACT: The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, 1611 North Kent Street, Suite 901, Arlington, VA  22209, 703/351-4969, fax 703/351-0090.

<b>Judging an Interest Group by the Politicians it Keeps: An Analysis of NEA-PAC Contributions to House Races,</b> by John Berthoud<p>
<i>Issue Brief</i> No. 120, Alexis de Tocqueville Institution<p>
John  Berthoud, Vice President of the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, relates that a review of contributions by the political action committee of the National Education Association reveals that the Congress that NEA is seeking to elect would radically change the direction of American government. Most significantly, NEA's ideal Congress would vastly expand federal spending and taxation. The average House candidate supported by the NEA during the last election cycle had an agenda to increase federal spending by $302 billion per year. On the other hand, the candidates that the NEA opposed had a net agenda to cut federal spending by $22.6 billion per year. Berthoud also states that, despite NEA's pledge of support for America's children, if NEA could have the Congress it wanted, it would mean either hundreds of billions of dollars in new taxes on American families or hundreds of billions of dollars in deficits for future generations. 7pp.  CONTACT: The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, 1611 North Kent Street, Suite 901, Arlington, VA  22209, 703/351-4969, fax 703/351-0090.

<i>Committee Brief</i> No. 26, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Denis Doyle, Heritage Visiting Fellow in Education, argues that Congress has a historic opportunity to convert Title I, Education for the Disadvantaged, into a voucher program. He proposes that poor families, rather than bureaucrats, decide where their children will go to school. Doyle cites the widely recognized problems with Title I, including the adverse effect of the Supreme Court's Aguilar decision which actively discourages poor children from attending non-government schools by penalizing them if they do. Doyle concludes that in order to reform Title I, the program should be reconnecting to its true beneficiaries-students and not schools. As it is, Title I commits more than $1,000 to each eligible child and if that money were available as a Title I voucher it would permit children to select schools that best serve their needs. Such an approach, writes Doyle, would mitigate the effects of the school bureaucracy and begin to instill values which foster character development. 5pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>Bilingual Education in Massachusetts, The Emperor Has No Clothes,</b> by Christine H. Rossell and Keith Baker<p>
Pioneer Institute for Public Policy Research<p>
Christine Rossell, Professor of Political Science at Boston University, and Keith Baker, a private social science research consultant, thoroughly examine the bilingual education program in Massachusetts public schools for limited English-proficient (LEP) students. They look at the controversial aspects of bilingual education nationwide,and they survey the history of bilingual education in Massachusetts.  Rossell and Baker provide eight recommendations for improving edicuational programs for LEP students: 1) free school districts from the legal obligation to provide native language instruction; 2) increase the LEP population size needed to trigger a self-contained classroom; 3) require parental consent for enrollment in a self-contained classroom; 4) require English language fluency for teachers in an educationl program for LEP children; 5) change the criteria for entering and exiting a self-contained classroom; 6) eliminate specific class-sized ceilings; 7) better research that would allow social scientists to analyze the success of the programs; and 8) the ideal program is that which involves "structured immersions." 242 pp. CONTACT: Pioneer Institute For Public Policy Research, 85 Devonshire Street, 8th floor, Boston, MA 2109, 617/723-2277, fax 617/723-1880.

<b>The Heartland Report on School Finance Reform for Illinois,</b> by Joseph L. Bast, Herbert J. Walberg, and Robert J. Genetski<p>
<i>Policy Studies</i> No. 72 and 73, Heartland Institute<p>
Joseph L. Bast, President of The Heartland Institute, Herbert J. Walberg of the University of Illinois at Chicago, and Robert J. Genetski of Chicago Capital, Inc., formulate a reply to the Governor's Commission on Education Funding and offer alternative principles for school finance reform. The report cites evidence which demonstrates why public schools are failing in Illinois, such as excessive bureaucracy and regulation. Moreover, the writers maintain that spending more money will not alleviate the situation. They argue that student achievement is not related to spending because increased spending rarely addresses the reasons schools are failing. The second part of the report offers a means to improve public schools through a market-based approach. The plan incorporates parental choice, private school choice, competition, and curriculum based exams to improve the quality, and the means to gauge the quality, of public schools.

<b>With Liberty and Justice for All: Redefining the Educational Choice Debate,</b> by Jennifer A. Marshall and Jennifer E. Marshall,<p>
<i>Family Policy,</i> Family Research Council<p>
Jennifer A Marshall, Educational Policy Analyst for the Family Research Council, and Jennifer E. Marshall, Welfare Policy Analyst for the Family Research Council, survey the philosophical and historical background of public education. They assert that, given the failure to establish a full educational choice program anywhere in the U.S. after a quarter century, choice proponents must challenge themselves to develop a new scheme. The proposal should place a premium on liberty and on the private benefits of education while reformulating the public-purpose rhetoric employed by the education establishment. Marshall and Marshall also believe the new proposal should avoid the weaknesses associated with vouchers, including the menace of government regulation, consistent challenges to constitutionality, dim prospects for political passage, the danger of expanding an entitlement mentality and a narrow coalition of beneficiaries to support passage. The authors invest faith in a refundable tax credit scheme to overleap the hurdles presented by means tested voucher programs. 7pp.  CONTACT: Family Research Council, 700 13th Street, N.W., Suite 500, Washington, DC  20005, 202/393-2100, fax 202/393-2134, Internet <a href="http://www.frc.org">http://www.frc.org.</a>

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/tp15.html">How to Talk About Property Rights: Why Protecting Property Rights Benefits All Americans, </a>by John Shanahan<p>
Heritage Talking Points No. 15, The Heritage Foundation<p>
John Shanahan, Policy Analyst for The Heritage Foundation, argues that although the government has the power to confiscate private land, it must compensate the owner. However, when government regulates how private owners may use their land, it typically does so without any recognition of, or compensation for, the costs. Shanahan notes that this de facto taking of property-the practice of restricting a person's right to use his property without compensating him for losses caused by the restriction-is now being questioned. The author discusses House and Senate bills which would protect private property and contract rights. Shanahan also offers the philosophical groundwork concerning the importance of private property. Shanahan laments that although the Supreme Court has clearly sided with the Constitution when requiring the government to pay just compensation when any amount of land is confiscated, the Court's decisions regarding regulatory takings have been less clear. As a result, executive branch agencies have had wide latitude in taking property through regulation. 4pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>Regulation vs. Conservation,</b> by Jonathan H. Adler<p>
<i>CEI Update </i>Vol. 9, No. 5, Competitive Enterprise Institute<p>
Jonathan Adler, Director of Environmental Studies at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, illustrates how regulation, the primary means that the federal government employs to protect endangered species and ecologically sensitive lands, might actually discourage voluntary stewardship and conservation of private property. He calls for non-regulatory, incentive based programs and compensation to maintain environmental standards. Forcing agencies to compensate for a regulation that constitutes a "taking" out of their own budget will cause them to examine whether the benefit of the regulatory action is worth the compensation. This way, according to Adler, "land-use regulation will only be pursued when the benefits appear to justify the costs or when other options are impractical or more costly." The coercive regulatory system that is presently used by the federal government costs the taxpayers approximately $300,000 per wetland acre protected. Adler argues that incentive-based programs would conserve wetlands at a fraction of the cost and would protect private property rights. 3pp.  CONTACT: Competitive Enterprise Institute, 1001 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Suite 1250, Washington, DC 20036, 202/331-1010, fax 202/488-0806.

<b>Key Issues in Environmental Risk Comparisons: Removing Distortions and Insuring Fairness, </b>by George M. Gray<p>
<i>Policy Study </i>No. 205, Reason Foundation<p>
Dr. George Gray, Deputy Director and Regulatory Toxicologist at the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, maintains that environmental risk management is crucial in order to ensure that scarce public health resources are used wisely. Risk assessment plays a key role in environmental decisions such as setting drinking water standards, Superfund site cleanup goals, and standards for pesticide residues on food. The Reason Foundation claims that risk assessment is associated with nearly all of the two percent of Gross National Product that is spent annually in the United States on environmental protection. Gray argues that many of the standard risk assessments use to establish regulatory standards deliberately overstate people's exposure to environmental contaminants. To best employ risk assessment to protect people, risk characterization must be improved to make better use of science in order to find the most accurate estimates, not "conservative" estimates. All risk comparisons, concludes Gray, require the best science and risk assessment to maximize protection of human health. 18pp.  CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S.

<b>A Positive Agenda for Environmental Policy, </b>by Bruce Yandle<p>
<i>The Shape of Things </i>No. 6, Progress & Freedom Foundation<p>
Bruce Yandle, Alumni Professor of Economic and Legal Studies at Clemson University, delivered the remarks in this paper at a Progress & Freedom Foundation roundtable on the environment. Yandle begins by mentioning that it has been nearly a quarter century since the United States and most of the industrialized world have been engaged in a massive effort to maintain environmental quality. He argues that the current "command-and-control" system is obsolete and that U.S. environmental polices need to be changed. An agenda for change would involve the following elements: <i>Goal Orientation</i>, policy should emphasize measuring, monitoring and reporting on environmental policy; <i>Flexibility,</i> innovation should be rewarded instead of penalized; <i>Biological Envelopes</i>, organizations such as river-basin, water-shed and air-shed associations should be encouraged and allowed to innovate in order to achieve goals; <i>Community Common Sense</i>, environmental protection decision making should take place where outcomes and costs matter the most; <i>Common Law,</i> statutory blocks against common law solutions to environmental problems should be removed; and <i>Property Rights</i>, private parties should be justly compensated for public benefits that they are asked to provide. Yandle concludes by arguing that the U.S. needs to update the blueprints for America's environmental policy-which have changed very little in twenty-five years.  4pp. CONTACT. Richard F.

<b>The New Paradigm in Environmental Enforcement: Environmental Audit Privilege and Immunity Legislation,</b> by R. Kinnan Golemon and Laura D. Wolf<p>
<i>The State Factor </i>Vol. 22, No. 1, American Legislative Exchange Council<p>
This issue illustrates how self-audit environmental laws are beneficial to both industry and the environment. It debunks four myths about self-audit privileges, reveals the flaws in the Environmental Protection Agency's policies and philosophies regarding the laws, and provides an update of legislation in the states. The authors examine-and then dismiss-arguments against self-audit laws, deeming them unfounded. The conclusion they reach is that the pervasive and voluminous regulation that has evolved over the years is inferior to a "model that focuses on and encourages voluntary compliance." Such a policy would allow regulatory agencies "to direct their limited enforcement resources at those among the regulated community that do not strive to be good citizens." 13 pp. CONTACT: American Legislative Exchange Council, 910 17th Street, N.W., 5th floor, Washington, DC  20006, 202/466-3800, fax 202/466-3801.

Dennis Avery, Director of the Center for Global Food Issues, and Alex Avery, Research Associate at the Center for Global Food Issues, discuss the new urgency of global agricultural sustainability in light of population growth. They find that the primary challenge of future sustainability is conservation of forests and other wildlands and wild plant and animal species to ensure integrity of local ecosystems. They also find that ensuring adequate funding for agricultural research, as well as researching new ways to fight soil erosion around the world is a priority. Avery and Avery note that modern high yield farming practices improve their efficiency, safety and sensitivity to the environment in direct proportion to investment in new agricultural technology and research. 20pp.  CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

 <b>Marbury's Travail: Federalist Politics and William Marbury's Appointment as Justice of the Peace,</b> by David Forte<P>
<i>The Catholic University of America Law Review </i>Vol. 45, No. 2, The Columbus School of Law<p>
David Forte, Professor of Law at Cleveland State University, examines the Federalist politics behind William Marbury's appointment as Justice of the Peace in the last days of John Adam's presidency. Soon after his inauguration, Thomas Jefferson discovered the undelivered commisions of the previous president that included Marbury's, and immediately ordered them withheld. Forte shows how the ambition of Marbury, the son of an established, but impoverished, family, worked his way up to a position of power in the Maryland gentry. Marbury's political loyalty to the Adam's wing of the Federalist party in Maryland earned him a nomination as Justice of the Peace, "the most powerful office in the lives of the common people." Marbury's position amongst Adam's loyalists brought him Jefferson's enmity. It was Jefferson's refusal to allow Marbury to take office that lead to the landmark case <i>Marbury v. Madison</i>, that established judicial review, and sizably increased the power of the judicial branch of government. 53 pp. CONTACT: The Columbus School of Law, The Catholic University of America, 620 Michigan Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C., 202/319-5140.

<b>Gun Control: Is the Tide Turning, </b>by Austin Fulk<p>
<i>Organization Trends  </i>June 1996, Capital Research Center<p>
Austin Fulk, Research Associate at the Capital Research Center, examines the recent move in many states to allow individuals to carry loaded, concealed weapons. Fulk points out that as the federal government has been tightening gun control laws, anti-gun control organizations have been focusing their efforts at the state level. He points to approximately a dozen states where regulations regarding the carrying of concealed weapons have been relaxed. After debating the arguments against concealed weapons, and asserting that guns do not lead to increased violence, Fulk goes on to document the contributions of groups such as the National Rifle Association, Gun Owners of America, and the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms. Next, he traces the rise of the gun control movement, detailing the work of groups such as Handgun Control, Inc., Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, and the Violence Policy Center. Fulk concludes by noting that while the federal government may soon assist proponents of concealed weapons by passing legislation allowing concealed weapons holders to carry guns across state lines, that help is not critical. Just as education and welfare reforms have been devolving to state levels, so too, he claims, has the issue of gun control. 7pp.  CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, 202/393-2600, fax 202/393-2626.

<b>Handbook on Religious Liberty Around the World, </b>edited by Pedro C. Moreno<p>
Rutherford Institute<p>
Edited by Pedro Moreno, International Coordinator for The Rutherford Institute, the <i>Handbook on Religious Liberty</i> examines the historical and legal aspects of religious liberty around the world.  In John W. Whitehead's forward, he argues that a type of religious apartheid-the exclusion of religious belief and persons from the public sphere-is occurring throughout the world, even in the United States.  To support this thesis, Moreno provides detailed accounts of instances of religious persecution throughout the world.  Attacks against Christians, Jews, and a variety of others are documented from a wide array of countries, including India, Sudan, Israel, China, Kenya, Australia, and Thailand.  Given special attention are the instances of religious persecution in the United States, where, The Rutherford Institute argues, religious beliefs, particularly Christianity, are being systematically eradicated. Knowing where religious discrimination is occurring and taking action to stop it are critical, according to Rutherford because: 1) where religious apartheid exists, persecution of individual believers inevitably follows; and 2) with the rise of secularism, the positive restraining effects of Judeo-Christian beliefs upon citizens will end.  347pp.  CONTACT.

<b>Discrimination, Affirmative Action, and Freedom: Sorting Out the Issues,</b> by Roger Pilon<p>
<i>American University Law Review,</i> Vol. 45, February 1996 <p>
Roger Pilon, Director of the Cato Institute's Center for Constitutional Studies, analyses the current debate over affirmative action from the perspective of First Principles. Arguing that individual liberty is grounded in the idea of individual sovereignty, he demonstrates how the breakdown of the distinction between private and public has led to the confusion that surrounds the anti-discrimination/affirmative action debate among both liberals and conservatives, with liberals trying to impose affirmative action in both the public and private sectors, conservatives trying to impose anti-discrimination in both sectors. Neither side seems to appreciate how the ideas of private and public sovereignty would sort the issues out in the respective sectors.

<b>A Court Without a Compass, </b>by Roger Pilon<p>
<i>New York Law School Law Review </i>Vol. 40, No. 4<p>
Roger Pilon, Director of the Cato Institute's Center for Constitutional Studies, argues in a symposium on James F. Simon's <i>The Center Holds: The Power Struggle Inside the Rehnquist Court,</i> that Simon presents a one-dimensional morality play of the last 40 years of Supreme Court jurisprudence. Concluding, correctly, that the Reagan/Bush appointees have shifted the Court only slightly, Simon's analysis, according to Pilon, nonetheless misses the deeper currents in 20th century jurisprudence that help explain why the Rehnquist Court is as political as the Warren and Burger Courts were and why constitutional law today has become so politisized. The Court today, Pilon concludes, is without a compass because its members, reflecting those currents, have no deeply grounded philosophy of the Constitution.

<b>Emancipating School Prayer: How to Use the State Constitution to Beat the ACLU and the Supreme Court,</b> edited by Harry V. Jaffa<p>

Harry Jaffa, Professor Emeritus of Political Philosophy at Claremont McKenna College and a Distinguished Fellow at the Claremont Institute, argues that Congress has the constitutional authority to immediately pass legislation allowing voluntary prayer in schools. He adds that this prayer would be guided by the acknowledgment of God expressed in the preambles of 46 U.S. state constitutions. This would at once recall the idea of "liberty under God," and remind all Americans that acknowledging God has not been a danger to, but rather the formation of unparalleled freedom for two centuries. Further, he argues that a joint resolution of Congress would preclude the Supreme Court from acting in opposition without declaring all 46 state constitutions unconstitutional. 49pp.  CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 250 West First Street, Suite 330, Claremont, CA 91711, 909/621-6825, fax 909/626-8724, E-mail <a href="mailto: 2026935@mcimail.com">2026935@mcimail.com,</a> Internet <a href=" http://www.claremont.org">	http://www.claremont.org. </a>

<i>Lecture</i> No. 567, The Heritage Foundation<p>
In this speech given at The Heritage Foundation's Resource Bank Annual Meeting, Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith puts forth ways in which Americans can liberate themselves for self-government. He begins his speech by discussing his experience as mayor and how he eschewed the public policy trends of the last thirty years of continuously raising taxes and establishing social programs and control mechanisms to solve the city's problems. As mayor, he has contracted out several city services, set up incentives for social workers to place welfare recipients in jobs, connected kids in tough neighborhodds to their local churches, fought for school choice, and overall, allowed flexibility and innovation in the delivery of public services. Goldsmith calls for devolution, but warns that it will not be successful unless it leads to a market-based system for providing government services. The system has to recognize that "the way to create true value is to let citizens and taxpayers make decisons that are in their own best interests." 5pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a>

<b>Initiative and Referendum in Pennsylvania,</b> by Charles E. Greenwalt II<p>
Commonwealth Foundation<p>
The process of "direct democracy," by way of initiatives and referendum, has fallen short of what reformers had in mind because of its extreme vulnerability to corruption. The question is, writes Charles Greenwalt, Senior Policy Associate at The Commonwealth Foundation, should Pennsylvania join the list of 24 states (and the District of Columbia) that have adopted procedures for statewide initiatives and the 25 states (and the District) that have adopted statewide referendum? Some of the major opposition relates to issues involving "finances," which would only allow those special interest groups with a good financial backing to get their issues on the ballot. Another problem the opposition raises is the belief of a 'complexity' of issues', which argues that the average or even slightly above average citizen would not really understand what he/she was voting on because the topics are too complex for their understanding. Proponents see this "direct" process as a must and point to the Pennsylvania Constitution, which says that the power and right to make laws ultimately rests with the citizentry. In addition, proponents of initiative and referendum believe that a higher voter turnout that develop and provide additional checks on lawmakers. Either way, concludes Greenwalt, what will work for one state may not work for another, thus each state must decide individually if the process of initiative and referendum outweighs the cost of corruption. 40pp.  CONTACT: The Commonwealth Foundation for Public Policy Alternatives, 3544 North Progress Avenue, Suite 101, Harrisburg, PA  17110, 717/671-1901, fax 717/671-1905.

Moreover, these amendments will restore to the Constitution the notion of a finite federal government, something that was implicit in the design of the government and understood by the Founders as an essential part of the system they created.

<p><li><b>Assembly Transformed: The Early Effects of Term Limits in Arkansas,</b> by Donald V. Weatherman,  <i>Term Limits Outlook Series</i> Vol. IV, No. 5. Donald Weatherman, Professor of Political Philosophy at Lyon College, examines the early effects of term limits in Arkansas. Term limits were upheld by the Arkansas Supreme Court in 1993. Since then, observes Weatherman, numerous changes have already occurred in both the seniority structure of the Assembly and the substance of legislation. Weatherman also reports that more "good government bills" have come to the floor than during any other recent session of the legislature. Weatherman concludes by writing that the new frontier of the term limits movement will be at the county government level, where elected officials are the most entrenched. 12pp. CONTACT: U.S. Term Limits, 1511 K Street, N.W., Suite 540, Washington, DC 20005, 800/733-6440, fax 202/393-6434.

<b>Rethinking Divorce,</b> by William A. Galston<p>
Center of the American Experience<p>
William A. Galston, Director of the Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy at the University of Maryland, surveys the ramification of divorce upon America's children, and calls for a reexamination of divorce laws in the United States. Galston holds that America currently tolerates a system that cares more for adults' interests than for children's.  Because of this, he argues, millions of children each year are being adversely affected by divorces-which the current legal and cultural environment permits. To remedy this, Galston states that Americans must first make it the country's goal to both reduce the number of divorces involving minor children, and, when such divorces are unavoidable, seek to mitigate their consequences for the children. Next, he recommends implementing social and legal changes to help couples before and during marriages, as well as at the threshold of divorce.  He also advocates eliminating the unilateral no-fault divorce system when there are children involved.  If divorce cannot be prevented, Galston advocates working to minimize the effects upon children by attempting to prevent diminished income, diminished parenting time, and the disruption of established ties. 5pp.  CONTACT: Center of the American Experiment, 1024 Plymouth Building, 12 South 6th Street, Minneapolis MN 55402, 612/338-3605, fax 612/338-3621.<p>

<b>Hollywood's Two Big Lies,</b> by Michael Medved<p>
<i>Declarations of Independence</i> Vol. 3, No. 1, Independence Institute<P>
Film critic Michael Medved condemns the Hollywood entertainment industry for what he calls their "two big lies:" 1) their claim that they present a realistic picture of the world; and 2) that they tailor their work to meet consumer demands. Taking on the first claim of Hollywood insiders, Medved critiques their portrayal of violence, sexuality, and religion. Next, he provides empirical evidence that more traditional, family-oriented entertainment fares better at the box office than more violent, sexually explicit fare which the industry claims the public wants. Medved asserts that people in Hollywood are not motivated by any desire to have their work mirror real life, or even make money. Their real desire, he claims, stems from a desire to win the approval of their peers for producing shocking and untraditional work. To combat this phenomena, Medved recommends that the American public should be more selective about the television programs and films they choose to watch. Their individual boycotts may not impact industry decisions, he writes, but it will impact their own lives. If they are not seeing the negative images of Hollywood, they can not be directly harmed by them.  5pp.  CONTACT: Independence Institute, 14142 Denver West Parkway, No. 101, Golden, CO  80401, 303/279-6536, fax 303/279-4176.

<b>On the Frontline of the Culture War: Recent Attacks on the Boy Scouts of America,</b> by William A. Donohue<p>
Claremont Institute<p>
William Donohue, President and CEO of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, examines the attack launched upon the American Boy Scouts by various groups charging them with discrimination.  Donohue begins his essay by first examining the principles upon which the organization was first founded.  Asserting that the Boy Scouts were intended to be a group dedicated to instructing young men on how to live moral, upright lives, he argues that the exclusion of atheists and homosexuals is in accordance with the group's mission.  Next, Donohue documents several recent court cases brought against the organization by various individuals in the homosexual, atheist, and feminist communities.  His next area of analysis focuses on the cultural war he feels the liberal establishment and members of the cultural elite have declared against the Boy Scouts.  Donohue then examines the role of the ACLU in the legal proceedings, arguing that an anti-family, anti-God bias permeates the legal association and is prompting it to promote  an agenda which seeks the exclusion of morality and tradition from the American landscape.  The essay concludes with an afterward by Edward J. Erler, Senior Fellow at the Claremont Institute, which recounts the recent court rulings pertaining to the Boy Scouts, most of which seem to favor the group's right to ascribe to its traditional moral code.  37pp.  CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 250 West First Street, Suite 330, Claremont, CA 91711, 909/621-6825, fax 909/626-8724, e-mail <a href="mailto: 2026935@mcimail.com">2026935@mcimail.com,</a> Internet <a href="http://www.claremont.org"> http://www.claremont.org.</a><p>

<b>The New Majority: The "Leave Us Alone" Coalition,</b> by Grover G. Norquist<p>
<I>Imprimis</I> Vol. 25, No. 5, Hillsdale College<p>
 Grover Norquist, President of Americans for Tax Reform, asserts that America is currently in the midst of a historic political realignment.  This shift is occurring, Norquist writes, as traditional liberal coalitions break down, and a more conservative coalition forms.  He terms this new political coalition the "Leave Us Alone" coalition, describing its members as ordinary men and women motivated by their love for freedom, family and tradition, while sharing the common desire of being left alone by the government.  The opposition they face in their efforts to control the political landscape, Norquist calls the "Takings Coalition."  He claims that while for years this alliance has been made up of groups wanting the government to take money from other Americans and give it to them, they are now fighting amongst themselves, and their numbers are shrinking. With victory for the "Leave Us Alone" coalition in sight, Norquist outlines a four-step plan to insure their success. According to him, they must: 1) oppose any and all tax increases; 2) end the Left's sense of inevitable victory; 3) seize the moral high ground; and 4) defund the opposition. 5pp.  CONTACT: Hillsdale College, Hillsdale, MI 49242, 800/437-2268.

<b>The Intellectual Foundations of the Cultural Decline,</b> by Stephen B. Young<p>
Center of the American Experiment<p>
Stephen B. Young, member of the Board of Trustees at the Center of the American Experiment, argues that a powerful force has been eating away at the soul of American society in recent years.  This force he attributes to a line of political thought which holds personal license and moral relativism as superior to the American tradition of freedom and liberty under the rule of law. Intellectually, Young ascribes this philosophy to a French ethic originating in Rousseauian theory. The triumph of this ethic over that purported by English philosophers Bacon, Locke, Hume, and Smith and German writers Kant and Hegel, generated what Young terms "the deconstruction of traditional norms and ethics."  For the origins of its growing dominance in modern American thought, Young looks to the Vietnam war and the need of baby boomers to find a social philosophy that supported their opposition to the traditional claims of the American state. Young not only criticizes the prevalence of this ideology in American society in general, he also examines its specific impacts upon America's colleges and universities.  Its existence there, he charges, has made any true leadership or reform impossible. To solve this widespread problem, Young calls for society at large to demand greater accountability amongst themselves and within the university community.  15pp.  CONTACT: Center of the American Experiment, 1024 Plymouth Building, 12 South 6th Street, Minneapolis, MN  55402, 612/338-3605, fax 612/338-3621

<b>Public Policy Grantmaking: Four Women Donors Offer Their Views, </b>by Ethelmae Humphreys, Heather R. Higgins, Sue Anschutz Rodgers, and Kristin Avansino<p>
<I>Alternatives in Philanthropy </I>June 1996, Capital Research Center<p>
While women control approximately 60 percent of the nation's wealth and are gaining more and more prominence in the workforce, the Capital Research Center reports that women donors are less likely than men to support non-profit organizations promoting changes in public policy.  This issue of <I>Alternatives in Philanthropy</I> takes a look at four women serving at key positions at foundations who do contribute to institutions involved in public policy.  Ethelmae Humphreys, Chairman and President of the Humphreys Foundations, discusses her work to promote a free society, outlining the parameter her foundation has set for public policy recipients and her devotion to social issues.  Next Heather R. Higgins, Director of The Randolph Foundation, writes about the important benefits of contributing to public policy groups rather than just giving directly to charities.  Then, Sue Anschutz-Rodgers, President and Executive Director of The Anschutz Family Foundation, discusses how philanthropic donations to public policy best facilitate the interplay between business, government, and the non-profit sector.  Finally, Kristin A. Avansino, President and Executive Director of the E.L. Wiegand Foundation, relays how her foundation's respect for the sacred, democracy, free-market principles, and hard work have led them to award grants to public policy organization.  4pp.  CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, 202/393-2600, fax 202/393-2626.

<b>The Council on Foundations: The Era of Lady Bountiful Is Over Message to America</b><p>
<I>Foundation Watch </I>Vol. 1, No. 5, Capital Research Center<p>
From April 22nd through 24th in Atlanta, Georgia, the Council of Foundations held their annual meeting. The program, comprised mostly of liberal activists and philanthropists, did feature conservatives Father Richard Neauhaus, founder of the journal <I>First Things,</I> and John Von Kannon, Vice President at The Heritage Foundation.  According to the Capital Research Center, the convention was representative of modern philanthropy's obsession with appearances. More than one hundred awards were distributed for accomplishments in public relations, yet not one program was commended for delivering lives from welfare, helping drug users overcome their addictions, or helping the handicapped.  In other words, for their charitable contributions. Much of this arises, asserts Foundation Watch, from the Council's current President, Dorothy Ridings,  and her obsession with media relations.  But in the Council's focus on how people perceive their actions, they are forgetting to carry out their true mission, claims the article. Foundation Watch suggests that the Council reaffirm the centrality of service to the mission of philanthropy, recognizing where America's charitable institutions have gone wrong.  7pp.  CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, 202/393-2600, fax 202/393-2626.

<b>All the King's Horses and All the King's Men: What Would Charity Do Without Them?</b> by Leslie Lenkowsky<p>
<I>Philanthropy </I>Vol. IX, No. 3, Philanthropy Roundtable<p>
Leslie Lenkowsky, President of the Hudson Institute, examines the controversy in the philanthropic community over proposed changes in their relationship with the federal government.  He notes that while much of the American public supports philanthropic groups assuming greater responsibility for social work, those same groups fear the repercussions of losing government funds.  But Lenkowsky argues that partnership has actually harmed the work of philanthropies more than it has helped them. To support this, he points to the restrictions placed upon programs, and the realignment of priorities to match government demands.  Another problem arising from the mutual dependency of the federal government and philanthropies, according to Lenkowsky, has been that their goals and beliefs have merged, depriving the relationship of any diversity of thought, and along with that, any vitality.  Lenkowsky compares their relationship to a dysfunctional marriage that leaves both parties worse off.  To remedy these problems, he calls for a reexamination of their partnership that will lead to the formation of a new partnership, where government and philanthropic organizations maintain a greater degree of separation from each other. This, Lenkowsky believes, would facilitate a reordering of priorities, increased flexibility, and a reinvigorated private sector more capable of meeting society's needs.  6pp.  CONTACT: The Philanthropy Roundtable, 320 North Meridian Street, Indianapolis, IN  46204-1725, 317/639-6546.

<b>Liberalism and Community,</b> by Steven Kautz<p>
Social Philosophy & Policy Center<p>
Steven Kautz, Assistant Professor of Political Science at Emory University, defends the classical liberalism of Locke and Montesquieu, against its communitarian critics.  According to Kautz, communitarians have charged liberalism with being both morally and politically deficient.  He counters these arguments by first exploring the problem of community as it has evolved in recent years. Kautz then looks at the various disagreements which have taken place between Democrats and Republicans. The next component of Kautz's analysis centers on the arguments of three important, new communitarians: Richard Rorty, Michael Walzer, and Michael Sandel. Contrasting their views against more traditionally liberal philosophies, he discusses Walzer's account of moral reasoning, Barber's concept of the nature of republican community, and Cory's writings on the nature of the self. Kautz also addresses the issues of patriotism, self-government, and virtue, ultimately confronting the question of whether liberal reason can sustain the moral life of a community. Kautz concludes that it is the very liberalism which communitarians attack that has made the notion of community possible, that because of its tenets people can live together in a peaceful, prosperous and just society. 232pp.  CONTACT: Social Philosophy and Policy Center, Bowling Green University, Bowling Green, Ohio 43403-1088, 419/372-2536, fax 419/372-8738.

<b>The Communitarian Challenge to Liberalism,</b> edited by Ellen Frankel Paul, Fred Miller, Jr., and Jeffrey Paul<p>
Social Philosophy and Policy Center<p>
This book focuses on the debate over the protection of individual rights verses the importance of community interests.  The collection of essays included in this volume addresses questions such as whether individual rights should trump group rights, the role communities ought to play in shaping their members' values, and the extent to which government should promote community values. One series of essays deals with conflicts between liberal and communitarian doctrines on the nature of moral agency and the functions of good government. Another collection focuses on alternative ways to conceive of the two doctrines and challenges the basic assumptions about the harmful effects of capitalism on communities. Also explored in this volume are the basic questions of whether it is possible for any society to have one common good, whether culturally diverse states can ever become true communities, and whether participation in the community should be voluntary or mandated by the government. Contributing to this work, and coming from a variety of perspectives are: Neera K. Badhwar; Martha Nussbaum; John Haldane; Chandran Kukathas; Will Kymlicka; David Conway; Steven Kautz; Ronald Beiner; Cass R. Sunstein; George B. Fletcher; Stephen Macedo; Benjamin R.

<b>The Cost of Race and Gender Preferences in California Government Contracting,</b> by Tom McClintock<p>
<I>Briefings</I>, No. 1996-53, Claremont Institute<p>
Tom McClintock, Director of Economic and Regulatory Affairs at the Claremont Institute, argues that when arbitrary distinctions are made on factors such as race or gender, quantifiable costs are incurred. The author examines the financial costs associated with such policies, specifically with respect to California government. McClintock relates that affirmative action and racial preferences in California permeate many aspects of life, including education, and that federal requirements incur additional costs. The costs are divided six ways between private and public sectors costs and include costs to government from above market prices, caused by reduced competition, and opportunity costs associated with the application of resources below their highest and best use. 10pp. CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 250 West First Street, Suite 330, Claremont, CA 91711, 909/621-6825, fax 909/626-8724, e-mail <a href="mailto: 2026935@mcimail.com">2026935@mcimail.com</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.claremont.org">http://www.claremont.org.</a>

<b>Still Choosing by Color,</b> by Michael Lynch<p>
<I>Briefings </I>No. 1996-53, Claremont Institute<p>
Michael Lynch, Public Policy Research Fellow at the Pacific Research Institute, looks at the recent report by the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (OCR) on the admissions process at The University of California, Berkeley, calling the validity of their findings into question. For seven years, the OCR has been investigating whether race played an undue influence on admittance to the University. Recently, they concluded that the admissions policy does not discriminate on the basis of race. Lynch holds, however, that the, OCR's findings notwithstanding, race does play a major role in admissions at Berkeley. He charges that the OCR's report does not include even the most basic data on which it should have formed its conclusions (applicant pool versus admission data and SAT GPA data for the various admission categories and ethnic and racial groups). When this matrix of criteria is examined, according to Lynch, it reveals that white and Asian applicants were not given the same access to reviews and were seriously underrepresented  in acceptances when compared to their numbers in the applicant pools. Based upon the sheer empirical evidence, Lynch concludes that the admission policies of UC Berkeley would be found unconstitutional under the recent Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in Cheryl Hopwood v. State of Texas.

<b>Virtuous Markets: The Market as School of the Virtues, </b>by Ian Maitland<p>
Center of the American Experiment<p>
Ian Maitland, Senior Fellow at the Center of the American Experiment, questions the assumption that the market destroys virtues such as honesty, loyalty and responsibility.  He asserts that proponents of that philosophy base their belief on the existence of a self-seeking, individualistic mindset which supposedly reigns there. This camp sees the market as both destroying the virtues within society and undermining the market's own moral foundations.  Maitland, however, takes a different point of view.  He argues that rather than undermining societal virtue, the market actually works to generate them. In order for businesses to function successfully, he asserts, they must be staffed by individuals who trust and are able to work with each other.  Trustworthiness, self-control, and sympathy are all virtues he claims the market requires and, because of that need, promotes.  Maitland concludes by calling into question the modern presumption that competition forms the basis of the market system, asserting that cooperation in fact is the most fundamental aspect.  11pp.  CONTACT: Center of the American Experiment, 1024 Plymouth Building, 12 South 6th Street, Minneapolis, MN  55402, 612/338-3605, fax 612/338-3621.

<b>Theft By Consent: The Lottery's Economic and Social Impact on Alabama,</b> by John Hill<p>
Alabama Family Alliance<p>
John Hill, Policy Analyst at the Alabama Family Alliance, looking at the case currently being made in Alabama in favor of a state lottery, assesses its probable impact on the state's economy.  Despite the promised benefits lottery advocates claim Alabama would reap, Hill finds that any good to come from such programs would be minimal, while the harm would be significant.  By comparing one proposed model to a similar program already in place in Georgia, Hill concludes that the lottery is essentially a voluntary, regressive tax.  The scholarship money lottery revenues provide in Georgia go mostly to upper and middle class students, according to Hill, while the funds from the ticket purchases come mostly from the state's poor. Next, he asserts that lottery sales have led to a decline in food sales equivalent to the revenue of lottery ticket sales, thereby negating any supposed benefit to retailers.  He also documents that the legalization of state sanctioned gambling such as lotteries have been shown to lead to increases in the rate of violent crime, gambling addictions, and, indirectly, instances of spousal abuse. Hill also points to the wide-spread illegal purchases of lottery tickets by teenagers, and notes that administering lottery programs has proven costly in other programs where administrative costs have risen faster than any other form of revenue collection. On the whole Hill, concludes that a state lottery would be an inefficient and costly way to raise state revenues. 25pp.  CONTACT:  Alabama Family Alliance, P.O.

<b><i>City Journal </i></b><br>
Summer 96, Manhattan Institute<p>
This issue of <i>City Journal</i> features an article by Contributing Editor Sol Stern entitled "The Invisible Miracle of Catholic Schools." Stern illustrates how inner-city Catholic schools in New York have educated some the neediest and uneducable kids from the city's most troubled neighborhoods, for a third of what taxpayers spend per pupil for the city's public schools. Despite the proven success of Catholic schools, Stern notes that liberals have ignored them in their search for solutions to the problems of New York's ailing public schools. Other articles in this issue include: "Special Ed: Kids Go In, But They Don't Come Out," by Kay Hymowitz; "Why L.A. is Bouncing Back," by Joel Kotkin; and "Reinventing the Port Authority," by Dick Netzer.

<b><i>Governing</i></b><br>
July 1996<p>

<b><i>Headway</i></b><br>
July 1996<p>
This issue of <i>Headway</i> features several articles on the issue of what is "authentically black." Joseph Brown, an Editorial Writer with the <i>Tampa Tribune,</i> tells about when his "blackness" was question when he came out on a different side of a policy issue than the civil rights establishment. Meanwhile, Sharon Brooks Hodge shares a story of when her "authenticity" as a black was questioned because she is "articulate." Ron Freeman, President of The Freedom Foundation in Summit, Missouri, argues that authentic blackness should mean being free and responsible to one's self and family, rather than shifting blame and avoiding responsibility. Finally, Jacqueline Gordon, founder and Director of the Christian Women's Forum, laments that too many African-Americans see black "authenticity" and "genuiness" linked to being politically liberal. These viewpoints show how broad generalizations about blacks are enforced within the black community itself and how this serves to work against the original ideals of the civil rights movement. 38 pp.  CONTACT: <i>Headway,</i> 13555 Bammel N.

<b><i>Carolina Journal</b></i><br>
April-May 1996, John Locke Foundation<p>
The April-May <i>Carolina Journal</i> centers on an articled entitled "Lemon and (Sub)Lime: Why We Must Re-engineer State Government." In this article, John Hood, President of the John Locke Foundation, compares state government to the U.S. auto industry to demonstrate the need for political leaders to take risks and be innovative. He finds that over the last 20 years the per-capita cost of state government in north Carolina and the price of a new car grew by about 70 percent in real terms. During the same period of time, however, the quality of these two products moved in separate directions. Concerning education and social services, increased state spending has not shown significant gains in education achievement and a key indicator in social well-being_the number of illegitimate births_has gotten worse. Meanwhile, during the same period of time, the struggling American automobile industry has dramatically improved and has reclaimed a competitive position in the world market. According to Hood, the comparison gives three lessons from the auto industry to state government: 1) competition is essential; 2) managerial flexibility is key; and 3) focus on results is crucial.

<b>CENTER  FOR INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS</b><p>
<b> CIR Wins Reversal in Fourth Circuit in Smith v VCU</b><p>

In <i>Smith, et al v. Fourth Commonwealth University,</i> CIR is representing five male professors at VCU who claimed sex discrimination when the school gave an en masse raise to female professors in 1992. On May 10, 1996 an en banc panel of the Fourth Circuit issued a decision reversing a district court's grant of summary judgment for the University. The opinion of the court obtained the support of six judges with three concurring and five dissenting.
<p>
The en banc decision rejected the VCU attempt to justify the raises with a regression analysis showing pay disparity between the genders. The court said that there was an issue of material fact whether some of the factors excluded from VCU's study_like performance, productivity and merit_ skewed the results and permitted a false finding of "gender disparity." In separate concurrences, Judge Wilkinson wrote that the "search for knowledge is too important to sacrifice to the spirit of separatism"; and Judge Luttig hailed the importance of merit and performance in salary decisions at VCU and declared the study performed there to be inadmissible evidence of a pay disparity.
<p>
<b>Texas Filed Petition for <i>Writ of Certiorari</i> in <i>Hopwood</i></b><p>
In <i>State of Texas, et al. v. Hopwood, et al.</i>, CIR and the firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher represent Cheryl J. Hopwood and Douglas Wade Carvell, two white applicants to the University of Texas Law School who were denied admission despite credentials that would have led to their admission had they been African-American or Mexican-American. In March, the Fifth Circuit held that the school's use of racial preferences in student admissions was unconstitutional and ruled that the Law School could not continue to consider race in its admission process. On April 30, 1996, defendants filed Petition for <i>Writ of Certiorari </I> asking the United States Supreme Court to take the case.
<p>
Defendants provided no less than six separate questions for review. They argued, <i>inter alia</i>, that: 1) Justice Powell's view in <i>Regents of California v. Bakke</i> that "diversity" constituted a compelling state interest is the law of the land: 2) the law school was permitted to rely upon discrimination in some of Texas' public elementary and high schools in adopting a race-based admissions policy, despite clear statements in Supreme Court opinions to the contrary, and :3) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is unconstitutional to the extent that it permits damage claims against states. The Clinton Administration filed an <i>amicus </I> brief on defendants' behalf agreeing with the first two contentions, and, indeed, going further to assert that the law school had a compelling interest in <i>racial diversity</i> (as opposed to the more limited notion of diversity in Justice Powell's <i>Bakke</I> opinion). Even the Clinton Administration, however, could not adopt defendants' argument that the Title VI is unconstitutional.
<p>
The plaintiffs-respondents Hopwood and Carvell filed papers in May in opposition to Texas' petition  refuting these and other even less-plausible arguments. On July 1, 1996 the Supreme Court denied the petition for <i>Certiorari.</i> The case now returns to the District court for the issue of damages.

<b>Developments in the Milwaukee School Choice Litigation:</b><p>
The Wisconsin Supreme Court denied the state's motion to reconsider its ruling dismissing its original jurisdiction over the litigation. That means IJ will be in Dane County Circuit Court. 
<p>
The chief judge of the Dane County Court denied the state's motion to substitute Judge Paul Higginbotham. The judge has a liberal reputation, but seems committed to a prompt resolution of the case. Contrary to press reports, Judge Higginbotham has never issued any substantive ruling in this case_the injunction was issued by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, and remains in effect pending a ruling by Judge Higginbotham.
<p>
Following these two rulings, IJ promptly filed a motion to dissolve the injunction and to schedule an evidentiary hearing. Although IJ asked the court to dissolve the injunction in its entirety, they asked the alternative that it dissolve the injunction as to nonsectarian schools, because only one of the remaining legal issues affects them.
<p>
<b><i>Black v. Village of Park Forest</i></b><p>
The Institute challenges a housing inspection ordinance in a southern Chicago suburb that allows local officials to conduct warrant-less, non-consensus inspections of single-family rental homes. On June 25, IJ filed briefs in support of cross-motions for summary judgment in the case. Briefs will be filed throughout the summer and a decision could come as early as September. The Institute represents tenants who reside in rental homes in Park Forest. The objective of the lawsuit is to establish that if government inspectors wish to enter rental homes, they must first ask for and receive a tenant's explicit consent. If tenants do not wish to grant inspectors access to their homes, the government must obtain a search warrant based on some reasonable belief (probable cause) that the housing code is being violated.
<p>
<b>Davis Bacon Act Challenge</b><p>
Representing four black construction contractors and three public housing organizations, the Institute for Justice amassed historical and economic research showing that the Davis-Bacon Act was originally intended to discriminate against black construction workers and that it is still having that effect today. The Institute has submitted six briefs and three large appendices. A decision could come anywhere between the next moth or sometime next year.
<p>
<b>New Jersey Welfare Case</b><p>
The Third Circuit heard oral arguments on June 10 in the appeal of the district court's decision upholding New Jersey's welfare reform program. The district court held that freezing welfare benefits and refusing to give additional benefits for additional children does not violate the rights of AFDC recipients. Legal Services of New Jersey, with the assistance of the ACLU and NOW, appealed the decision. Representing three New Jersey AFDC recipients and three public interest organizations, the Institute for Justice submitted briefs in the district court and the appeals court. IJ's briefs showed how the New Jersey case fits into a carefully-planned welfare rights agenda, orchestrated by Legal Services attorneys. A decision is expected in the next few months.
<p>
<b>Inter-racial Adoption Case</b>
<p>
<i>Matthew O. and Joseph I. v. Texas Dept. of Protective and Regulatory Services,</i> the Institute's attack on barriers to interracial adoptions, a state trial court recently denied class certification. Judge F. Scott McCown Found that Lou Ann and Scott Mullen, acting as next friends to the proposed class of minority children, cannot adequately represent the class because neither is Mexican or African American, while most of the class members are. Thus, the court found the Mullens "lack the identity of interest necessity."
<p>
The court further found that the Institute's argument that the use of race in adoption is unconstitutional_combined with its overall efforts challenging racial classifications and the regulatory welfare state_create a "very serious conflict of interest" with the proposed class. Such a conflict also precluded class certification.

Devils Tower Triumph_Climbers in Business</b><p>
A landmark challenge brought by users of Devils Tower in northeastern Wyoming has ensured that all may use the nation's first monument pending a trial. An order from Wyoming federal district court prevents the National Park Service (NPS) from closing the site for religious observances by a number of Native Americans. The Wyoming court granted MSLF's motion for a preliminary injunction to stop the NPS from closing Devils Tower to commercial climbing to conform their conduct in furtherance of those American Indians' religious necessities (which) amounts to "impermissible governmental entanglement with religion."
<p>
<b>Victory in Crooked Lake II</b><p>
Property owners on Crooked Lake in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan won a second victory when a federal district court ruled in their favor in another challenge to the attempt by the U.S. Forest Service to regulate private property due to its adjacency to a federal wilderness area. On May 16, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan barred the Forest Service from enforcing regulations denying MSLF clients motorboats access to Crooked Lake. The court agreed with MSLF on all counts, ruling: only Congress may use the Property Clause; only federal land was designated as part of the wilderness; private land could become part of the wilderness only with the consent of the owner; buffer zones could not be created around the wilderness; and wilderness designation is "subject to valid existing rights."
<p>
<b>Gasoline Tax: Unconstitutional?</b><p>
As the national debate heats up on the controversial fuel tax that was part of the 1993 Clinton tax package, MSLF has asked the Supreme Court to rule that the tax was unconstitutional on the day President Clinton signed it into law. MSLF believes the tax violates the Constitution's Origination Clause since it failed to originate in the U.S. House of Representatives. The lawsuit challenging the tax was filed by the Wyoming Trucking Association before federal district court in Wyoming where the court held that it had no jurisdiction to hear the case. The district court ruled that, by act of Congress, any challenge to a federal tax must first be heard by the Internal Revenue Service. On appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, the appellate court, while expressing concern as to whether the Origination Clause was violated, agreed with the district court that Congress had prohibited suits such as the one filed by the Wyoming Trucking Association.

<B>NEW ENGLAND LEGAL FOUNDATION<P>
Punitive Damages Case</b><p>
In a case that has generated much publicity, the U.S. Supreme Court has, for the first time ever, reversed a state court award of punitive damages on the grounds that the damages were so excessive as to offend constitutional due process. This case may induce lower courts to begin to rein in spiraling punitive awards which have made some state courts into virtual litigation lotteries.
<p>
<i>Gore v. BMW </i>was an Alabama case awarding $2 million in punitive damages to a doctor whose BMW was repainted without his knowledge before he bought it. The case was a paradigm of the absurdities that occur under the current system which allows juries virtually complete discretion to award punitive damages. NWLF's <i>amicus</i> brief, filed on behalf of the  New England Council, argued for constitutional guidelines to restrain such awards. This decision begins that process.
<p>
<b>Massachusetts Employment Case</b><p>
After Ms. O' Brien, who had no written employment contract with the company, was detected making anonymous calls to her supervisor, she was fired. She sued for breach of contract in Superior Court and in <i>O'Brien v. NYNEX</I> she won a total judgment of $500,000. That award included, in addition to a large breach of contract award against the company, $100,000 against her supervisor for his malicious interference with her employment.
<p>
NELF argued to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court that the lower court had erred in finding that Ms. O'Brien could base a breach of contract action on the company's Personnel Manual. While the SJC did allow the contract action, it held, as NELF and NYNEX had argued, that if the Manual constituted a "contract," O'Brien had to follow all the rules in the contract including the grievance process. Since she never filed a grievance, the court held that she forfeited any "contract" right she may have had.
<p>
The court, however, did uphold the award against the supervisor personally. In a decision that may reflect the unusual facts of this case, the court held that a jury could find that the supervisor was so personally antagonistic to Ms. O'Brien that he forfeited future cases to ensure that this ruling does not create a loophole allowing fired employees to recover tort damages in employment cases. 
<p>
<b>Retroactive Property Tax Case</b>
<p>NELF will represent the Connecticut Business & Industry association in a Connecticut tax case involving Southern Connecticut Gas Company in which the primary issue is whether a town can reassess a taxpayer's listed property years after the tax was levied and paid.
Connecticut law requires owners of property to file an annual list of all real and personal property with the town in which the property is located. The town has a period to review the data and then it publishes a "Grand List" which includes all property in the town and its taxable values. In this case, a town seeking additional revenue reassessed the company's property years after the tax was paid.
<p>
Connecticut law permits the Grand List to be revised to include "omitted" property. The Superior Court rejected the town's effort to stretch that provision to cover a dispute over the property's value. If the town is successful, all Connecticut property owners will face a dramatically higher risk of retroactive property tax bills.
<p>
<b>NELF Fights Unemployment Compensation Award</b><p>
On behalf of Associated Industries of Massachusetts, NELF will file an <i>amicus</I> brief in the SJC in a Massachusetts unemployment compensation appeal which involves whether an employee who was fired knowingly violating a reasonable and uniformly enforced company policy can still receive unemployment compensation. The employee, a nursing aide, was fired for cursing an elderly patient in violation of a policy against verbal or physical patient abuse.
<p>
The Massachusetts Appeals Court reversed a lower court's denial of benefits, adding a "deliberate" glass to the statute. NGLF's brief will argue that that decision is legally wrong and would undermine laws and rules prohibiting patient and elderly abuse and, more generally, it would lower the already low threshold for receiving unemployment benefits, raising costs for Massachusetts employers and employees.
<p>
<b>Veteran's Tax Case Reaches End of the line</b><p>
After four years of litigation and a supporting brief from the U.S. Solicitor General, the U.S. Supreme Court has designed a petition for <i>certiorari </i>in NELF's effort to stop Massachusetts' policy of taxing federal military retirement benefits.

<B>NATIONAL RIGHT TO WORK LEGAL DEFENSE FOUNDATION, INC.<P>
Union Scheme Against New Employees</b><p>
National Right to Work Foundation attorneys have filed unfair labor practice charges with the Washington State Personnel Board on behalf of a Tocoma hospital employee after a state agency and its union concealed information from newly hired workers detailing their rights to cut off the use of compulsory union dues for politics.
<p>
Western State Hospital social worker Jennie Stephenson brought charges which describe how the Washington Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) and the Washington Federation of State Employees (WFSE) union, in new employee orientation programs routinely withhold details on the limits of union-mandated forced-dues payments.
<p>
Foundation attorneys charge that the failure of an employer to provide such information violated regulations concerning employment relations.
<p>
In her charges, Ms. Stephenson seeks an order to restore the constitutional rights of workers by requiring that DSHS immediately begin informing new employees of their rights to withhold forced dues for politics. She also is asking for a refund of nonchargeable fees, plus interest, collected in the last six months, the removal of barriers to challenging forced-dues amounts, and the full disclosure of the right to withhold forced dues to all members of the bargaining unit.

<B>WASHINGTON LEGAL FOUNDATION<P>
<i>BMW v. Gore</i>: Punitive Damages</b><p>
In a major victory for civil justice reform, the Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 opinion on May 20, 1996, that a $2 million punitive damage award for minor paint damage to a BMW automobile was "grossly excessive" under the Due Process Clause of the Constitution. The landmark decision came only a few weeks after president Clinton, at the insistence of plaintiffs' lawyers, vetoed a measure that would have placed limits on the award of punitive damages in product liability case. WLF argued that the $ 2 million punitive damages, 500 times the amount of the compensatory damages, was clearly excessive in light of BMW's good faith effort to comply with applicable disclosure laws and reasonable industry standards.
<p>
<b><i>Bennett v. Plenert</i>: Endangered Species Act</b><p>
On May 24, 1996, WLF filed a brief in U.S. Supreme Court supporting the rights of persons affected by federal decisions taken under the Endangered Species Act to sue under the citizen suit provision of the ESA in order to challenge those decisions. WLF's clients include Senator Dick Kempthorne of Idaho, Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Drinking Water, Fisheries and Wildlife, Representative Richard W. Pombo, Chairman of the Resources Committee Task Force on Endangered Species, and Representatives Bill Baker, Helen Chenoweth and Gerald Solomon and the Fairness to Land Owners Committee. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had ruled that only environmentalists who wish to protect endangered species have standing to challenge agency decisions in court. WLF argued that businesses, ranchers, property owners and others who are directly affected by decisions under the ESA should also have a standing to challenge the excessiveness of agency decision making under the ESA.
<p>
<b><i>Habeas Corpus </i>Reform Measure</b><p>
WLF filed a brief in the U.S. Supreme Court on May 17, in this expedited case to hear a challenge to the recently enacted <i>habeas corpus</i> reform measure. A hearing in the case was held on June 3, 1996. The death row defendant in this case challenged the constitutionality of the new law enacted earlier this year that limits the ability of death row inmates to file second and successive <i>habeas corpus </i>petitions. The law has a "gatekeeper" provision that requires that such petitions be first approved by a three judge panel of the respective U.S. Court of Appeals and that decisions granting or denying the filing of the petition cannot be reviewed in the Supreme Court. The oral argument centered around the question of whether Congress could deprive the Supreme Court of original jurisdiction to hear <i>habeas corpus </i>petition filed with the High Court. The last time such a petition was granted was over 70 years ago.
<p>
<b><i>Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona</i>: Official English</b><p>
On May 24, 1996, WFL filed a brief in the Supreme Court supporting a provision in the Arizona Constitution that requires state employees to speak English while on the job. In its brief, WLF represented 34 Members of Congress, the State of Nebraska, and the Claremont Institute, and argued that the First Amendment rights of government employed are not infringed by a state law requiring that official business of the state be transacted in English. In this case, a government employee argued that the First Amendment protected her right to settle damage claims against the State of Arizona in Spanish rather than in English.

<font size=3> 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Once in a while, someone comes up with an idea everyone can agree on. Michigan's Mackinac Center for Public Policy has come up with a way for all Americans to know exactly how much their employers have to pay the government -- and for what -- in order to keep them on the payroll. It's called the Right to Know Payroll Form.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	If your employer adopted this form, your pay stub would show every bit of money the government takes from your pocket each payday. And why shouldn't you have this information? You're a taxpayer and the government is supposed to serve you, not the other way around. These costs affect you directly. Who can object to your knowing? 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The "Right to Know" pay stub would tell you how much your employer paid: 1) to administer federal, state and local taxes; 2) to comply with mandatory programs like the Americans with Disabilities Act, Family and Medical Leave Act, Equal Employment Opportunity Act, etc.; 3) for unemployment insurance; 4) for workers' compensation; 5) for the employer's share of Medicare; and 6) for the employer's share of Social Security. 
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Did you know all that was coming out of your paycheck? Well, we're not through, of course. We haven't mentioned the rest of the items that would appear on your pay stub: 1) withholding for federal income tax; 2) withholding for state income tax; 3) the employee's share of the Social Security tax; 4) the employee's share of the Medicare tax; 5) withholding for local income tax. 
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After all that is deducted from your earnings, you get to keep what's left. Just so you have some idea how your pay stub would look money-wise, take the example provided by the Mackinac Center, based on current tax rates. John Doe's two-week pay stub starts with an amount of $1,026.59, which represents the total amount his employer must put up to pay all the costs we mentioned, plus pay John Doe. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	After the first group of costs listed above are taken out -- in other words, the "hidden" money that vanishes before Mr. Doe sees a single penny, even on paper -- John is left with a gross of $916.67. 
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now, take special note: The way John Doe's pay stub now reads, he has the impression that $916.67 is his total cost to his employer. Yet, the "Right to Know" payroll stub tells a different story: that his employer already has paid $109.92 to the government just to employ Mr. Doe. Every two weeks. And the same is true for every employee.	Then, all the rest is taken out -- Social Security, income tax, etc. And what is John Doe left with out of a total $1,026.59? Just $686.67. Another way to put it: Before John could be paid $686.67, the government had to be paid $339.92. 
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Well, now. Doesn't that seem like a lot? It does to me. Don't you think that if all Americans could see in this kind of detail exactly how much of their money is being diverted to the government -- much of it before they even know about it -- they might have a few more questions about why the government needs that much money and what is being done with it? I do. In fact, I think every employer should give this sort of accounting to every employee. 
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And many in Michigan already have. The largest, and most notable, is the State of Michigan. That's right, all 60,000 State of Michigan employees will receive a list of what the state -- the taxpayers, really -- must pay for their Social Security and Medicare taxes. Although the state will not provide employees with the costs of workers' compensation or unemployment insurance, this is a great first step. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, the Right to Know Payroll Form is a great idea. Imagine a country where every employee knew how much government <I>really</I> cost him or her in the form of lost wages. I suppose this kind of "better-informed citizenry" would make a few people in liberal, big-government circles just a wee bit uncomfortable. After all, people suddenly would see the hand of big government dipping into their wallets every couple of weeks, whereas before it was done on the sly. But liberal discomfort has never bothered me before.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	And it doesn't bother me now.

<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1079, The Heritage Foundation<p>
John Hillen, Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, writes that, America will continue to squander its military resources on such inconclusive and tangential operations as Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia, if concrete guidelines for military intervention are not adopted. Hillen lists five criteria for military intervention: 1) it should defend national security interests; 2) it should not jeopardize the ability of the U.S. to meet more important security commitments; 3) it should strive to achieve military goals that are clearly defined, decisive, attainable, and sustainable; 4) it should enjoy congressional and public support; and 5) the armed forces must be allowed to create the conditions for success. Congress should also require, according to Hillen, that the National Security Strategy, an annual report by the President to Congress, contain: a prioritization of national interests and national security interests; a listing of criteria, such as those listed here, that will give guidelines for when, where, whether, and how the U.S. military should conduct military interventions; a set of criteria for deciding when and in what capacity the U.S. will participate in multilateral military operations through coalitions, alliances, and other structures; an unequivocal guarantee that the President will consult Congress before launching military interventions that are not national emergencies; and a declaration that U.S. military forces in interventions abroad will have clearly defined, decisive and attainable military objectives that can be achieved through proven military doctrine. 19 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto:Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>The Imperative of American Leadership: 
A Challenge to Neo-Isolationism, </b>
by Joshua Muravchik <p>
The American Enterprise Institute<p>
Joshua Muravchik, a Resident Scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, calls for an active, interventionist American post-cold war foreign policy. Muravchik argues that at times "America must be the policeman -- at others, the mediator, teacher, or benefactor." Only America, as the sole superpower, can provide leadership in upholding world peace. Muravchik uses the case of Bosnia to illustrate his argument. He asserts that Europe's and the United Nations' unimpressive response to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia revealed the decay of the United Nations and remains as the saddest example America leaving leadership to others. He claims that the current "great divide" over American foreign policy "is no longer between hawks and doves but between 'Washingtonians' (isolationists and so-called 'realists' who want above all to 'avoid entangling alliances') and 'Wilsonians' (activists prepared to spend treasure and even blood to defend world peace)." He also believes that America's domestic problems -- both economic and social -- arise more from weakness of character than from lack of money or presidential attention. He believes that addressing domestic problems and conducting an active foreign policy go hand in hand. 261 pp. CONTACT: American Enterprise Institute, 1150 17th Street, N.W., Washington, DC  20036, 202/862-5800, fax 202/862-7178.

<b>The World Bank and Economic Growth: 50 Years of Failure,</b> by <a href="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan Johnson</a><p>
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/bg1082.html"><I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1082,</a> The Heritage Foundation<p>
Bryan Johnson, Policy Analyst at the Heritage Foundation, examines the unsuccessful efforts of the World Bank to promote economic growth in less developed countries. In light of President Clinton's recommendation that the United States give more money to institutions like the World Bank, Johnson shows that the Bank's approach to economic development has not worked. Concerning the World Bank, Johnson says Congress should: 1) phase out financial support for it; 2) seek a General Accounting Office audit of its lending practices; 3) make remaining funding contingent on public access to its records and information; and 4) require that the Administration provide Congress with a report on the level of economic freedom in World Bank recipient countries. Johnson provides a detailed history of the bank, and illustrates its failed policies. In his conclusion, Johnson points out that although the World Bank played an important role in getting Europe on its feet after World War II, it has drifted from its original mission to become little more than a clearinghouse for international welfare. 21 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>A Miasma of Corruption: The United Nations
at 50,</b> by Stefan Halper<p>
<I>Policy Analysis</I> No. 253, Cato Institute<p>
According to Stefan Halper, a former White House and State Department official, the United Nations' lack of accountability to its member-nations has led to corruption, mismanagement and a disconnect between costs and benefits. Halper presents a detailed analysis of mismanagement at the U.N., citing such evidence of corruption as: "secretive budget practices; an ever-growing army of irresponsible, unaccountable bureaucrats; and a massive duplication of effort." Overall, he calls for a comprehensive, independent audit of the United Nations, followed by drastic downsizing and reform, including privatization of many agencies. If such steps are not taken, Halper recommends the United States consider terminating U.N. membership. 24 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, e-mail <a href="mailto: cato@cato.org">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet http://www.cato.org.

<b>Wages, Profits, and Income: Politics vs. Reality,</b> by <a href="/heritage/staff/wilson.htm">Mark Wilson</a><p>
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/theory/fyi97.html"><I>F.Y.I</I>. No. 97,</a> The Heritage Foundation<p>
Mark Wilson, The Rebecca Lukens Fellow in Labor Policy at the Heritage Foundation, examines the conventional American wisdom that says that wages are down, the middle class is shrinking, corporations are getting fat, and the rich are getting richer at the expense of the poor. Wilson shows conventional wisdom to be wrong. For example, while there has been a decline in average real cash wages since 1973, most workers are better off today because their real compensation and real per capita income continue to increase. He also shows that higher profits benefit workers, while falling profits limit compensation growth. Wilson, concludes that to the extent that real wages are falling for some workers, more government programs, restrictions on trade, and increasing the minimum wage will not bring a solution. Policies that focus on the primary problems -- high taxes and slow productivity growth -- need to be implemented. 11 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>Promise and Peril: Implementing a Regulatory Budget,</b> by Clyde Wayne Crews<p>
<I>Regulatory Reform Project,</I> Competitive Enterprise Institute<p>
Clyde Wayne Crews, Fellow in Regulatory Studies at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, illustrates how Americans live under a regime of "Regulation Without Representation," noting that much of today's regulatory rulemaking is done by agency bureaucrats not accountable to voters. He also points out that the amount of <I>non-tax</I> dollars government requires to be spent on regulation is equivalent to over one-third of the level of government spending. Crews proposes a "regulatory budget" that would enforce greater accountability by limiting the regulatory costs that agencies can impose on the private sector. Ideally, a full-scale budget paralleling the fiscal budget could be implemented. This would require Congress to divide a total budget among agencies. Crews argues that the real innovation of regulatory budgeting is its potential to make regulatory agencies feel the consequences of regulatory decision making, rather than the regulated parties alone. There are, however, some pitfalls to regulatory budgeting according to Crews. For example, under a budget, agencies have an incentive to underestimate compliance costs while regulated parties have the opposite incentive. Crews concludes that a regulatory budget is not a magic device that alone can reduce the current $647 billion cost of regulatory compliance. But, while burdens continue to increase and the benefits of regulation seems more ambiguous, it is necessary to make institutional changes that specify the purpose and reach of delegated regulatory power.  28 pp. CONTACT: Competitive Enterprise Institute, 1001 Connecticut avenue, N.W., Suite 1250, Washington, D.C., 20036, 202/331-1010, fax 202/331-0640.<p>

<b>Broken Promises: What's Gone Wrong with the Economy in the 1990's</b>, by Stephen Moore <p>
<I>IPI Policy Report</I> No. 136, The Institute for 
Policy Innovation<p>
Stephen Moore, IPI Research Fellow, examines the sluggish economic growth of recent years, illustrating the distinct and deliberate change in fiscal policy that has taken place under Presidents Bush and Clinton. Moore shows that compared to the supply-side fiscal policies of President Reagan, the tax-and-spend polices of the 1990's raised the overall tax burden by 1.25 percent of GDP, real federal non-defense spending rose by 30 percent, median family income has fallen by 5 percent (or $2,100 per household) and that tax hikes have failed to deliver the promised revenue. Moore concludes that if the tax-and-spend policies of Bush and Clinton continue, the 1990's will produce the largest budget deficits and the slowest economic growth rate of any decade in the past half century. 29 pp.  CONTACT: The Institute for Policy Innovation, 250 South Stemmons, Suite 306, Lewisville, TX 75057, 214/219-0811, fax 214/219-2625, e-mail <a href="mailto: ipi@I-link.net">ipi@i-link.net</a>, Internet http://www.ipi.org.

<b>Market Opening or Corporate Welfare?<br>
"Results-Oriented" Trade Policy Toward Japan,</b> by Scott Latham<p>
<I>Policy Analysis</I> No. 252, Cato Institute<p>
Under President Clinton, the United States has become progressively more protectionist in trade policy according to Scott Latham, an international trade consultant. He argues that in trade disputes with Japan over cars, semiconductors and photographic film, the Administration policy constitutes "corporate welfare in the international arena." The trade disputes, according to Latham, are a result of American firms' enlisting intervention in trade by the government to make up for their previous neglect of the Japanese market. These firms seek "bureaucrat-to-bureaucrat managed trade, not free trade." This study reveals the biggest beneficiaries of the Clinton Administration's protectionist trade policy toward Japan, and concludes that American charges of closed Japanese markets for the disputed products are groundless. Overall, according to Latham, results-based trade policy is not about opening markets, but instead about granting special favors to policitally powerful U.S. industries. 47 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, e-mail <a href="mailto:cato@cato.org">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet http://www.cato.org.

<b>The Decline of the Nation-State in International Trade and Investment: Is the United States Losing Its Grip?</b> by William H. Lash, III<p>
<I>Policy Brief,</I> No. 168, Center for the 
Study of American Business<p>
William Lash, Adjunct Fellow at the Center for the Study of American Business, examines whether United States sovereignty and the concept of a nation state have been diminished with the expansion of trade agreements and the dominance of transnational corporations. He finds that the nation-state is alive and well in today's freer market place, as well as American sovereignty, arguing that what was widely perceived as a threat to U.S. sovereignty, the World Trade Organization (WTO), by law cannot usurp national sovereignty. Furthermore, 94 percent of U.S. investors have their portfolios limited to U.S. firms, while foreign investors still face many restrictions in the U.S. in industries such as nuclear energy, broadcasting, coastal and inland shipping, and domestic air transportation. Another reason nation states remain strong is cultural identity. Lash predicts that consumers and corporations clinging to cultural identity will fortify the notion of a nation-state and continue to support trade. Lash gives the examples of Canada excluding the U.S. operated Country Music Television and the EU restricting the import of non-European television programming and film. Efficiency, the concept that experts believed would lead to the demise of the nation-state by multilateralism, may not always be what the population desires, concludes Lash. 15 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630, fax 314/935-5688.

<b>Federal Estate and Gift Taxes: Are They Worth the Cost? </b><p>
The Center for the Study of Taxation<p>
This report was published by The Center for the Study of Taxation to illustrate the effect of estate and gift taxes on family businesses, federal revenues and the national economy. Many people presume that the estate tax will not affect them unless they have a large estate. However, a home, a modest investment portfolio, life insurance, retirement benefits, and/or business property can easily qualify as an estate in the taxable range. Ironically, the report notes that the tax does not even raise very much revenue for the federal government. The federal government spends the equivalent of 65 percent of the revenue raised by estate taxes just to enforce compliance with the tax. Overall, this report shows that estate and gift taxes cost people jobs by presenting a huge obstacle to business continuity and business growth as well as limiting the creation of new jobs and increasing the cost of capital accumulation. 16 pp. CONTACT: The Center for the Study of Taxation, 695 Town Center Drive, Suite 1460, Costa Mesa, CA 92626-1924, 714/641-8067, fax 714/641-3128.

<b>The Flat Tax and Small Business,</b> by Scott Moody<p>
<I>Issue Analysis,</I> No. 26, Citizens for a Sound Economy<p>
Scott Moody, Flat Tax Policy Analyst at Citizens for a Sound Economy, examines the effect of the proposed Shelby/Armey flat tax on small business. He finds that the flat tax simplifies the current income tax by dramatically downsizing the 600 different tax forms into just two, each the size of a postcard. This simplification would reduce the cost of complying with the current tax code for all businesses by 94 percent-from $150.6 billion per year to $9.4 billion a year. Moody also illustrates how small businesses bare a much higher compliance cost in relation to their total revenue than larger businesses The flat tax allows for higher capital spending by small businesses, and eliminates the double taxation that occurs when there is a capital gains tax. Investments in small businesses gain profits nearly exclusively as capital gains. So eliminating the capital gains tax would help small businesses immensely. 13 pp. CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H Street, N.W., Suite 700, Washington, DC 20005-3908, 202/783-3870, fax 202/783-4687, Internet http://www.cse.org/cse.

<b>New Jersey Income Tax Cut Led to Savings, 
Not Rise in Local Taxes,</b> by Timothy Goodspeed and Peter Salins<p>
<I>Civic Report</I> No. 1, The Manhattan Institute<p>
Timothy Goodspeed, Professor of Economics at Hunter College, and Peter Salins, Professor of Urban Affairs and Planning at Hunter College and a Senior Fellow at the Manhanttan Institute, illustrate that Governor Whitman's income tax cut in New Jersey lead to savings in local taxes. They found that historically, "there has been little or no relationship between income tax rates, which have varied significantly, and property tax rates, which have increased consistently but moderately." In 1995, the first year of the Whitman tax cuts, there was virtually no change in real property taxes relative to 1994. Goodspeed and Salins also point to an economic phenomenon called "the flypaper" effect. The flypaper effect says that localities are more likely to spend lump sum grants from the state than they are to spend money raised by local revenues. This means, for example, that local school boards are more efficient with their funds when they have to answer directly to the local community. 10 pp. CONTACT: The Manhattan Institute, 52 Vanderbilt Avenue, New York, NY 10017, 212/599-7000, fax 212/599-3494. <p>

<b>What Medicare's Advisers are Telling Congress About Medicare Reform,</b> by <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert Moffit</a><p>
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/fyi99.html"><I>F.Y.I.</I> No. 99,</a> The Heritage Foundation<p>
Robert Moffit, Deputy Director of Domestic Policy Studies at the Heritage Foundation, reports that the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (PROPAC) and Physician Payment Review Commission (PPRC) have called on Congress and the President to slow the explosive growth in Medicare spending. PROPAC and PPRC are official panels that were established to advise Congress on Medicare reimbursement and physician payment reform. The panels gave Congress the following significant recommendations and opinions on general Medicare reform: 1) Medicare spending urgently needs to be controlled; 2) beneficiaries of Medicare need to be given more choices; 3) neither panel opposes Medical Savings Accounts; and 4) today's Medicare price controls cause limitations and heavy costs. Overall, Moffit concludes, the reports of these two commissions underscore the need for fundamental reform. 8 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>The Establishment Strikes Back: Medical Savings Accounts and Adverse Selection,</b> by Peter Ferrara<p>
<I>Briefing Paper</I> No. 26, The Cato Institute<p>
Peter Ferrara, Associate Policy Analyst at the Cato Institute, challenges the criticism directed toward Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) as a component of proposed structural reforms of Medicare. Critics of MSAs argue that they would appeal only to the healthy while traditional Medicare would be left to serve the sick. Ferrara, however, shows that recent studies that argue this point are seriously flawed. Based on actuarial studies and experience in the private sector, MSAs will appeal to a wide cross section of the elderly, regardless of their health status. Overall, Ferrara concludes that MSAs remain the best hope for reforming the Medicare system. 12 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, E-mail <a href="mailt:cato@cato.org">cato@cato.org,</a>Internet http://www.cato.org.

<b>Perspectives on the Continuing Debate Over School Choice</b><p>
<I>Dialogue</I> No. 13, Pioneer Institute<p>
In the November 1995 issue of <I>Dialogue, "Responses to a Harvard Study on School Choice: Is It a Study at All?"</I> The Pioneer Institute gathered nine school choice experts to critique a draft manuscript of <I>Who Chooses, Who Loses? Culture, Institutions, and the Unequal Effects of School Choice,</I>edited by Harvard Professors Richard Elmore, Gary Orfield, and Bruce Fuller. Professor Fuller requested the opportunity to respond to Pioneer's critique. In this response, Fuller defends the impartiality of the research compiled by him and his colleagues. He also welcomes the stimulation to the debate that the Pioneer study contributes, but criticizes the fact that only advocates of school choice were invited for the critique. Fuller maintains that the empirical evidence shows that school choice is not the panacea that advocates proclaim. Terry Moe, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution and participant in the Pioneer critique, responds to Fuller's defense of his study. Moe points out that the Harvard study was not undertaken by impartial researchers either. Furthermore, the Harvard study is, in reality, not a real "study" as its authors proclaim. The Harvard report was merely a collection of separate papers presented at a conference and complied into one volume. Moe writes that on the brute facts, the Harvard report and the Pioneer critique do not differ too much. The difference is in the interpretation. The Harvard report is negative and Moe thinks that this is unjustified. 8 pp. CONTACT: Pioneer Institute for Public Policy Research, 85 Devonshire Street, 8th floor, Boston, MA 2109, 617/723-2277, fax 617/723-1880.

<b>The Decline of Academic Standards in California Public Education: The Story Behind the Student Testing Fiasco,</b> by Ben Boychuk<p>
<I>Briefings</I> No. 1996-49, The Claremont Institute<p>
Ben Boychuk, Research Associate at the Claremont Institute, examines the issue of educational standards and educational reform. The essential question, asks Boychuk, is: Would schools be improved by raising standards in the present system, or is a more fundamental overhaul needed? To answer this, he looks at the state of California and their well-documented attempts at education reform by raising standards. "Back-to-basics" reforms in the early eighties, which refocused on skills instruction, such as grammar, spelling, addition, and subtraction, brought slow but steady improvement in student exam score. Later in the 1980's, however, state education officials shifted their focus away from basic skills and implemented policies popular at teachers' colleges and among progressive education theorists. In 1987, these abstract educational theories were implemented on a much more ambitious scale with the result being that verbal and math SAT scores dropped dramatically. Boychuk  urges parents to stress a "basics-first" philosophy in their local schools and not to just ask for stated curriculum goals and academic standards. Parents should monitor homework and/or classroom assignments for academic as opposed to an "attitudes" focus. For, districts, he suggests a review of current standards for academic rigor, appropriate scope and sequence. Districts should also eschew teaching fads and require basic instruction in reading, grammar, composition, correct spelling, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, and decimals. Finally, collective bargaining agreements with local teachers' unions should be re-examined to see if they interfere with curriculum reform efforts. 25 pp.  CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 250 West First Street, Suite 330, Claremont, CA 91711, 909/621-6825, fax 909/626-8724, E-mail <a href="mailto: 2026935@mcimail.com"> 2026935@mcimail.com,</a> Internet http://www.claremont.org

<b>Superfund: The Shortcut that Failed,</b> by Richard L. Stroup<p>
<I>Policy Series</I> No. PS-5, Political Economy Research Center<p>
According to Richard Stroup, Senior Associate at PERC, Superfund, the federal program to clean up hazardous waste sites, was supposed to be a shortcut. The Environmental Protection Agency was given authority by Congress to clean up waste sites immediately and then bill the responsible parties. Stroup argues that Superfund has failed to achieve the desired results and that it should be scrapped. Superfund has replaced common-law procedures with nearly unchecked bureaucratic control. Overall, Stroup calls for Congress to allow both citizens who feel harmed (or at risk) and those accused of wrongdoing access to judicial review. This would curb the tendency by EPA, according to Stroup,  to create unsubstantiated and exaggerated fears in order to justify expensive cleanups. 28 pp. CONTACT: Political Economy Research Center, 502 S. 19th Avenue, Suite 211, Bozeman, MT  59715, 406/587-9591, fax 406/586-7555.

<b>Property Rights, Regulatory Takings, and Environmental Protection,</b> by Jonathan Adler<p>
Competitive Enterprise Institute<p>
Jonathan Adler, Director of Environmental Studies at The Competitive Enterprise Institute, challenges the notion that property rights undermine sound environmental conservation. Instead, he argues, they lie at its foundation. Under current environmental laws the federal government can, through regulation, take private land without just compensation. This directly contradicts the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The government pays the owner the value of his land when it takes the owner's property to create a publicly-desired resource, such as a military base, road, or wildlife preserve. However, when the government forces a property owner to alone bear a public burden on his land through regulation, the government rarely pays anything. For the last two decades, federal land-use control has been the most utilized way of achieving environmental objectives. Adler calls for Congress to ensure compensation for regulatory takings to restore Constitutionally guaranteed property rights and to lead toward the development of a new generation of environmental protection. Groups opposing compensation for regulatory takings argue that requiring compensation would impose an extreme financial burden upon the federal government. Adler argues that such claims are overstated and that requiring federal agencies to pay compensation would make them "more aware of the financial risks of over-relying on land-use regulation to achieve statutory goals." Other approaches, notes Adler such as incentive-based wetland conservation programs, present a possible way to achieve statutory goals on a far more cost-effective basis. Furthermore, forcing agencies to pay for the private property right they revoke through regulatory takings will encourage them to examine non-regulatory approaches to protecting the environment. Adler concludes that compensating landowners eliminates the negative environmental incentives created by the heavy hand of existing government regulations. 30 pp. CONTACT: Competitive Enterprise Institute, 1001 Connect

<b>Resolving the Tragedy of the Commons by Creating Private Property Rights in Wildlife,</b>
by Robert Smith<p>
Competitive Enterprise Institute's Center
for Private Conservation<p>
Robert Smith, Senior Environmental Scholar at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, argues that where human activity has contributed to species decline, the problem of overexplotation or overharvesting is a result of the resources being under public rather than private ownership. According to Smith, wherever there is public ownership one finds overuse, waste, and extinction. Private ownership, however, results in sustained-yield use and preservation. He uses the case of salmon to illustrate his point. Because no one owns the rights to salmon, each user of this common property resource is pitted against one another. This has lead to rapid depletion of the stock. Meanwhile, in some European countries, salmon fisheries are healthy because the rights to the salmon or the salmon rivers are privately owned. Game ranches, hunting preserves and safari parks also add support to the argument. Overexplotation and extinction of wildlife appears to stem from their treatment as a common property resource. The proper method for wildlife conservation, argues Smith, is creating private property rights. 24 pp. CONTACT: The Center for Private Conservation, Competitive Enterprise Institute, 1001 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Suite 1250, Washington, DC 20036, 202/331-1010, fax 202/331-0640, e-mail <a href="mailto: cpc@cei.org">cpc@cei.org.</a>

John DiIulio, Professor of Politics and Public Affairs at Princeton, and George Mitchell, a member of the Governor's Task Force on Corrections, challenge arguments that American prisons are overflowing with low-level drug offenders and first-time non-violent criminals who can be safely released into the community. This study examined the portfolios of Wisconsin prisoners now serving sentences. This allowed DiIulio and Mitchell to trace the prisoner's criminal histories back to the juvenille justice system. They found that 91% of the inmates had current or prior conviction for a violent crime, the recidivism rate is approximately 90%, the majority had violated their probation or parole. The authors conclude that the people who really go to prison in Wisconsin are violent criminals and criminals with long records. 37 pp. CONTACT: Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, 3107 North Shepard Avenue, Milwaukee, WI  53211, 414/963-0600, fax 414/963-4230.

Kenneth Boehm, Chairman of the National Legal and Policy Center, calls for the abolishment of federal funding for the Legal Services Corporation (LSC). During the FY 1996 appropriations process, congressional leaders reduced a fraction of the funding for the LSC with a promise to end the federal subsidy by 1998. However, during the 1980s supporters and employees of LSC grantees fought efforts to reform federal subsidies to the Corporation. They mounted a massive lobbying campaign, financed in part by federal funds, and devised loopholes to avoid the few restrictions that eventually were imposed. With renewed pressure to reform in 1995, LSC fought back with strategies designed to ensure that their spending habits and politicized activities would continue-business as usual. Therefore, according to Boehm, it is imperative that Congress reaffirm its decision to phase out federal subsidies by 1998. 7 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org"> Insider@heritage.org.</a>

The group issues papers that usually stress two points: 1) locking up criminals does not reduce crime; and 2) the criminal justice system is rigged against minorities. Instead of focusing on the finding of guilt and the appropriate punishment for criminal acts, TSP examines the sociology of the "root causes" of crime. Among the groups that TSP has great influence over are liberal judges, criminal defense attorneys, and law professors. Because their papers tend to blame criminal activity on the failures of society, their answer to crime is more government money for Social programs. TSP illustrates, according to the paper, why legislation should be passed preventing federal funds for groups to lobby for more federal funds.  4 pp. </ul>

<b>American Orphanages: How We Used to Care for Children,</b> by Marvin Olasky<p>

Marvin Olasky, Senior Fellow at the Progress & Freedom Foundation, presents a short history of the American orphanage. This research comes in light of the search for alternatives of failed welfare programs and alternatives to government as the cure for societal ills. Much of his findings contradict the conventional history of American orphanages that is filled with images of child abuse and neglect due to the absence of close government oversight. For the most part, Olasky finds that the accepted history of orphanages is biased towards accentuating the negative aspects while preventing us from seeing the positive role that they have played in the past. 6 pp. CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, 202/393-2600, fax 202/393-2626.
