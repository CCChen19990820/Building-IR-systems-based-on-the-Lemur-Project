<h3>A Commentary on the Podhoretz Legacy</h3>

<hr size=3 width=50%>

<b>Mark Gerson</b><br>

<b>Policy Review</b><br>

<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</I></center>

<p>

	In the early 1960s, the great Columbia professor and literary critic Lionel Trilling warned of the impending "Norman Invasion." He was talking about three brash and brilliant young stars of the literary world—Norman O. Brown, Norman Mailer, and Norman Podhoretz. A generation later, no one recalls Norman O. Brown, and Norman Mailer will be remembered as an unharnessed genius. Of Trilling's invaders, one has conquered: Norman Podhoretz.
<p>	 William, the great Norman conqueror of 1066, left behind the glorious Bayeux Tapestry detailing the story of his invasion of England. Despite two world wars and countless smaller ones, the tapestry remains with us. Norman Podhoretz has left us not a tapestry, but 412 issues of <i>Commentary</i>, which <i>The Economist</i> once called "the best magazine in the world." Podhoretz served as its editor in chief from February 1960 until May of this year. These were the years and this was the magazine in which neoconservatism -- one of the most important political movements of this century -- was conceived, developed, and eventually blossomed.
<p>	What hath Norman Podhoretz wrought? Three extraordinary contributions to our intellectual culture stand out. First, Podhoretz and his <i>Commentary</i> writers were the intellectual force behind Ronald Reagan's Cold War battles. Their ideas, harnessed by a gifted statesman and backed by a strong and capable military, helped bring about the collapse of the Soviet Union and the intellectual delegitimation of Third World and anti-Zionist politics.<p>
	Another legacy of <i>Commentary</i> is evident in today's debate over affirmative action. Podhoretz and his writers, strong supporters of the civil-rights movement in the 1960s, have maintained a steadfast opposition to racial classifications or preferences throughout their careers. When the honorable movement of Martin Luther King Jr. veered into a realm of quotas, racial preferences, and social engineering, Podhoretz stood firm. <i>Commentary</i> authors identified the grave moral weaknesses of affirmative action before anyone else, warning that quotas betrayed the promise of civil rights and victimized their intended beneficiaries. Present-day opponents of quotas often sound like they are quoting from Commentary articles written two decades ago.
<p>	The same can be said about discussions regarding what Lionel Trilling called the "adversary culture" -- opponents of middle-class values whose influence spreads far beyond the college campuses where the critics flourish. While many Americans once tolerated these people, praising their "idealism," Podhoretz and the neoconservatives saw them as destructive, nihilistic, and ultimately dangerous. Rare for intellectuals, the neoconservatives celebrated the prosaic and unromantic culture of the ordinary American. In so doing, they provided bourgeois culture with the intellectual self-confidence to stand up against those whom most now recognize as cultural barbarians.
<p>
<b>Beginnings</b><p>
	Born in 1930, Podhoretz was raised in a lapsed Orthodox Jewish home in Brooklyn, New York. After graduating from high school, he enrolled at Columbia University. There he became the protégé of Lionel Trilling and distinguished himself as one of the brightest literary minds of his generation. After graduate studies at Cambridge University, Podhoretz served for two years in the United States Army before returning home to assume a position as an assistant editor of <i>Commentary</i> -- a job that Trilling had arranged for him. While at <i>Commentary</i>, Podhoretz wrote prolifically, publishing in nearly every New York magazine of note. In present-day discussions of neoconservatism, it is often said that Podhoretz (and the other neoconservatives) are refugees from the Left who, in reaction to the 1960s counterculture, moved rightward. Although Podhoretz was a liberal in that he supported the New Deal and civil rights, his work in the 1950s demonstrates how that observation reveals far more about changes in liberalism than changes in Podhoretz.
<p>	While the topics of Podhoretz's essays in the 1950s ranged from William Faulkner to nuclear war, they reveal the skepticism of a serious critic inclined to doubt any simple answers to social, political, and literary questions. Rejecting the rationalist and utopian themes of liberalism, Podhoretz had a great appreciation for the commonplace and the prosaic. In a 1957 essay, Podhoretz indicted liberalism for being unable to "take a sufficiently complicated view of reality." Liberalism was "a conglomeration of attitudes suitable only to the naive, the callow, the rash: in short, the immature. Its view of the world was seen to be an undignified, indeed dangerous philosophy for the leading nation in the West to entertain."
<p>	In "The Know-Nothing Bohemians," a seminal 1958 essay in <i>Partisan Review</i>, Podhoretz focused his attack on what he regarded as an exceptionally naive, callow, and immature group of leftists -- the Beats, a group of literary intellectuals centered in Greenwich Village who were attaining increasing prominence in American letters. Podhoretz charged that the Beats' disdain for traditional, middle-class morality translated into a dangerous nihilism, "the revolution of the spiritually underprivileged and the crippled of soul -- young men who can't think straight and so hate anyone who can." For Podhoretz, the message of their animosity toward private property and the middle class was clear: "Kill the intellectuals who can talk coherently, kill the people who can sit still for five minutes at a time, kill those incomprehensible characters who are capable of getting seriously involved with a woman, a job, a cause."
<p>
<b>The Implosion of Liberalism
</b><p>

	In 1959, Podhoretz was named the editor in chief of <i>Commentary</i>, but he did not take up arms against the nihilists right away. In keeping with the zeitgeist of the times, he flirted with the Left. He opened the pages of <i>Commentary</i> to writers supporting the peace movement and radical cultural critics like Paul Goodman, who wrote of the "beautiful cultural consequences" that would follow from legalizing pornography. Podhoretz upset many people with his movement toward the Left -- namely Lionel Trilling and Irving Kristol -- but maintained his connections to the traditional liberal community as well.
<p>	The Vietnam War proved a pivotal event in the development of Podhoretz's thought, but not in the way it would for so many others of his generation. Podhoretz opposed military intervention in Vietnam, and under his stewardship, <i>Commentary</i> was the first magazine to seriously consider the war and its potential ramifications. His opposition was always on tactical grounds; he maintained simply that it was a conflict from which the United States could not emerge victorious. To Podhoretz, this one error of the United States did not change the fact that communism and the Soviet Union were evil, and did not suggest any fundamental flaws in the American way of life. The Left and the counterculture, on the other hand, used the war to impugn American institutions like the family and the university.
<p>	So while Podhoretz opposed the war, his opposition to the antiwar movement was more intense and ultimately more important. His position was barely represented in the intellectual community. He saw liberal intellectuals, colleagues whom he respected and trusted, fail to criticize increasingly militant student protesters. Whatever the students did -- even when radicals at Columbia urinated on the carpet in the office of university president Grayson Kirk -- liberal professors praised the "idealism" of the students and excused their tactics as the excesses of youthful exuberance. Podhoretz's wife, the noted writer Midge Decter, recalls the student takeover at Columbia University. She was at a party of New York intellectuals, and criticized the students who had overturned files and destroyed a professor's life's work. Dwight MacDonald, a major figure on the New York intellectual scene for 25 years, responded, "Obviously, you care more about material values than human values."<p>
	This incident was emblematic of what Podhoretz, Decter, and their allies identified as a major crisis in liberalism. Though the term "neoconservatism" was not coined until the early 1970s -- by the socialist Michael Harrington -- it is used now to describe the New York intellectuals and their compatriots who opposed the counterculture and its various permutations. What Podhoretz had called in 1957 "a conglomeration of attitudes suitable only to the naive, the callow, the rash" imploded 10 years later. Unable or unwilling to define and protect its principles against the radical onslaught, liberalism self-destructed as a coherent, governing philosophy -- with devastating effects on its key institutional expressions: the university and the government. Though he was not yet a conservative, Podhoretz became as effective a critic of the Left as anyone on the Right. Many arguments that we now regard as staples of conservatism originated in the pages of <i>Commentary</i> 20 years ago. An example is political correctness: Though the term was not coined until the 1980s, it was best described in a 1973 <i>Commentary</i> article called "The New Inquisitors," written by Podhoretz himself:
<p><blockquote>

	"The upshot is an atmosphere which is no longer conducive to fearless inquiry or even to playful speculation and which, far from encouraging, positively obstructs the development of independence of mind and of the critical spirit. Thus do our colleges and universities continue their degenerative mutation from sanctuaries for free discussion into inquisitorial agents of a dogmatic secular faith."
</blockquote><p>

	Though Podhoretz and several others -- especially James Q. Wilson, whose 1972 <i>Commentary</i> article, "Liberalism Versus Liberal Education," explains perfectly the crisis in higher education today -- tried to protect the university, they saw that their task was virtually hopeless. The university was liberalism's home turf, and was the first casualty of the liberal implosion. The issue to which Norman Podhoretz and <i>Commentary</i> dedicated most of their ideological firepower was the legacy of the civil rights movement: affirmative action and quotas.
<p>	Originally conceived by President Kennedy, affirmative action was designed to encourage institutions to make a concerted effort to be inclusive of all people. Podhoretz always supported this. In his 1979 memoirs, Breaking Ranks, Podhoretz recalled saying when the debate had begun earlier in that decade that "I supported special efforts to recruit qualified blacks and that I also supported special efforts to help unqualified blacks compete on an equal footing." But affirmative action had soon become a series of programs and benefits intended to give preference to people based upon their race, and, over time, upon their ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation as well. And, to Podhoretz, this violated a crucial tenet of his liberalism -- that an individual should not be judged on the basis of an involuntary characteristic. Consequently, Podhoretz made <i>Commentary</i> the intellectual center of opposition to affirmative action. Throughout the 1970s, <i>Commentary</i> attacked affirmative action from every angle.

<p>
	<i>Commentary</i> authors were among the first to argue that those who would suffer the most from affirmative action programs would be the intended beneficiaries; that those not slated to "benefit" from affirmative action would react bitterly when a member of a preferred group received an admissions slot or a job on the basis of race or another superfluous category; and that those "minorities" in the institutions would constantly feel the need to prove themselves worthy, to demonstrate that they were not a "quota hire." As Michael Novak noted in a 1976 <i>Commentary</i> article, "If you grant no responsibility or hope for their own advancement to blacks, but treat their needs as in every respect due to a form of victimization, then no one calls you a racist; you are regarded, instead, as a friend to blacks. 'Don't blame the victim' is the slogan of such friendship. But if, on the other hand, you assert that blacks are equal to whites in potency, moral spirit, dignity, responsibility, and power over their own future, and deny that they are mere pawns and victims, then you set off a chorus of alarums and find yourself on treacherous emotional territory."
<p>
<b>The Failure of Nerve</b>
<p>	After the American defeat in Vietnam, Podhoretz saw this same shifting of responsibility that liberalism had come to embody on the international scene. Podhoretz believed the Vietnam War was a major tactical blunder, but America's misfortune should not serve as a precedent. America was the same great, powerful, and responsible nation that she was when she embarked on this mistaken path. And when the United States had to become engaged militarily in the future, she should do so with a clear conscience and with strength of will.
<p>	This was not so easily done. The Vietnam War had taken quite a toll on the American people: As Midge Decter explained in a 1976 <i>Commentary</i> symposium, "Defeat (and it is a tribute to something that one should feel impelled to remind on this point) is not good for people. And it is no better for nations than for individuals. It humiliates, raises doubts, heightens acrimony, increases recourse to tricky euphemism, and stirs up all those lurking and treacherously seductive fantasies of escape. Most of all, it paralyzes, and once again does so no less to nations than to individuals."
<p>	In the wake of the defeat in Vietnam, Podhoretz worried about what he called "a failure of nerve" triggering "a culture of appeasement." The Soviet Union was as evil as ever, gobbling up nations and subjecting them to totalitarian terror. As he wrote in <i>Commentary</i> in 1976, the Soviet Union is "the most determined, ferocious and barbarous enemy ever to have appeared on the earth." Podhoretz resurrected the argument that Communism is morally equivalent to Nazism; in fact more dangerous in one respect -- intellectuals and their young charges had never been attracted to Nazism. 
<p>	 How to stop Soviet aggression? Only the United States would have the power to do so, and effective resistance would demand not only substantial resources but a will to win. And in the mid-1970s, following Vietnam, Podhoretz was worried that such a will did not exist. "While the Soviet Union engages in the most massive military buildup in the history of the world, we haggle over every weapon. We treat our own military leaders as though they were wearing the uniform of a foreign power. Everything they tell us about our military needs is greeted with hostility." Podhoretz savaged anyone who stood in the way of this American effort. That included not only the political and intellectual Left, but the business community as well: Corporate moguls were all too ready to sacrifice anti-communist principle for the profits in trading and dealing with America's totalitarian enemies. Self-indulgence on the Right was, according to Podhoretz, just as bad as self-indulgence on the Left. Two books he published in this period, <i>The Present Danger</i> and <i>Why We Were in Vietnam</i>, sought to establish the righteousness of the anticommunist cause, and the moral and military readiness of the United States to prosecute it.
<p>	In addition to his own writing, Podhoretz published many important articles on these subjects. Especially notable were Richard Pipes's work on the Soviet Union and Robert Tucker's essays on the danger posed by the oil-producing states. But the most significant essay he published during that period was Jeane Kirkpatrick's "Dictatorships and Double Standards," in November 1979. Kirkpatrick wrote that anticommunism should be the priority of American foreign policy, even if that meant making alliances with nondemocratic, authoritarian governments. Communist governments were worse than noncommunist authoritarian governments because the former destroy civil society and ruin the lives of all of their inhabitants.
<p>	"Dictatorships and Double Standards" was widely read: One prominent reader was Ronald Reagan, then running for president. He expressed his admiration for Kirkpatrick, and later appointed her U.S. ambassador to the United Nations when he became president. Kirkpatrick used her position as a bully pulpit from which to defend American values and interests and to excoriate its enemies in the Communist bloc and the Third World.
<p>	Kirkpatrick was not the first <i>Commentary</i> writer to defend Podhoretz's ideals from the floor of the United Nations. In the 1970s, there was no place where the ideas of communism -- or at least the idea that communism was no worse than American democracy -- were more prevalent than in the United Nations. Often combined with virulent anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism, the Soviet Union and its Third World charges passed resolutions blasting the West and the Jews. And the West, by and large, had little to say in response. At least, until Norman Podhoretz gained influence in that body. In 1975, Podhoretz published a remarkable essay by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, "The United States in Opposition," calling upon the West to take up the war of ideas with the pernicious forces of the Soviet Union and the Third World. This article also was widely read -- Secretary of State Henry Kissinger called to congratulate its author -- and President Gerald Ford responded by appointing Moynihan ambassador to the United Nations. 
<p>	Moynihan took the job in 1975, at the height of the anti-Semitism and anti-Western sentiment in the U.N. The United States could not have found a better man to respond to the virulent ideological challenge being put forth by her enemies. In November 1975, Ugandan dictator Idi Amin took to the floor of the United Nations to deliver one of the most anti-Semitic speeches given since Hitler. Maintaining that "the United States of America has been colonized by the Zionists who hold all the tools of development and power," Amin called upon the United States to "rid their society of the Zionists," and for the United Nations to pursue the "extinction of Israel as a state." The United Nations delegates responded with a standing ovation, and the accompanying resolution that he sponsored -- "Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination" -- passed easily. A majority of the nations of the world had, in the very institution that was once the hope of liberalism in the wake of Nazism, passed a resolution that Hitler could have offered, and did so with a fervor Hitler would have admired. A response was needed, and Ambassador Moynihan turned to his old editor for advice.
<p>	Podhoretz drafted most of the speech with which Moynihan responded. It was a moving address, one that sent shock waves through the United Nations and upset countless liberals. That speech, and the events leading up to it, are masterfully recounted in Moynihan's memoirs of his service at the United Nations, <i>A Dangerous Place</i>, which is dedicated to Norman Podhoretz and Leonard Garment. Moynihan became so popular in New York as a result of that speech that he was catapulted to the United States Senate in 1976, with Norman Podhoretz as one of his principal advisors.
<p>	By the end of the 1970s, liberalism had, in the mind of Norman Podhoretz, become so corrupted that there was no longer any place for him in it or in the Democratic Party. Although Podhoretz did not resign from the Democratic Party, he voted for Ronald Reagan -- the first time he voted Republican in a presidential election. But he had good reason to do so; Ronald Reagan and his staff took the ideas in <i>Commentary</i> very seriously, and <i>The Present Danger</i> was required reading in the Reagan campaign.
<p>	While Reagan's stance toward Communism and Israel were the main reasons for Podhoretz's support, Podhoretz had also become more conservative on domestic issues. Midge Decter calls an aversion to capitalism "the last vestige of our liberalism," and they were supporters of capitalism by 1981 when Podhoretz published "The New Defenders of Capitalism" in the <i>Harvard Business Review</i>. In that article he wrote:<p><blockquote>
	"[Capitalism] is a necessary, if not a sufficient, condition of freedom; it is both a necessary and a sufficient condition of wealth; it provides a better chance than any known alternative for the most widespread sharing in the wealth it produces."
</blockquote><p>

	His support for capitalism deepened throughout the decade, as he published important pieces on the subject by its great celebrators George Gilder and Michael Novak. Podhoretz also saw clearly the failures of the welfare state, and opened his pages to thinkers like Charles Murray, who diagnosed its brutal unintended consequences. He also maintained an assault on affirmative action; indeed, Thomas Sowell's December 1989 essay, "Affirmative Action: A Worldwide Disaster," may be the best critique of quotas ever penned.
<p>	But his prime area of interest remained foreign policy. Though many of his contributors, friends, and relatives (notably his son-in-law Elliott Abrams) served in high positions in the Reagan administration, Podhoretz harshly criticized the president for capitulating to the Soviets. His 1982 <i>New York Times Magazine</i> article, "The Neoconservative Anguish over Reagan's Foreign Policy," makes this case quite succinctly. Podhoretz detected Reagan's tendency, as George Will put it, to love commerce more than loathe communism -- and make deals with the Soviets when his corporate constituency thought that doing so would yield a profit. Podhoretz stated boldly that America's most important responsibility was to fight the evil of communism.
<p>
<b>Fighter for the Right </b><p>
	After those 412 issues of <i>Commentary</i>, what has Norman Podhoretz taught us? Several important lessons. He has taught us that everything we treasure is fragile, and needs constant attention and defense. The implosion of liberalism in the 1960s is destroying our university system. The ideas of Martin Luther King Jr. were bastardized into support for race-based preferences that are anathema to the central liberal principle that people should be judged on their individual merits.
<p>	Leftism took over liberalism because Leftists never forgot, as others did, that ideas -- not economic interests, not social arrangements -- rule the world. Podhoretz has constantly reminded us of this truth, when he stressed that freedom could only be preserved if America had the will to defend it herself, when he bore witness to the original tenets of the civil-rights movement, when he scored communism and supported Israel. In his valedictory statement in the June 1995 issue of <i>Commentary</i>, Podhoretz quotes Theodore Roosevelt. "Aggressive fighting for the right is the noblest sport the world affords." Podhoretz has spent a long and fruitful career fighting for the right, and we are all indebted to him for it.

<b>Policy Review</b><br>

<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</I></center>



<p>

<i>While the Congress is primarily responsible for national domestic policy, the president is the commander in chief of the armed forces and is chiefly responsible for America's foreign policy. Next year's presidential race is therefore an important opportunity for Americans to debate the direction of America's military and our country's role in the world. In late September,</i> <b>Policy Review</b> <i>asked eight leading conservatives to define the most important defense and foreign-policy issues of the 1996 elections.</i>
<p>
<b><a name="george></a>GEORGE WEIGEL</b>
<p>	The United States has not had a foreign policy since January 20, 1993. Before then, with the exception of the Gulf War, the foreign and defense policies of the Bush administration were geared not to shaping the post-Cold War future, but to managing the Cold War's endgame. The Republican president inaugurated on January 20, 1997, will thus have an immense responsibility: creating the first post-Cold War foreign policy worthy of the name.
<p>	If the candidates in the 1996 GOP presidential primaries could forge agreement on the following six points, presidential leadership in 1997 and beyond will prove much easier:
<p><ol>

	<li>The United States needs a foreign policy. With the end of the Cold War, time, energy, and resources can and must be directed toward reconstructing civil society in America. But disengagement is not an option for the world's leading democracy and leading military power. The proliferation of ballistic-missile technology and weapons of mass destruction, hostile ideologies, and international terrorism place America always at risk. The risks are manageable, but not unless they are acknowledged and dealt with.<p>
<li>The completion and preservation of freedom's victory in the Cold War requires the expansion of NATO before the end of the century. Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia should be admitted as full members, and Ukraine and the Baltic states engaged in some form of associate membership en route to full participation. As even Strobe Talbott now concedes, NATO expansion is a mortal threat neither to Russia nor to the evolution of Russian democracy. An appropriate security relationship can be defined between the new NATO and the Russian Federation while the former democracy evolves. If the history of Europe in the 20th century teaches us anything, it is that an ounce of preventive diplomacy and collective security is worth a ton of terrible cure.
<P>

<li>Preventing the spread of ballistic-missile technology and weapons of mass destruction ought to be one of the highest priorities of U.S. national-security policy. This means clamping down on regimes that import or export such weapons, as well as improving counter-terrorist measures. The new president should confer quietly with Congress and America's principal allies on the conditions under which preemptive military action will be used to counter weapons proliferation against rogue states or terrorist organizations. The president should appoint a national coordinator of counter-terrorism, and he should instruct the relevant intelligence agencies and the FBI that a coordinated counter-terrorism program is essential to national security and that institutional roadblocks put in its way will be swiftly removed. <p>
<li>The essential technological complement to an assertive policy of nonproliferation and counter-terrorism is missile defense. It is criminally irresponsible to deny the American people and America's allies the benefits of missile-defense systems just because of Cold War shibboleths. Early in his term, the new president, in consultation with the Congress, should announce America's withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, while pledging to share appropriate defense technologies with its allies.
<p><li>For tens of millions of people around the world, the United States remains a beacon of freedom. U.S. human-rights policy must be reinvigorated, stressing the universality of such basic human rights as religious freedom, free speech, freedom of association, and freedom of the press. The United States should rebut the argument that these rights are "culturally conditioned," while making vigorous use of instruments like the National Endowment for Democracy to support proponents of freedom living in totalitarian and authoritarian societies. We should place special emphasis on aid to the democratic opposition in China and Cuba.
<p><li>On its 50th anniversary, the United Nations is in desperate straits. It has demonstrated its ineptitude at "peacekeeping" in Bosnia, its functional agencies (like the World Health Organization) are awash in corruption, and the "soft" side of the U.N. has become a hotbed of internationalized libertinism, as demonstrated by the 1994 (anti-) population conference in Cairo and the 1995 Beijing conference on women. The next administration should reform the U.N. and its functional agencies, while shunning wastes of time and energy like the Cairo and Beijing conferences and the 1995 Copenhagen "Social Summit." If, by the year 2000, the U.N. has not been dramatically cleaned up and slimmed down, another Republican administration should seriously consider withdrawing from an institution that, at present, hinders the pursuit of the very ends it was intended to serve.
</ol><p>
<b>George Weigel</B> <i>is the president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, in Washington, D.C., and the author of nine books, including</i> <b>Idealism Without Illusions: U.S. Foreign Policy in the 1990s</b>.
<p>
<a name="mal"></a><b><a href="/heritage/staff/wallop.htm">MALCOLM WALLOP</a></b>
<p>Any candidate worthy of consideration should begin by understanding and expressing that the peace and prosperity we enjoy were dearly bought with the blood of Americans on countless battlefields the world over. No nation has given more selflessly to the cause of liberty; no nation has ever had a people wiser in distinguishing among the nations of the world our natural friends, our inevitable enemies, and the barbarians to be left alone. Thanks to the sacrifices of American people, we can say today, as Abraham Lincoln said a century and a half ago, that "all the armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa combined with all the treasure of the earth, our own excepted, could not by force make a track on the Blue Ridge or take a drink from the Ohio in a trial of a thousand years."
<p>	So, candidates, begin with pride in your country and gratitude to its people. We are a great country and deserve a prominent place in world affairs. We must never diminish our strength and purpose, since as Charles de Gaulle used to jest, the future lasts a long time. Serious threats will surely arise; whether they prove deadly will depend on us. Americans can be defeated or our interests thwarted only if we lose our moral virtues, make foolish moves in the world, and neglect our military power. No government has ever matched the Clinton administration in these failings.
<p>	America's only glaring weakness over the past half-century has been leadership sometimes unworthy of the American people. The nation's "leadership class" -- high officials, professors, and heads of big corporations -- has committed America's youth, blood, and credit to wars it did not intend to win. Communism was here to stay, they thought, and even Republican stars such as Henry Kissinger counseled accommodation with it. They dreamed not of freedom's triumph but of convergence and accommodation to tyranny. They dreamed up the idiocy that America's safety depends on continued vulnerability to missile attack, a doctrine that still prevails in Washington. These opportunities to equivocate will come again.
<p>	Since President Bush's time, this leadership class has decided that political and military history has ended and that our real enemies are the French and Japanese who sell us cheese and cars at good prices.
<p>	First observation: Foreign policy does not exist in a vacuum; it must have military capability to protect and project it. Diplomacy without power is a prayer -- not to God, but to one's adversary, and its fulfillment depends on the mood and whim of the party prayed to. No nation can devise a military posture until it has defined its purpose through national interest. America, therefore, needs a new doctrine to replace Monroe and containment.
<p>Such a doctrine must acknowledge that America has legitimate interests. First is the defense of the homeland. 
<p>	Second, our economy depends on trade. We need access to our trading partners.
<p>	Third, we are a nation that values travel—for trade, scholarship, science, and pleasure. Americans abroad must have a nation behind them.
<p>	Lastly, America's interest in regional stability cannot be ignored. If America's presence and purpose in the world can be doubted, if we tolerate vacuums of power, they will be filled by others, and ultimately American blood will be spilled. In the past century, we have been called upon time and again to secure peace and liberty after our leaders thought the world no longer needed us.
<p>	Along with the doctrine we need common sense -- in both diplomacy and military policy. This means not squandering American generosity in petty ventures cooked up by the U.N.'s petty bureaucrats. While our leaders downsize the U.S. military and tergiversate with our commitments to traditional allies in Europe and the Pacific Rim, the future and vitality of those regions is being shaped by petty tyrants whose only asset is the willingness to make war. The administration treats military matters as a spectator sport. The foreign-policy establishment calls Americans' objections to such leadership by turns warmongering and isolationism. Our candidates should recognize these objections as wisdom.
<p>	Collective response is a contemporary stupidity. The U.N. cannot respond, nor can Europe nor NATO nor the Pacific nations, unless one of them is both willing and able to respond alone. Joiners follow leaders, but when joiners have no leaders, they have conferences.
<p>	As for Bosnia, the president and the supreme Allied commander in Europe should tell our allies to join us in giving Serbia an ultimatum to stop the Balkan war or else face a united declaration of war by NATO's 15 nations. Otherwise, America should quit NATO, lift the embargo, and arm the Bosnians. The continuing policy vacuum has sapped America's prestige abroad and fostered European excuses for death, destruction, and "ethnic cleansing" in their own backyard.
<p>	Lastly, America needs missile defenses. There can be no further excuses for inaction. Even Democrats say that nothing so threatens regions and continents as the proliferation of nuclear weapons. To the nuclear threat, we can now add chemical and biological weapons. The Clinton idiocy is to make us all equally vulnerable. America has the technology to protect Americans and American allies from missiles. What possible excuse can be offered for failure to act? Why should Americans or their allies be threatened and blackmailed because our leaders are hooked on treaties and invalid concepts further outmoded by recent events?
<p>	Respect for Americans, pride in our selfless achievements in this dark century, and confidence in our future are the basis of military and foreign policy. These Americans are a wise and brave lot, and they deserve both common sense and courage from their leaders.

<p>	In a time of great uncertainty about America's role in the world, it is not the details of America's foreign policy that trouble her citizens so much as the sense that the man in the White House doesn't know what he's doing. Republican candidates will be tempted to dwell on the Clinton administration's specific foreign-policy blunders. Some of this will, of course, be necessary and valuable. But the American people will not and should not be satisfied solely with an indictment of the president's actions. 
<p>	Clinton's main problem as commander in chief is that, like many American liberals, he is uncomfortable with America's power. This makes him uncertain about how to use it. And this uncertainty is the source of the administration's misguided foreign and defense policies. The 1996 election is a superb opportunity to craft an alternative vision of presidential leadership. Articulating this vision, rather than promising a specific blueprint, should be the focus of the presidential campaign.
<p>By seeking the U.N.'s blessing on the American-led operation in the Persian Gulf War, where U.S. interests were clearly at stake, President Bush showed that Washington was uncertain about its newly acquired status as sole superpower. Over the past three years, the Clinton administration has taken this precedent to extremes. It has subjected U.S. and NATO actions in Bosnia to U.N. approval, even where those actions directly risked the lives of troops from our major NATO allies. It has accommodated U.N.-instigated "nation-building" in Somalia, going well beyond the Bush administration's original humanitarian objectives. In an astounding abandonment of American prerogatives, Clinton sought U.N. approval of the occupation of Haiti last fall, but sought no such approval from Congress. 
<p>	Many Americans have passively accepted the notion, implicit in Clinton's approach, that actions taken in the name of the U.N. are morally purer than actions taken or led by the United States. A look at the source of U.N. power reveals the emptiness of this point of view. 
<p.	Whereas American decisions are shaped by Virginians, Texans, Rhode Islanders, and the free citizens of 47 other states, a majority of the nations represented at the U.N. have political and social structures that are, to one degree or another, undemocratic. Many have governments that abuse their citizens and threaten other nations. None of the representatives at the U.N., including our own, is freely elected. 
<p>	Presidential candidates need to articulate the argument in a straightforward way: American power is the greatest force for good in the material world, and that power is derived from our Constitution, not from the U.N. Charter. How can the decisions of the United Nations have greater moral authority than those taken by the U.S. Congress which, despite its flaws, embodies the most representative and accountable political system in the world? No president should feel guilty for using wisely American power derived from our constitutional system. 
<p>	As they make this argument, candidates must brace themselves for the inevitable charge of "isolationism." The use of this term, now being leveled against the administration's congressional critics, is meant to conjure up frightening images of the 1930s and the unchallenged rise of fascism. It fits neatly with the liberal view of the world, which sees our commitment to world leadership and our participation in the United Nations as one and the same. Much like the domestic debate over welfare, this worldview also equates our "compassion" for developing nations to the amount of foreign aid money we give away. 
<p>	The candidates must explain, in positive terms, America's deep involvement in world affairs, and how this has very little to do with either the United Nations or our foreign-aid program. The combined dollar value of our foreign-aid budget and our contribution to the U.N. amounts to a tiny fraction of our private-sector trade. And we should not forget that much of our $270 billion military budget goes to keep the peace around the world, which is in everyone's interest. 
<p>In a very imperfect world, our military and economic power is derived from the fairest, most humane system of government ever devised. This should be a source of tremendous confidence for a president, not confusion and embarrassment.
<p>As a trading partner, a military ally, and a beacon of democracy, the United States has a huge stake in world affairs. The successful candidate should affirm these roles and dispute any suggestion that our internationalism should be measured by the degree of our subservience to U.N. policies.

<p>Foreign policy without armed force is like sheet music without the orchestra. We must be concerned about the Big Questions, but we must not neglect what has been happening to the "orchestra." 
<p>General George C. Marshall once said, "The soldier's heart, the soldier's spirit, the soldier's soul are everything. Unless the soldier's soul sustains him, he cannot be relied on and will fail himself and his country in the end." Marshall understood the decisive military importance of the intangible moral factors. No doubt he knew Napoleon's dictum that "in warfare, the moral is to the material as three is to one." 
<p>	The Clinton administration appears bent on crippling the military's moral powers as well as its material strength. Though it's uncomfortable, Americans must face the fact that revolutionary social policies are undermining the cohesion and combat effectiveness of the forces. Political correctness is replacing military character.
<p>	Most uniformed people agree, but dare not say it openly. Thus the problem of women in combat roles or homosexuals in the ranks is compounded by an institutionalized lie necessary to inject social deconstruction into an unwilling organism. And it leaches away the ethic of honor and integrity that are the heart of an effective military. Junior ranks see their seniors denying what everybody knows and forcing others to lie. They see careers of fine officers ruined because they will not genuflect to falsehood. They see flag officers putting self-interest above the welfare of their people. The moral damage is potentially disastrous.
<p>	Since a soldier must be "obedient unto death," sending him into battle is a moral transaction. He must be certain his life will not be wasted because of moral blindness or character defects in his commander. If his leaders are contemptuous of his sacrifice -- as was the British commander who reportedly remarked in the disastrous Gallipoli campaign in 1915, "Casualties? What do I care about casualties?" -- it breaks the vital link that enables him to do the bloody, terrifying work of grappling with and killing the enemy.
<p>	But mutual trust does not happen overnight. It takes attention and commitment. Commissioned and non-commissioned officers have to set good examples, displaying truthfulness and integrity as well as military competence. Any policy that undermines this process hurts national defense as surely as cutting the budget or canceling vital weapons programs. 
<p>	Liberals have a teleological compulsion to remake every institution in their own image, and politicize everything they touch. They love to get their hands on the military, largely because it is a command institution and can be reshaped with relative ease from the top down (just as the Left, which is antidemocratic despite its sanctimonious posturing, would like to do to our entire society). 
<p>	To be sure, most military men still cling to the martial virtues, the very antithesis of liberal enlightenment. The military may yet manage to remain resistant to alien transformation. But it may still be forced to undertake more "acceptable" missions, like nation-building and peacekeeping, even though the operations in Somalia and Haiti got men killed, hurt morale, and cost hundreds of millions of dollars, without benefiting any vital national interest. Liberals hope thereby to drain away the ethos of the warrior and replace it with the ethos of the global welfare caseworker.
<p>	Social policy and defense policy intersect at this issue. It could unite conservatives concerned about national security with those worried about the moral health of the nation. But strangely, Republican presidential candidates haven't focused on it. They are missing a good bet. In 1993, Clinton's decision to open the services to homosexuals generated an unprecedented outpouring of opposition. That deep reservoir of concern about the welfare of the armed forces is still there, waiting to be tapped. 
<p>	Perhaps it is hard to believe that the force that triumphed so magnificently in the Persian Gulf War could ever lose its soul. After all, that extraordinary victory was due as much to superior motivation, morale, leadership, and training as it was to technological superiority. Nevertheless, we cannot afford to take these qualities for granted, for they require constant cultivation. Throughout history, complacency has always been the forerunner of military disaster. Because it occurs outside the material domain, damage to the military spirit can't be quantified. It is subtle, insidious, and generally not noticed until it is revealed in the unforgiving crucible of combat.
<p>	Every candidate who wants to become commander in chief had better make sure he will have reliable forces to carry out the nation's foreign policy and defend our vital interests. Otherwise he may one day find this now unmatched military instrument crumbling in his hands just when it is needed most.

<p>	In July 1992, members of the Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces visited the carrier U.S.S. John F. Kennedy, to hear what Navy men thought about the question of women in combat. In anticipation of the two-day field trip, the Kennedy's commanding officer recorded a videotape encouraging all crew members to express their opinions freely -- whether in favor or opposed --provided they were prepared to explain their rationale.
<p>	Since that time, a great deal has changed. Almost nothing remains of the laws and rules exempting women from service in or near the front lines, and candor about the consequences of unprecedented policy changes now in progress can end a military career.
<p>	The armed forces have become a prime venue for social experimentation because those most directly affected must follow orders, without visible dissent. Navy Secretary John Dalton's new policy regarding pregnant women on combat ships, for example, forbids "adverse comments" about deployability problems resulting from absences due to pregnancy.
<p>	At a time when international commitments are growing, defense budgets are shrinking, and the armed forces are carrying a heavy burden of social and cultural change, the next president must insist on complete information and objective evaluations throughout the chain of command. He must also be willing to reverse experimental policies that detract from morale, discipline, unit strength, and overall readiness.
<p>	A pro-defense administration should begin with sound priorities. Contrary to the notion that the volunteer force exists to provide job opportunities, the next president must recognize that the armed forces exist to defend the country, and the needs of the military must come first.
<p>	Technology and hardware are important, but money alone cannot buy a strong national defense. Wars are deterred, or fought, not by computers and weapons, but by people -- young men and women who volunteer to defend their country in a still-dangerous world, despite countless sacrifices and personal risk. To improve the recruitment and retention of qualified troops, we must avoid anything that makes military life more difficult or dangerous.
<p>	Current policies placing women in or near close combat units must be reevaluated -- not in terms of career opportunities, but in terms of military strength and readiness. Lives must not be sacrificed, nor missions undermined, because of front-line soldiers who are less strong, less deployable, and more vulnerable to wartime violence and capture. The definition of the word "qualified," as in "qualified to do the job," must not become flexible and therefore meaningless for the sake of women or any other favored group.
<p>	Affirmative-action quotas that subvert high training standards historically based on merit and wartime requirements should be ended by executive order. In the tradition of Harry Truman, who promoted social change by ending racial segregation in the armed forces, the next president should insist on policies that judge people as individuals, not as members of groups.
<p>	The next president must seek a more sensible balancebetween the interests of parents, field commanders, and children who stand to lose the most when their mothers are sent to fight a war. Overly generous pregnancy benefits offered without regard to marital status, for example, degrade cultural values while escalating family stress, child-care costs, and non-deployability numbers. Disciplinary problems must be addressed as well, since human emotions do not always respond to military orders.
<p>The Clinton administration has persisted in promoting homosexuality as an acceptable lifestyle, despite the law passed in 1993 intended to exclude homosexuals from the military. The next president should deny the gay agenda, which has gained significant ground in all branches of government, including the uniformed services.
<p>	Ronald Reagan, who enlisted but did not serve in the front lines, demonstrated that a pro-defense presidency does not depend on military background alone. In the tradition of Ronald Reagan, the next commander in chief must convey a deep respect for military values, and be willing to defend the interests of the troops against civilian activists with different agendas.
<p>	Clinton has tried to convey respect for the military by using soldiers, sailors, and aviators as backdrops for "photo ops." The next commander in chief must earn the respect of the troops by standing on principle, not public relations.

	The three most important foreign-policy and defense issues of the 1996 elections are America's vulnerability to nuclear missiles, foreign aid, and the extent of America's international engagement, including the use of force overseas.
<p>	    In a post-Cold War world, a nuclear attack against American territory poses the single gravest security challenge. Despite several strategic-arms control agreements signed over the last decade, Russia retains a large nuclear arsenal. China is also modernizing its nuclear forces. A number of other countries are aggressively developing small, but potent, nuclear forces.
<p>   America's failure to deploy ballistic-missile defenses doesn't just perpetuate our national vulnerability. It also greatly weakens our diplomatic prowess. Imagine how different the outcome of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait might have been if, just as the Bush administration was contemplating its options, Saddam Hussein had informed the world that he had already built a dozen or so nuclear-tipped ICBMs.
<p>	Contrary to the musings of traditional arms-control theorists, American ballistic-missile defense deployments are likely to discourage other countries from embarking on the path of nuclear proliferation. I suggest that the candidate inform the American public about our vulnerability to nuclear attack and explain the imperative, including costs, of appropriate solutions. I propose a measured missile-defense program that deploys "brilliant pebbles"-like weapons as its first phase.
<p>	The popularity of foreign aid with the American people has reached a nadir. Americans complain, correctly, that significant amounts of U.S. aid have been misdirected, and many object to providing any foreign assistance when we have urgent domestic problems. But foreign aid, if it advances specific U.S. national interests, can be a useful foreign policy investment. I recommend that the presidential candidate begin a candid dialogue with the American people about the merits of a judicious foreign-aid program. While streamilining our foreign aid delivery by merging AID into the state department and eliminating wasteful social and developmental programs, I would show how it serves America's interest to use foreign aid to promote democracy and free markets in other countries. Furthermore, U.S. aid should be provided directly to its intended recipients rather than funneled through international institutions.
<p>	Finally, the use of American troops in such places as Somalia and Haiti and the speculation that American ground forces may be sent into combat in the former Yugoslavia have reintensified the long-standing debate about the proper scope of America's international engagement and the role of force in support of our national interests.
<p>	Presented with these realities, I suggest reestablishing the basic public consensus on this critical national-security issue. The American people need to understand that we must remain a key international player and that our troops should be deployed for combat overseas only when vital American interests are at stake. Once deployed, our troops should be given all the resources they need to prevail in combat quickly and decisively. Nothing would be more harmful than the specter of American forces suffering casualties because they either lacked heavy armor (as in Mogadishu), could not engage in an air-defense suppression (as in Bosnia), or were commanded by bungling U.N. officials.

<p>
	There are two foreign and military policy issues that seem to me of greatest significance during the forthcoming campaign.
<p>	The first issue is missile defense. The spread of nuclear weapons and missile technology can be slowed but not avoided, for primitive versions of the bomb and of delivery systems are, after all, 50-year-old technology. The bizarre theory of mutual assured destruction and the obsolete Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty keep us defenseless against all logic, and the time has come to replace them with a policy of defending the country. The more plainly candidates speak about this, the more public support there will be.
<P>	The second issue is intervention: When do we risk the lives of our soldiers in crises overseas? This is obviously a complex issue and, with the Cold War over, many Americans (including some candidates) will be tempted to answer: "Never." I would like to see a candidate address this issue in more or less the following manner:<p><blockquote>
	"During the Cold War, we had to lead a coalition of nations against the twin threats of communism and Soviet power. We rose to that struggle and won it, and our victory saved our own freedom was well as the freedom of hundreds of millions of others.<p>
	"Now that it is over, we can do less and spend less overseas. There are places on the globe that simply don't matter enough to demand American involvement. But just as we had interests to defend before there was a Cold War, and just as there were threats to us before then, the same is true now.
<p>	"Some of these interests are very old: The first American statesmen saw what we had at stake in Mexico and the Caribbean; today, drug and migration flows are still major issues. Some interests are new: The spread of nuclear weapons and missile technology now gives small nations and terrorist groups the ability to strike at America. But it is clear that a world in which every petty tyrant is armed to the teeth, and our foreign markets are in turmoil, and our own region is plagued by instability, will not be a very good gift to our children. America still has an irreplaceable role if the world is to be a less dangerous place.
<p>	"Why us? Because our wealth, power, and freedom grant us the leadership of the world's democracies. It is true that our power provides a continual temptation to meddle in situations where our interests do not require us to jump in, and one test of a president is to keep his cool and stay out of those.
<p>	"But if we are to keep the world moving toward freedom, and protect our freedom, safety, and prosperity, we cannot act as if we lived on some other planet. Another test of a president is to know when our interests really are at risk today, and the toughest test is to understand when they will be at risk tomorrow if we don't act now. We can pass those tests or fail them, but we cannot avoid them."</blockquote><p>

<a name="seth"></a><b> SETH CROPSEY</b>
<p>	The overriding foreign-policy issue in the coming presidential campaign is the loss of the strong place America held in 1991—the year of victory in the Persian Gulf War and the formal disintegration of the Soviet Union -- and the nation's progressive weakness in international affairs. Do the American people approve of this direction?<p>
	Presidential candidates would be wise to reject the conventional wisdom that Americans are uninterested in foreign policy, that their desire to address serious domestic problems comes at the expense of concerns about U.S. influence abroad. Voter confusion is understandable, since no national political leader has explained why Americans should be interested. The task of a challenger is to show plainly what a world bereft of American leadership looks like. This should be at the heart of any conservative presidential candidate's foreign-policy position.<p>
	At risk in Bosnia is America's historical commitment to the principle that employing force to seize another country is unacceptable. The current administration has effectively given the U.N. secretary-general veto power over the use of our forces in the Balkans. This failure has neutered U.S. policy there and promises to cripple it in the future.
<p>	Up to now, American weakness in Bosnia -- as evidenced by years of inaction, and demonstrably poor military advice -- 0has encouraged only one leader (Jacques Chirac of democratic France) to fill the void. But if this administration's incomprehensible Bosnia policy continues, it will eventually embolden some dangerous challenger armed with nuclear weapons. The conflict in the former Yugoslavia could also spread throughout the Balkans and beyond. Presidential candidates should remind voters of this century's brutal history and of America's immediate economic and security interest in maintaining a peaceful, prosperous Europe.
<p>	To underline the character of excessive multilateralism, the eventual challenger to Clinton in 1996 should use in a political advertisement the videotape of the U.N. spokesman Ahmad Fawzi's press announcement on July 26. That's when he declared that "the secretary-general has decided to delegate the necessary authority [to conduct air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions] to commanders in the field." Insofar as Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali really holds the power to decide when American commanders may or may not use force, the challenger should make the current administration's responsibility for this plain. Voters will not be pleased.
<p>	America's gyrating policies in Asia for the past three years undermine this nation's general commitment to free trade, as well as its specific commercial and security ties to Japan and the future of its relationship with China. Asia has the fastest-growing economies in the world, and American exports there support more than three million jobs. Blown by domestic political winds, the current administration's policies in Asia have touched every point on the compass. Going to the brink of a trade war with Japan is, politically, perhaps unassailable. But if Japan is true to form, there will be no significant increases in imports of American auto parts by this time next year. 
<p>	The challenger should exploit this fact. He should call attention to the inconsistency between the administration's support for NAFTA and GATT, and its managed-trade policy towards Japan. He should also note that Japan is slowly becoming more democratic by itself, and that U.S. pressure for managed trade thwarts this evolution.
<p>	Finally, the candidate should demonstrate that he will take his responsibility as commander in chief seriously. A missile defense is only one thing that this administration is ignoring in order to keep the military as ready as it needed to be during the Cold War. America now has within its technological grasp the ability simultaneously to reduce defense spending and construct a military that can move swiftly to any part of the world, and from a safe distance wield decisive conventional power. This is the kind of force that we should be building, not a smaller version of the Cold War model. To achieve this, the defense department must shrink the huge and ungainly central bureaucracy it has developed over the years. The candidate will be on firm ground in arguing that the sound political principle of decentralization and returning authority to the states should apply equally to the wise management of the nation's defenses.
<p>	It has been years since a presidential candidate said anything about defense except that there should be more of it, or less of it. The candidate who breaks this pattern next year will add to his qualification as prospective commander in chief, and perform for the defense department a vital task that it may not be able to accomplish on its own.

<b>Policy Review</b><br>
<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</i></center>
<p>
	This November, voters in Virginia, New Jersey, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Kentucky will have the opportunity to tell their elected representatives whether they are happy with the new conservative direction in American politics. This represents the first chance since the conservative GOP landslide of 1994 for large numbers of voters to go the polls, so the state races of 1995 will provide the first electoral indication of whether America is entering a period of fundamental political realignment.<p>	One of the most significant bellwethers will be elections for the General Assembly in Virginia. All 100 seats of the House of Delegates and all 40 seats of the Senate are up for balloting, and the ideological differences between the two parties are as clearly defined as in the national congressional elections of 1994. Republican Governor George Allen, elected in 1993, has pushed a wide-ranging agenda to put a more conservative stamp on Virginia government. Splitting mostly along partisan lines, the Democratic-controlled General Assembly has rejected most of his proposals, including tax and spending cuts, school choice, and prison-construction measures. <p>	Allen (who is limited by state law to a single four-year term) says that this year's General Assembly "will go down in history as one of the least productive ever. We sadly saw the Democratic defenders of 'business-as-usual' status quo mount unprecedented party-line defenses against those of us championing positive and constructive change." <p>	Republicans haven't controlled either house of the Virginia General Assembly in modern times. But recent national and state political trends have given the Democratic leadership in the legislature ample reason to worry. When Douglas Wilder was elected governor in 1989, the Democrats enjoyed majorities of nearly 2:1 in the House, and 3:1 in the Senate. This year, they may lose control of both houses of the General Assembly. In the House, their majority has fallen to 52-47 (with one independent) and their margin in the Sen
ate is just 22-18. Republican success in November could usher in reform on some of the most important issues facing the state and the nation: crime, taxes and spending, education, welfare reform, and the relationship between Virginia and the federal government.<p><b>Crime</b><p>
	From 1988 to 1993, the state's violent-crime rate rose nearly 30 percent, even though the most crime-prone age bracket (15-24) had declined. Felons were, on average, serving just one-third of their sentences. The average individual convicted of first-degree murder, for example, received a term of 35 years but spent just 10 years in jail.<p>	Democrats in the legislature endorsed Allen initiatives to abolish parole and increase prison time by 125 percent for first-time murderers and rapists, to consider violent offenses committed as juveniles when sentencing adult offenders, and to enact truth-in-sentencing legislation. This year, however, the General Assembly voted, mostly along party lines, to provide just one-quarter of the $400 million requested by Allen for new prison construction. <p>	    By refusing to appropriate sufficient money, Allen says, his political opponents are putting public safety at risk. "Liberals in the General Assembly," he adds, "are shortchanging prison construction, making it more likely that dangerous criminals will be released early -- and back in our neighborhoods." Allen warns that "increasing prison terms, without increasing prison capacity, is precisely the mistake that too many other states have made."<p><b>Taxes and Spending</b> <p>
	In December 1994, Allen drew fire when he proposed a relatively modest package of tax and spending cuts. Democrats attacked the governor's proposal as a tax "shift" in favor of the rich. They urged taxpayers to send $33 checks to Allen (the average amount a family's taxes would be lowered in the first year, under Allen's proposal) in an attempt to illustrate that Virginians didn't really need lower taxes. What the Democrats did not say, however, was that, by the fifth year, the average family of four, with a $30,000 income, would have saved nearly $1,000 in state taxes under Allen's proposal. Accurate or not, the Democrats' public relations campaign was successful, and the tax cut was killed. <p>	Though Allen's budget proposal cut only $170 million (out of a two-year, $15-billion general-fund budget), the Democrats tried to portray Allen's proposed budget cuts as unreasonable. For example, when Allen proposed eliminating duplicative state agricultural extension programs and high-salaried staff positions, he was erroneously accused of wanting to do away with popular 4-H agricultural programs. Similarly, when Allen targeted "family planning" programs (which were included in, of all places, the agriculture budget), he was attacked for wanting to slash farm spending. The Democrats pushed their own budget through the General Assembly on a party-line vote, restoring $166 million of Allen's spending cuts. <p>		<b>Education Reform</b><p>	During the recent session of the General Assembly, Allen proposed a new program of charter schools -- public schools controlled by teachers, universities, or other groups independent of school boards. Several bills were introduced in the General Assembly, but were killed after Democrats objected. Democratic Senator R. Edward Houck said the concept was aimed at "escaping" regulations. Houck, who is the supervisor of special and vocational education in Fredericksburg schools, denounced charter schools as a "half-baked . . . quick fix" designed to avoid what he said were the real pro
blems confronting public education -- too little money and too little parental responsibility. <p>	Allen came under heavy fire from the Democrats for his opposition to accepting $1.7 million in federal funds to implement the Clinton administration's controversial Goals 2000 program. This year, the Virginia House and Senate voted, mostly along party lines, to approve nonbinding resolutions in favor of federal funding for Goals 2000. When Republican Senator Mark Earley and others raised questions about the vague language of the federal regulations that would come attached to the money, their concerns were dismissed by the Democrats and the Virginia Education Association (VEA), a teachers union that supports Goals 2000 strongly. Allen -- expressing his concern about the need to retain local control over education in Virginia -- announced that the state would not apply for the Goals 2000 money. <p>	Other Allen proposals killed in the General Assembly included mandatory criminal background checks for new school personnel and protection of teachers from frivolous lawsuits for good-faith efforts to discipline students.<p>	The state's sex-education program, known as Family Life Education (FLE), sparked a bitter political battle. The Allen administration supported a bill that would have made FLE an "opt in" program, in which parents wanting their children to participate had to sign up. At present, the burden is on parents who do not want their children in the program to withdraw them. Because of the bureaucratic nature of the "opt out" process, some parents, who thought their children were not participating in FLE, were surprised to find their youngsters were still taking the course. The bill also would also have made FLE voluntary. Democratic opposition killed the legislation in both the House and the Senate.<p>	Allen won a partial victory on another issue: The State Board of Education voted in June to approve a compromise version of more rigorous academic standards in English, math, science, and social studies. Th
e standards were developed by the Governor's Champion Schools Commission in conjunction with parents and teachers. An earlier Allen proposal was bitterly attacked by Democratic legislators, the VEA and other teachers' groups, and a number of PTAs, who claimed the standards were "too demanding." Among other things, they required fourth-graders to be able to summarize the purpose of the Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution, fifth-graders to trace the historical background of major world religions, eighth-graders to identify members of the Virginia and U.S. Supreme Courts, and 12th-graders to analyze issues involving state, local and federal governments.  <p><b>Welfare</b><p>	At the beginning of this year's session, both the Democrats and the Allen administration introduced their own versions of welfare reform. Led by Senator Joseph Gartlan of Fairfax (the dean of senate liberals), the Democrats sought to cast Allen and his secretary of health and human resources, Kay James, as callously targeting the poor.<p> 	Both the House and the Senate approved weaker Democratic welfare legislation earlier this year on party-line votes. Rather than sign it, however, the governor made major changes in the bill, reflecting the details of his original proposal, and returned the measure to the General Assembly. In the end, the Democrats blinked, making just a few technical amendments to Allen's bill. The final version passed the General Assembly by overwhelming margins -- 90-9 in the House and 33-6 in the Senate -- and was signed into law by Allen. <p> 	Most provisions took effect statewide in July 1995. The plan includes a "family cap" -- denying cash benefits to children born to parents already on welfare -- and contains new rules requiring unwed teenage mothers to live with a parent or adult guardian. Welfare recipients' children will be required to attend school, and mothers on AFDC must assist the state in locating absent fathers.<p>	Tough new work requirements are at the heart of the program. The legislat
ion (which is being phased in over the next four years) requires able-bodied adult recipients to take private-sector or community service jobs within 90 days. It places a two-year limit on benefits for most recipients. To ease the transition from welfare to work, the state will provide medical services, child care, and transportation for those who find jobs.<p>	The welfare reform already seems to be having one of its intended effects: Reducing the number of able-bodied people on welfare. From 1988 to 1993, Virginia's welfare rolls increased by almost a third. By contrast, from May to July of this year, Virginia's AFDC caseload fell from 74,000 to 69,000 families. <p>	"There is a general cultural shift," says Kay James. "People were beginning to understand that change was coming, and they began to change their behavior as a result." James says recipients have been coming into local welfare offices "where the work requirements have not even been phased in, and saying: 'Look, it isn't worth it. I might as well get a job I like, instead of one you say I have to go to.'" She adds that, in meetings with Allen, local welfare administrators have frequently expressed disappointment that their areas were not among the first round of localities chosen by the administration to implement the new requirements.<p>	Despite the bipartisan votes for final passage, James believes the earlier debate over welfare in the General Assembly illustrates differences between the two parties. "In Virginia, you will hear that 'the Democrats wanted AFDC recipients to work,'" she says. "But what do you mean by 'work'? For the Democrats, that meant being involved in job training—it didn't mean real work." In the General Assembly, she says, the Democrats pushed for "hardship exceptions" to the work requirement that were so broad that the great majority of the adult AFDC population would have been exempted. <p>	In the end, James argues, the Democrats concluded that "we were likely to prevail, and they wanted to be on that train when it left 
the station."<p><b>Federal Mandates</b><p>	Another difference between the parties involves the Allen administration's repeated clashes with the Clinton administration over federal mandates. In one case, the EPA threatened to strip Virginia of its authority to grant air pollution permits to incinerators, factories, and power plants. The agency claimed the state was in violation of federal law, because it restricted the right of private environmentalist groups to file lawsuits unless they could prove a state permit would cause them a major financial loss. <p>	Virginia later sued the EPA after the agency threatened to withhold federal highway funds. This time, the EPA refused to approve Virginia's vehicle-emissions testing plan, because the state wanted to permit gas stations to inspect and repair vehicles (Washington insisted that inspections and repairs be done at separate facilities.) <p>	Virginians are no longer willing to be "jerked around like serfs," Allen said in announcing the suit, which contends that the EPA's actions violate the 10th Amendment. This year, Allen vetoed a measure, passed by the legislature, which would have implemented the federal "motor-voter" legislation. Virginia Attorney General James Gilmore filed suit, charging the bill was an unconstitutional, unfunded federal mandate. The Justice Department and the Virginia ACLU countersued, and the case is pending.<p>	The U.S. Department of Education has ruled that Virginia public schools cannot expel or suspend disabled students for any reason without guaranteeing alternative schooling. Virginia officials say that special education students who sell drugs, carry weapons, or fight on campus should be disciplined in the same way as other students -- which may include unconditional expulsion. The education department claims this violates the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and has threatened to withhold $58 million in federal funds unless Virginia agrees to change its disciplinary procedures. <p>	Secretary James fought 
a difficult battle with Donna Shalala, Clinton's health and human services secretary, before winning a federal waiver allowing Virginia's welfare reform program to take effect. Shalala had initially demanded that Virginia directly provide child care and transportation to welfare recipients making the transition to work. Virginia fought successfully to retain the option of having the services provided by churches and other private groups. <p><b>The Moderate Republican Factor</b><p>	Even if Republicans win enough seats to form a majority, it won't necessarily mean smooth sailing for Allen's legislative proposals. Just as in the U.S. Senate, GOP moderates will tend to put up obstacles to conservative proposals. <p>	Since Allen took office last year, Republican lawmakers from Northern Virginia have, on occasion, joined with the Democrats to thwart key administration initiatives. For example, Senator Jane Woods teamed with the Democrats in working to defeat Allen's proposal to reform the FLE program. When Allen's Champion Schools Committee proposed toughened academic standards for social studies, the first draft was blasted as "an unmitigated disaster" by another Republican lawmaker, Delegate James Dillard.<p>	Delegate Vincent Callahan, one of the most senior House Republicans, joined with developer John "Til" Hazel, scores of other prominent businessmen, and Gartlan in a "bipartisan" plan to increase spending on roads, technology, and public education by hundreds of millions of dollars. The group (many of its members are Republicans) wants to pay for the new spending through a combination of new tolls, bonds, and new gas or sales taxes. It has been circulating the proposal to legislative incumbents and challengers in Northern Virginia. The plan is viewed as a slap at Allen, who has refused to consider increasing taxes.<p>	In general, Virginia voters have rarely faced as clear-cut an ideological choice between parties as they do this year. Governor Allen may have lost most of his legislative battles to date. B
ut by defining boldly what he and his party stand for, he has sharpened the issues of the election and given the citizens of the Old Dominion a set of clear choices for the direction of the state.<p>	The consequences will go beyond Virginia. If the GOP does not take a majority in at least one house of the Virginia General Assembly, then it could be premature to say America is entering a period of conservative governance. And if the Democrats lose big, their party will know that the elections of 1994 were not a fluke, and that liberal dominance of American politics may be over. <p><b>JOEL HIMELFARB</B>, <i>a Washington writer, formerly covered Virginia's legislature for the</<a href="/wash_times">i> <b>Washington Times</b> <i>editorial page</i>.

<h3>Which Land trusts Can You Trust? </h3>
<hr size=3 width=50%>
<b>R. Randolph Richardson</b><br>
<b>Policy Review</b><br>
<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</i></center>
<p>
	The public places great faith in national conservation groups to preserve ecologically valuable land. Uncritical news coverage and slick fundraising campaigns have something to do with this. But nature-lovers and property owners should be aware that local community-based land trusts are often better stewards of land and more interested in managing land for the enjoyment of the local populace. Unfortunately, many citizens involved in land preservation are unaware of the distinctions.<p>	I learned this lesson through bitter experience. My dad once owned 74 acres in Westport, Connecticut. In 1970, when he was 84, he asked me to help him decide how to preserve the land for the enjoyment and education of his neighbors. He wanted the Christmas trees he'd planted sold to help pay for planting native hardwood, shrubs, and grasses. He wanted trails with plant life identified and education programs for kids. Eventually he chose the Fairfield Chapter of the Connecticut Audubon Society (not affiliated with National Audubon) to carry out his vision because it agreed to do most of what he thought important.<p>	In l990, 18 years after Dad's death, I discovered Audubon had done nothing it had agreed to. The Christmas trees were 35 feet high and covered with thick bittersweet vines that threaten to kill them. The land was overgrown and untended, and locked gates barred public access. At the Audubon office, I pointed out that densely planted spruce trees provide almost no food and nest sites for birds (except for predatory owls and hawks that eat other birds). The young staffer ignored me and nattered on about a rare hawk seen on the site recently.<p>	Audubon's officials brazenly cited lack of funds for their failure to fulfill the contract. Yet one of the parcels was a Christmas tree farm whose profits were flowing mainly to a former Audubon employee. As far as I could see, not a penny of Audubon's share was being spent to maintain the balance of the 74 acres.<P>Over the years, I've learned that there are large differences between the practices of national landholding trusts like the Nature Conservancy, the Trust for Public Land, and National Audubon Society and those of the local trusts. There are exceptions to my generalizations, and some local and state chapters with famous brand names are not affiliated with their national namesakes, but may operate as most of the nationals do. The national environmental organizations and their affiliates tend to:<p>·	Follow the thinking of John Muir, a talented nature writer and a founder of the Sierra Club. Muir believed wilderness is best left alone because man can only degrade it. The Muir doctrine, however, has no basis in science. The nationals' philosophy of land management amounts to nonmanagement. And this nonmanagement saves millions of dollars that they can devote to fundraising, salaries, perks, etc.; as the inspector general of the Interior Department points out, the nationals are businesses.<ul><p><li>	Limit public access by cutting few trails, allowing ground vegetation to become impenetrable, preserving parcels of land that are bounded entirely by private property, and declaring land off-limits under the Endangered Species Act and other federal legislation.<p><li>Lobby the federal government to manage land their way and to lock away ever more land under the Endangered Species Act, wetlands regulations, and similar laws. Many professional foresters think that such promotion of the Muir philosophy of land management results in more disastrous fires in national parks, like the notorious Yellowstone fire in 1989.<p><li>Engage in the highly profitable business of selling land to the federal government, particularly to various agencies  within the Department of the Interior (see <a href="#sidebar">sidebar</a>).</ul><p>
Local land trusts, with some exceptions, tend to:<p><ul>
<li>Use what science-based management they can afford.<p><li>Allow public access and seek multiple uses for preserved property, including recreation, preservation, education, and in some cases sensible, sustainable logging.<p><li>Seek members among their local communities. </ul><p>
	For those with experience of wildlife and land, the differences in management philosophy are not abstract. A few vignettes illustrate this. I have visited eight sites owned by nationals. Three were within homeowners' associations, forbidding public access. A fourth had soil beloved by dense ground cover, ensuring no sunlight for tree seedlings. The land could remain an impenetrable wilderness for centuries until wildfire cleared the ground. A fifth, 20.3 acres, is prone to saltwater intrusion in hurricanes and off-limits to the public. An expert on the rare orchid growing there suggested that since each plant produces 10,000-plus seeds, real protection of the species lies in trying to grow it elsewhere. Maybe Congress needs to ask that question next time it's lobbied to lock away land for an endangered something.<p>	In northeast Connecticut, by contrast, there's a young local trust busily acquiring land. Each new tract is surveyed by state or private forestry professionals. The resulting plans are masterpieces of knowledgeable, applied ecological sciences. Black birches, a disease-prone species there, are to be killed by girdling their trunks, making room for heartier stock. "Patch cuts" (small areas where trees are cleared for the planting of shrubs and grasses) are made to provide food for small mammals and to protect fledgling birds from hawks. This trust also organizes demonstrations for local landowners of some of the techniques they can apply on their land.<p>	An established trust in northwest Connecticut owns the most beautiful stand of ancient, giant hemlocks in New England. These great-grandfathers are being attacked by the wooly adelgid, an insect native to Asia that betrays its presence only when the needles start to fall off the trees. The president of the trust, a retired engineer who built petroleum plants throughout the world, has raised funds to send a scientist to Japan, where knowledge about the adelgid and its natural predators is well advanced. Many years ago, this trust had a healthy stand of red pine on ten acres. A disease, then untreatable, was devastating red pine throughout the area. The trustees decided to keep the organism from multiplying and attacking red pines elsewhere. So they clear-cut the stand and used the proceeds to improve their properties.<p>	Many things have changed since my father donated his land to the Connecticut Audubon Society. Owners have smartened up and few donors now enter into donation contracts without a strong recission clause. These legal arrangements generally recite the donor's expectations concerning the management of the gifted land: whether to allow the harvesting of mature timber, maintain trails, enforce limitations on public access, and so on.<p>	Landowners are increasingly adept at protecting the environmental integrity of their land, as well as their plans for it, by selling conservation easements to land trusts. Such easements, which last in perpetuity, essentially foreclose any chance that the owners' wishes will not be respected. One can sell an easement, for example, requiring that the land be managed a certain way and cannot be sold for development. There's been an explosion in the variety of easement terms; with patience, a landowner may find an organization that buys easements allowing the harvesting of mature timber or providing expert management for wildlife and plants. If the transfer is to take place after the donor's death, the authority to enforce the recission power is frequently conveyed to a third party known as the enforcer, whose rights, responsibilities, and qualifications can be written into the contract.<p><b>Looking to the Future</b><p>	The last 15 years or so have witnessed an explosion in the number of small, community-based local trusts. According to the Land Trust Alliance, based in Washington, D.C., as of 1994 there were 1,100 land trusts with approximately 900,000 active members. The number of local trusts is now growing at about one per week. They own about 540,000 acres outright, have conveyed nearly 1 million acres to state and municipal parks, and have acquired various kinds of conservation easements on about 2.5 million acres.<p>I would like to imagine a future in which the practices of national landholding organizations converge with those of local trusts for the betterment of citizens and communities. Change is already occurring among the nationals. In most Northeastern and Western states, state and county forestry officials are products of excellent forestry schools. They understand the science-based management of wild land and wildlife. They advise the local trusts and, occasionally, the local affiliates of the nationals.<p>	The 1991 Farm Bill included funding for a "Forestry Stewardship Program" that strengthens the advisory system local trusts and private owners depend on. Here and there, some local affiliates of the nationals are beginning to use science to manage their land. In most areas, relations between the locals and the nationals are cordial and the practices introduced by state and private foresters are being observed by the young idealists who work for national affiliates. In sum, science is once again beginning to overcome what has increasingly seemed a dogma.<p><b>R. RANDOLPH RICHARDSON</B>, <i>now retired, has run several small businesses in the timber, cattle-raising, farming, and fishing industries</i>.<p><a name="sidebar"></a><b>Real Estate for Sale (sidebar)</b><p>	My desire to see local land trusts receive the support they deserve is not limited to my experiences as a landowner and a conservationist. As a taxpayer, I have become concerned about the practice by national land trusts of purchasing ecologically valuable land from private owners for the purpose of reselling it to federal agencies. Taxpayers should hold government accountable for wise use of funds and tax exemptions, especially when the result is often to remove land from public access. Yet the federal government often overpays, to the enrichment of the national trusts involved. According to a 1992 report of the Interior Department's inspector general:<p><ul>
<li>Between 1987 and 1989, the Fish and Wildlife Service paid the Nature Conservancy $13.5 million for 11,502 Texas acres, including $500,000 paid in undocumented fees that boosted the price above market value. The same agency paid the same seller $4.5 million for Oklahoma land appraised at $3.5 million.<p>
<li>In 1987, Fish and Wildlife paid the National Audubon Society $1 million for 777 acres in California appraised at $700,000. The agency reasoned that it had asked Audubon to acquire the land in 1983, when Audubon had to pay $1 million for it.<p>
<li>The Nature Conservancy purchased 3,735 Arkansas acres in 1989. In 1991, Fish and Wildlife bought 1,153 acres of this appraised at $747,000 for $914,000, including interest and overhead charges of $251,000.

<title>M.D. Monopoly -- Fall 95 Policy Review</title>

<h3>How Nurses Can Help Relieve Spiraling Heath-Care Costs</h3>
<hr size=3 width=50%>
<b><a href="http://www.cato.org/main/bandow.html">Doug Bandow</a></b><br>
<b>Policy Review</b><br>
<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</i></center><p>
	Medicare isn't the only part of America's health-care system where costs are spiraling out of control. Doctors have created a cartel by confining the delivery of treatment solely to M.D.s and by regulating the number and activities of M.D.s. This suppresses the supply of health-care professionals, raising costs and reducing choice. State governments could significantly lower both public and private health-care costs by reducing physicians' stranglehold over medical care and moving towards a freer market. For its part, the federal government could, if it is willing to use its vast power under the commerce clause of the Constitution, preempt state rules that hamper the cost-effective delivery of medical services.<p>	The Clinton administration recognized the problem of supply, but sought to remedy it by manipulating federal funding to force more doctors to become general practitioners. Similarly, the Council on Graduate Medical Education has urged educational changes to change the ratio of primary-care physicians to specialists from 30:70 to 50:50 by the year 2040.<p>	The critical question, however, is not what percentage of doctors should provide primary care, but who should be allowed to provide primary care. Doctors are not the only professionals qualified to treat patients, yet most states needlessly restrict the activities of advanced-practice nurses (A.P.N.s) (who include nurse practitioners, nurse-midwives, clinical nurse specialists, and nurse anesthetists), registered nurses (R.N.s), licensed practical nurses (L.P.N.s), physicians assistants (P.A.s), nurse's aides, and similar professionals. Even today, these providers dramatically outnumber doctors—there are 2.2 million R.N.s, three times the number of M.D.s, and nearly 1 million L.P.N.s alone, while the number of A.P.N.s, at well over 100,000, is about half the number of physicians providing primary care. Ellen Sanders, a vice-president of the American Nurses Association, estimates that 300,000 R.N.s could become A.P.N.s with an additional year or tw
o of training.<p>	Although A.P.N.s, R.N.s, and L.P.N.s are capable of handling many simple and routine health care procedures, most states, at the behest of physicians, allow only M.D.s to perform "medical acts." According to Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University of Minnesota, "You have highly trained people doing things that could be done by others." Doctors perform what A.P.N.s could do, A.P.N.s do what registered nurses could handle, and registered nurses handle what nurse's aides could perform. "I can take care of a patient who has broken an arm," complains Maddy Wiley, a nurse practitioner in Washington state, "treat them from top to bottom, but I can't give them an adequate painkiller." Instead, patients can receive such treatment only through the government-created doctors' oligopoly, into which entry is tightly restricted. Observes Michael Tanner of the Cato Institute: "In most states, nurse practitioners cannot treat a patient without direct physician supervision. Chiropractors cannot order blood tests or CAT scans. Nurses, psychologists, pharmacists, and other practitioners cannot prescribe even the most basic medications."<p>	The problem is exacerbated by the nature of the medical marketplace, where the expansion of services is expensive. Much of the necessary capital already exists -- there are, for instance, a lot of unfilled hospital beds. The practice of medicine, however, has become increasingly labor intensive. The National Center for Policy Analysis figures that, because of the high cost of training medical personnel, "moving capital and labor from other sectors requires a price increase for medical services that is six times higher than that needed to expand other goods and services." As a result, the NCPA estimates, 57 cents of every additional dollar in U.S. medical expenditures is eaten away by higher prices rather than added services.<p>	Physicians have shown unyielding resistance to alternative professionals. Medical societies have tried to prev
ent chiropractors, for instance, from gaining privileges at local hospitals. M.D.s have similarly opposed osteopaths and podiatrists. Working through state legislatures, physicians have won statutory protection from competition. Many states ban midwives from handling deliveries. Optometrists are usually barred from such simple acts as prescribing eye drops. Half of the states permit only physicians to perform acupuncture. Overregulation of pharmaceuticals, which prevents patients from self-medicating, also acts as a limit on health-care competition. Allowing over-the-counter sales of penicillin, for instance, could save patients about $1 billion annually.<p>	A recent episode in Georgia illustrates the arbitrariness of most occupational licensure regulations. According to Tanner, state legislation was introduced at the behest of dentists to prevent dental hygienists from cleaning teeth. Then an amendment was added for the ophthalmologists to bar optometrists from performing laser eye surgery. In the end, the bill prohibited anyone but physicians, veterinarians, podiatrists, and dentists from performing any procedure that pierced the skin, effectively outlawing nurses from drawing blood or giving injections. This unintended outcome would have brought most hospitals to a halt, and a court had to block its enforcement. Examples abound of legal restrictions promoted by self-serving professionals and harmful to consumers. In general, professional licensure has reduced the number of potential caregivers, cut the time spent with patients, and raised prices.<p>	The second manifestation of physicians' monopoly power is the anticompetitive restrictions that the profession places upon itself. The doctors' lobby has helped drive proprietary medical schools out of business, reduced the inflow of new M.D.s, and for years prevented advertising and discouraged members of local medical associations from joining prepaid plans. Until the early 1980s, the American Medical Association attempted to restrict walk-in clinics that adv
ertised themselves as providing "emergency" or "urgent" care. Explained John Coury, who was then chairman of the AMA, "Some of these facilities were set up by nonmedical people as money-making propositions" -- as if doctors don't seek to make money. Moreover, federal immigration law and state requirements limit the entry of foreign doctors into the country and often prevent them from finding work. None of these rules has much to do with consumer protection.<p>	Allowing nurses to provide services for which they are qualified would expand people's options, allowing patients to decide on the more cost-effective course of their treatment. Some states have begun to allow greater competition among health-care providers. Mississippi does not regulate the practice of P.A.s. Nearly half the states, including New York, already allow nurse practitioners to write at least some prescriptions, while a handful, such as Oregon and Washington, give A.P.N.s significant autonomy. The Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services is encouraging the training of nurse-midwives.<p>	In this area, at least, the Clinton administration wanted to move in the right direction, pledging to "remove inappropriate barriers to practice." The Clinton proposal would have eliminated state laws that ban A.P.N.s from offering primary care—prenatal services, immunizations, prescription of medication, treatment of common health problems, and management of chronic but standard conditions like asthma -- and to receive insurance reimbursement for such services. Even these modest efforts did not go unchallenged: The California Medical Association attacked the Clintons' proposal as "dangerous to the public's health," and an AMA report argued that expanding the role of nurses would hurt patients, fragment the delivery of care, and even raise costs.<p>	There is, however, no evidence that the public health would be threatened by allowing non-M.D.s to do more. Professionals should be allowed to perform work for which they are well trained -- witho
ut direct supervision by a doctor. At the very least, states should relax restrictions in regions, particularly rural areas, that have difficulty in attracting physicians. In this way, those with few health-care options could choose to seek treatment from professionals with less intensive training. A recent Gallup poll found that 86 percent of Americans would accept a nurse as their primary-care practitioner. Why not give them that option? Says Leah Binder of the National League of Nursing, "Let the 'invisible hand' determine how much it should cost to get a primary-care checkup."<p>	 Physicians assistants, for instance, receive two years of instruction to work directly for doctors and could perform an estimated 80 percent of the primary-care tasks conducted by doctors, such as taking medical histories, performing physical exams, and ordering tests. Similarly, the Office of Technology Assessment figures that nurses with advanced practices could provide 60 to 80 percent of the clinical services now reserved for doctors. Explains Arthur Caplan of the University of Minnesota, nurse practitioners are "an underutilized, untapped resource that could help reduce the cost of health care significantly." Len Nichols, a Wellesley economist, estimates that removing restrictions on A.P.N.s could save between $6.4 billion and $8.8 billion annually. Mary Mundinger, the dean of Columbia University's School of Nursing, contends that nurse practitioners have been providing primary care for decades and no research, even that conducted by doctors, has ever documented any problems.<p>	Lonnie Bristow, the chairman of the AMA, admits as much, but responds that those nurses were working under a doctor's supervision. But that supervision is often quite loose. Nurses regularly perform many simple aspects of primary care far more often than doctors and, as a result, are better qualified to handle them in the future, with or without the supervision of an M.D.<p>	None of the AMA's arguments withstands analysis. For instance, the officia
l AMA report claims that because nurses want to serve all populations and not just "underserved" groups in rural and inner-city areas, "there is virtually no evidence to support" the claim that empowering other medical professionals would improve access to care. But increasing the quantity of primary health-care providers would necessarily make additional medical professionals available to every area. Moreover, poor rural communities would likely be better able to afford the services of A.P.N.s, whose median salary nationwide is $43,600, than a general-practice M.D.s, with a median salary of $119,000. Even if allowing nurses to do more increased competition only in wealthier areas, it would thereby encourage some medical professionals, including doctors, to consider moving to underserved regions where the competition is less intense.<p>	The most compelling argument against relaxing restrictions on nurses is that Americans' health care might somehow suffer. "A nurse with four to six years of education after high school does not have the same training, experience, or knowledge base as a physician who has 11 to 16 years," complains Daniel Johnson, the Speaker of the AMA's House of Delegates. True enough, but so what? No one is suggesting that nurses do anything but the tasks nurses are trained to do. In fact, the OTA study judged A.P.N. care in a dozen medical areas to be better than that of M.D.s.<p>	The problem of occupational licensure is not confined to doctors. The nursing profession behaves the same way when it has a chance. Under severe cost pressures, hospitals have increasingly been relying on L.P.N.s, nurse's aides, and "patient-care assistants." The cost savings can be great: Nurses typically receive two to four times as much training as licensed practical nurses and command salaries 50 percent greater. Yet in many hospitals they still bathe and feed patients. Stanford University Hospital has saved $25 million over the last five years by reducing the share of R.N.s among patient-care employees from 90
 percent to 60 percent. The consulting firm of APM, Inc. claims that, since 1987, it has assisted 80 hospitals in saving some $1 billion. Alas, professional groups like the American Nurses Association have opposed these efforts.<p>	To bring competition to the medical profession, patients should also be allowed greater access to practitioners of unorthodox medicine. In 1990, a tenth of Americans -- primarily well-educated and middle- to upper-income -- went to chiropractors, herbal healers, massage therapists, and the like. Health insurance covered few such treatments. Some of these procedures may seem spurious, but then, practices like acupuncture were once regarded similarly before gaining credibility. The most important principle is to allow patients free choice to determine the medical treatments they wish to receive. This means relaxing legal restrictions on unconventional practitioners and creating a health-insurance system that would allow those inclined toward alternative treatments to acquire policies tailored to their preferences.<p>	Most important, states should address the obstacles to becoming and practicing as an M.D. This nation suffers from an artificial limit on physicians. Observes Andrew Dolan of the University of Washington, the argument that occupational licensing is necessary "to protect patients against shoddy care" is "unproven by almost any standard." Experience suggests that licensure reflects professional rather than consumer interests.<p>	At the least, states should eliminate the most anti-competitive aspects of the licensing framework, particularly barriers to qualifying as doctors and to competition. These include that power of doctors to control entry into their own profession and to restrict competitive practices. As the National Center for Policy Analysis's John Goodman and Gerald Musgrave explain, "Virtually every law designed to restrict the practice of medicine was enacted not on the crest of widespread public demand but because of intense pressure from the political repres
entatives of physicians." Although licensure is defended as necessary to protect patients, local medical societies spent years fighting practices (such as advertising, discounting, and prepaid plans) that served patients' interests, as well as imposing fixed-fee schedules on their members. No existing licensing requirement should escape critical review.<p>	More far-reaching reform proposals include substituting institutional licensure of hospitals and establishing a genuine free market in health care (backed by private certification and testing and continuing malpractice liability). Such approaches seem shocking today only in the context of the vast regulatory structure that has been erected over the years. If we are serious about increasing access to and reducing the expense of medical care, we should give careful consideration to full deregulation. Such steps would do much to achieve the Clinton administration's goal of encouraging more primary-care physicians and more physicians from racial minorities.<p>	The federal government shares some of the blame for clogging the pipeline of medical professionals, because its Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement rules encourage needlessly large and over-trained medical staffs. Medicare, for instance, requires hospitals to use only licensed laboratory and radiological technicians, and engage a registered nurse to provide or supervise the nursing in every department. Only nurse practitioners operating in nursing homes or rural areas can be reimbursed under Medicare. Only 18 states allow Medicaid reimbursement for A.P.N.s. Non-hospital facilities such as community health centers, which play a particularly important role in poor and rural areas, also face tough staffing requirements. These sort of restrictions hamper the shift to less expensive outpatient services. With enough political will, the federal government could play a role in easing state licensure, just as the Federal Trade Commission fought professional strictures against advertising.<p>The collapse of the Cl
inton campaign for radical reform was welcome, but the American medical system still needs fixing. The supply side would be a good place to start. Rising costs require us to look for cost-effective alternative providers. Even more important: Patients should have the largest possible range of options when determining their health care. It's time to integrate the practice of medicine into the market economy. <p><b><a href="http://www.cato.org/main/bandow.html">DOUG BANDOW</a></B> <i>is a senior fellow at the <a href="http://www.cato.org">Cato Institute</a> and the author of</i> <b>The Politics of Envy: Statism as Theology</b>.

<h2>REFORMING AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN EMPLOYMENT: <br>
HOW TO RESTORE THE LAW OF EQUAL TREATMENT</h2>

Nelson Lund is Associate Professor of Law at the George Mason
University School of Law. From 1989 to 1992, Professor Lund served
as Associate Counsel to President George Bush. Before that, he
served as law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
and Attorney-Advisor in the Office of Legal Counsel in the Department
of Justice.
<P>
<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<P>
 In his recent speech on affirmative action programs, President
Clinton strongly reaffirmed the federal government's long-standing,
and thoroughly discredited, approach to this subject. That approach
is easy to sum up: Proclaim a fervid opposition to discrimination,
but practice a policy of discriminatory preferences and favoritism
for selected groups. The euphemisms and Orwellian doublespeak
by now are quite familiar:
<P>
President Clinton's embrace of the discriminatory status quo puts
the burden on Congress to initiate meaningful reform. Such reform
must address three principal areas in which the federal government
practices or fosters discriminatory preferences: contract set-asides,
education, and employment. Congress in all likelihood will consider
the following three options.
<P>
<B>OPTION 1: Put the federal government's own house in order.</B>
This approach, which has been embraced by Senate Majority Leader
Bob Dole (R-KS) and Representative Charles Canady (R-FL), would
dismantle the notorious system of minority and sex-based quotas
for federal contracts and forbid the federal government from discriminating
in hiring and promotions. Federal contract set-asides increase
the cost of government procurement by preventing agencies from
accepting the low bids on many contracts, and they discriminate
against low-bidding firms that are owned by people of the wrong
color or sex. Abolishing this practice would be a significant
step in the right direction by establishing a level playing field
for the more than $161 billion in federal contracts awarded annually. (1) 
Abolishing discriminatory practices in federal hiring and promotions,
moreover, would substitute individual merit for group status and
give equal legal rights to more than 2.8 million federal employees.

<P>
  The limits of this approach, however, are evident from Chart
1, which shows that the federal government employs only 3.1 percent
of the workers now protected by the principal anti-discrimination
statute. Federal contractors, moreover, would still be allowed
to use discriminatory preferences, and Labor Department bureaucrats
could still bring pressure for "better numbers," so
long as they avoided the imposition of formal goals and timetables.
And discriminatory preferences in college admissions would be
virtually untouched. 
<P>
<B> OPTION 2: Outlaw discriminatory preferences imposed not only
by the federal government, but also by federal contractors and
subcontractors, and by state and local level governments and other
recipients of federal grants.</B> Although this is not a complete
solution, it would extend the principle of equal treatment to
an additional 26.5 million employees of firms that do business
with the federal government and the approximately 16 million Americans
who work for state and local governments. (2) And it would cover practically
all colleges and universities. This approach adopts the well-accepted
principle that the federal government should neither engage in
discrimination nor finance discriminatory conduct by others. That
principle has been applied for many years to protect women and
certain minorities from discrimination by those who do business
with the federal government or who accept federal financial assistance.
<P>
 But, again, this approach leaves something to be desired. Under
this approach, it would still be legal to discriminate against
half of those Americans currently covered by the federal civil
rights law.
<P>
<B> OPTION 3: Require equal treatment for 100 percent of the population
that is now covered by federal civil rights law.</B> The most
complete solution is also the simplest. The Civil Rights Act of
1964 clearly forbade employment discrimination against either
sex and against any racial or ethnic group. Although federal agencies
and the courts have refused to implement Congress's straightforward
mandate, the Congress can now insist that its original intent
be honored. This would extend the principle of equal treatment
to the more than 94 million American employees now covered by
the 1964 Act. Similarly, racial discrimination by federal grantees
 -- which includes almost all colleges and universities  --  has
been formally forbidden for thirty years. Congress need only insist
that this law be enforced as written.
<P>
 This study explains in some detail why Congress should opt for
a comprehensive approach to the problem of discriminatory preferences
in employment. After exploring the illegitimate origins of the
current system, it discusses the nature of the current problem
and explains why partial solutions are unsatisfactory. It also
unmasks the myths behind "voluntary" affirmative action
and the "disparate impact" theory of discrimination.
Finally, it offers an outline of the legislation Congress ought
to consider if it wants to restore the ideal of equal treatment
under the law. 
<P>
<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
<P>
 The Congress of the United States has never sanctioned the discriminatory
conduct that now occurs routinely in the American workplace under
the rubric of "affirmative action." To the contrary,
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed discrimination
in employment against any individual "because of such individual's
race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." Senator
Hubert H. Humphrey (D-MN), who was the Democratic floor manager
for the 1964 Act, assured the Senate that "nothing in the
bill would permit any official or court to require any employer
or labor union to give preferential treatment to any minority
group." (3) Even more dramatically, Humphrey challenged one skeptical
colleague by saying:
<P>
<blockquote> If the Senator can find in title VII... any language which provides
that an employer will have to hire on the basis of percentage
or quota related to color... I will start eating the pages one
after another, because it is not in there. (4)</blockquote>
<P>
 Technically, Senator Humphrey was right. But federal judges and
bureaucrats soon proved him wrong by using Title VII to create
the elaborate system of quotas and preferences that we see all
around us today. This transformation was accomplished through
a series of Orwellian distortions of the law, none of which has
ever been ratified by Congress.
<P>
 Congress can solve all the important problems arising from affirmative
action in the workplace by emphatically reaffirming the law it
enacted in 1964. This would have the effect of repealing the complicated
system of racial and sex-based preferences that have proliferated
thanks to rogue judges and regulators. Congress must understand
that these problems cannot be solved simply by getting the federal
government itself out of the business of discrimination. The most
serious effects of the federal government's twisted interpretation
of Title VII are occurring in the private sector and in state
and local government. Unless Congress addresses those effects,
any claim of leadership will ring hollow indeed.
<P>
<h4>UNDERSTANDING AFFIRMATIVE DISCRIMINATION</h4>
<P>
 Group-based employment preferences are incompatible with the
ideal of equal opportunity that every federal employment statute
has claimed to advance. They are also incompatible with the views
of the overwhelming majority of Americans. (5) For the same reasons
that Congress has quietly accepted the insidious spread of such
preferences, however, it will be reluctant to abolish them. Powerful
special interests, ranging from civil rights lobbyists and labor
unions to significant elements of the business world, will ferociously
defend the discriminatory status quo. Legislators who make their
stand on the principles articulated by Hubert Humphrey and Martin
Luther King, Jr., will be accused of racism, insensitivity, and
political expediency. As a consequence, true expediency may tempt
them to soften the rougher edges in the current system through
cosmetic reforms and empty symbolism, leaving the underlying problem
unresolved.
<P>
 One common perception about affirmative action is that it began
as a benign effort to combat discrimination and has evolved gradually
into the current system of quotas and preferences. Affirmative
action, according to this view, simply requires employers to "cast
a wider net" so that members of historically neglected groups
can enjoy the opportunity to compete on an equal footing for jobs
and promotions. While there is some truth in this view, there
also are indications that it was no accident that "affirmative
action" became a device for smuggling legalized preferences
into the fabric of American life.
<P>
 In September 1965, for example, President Lyndon B. Johnson issued
an executive order requiring federal contractors to agree that
they would take "affirmative action to ensure that applicants
are employed, and that employees are treated during employment,
without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin." (6) 
This sounds perfectly innocuous. Only a few months earlier, however,
Johnson had said that "equality of opportunity is essential,
but not enough." What was really required, according to Johnson,
was a transition to "the next and the more profound stage
of the battle for civil rights.... We seek not just legal equity
but human ability, not just equality as a right and a theory but
equality as a fact <I>and equality as a result.</I>" (7) 
<P>
 Whatever the original vision of affirmative action may have been,
it soon became a tool for imposing equality of results rather
than equality of opportunity. While federal law on its face forbids
discrimination against members of any racial group or either sex,
this apparently simple principle has been obscured and twisted
by a complex web of lies, censorship, doublespeak, and code words.
Those whom the law now disfavors can be denied a job or promotion
because of their skin color or their sex without being victims
of "discrimination" in its new legal meaning. This miracle
is accomplished by calling the denial either (a) affirmative action
taken to <I>prevent</I> discrimination; (b) an unfortunate side
effect of an attempt to cure "historic injustices";
(c) a prerequisite to achieving "diversity in the workplace";
or (d) the result of a presumption of "social disadvantage"
for everyone in the preferred racial group. 
<P>
  The dizzying and ever-changing array of intellectual rationales
for discrimination has been accompanied by an elaborate code of
misleading language. Quotas become "measurable goals and
specific timetables." When a job applicant is rejected because
of race, it was not really because of his race: it was just that
the favored person had <I>his</I> race counted as a "plus
factor." Or discrimination isn't really bad unless it is
also "stigmatizing" (an effect that apparently can be
experienced only by certain legally favored groups). All of this
evasive rhetoric has arisen because the underlying practices are
so difficult to defend. And because of that difficulty, they are
rarely defended. Instead, they often are just carried out covertly.
But the discriminatory nature of affirmative action cannot be
concealed entirely. 
<P>
 Example: A 1989 poll of <I>Fortune</I> 500 executives indicated
that only 14 percent of these firms even claimed to eschew discriminatory
preferences in favor of merit-based hiring decisions. A majority
of the firms claimed to employ "affirmative action goals,"
and a full 18 percent acknowledged that they have adopted specific
quotas. (8)
<P>
Example: In 1990, Max Frankel, who was then executive editor of
<I>The New York Times</I>, acknowledged that the standard of excellence
that his organization applied to employees depended upon the individual's
skin color:
<P>
 <blockquote>We've reached a critical mass with women. I know that when a
woman screws up it is not a political act for me to go fire them.
I cannot (easily) say that with some of our blacks. They're still
precious, they're still hothouse in management, and if they are
less than good, I would probably stay my hand at removing them
too quickly. It's still a political act and it would hurt the
organization in a larger sense, so you tolerate a little more
in the short term. (9)</blockquote>
<P>
 
<P>
Example: The state of California enacted a law setting a goal
that "by fiscal year 1992-93, 30 percent of all new hires
in the California Community Colleges as a system will be ethnic
minorities." (10)
<P>
Example: After the <I>Philadelphia Inquirer </I>was criticized
for an editorial advocating that poor black women be encouraged
to use the contraceptive Norplant, the paper's editor announced
a quota of 50 percent minorities and 50 percent women for all
newsroom hires during the succeeding five years. (11)
<P>
Example: The Xerox Corporation has adopted a kind of "hidden
hand" alternative to quotas: Annual bonuses are based in
part on a manager's success in promoting blacks and women. (12)
<P>
Example: The Washington Bureau chief of the <I>Los Angeles Times</I>
has announced that no white males will be hired "until we
[do] more for minorities and women." (13)
<P>
Example: Apparently seeking to increase the "diversity"
of its workforce by hiring more women, the U.S. Forest Service's
Pacific Southwest Region created "upward mobility positions"
limited to "applicants who do not meet the [Office of Personnel
Management] qualifications requirements." A Forest Service
spokesman defended its amazing search for <I>unqualified</I> workers
with the following revealing comment: "On its face, this
seems bizarre. However, the intent  if not the choice of language
 was appropriate to the circumstances.... " (14)
<P>
Example: On January 20, 1995, Oklahoma City decided to withdraw
from the U.S. Department of Justice's Police Hiring Supplement
Grant program, under which it had been authorized to hire 25 officers.
Police Chief Sam Gonzales objected to a Justice Department letter
that demanded an "underutilization analysis" for women
and minorities and an affirmative action plan including specific
steps to achieve "goals" for correcting the underutilization
that the Justice Department <I>assumed must exist</I>. Justice
Department officials also demanded that the city develop a specific
plan for the "equal employment of women and minorities within
the Police Department's sworn personnel." Chief Gonzales
commented: "I believe this particular language to be very
significant in that it states `equal employment' of women and
minorities rather than `equal employment opportunity.'" (15)
<P>
<h4>B>THE ILLEGITIMATE SOURCES OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION</h4>
<P>
 The main goal of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was to dismantle
the Jim Crow system, under which black Americans were pervasively,
overtly, and legally discriminated against in substantial portions
of the nation. The prohibition against employment discrimination
in Title VII of that statute was meant to enhance the economic
well-being of this oppressed minority by requiring employers to
give blacks the same opportunities available to whites. That goal
was achieved: Jim Crow was destroyed, and economic progress among
southern blacks increased dramatically during the decade following
the enactment of Title VII. (16)
<P>
 Although the motivating force for the Civil Rights Act was opposition
to the legalized oppression of Jim Crow, Congress did not stop
there. Following a long American tradition, exemplified by the
Fourteenth Amendment itself, the legislature established universal
legal rights that apply everywhere in the country. Significantly,
Title VII contains no special provisions for blacks, and no special
provisions for the South. The concept of "protected groups"
is alien to the fundamental principles of Title VII, which establishes
individual rights belonging to every employee and applicant for
employment. (17)
<P>
 Although it rested on universal principles, Title VII originally
included exemptions for certain entities, most notably small employers
and government agencies. The original statute also provided exceptions
for certain kinds of traditional practices, such as treating men
and women differently where sex is a "bona fide occupational
qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation"
of a business. (18) Subsequent acts of Congress expanded the reach
of the statute to cover state and federal agencies (19), as well as
some small employers exempted in the original Act and certain
forms of unintentional discrimination. The law has also been amended
to increase the powers of the principal enforcement agency (the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) and to enlarge the monetary
relief that victims can recover from defendants.
<P>
 Not once, however, has Congress created any "affirmative
action" exception to Title VII's prohibition against discrimination. (20)
The exceptions that have arisen are entirely the product of executive
and judicial action.
<P>
<h4>QUOTAS BY EXECUTIVE ORDER</h4>
<P>
Pursuant to executive orders issued by Presidents Kennedy and
Johnson, the Department of Labor undertook the most important
early initiatives promoting illegitimate forms of affirmative
action. These initiatives were not dictated by the executive orders
themselves, which required only that federal contractors "take
affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and
that employees are treated during employment, without regard to
their race, creed, color, or national origin." (21) In light of
the long-standing patterns of racial discrimination that existed
at the time, especially in the South and in certain unionized
industries, this language implied no more than that firms wishing
to do business with the federal government should resist the strong
inertial forces supporting those odious practices. But this unexceptionable
goal was soon left behind.
<P>
 Early in the Nixon Administration, the Labor Department quietly
promulgated an order requiring that "the rate of minority
applicants recruited should approximate or equal the ratio of
minorities to the applicant population in each location." (22) 
After an outcry against this proportional representation scheme,
the order was replaced with a more subtly worded set of rules
that nonetheless had the effect of requiring racial quotas and
preferences. Under the current version of these rules, federal
contractors must establish numerical "goals and timetables"
(one of many popular euphemisms for quotas) whenever minorities
are "underutilized" according to arbitrary standards
that do not measure actual discrimination. (23) Enforced by the Office
of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) in the Labor Department,
these rules give OFCCP the power to issue debarment orders forbidding
federal agencies from doing business with firms that show insufficient
zeal in meeting their quotas. Needless to say, the threat of debarment
has powerful <I>in terrorem</I> effects.
<P>
<h4>JUDICIAL AUTHORIZATION OF QUOTAS</h4>
<P>
Had the federal courts enforced the plain meaning and intent of
Title VII, the arbitrary quota policies promoted by the Nixon
Administration and its successors might have withered on the vine.
In <I>United Steelworkers v. Weber</I> (24), however, the Supreme Court
held that racial quotas are permissible under Title VII. The case
arose when Kaiser Aluminum and the United Steelworkers adopted
a collective bargaining agreement establishing a training program
that would qualify unskilled Kaiser workers for jobs in various
skilled trades. Eligibility for the program was determined by
seniority, but Kaiser succumbed to pressure from the Labor Department
and imposed a 50 percent quota for black applicants. (25) While acknowledging
in his majority opinion that the language of Title VII's prohibition
against discrimination "because of race" plainly forbade
this affirmative action program, Justice Brennan nevertheless
pretended that Congress intended something other than what the
statute says. He was unable, however, to find a single shred of
evidence to support this position. Justice Rehnquist's dissenting
opinion, by way of contrast, assembled a massive array of evidence
conclusively refuting Brennan's audacious misinterpretation.
<P>
 In <I>Johnson v. Transportation Agency</I> (26), the Supreme Court
affirmed and expanded the affirmative action exception to Title
VII. Employers in both the public and the private sectors now
face pressure to grant discriminatory preferences when there is
a "manifest imbalance" of minorities or women in "traditionally
segregated job categories." Despite what one might think
from reading this language, however, affirmative action is not
limited to rectifying segregationist practices by discriminatory
employers. Rather, discrimination is legitimized whenever women
or minorities are "underrepresented" in some job. The
standards for determining "underrepresentation" are
extremely loose, and have been met even when it has been caused
by some vague and unspecified form of "societal discrimination." (27)
<P>
 With perfect circular reasoning, "discrimination" is
presumed to exist when "underrepresentation" in particular
jobs is found.
<P>
<h4>INNOCENT VICTIMS OF QUOTA POLICIES</h4>
<P>
The Supreme Court has also stated that legitimate affirmative
action plans must not "unnecessarily trammel the interests
of the [disfavored] employees." (28) Here again, however, the
Court permits employers to impose explicit racial quotas even
when those quotas offer no relief to victims of proven discrimination. (29)
<P>
 Quotas and preferences, moreover, are legal even when they deny
employment opportunities to individuals who have never benefited
from an employer's prior discrimination.
<P>
 The <I>Weber</I> decision is once again illustrative. The white
plaintiff in that case, an unskilled laborer, had never belonged
to one of the unions whose racist policies had presumably excluded
blacks from the skilled trades. Yet the Court upheld a discriminatory
quota that deprived this plaintiff of an opportunity that would
have been open to him but for the color of his skin. While in
theory there are limits to how far employers can go in trammeling
the interests of people in disfavored groups, (30) in practice, the
Supreme Court has never held that an affirmative action plan violates
Title VII. In fact, the Court has created a legal rule that presumes
the validity of discriminatory affirmative action plans, thus
requiring victims to assume the heavy burden of <I>disproving</I>
the validity of such plans. (31)
<P>
 With the law stacked so heavily against them, victims of affirmative
action policies seldom seek legal redress. The reported decisions
therefore do not present anything like a true picture of the underlying
problem. It is completely absurd to argue, as one Clinton Administration
consultant has contended, that the paucity of reported judicial
decisions means that "the problem of 'reverse discrimination'
is not widespread; and that where it exists, the courts have given
relief." (32) One might as well argue that the paucity of litigation
about employment discrimination in the 1950s meant that discrimination
against blacks was a rarity. (33)
<P>
 Although reported cases are not especially numerous, a few examples
offer some insight into the sort of policies that courts find
acceptable.
<P>
Example: A county agency, which had never discriminated against
women, adopted an affirmative action plan with a "goal"
of 36.4 percent women (corresponding to the proportion of women
in the county's workforce) on highway maintenance crews. Despite
the utterly obvious fact that women are less likely than men to
seek jobs involving heavy physical labor, the Supreme Court labeled
this a "traditionally segregated job category." The
Court approved the county's decision to deny a promotion to a
male applicant in favor of a less qualified woman. (34)
<P>
Example: After receiving the highest score on a competitive examination,
a white firefighter was denied a promotion to engineer in favor
of a black firefighter with a lower score. Without discussing
the percentage of blacks in the fire department or in the engineer
position, and without making any comparisons with the available
labor force, the federal courts discovered a "manifest imbalance"
in a traditionally segregated job category. In upholding the fire
department's racial discrimination, the appellate court commented,
in words that could have been applied as easily to Jim Crow itself,
that the affirmative action plan "minimizes the disruption
of employees' expectations by providing clear guidelines for when
race may be taken into account." (35)
<P>
Example: In approving a plan to increase the number of women in
a university sociology department by discriminating against male
applicants, a federal court held, apparently with a straight face,
that "[w]hen approximately fifty percent of the nation's
population is women and only thirty-four percent of the recipients
of Ph.D.'s in sociology are women, sociology must be considered
to be a traditionally segregated field." (36)
<P>
Example: A county school board approved a policy involving race-based
involuntary transfers of teachers among schools. The courts acknowledged
that the challenged policy "does classify and burden individual
teachers on the basis of race." Although the policy had been
adopted in connection with a desegregation case, there were no
vestiges of discrimination in faculty assignments. The courts
nonetheless upheld the discriminatory policy "because the
goal of providing to schoolchildren a racially diverse learning
environment is clearly a legitimate one under Title VII." (37)
<P>
Example: A court approved a university's decision to raise the
salaries of women faculty members by amounts ranging from 1 percent
to 40 percent. The school's decision was based on a statistical
study showing that women were paid less than "comparable"
men. The comparability study, however, took no account of variables
such as "research productivity and quality, teaching quality
and load, publication quantity and community service" because
such variables generally "are not available and/or not suitable
for statistical analysis compared to the relatively straightforward
coding of other factors such as rank or tenure status." Thus,
nondiscriminatory factors that could obviously create salary disparities
were ignored because the court did not have any numbers handy
with which to measure them. (38)
<P>
<h4>THE SCOPE AND NATURE OF EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION</h4></B>
<P>
 Any honest discussion about the prevalence of employment discrimination
must begin with two propositions. First, no one knows or can know
how much discrimination against any group actually occurs. Second,
no law can eliminate such discrimination completely.
<P>
 There simply have been no reliable studies measuring either how
much discrimination American employers actually engage in or against
whom they discriminate the most. We can be sure of one thing,
however: discrimination against virtually all groups does occur,
and will continue to occur. If the laws against murder, a crime
that is easily detected and severely punished, have never come
close to eliminating it, (39) our anti-discrimination laws will not
eliminate discrimination. Thus, the claim that discriminatory
affirmative action policies must be maintained until we achieve
a "color-blind" society is simply a ruse that will guarantee
eternal life to those policies.
<P>
 Although anti-discrimination laws will never produce a color-blind
society, policymakers can certainly craft a color-blind law. That
is exactly what Congress set out to do when it passed the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, and the legislature was perfectly correct
in expecting that law to reduce the incidence of discrimination.
To the extent that Title VII raises the cost of discriminating
against those protected by the statute, it is simply inevitable
that less discrimination will occur. (40 It emphatically does not
follow, however, that the goal of reducing discrimination against
groups that have historically been the victims of prejudice requires
the use of preferences in their favor.
<P>
 The upside-down notion of using discrimination against some groups
to combat discrimination against other groups begins with the
false premise that any statistical "imbalance" in the
workforce must be the result of discrimination against the underrepresented
group. This premise is not only false; it is preposterous. (41) No
society has ever existed in which human beings sort themselves
into jobs and occupations according to the mathematical laws of
chance:
<P>
<blockquote> The even distribution or proportional representation of groups
in occupations or institutions remains an intellectual construct
defied by reality in society after society. Nor can all this be
attributed to exclusions or discrimination, for often some powerless
or persecuted minorities predominate in prosperous occupations. (42)</blockquote>
<P>
 Attributing every "imbalance" to employer discrimination
assumes away the manifest effects of differences in educational
achievement, family upbringing and cultural traditions, marital
patterns, and even the physical differences between the sexes.
When one begins indulging assumptions like that, one has left
reason behind and entered the realm of mysticism.
<P>
 What discriminatory affirmative action policies certainly can
do is increase the number of minorities and women holding desirable
jobs. That is the basis of their political appeal, just as the
artificial allocation of desirable jobs to whites was a critical
contributor to the political durability of the Jim Crow system.
Reserving certain jobs for certain groups, or giving preferences
to members of those groups, obviously serves the narrow self-interest
of those who enjoy the preferences. These beneficiaries inevitably,
and ironically, are drawn from the most elite and <I>least</I>
disadvantaged segments of the preferred groups. As one shrewd
observer has pointed out, "race-based set-asides have amounted
to no more than a cruel bait-and-switch game in which conditions
of poor Blacks were used to garner preferences that ultimately
benefited upper-income Blacks and White corporations." (43) In
effect, the current preference system creates a labor cartel,
allowing the legally privileged groups to command above-market
wages or (what amounts to the same thing economically) to depress
the demand for their competitors' services. This is wonderful
for the cartel's members, but everyone else pays the price.
<P>
 Apart from the economic inefficiencies imposed on society in
general, the costs of affirmative action are borne largely by
two groups:
<P>
<B> Whites, Men, and Other Unfashionable Groups.</B> The most
obvious victims of legalized discrimination are those individuals,
"predominantly unknown, unaffluent, unorganized," (44) who
are excluded by preferential policies from positions they otherwise
would have obtained. These victims of affirmative action are neither
the CEOs of major corporations nor their highly paid Washington
lobbyists. Nor are they neurotics who deserve to be subjected
to President Clinton's condescending pop psychology. (45) On the contrary,
they are mainly ordinary working people who suffer the same losses
experienced by other victims of discrimination. They are easy
to ignore or make fun of inside the Beltway, but that says more
about the climate in Washington than it does about those who must
live with the decisions that are made there.
<P>
<B> Minority Victims.</B> A less obvious group of victims comprises
those minority individuals and women who would have succeeded
without preferential policies, but whose achievements become clouded
by the suspicion and resentment of others. The fact that resentment
against these individuals is actually unjustified will not prevent
it from occurring. (46)
<P>
<h4>THE OPPOSITION TO REFORM</h4>
<P>
 Perhaps the best evidence that discriminatory preferences are
a serious and widespread phenomenon is the ferocity of the opposition
to abolishing them. (47) For every beneficiary, there is a corresponding
victim. Thus, if the beneficiaries of this discrimination believe
they stand to lose a great deal if it ends, that suggests that
reform of the status quo is an urgent matter. (48) Accordingly, it
is imperative that Congress enact the simple reforms that are
needed to remove the stamp of legal approval from the discrimination
that the law now promotes. But that will not be easy. Besides
the direct beneficiaries of quotas and preferences (including
those who are paid to administer or advocate preferential policies),
politically significant business interests have incentives to
preserve the current legal regime.
<P>
 First, inefficient quota requirements -- whether imposed directly
or indirectly 
<P>
 -- confer advantages on large, established business enterprises
vis-&agrave;-vis their smaller competitors. This effect, which
is a matter of simple economics, is especially powerful when the
regulatory regime involves massive paperwork and reporting requirements
like those imposed by the EEOC and OFCCP.
<P>
 Second, after decades of government pressure to get their numbers
right, a great many large companies have institutionalized affirmative
action as a significant element in their corporate cultures. These
firms thus have large and powerful <I>internal</I> constituencies
for such programs. Those internal constituencies will fight to
protect their interests and will help shape the public posture
of the firm on issues that affect those interests.
<P>
 The incentives that exist for business interests to support the
status quo will not necessarily produce aggressive <I>public</I>
support for policies that favor discrimination. Indeed, business
leaders often adopt an anti-regulatory rhetorical posture even
when they are actively seeking anti-competitive government regulations.
With affirmative action, there are especially strong reasons to
avoid getting caught up directly in the public controversy: For
most big firms, almost any position they adopt on the public policy
question is bound to offend a significant portion of their employees
and customers. (49) But these considerations need not prevent business
interests from taking quiet and indirect steps to protect their
interests. The dubious arguments that support those interests
therefore need to be confronted.
<P>
<h4>THE MYTH OF "VOLUNTARY" AFFIRMATIVE ACTION</h4>
<P>
One of the most enduring myths about affirmative action is that
it reflects voluntary efforts by American employers to comply
with Title VII's spirit of equal opportunity. An especially dangerous
corollary of this myth is that Congress should merely forbid the
federal government from engaging directly in discrimination, leaving
the private sector to continue behaving as it has in the past.
In order to appreciate why both the myth and the corollary are
fallacious, a very rudimentary introduction to the economics of
discrimination will be helpful.
<P>
 There is a respectable, though hardly unimpeachable, economic
argument for repealing the legal constraints on discrimination
by private employers. (50) According to this argument, ordinary market
forces will minimize employer discrimination that is based on
such arbitrary factors as a personal distaste for members of certain
groups. The market, however, would still reward economically efficient
forms of discrimination. This can occur when race or sex is correlated
with desirable characteristics that are costly to identify directly.
Thus, for example, if very few women possess the physical strength
to perform a certain job, it may be cheaper for an employer to
exclude women from consideration than to administer strength tests
to all applicants. Such discrimination, according to the economic
argument, should be tolerated because the efficiencies it creates
benefit <I>all</I> groups over the long run, even if some individuals
are denied jobs for which they are the best qualified. (51)
<P>
 Business interests sometimes use variations on this economic
argument to defend discriminatory affirmative action programs.
They argue, for example, that a diverse workforce is an essential
business imperative because firms need to respond to a racially
and ethnically diverse consumer population. (52) When used to defend
discriminatory policies, these arguments rest on the assumption
that members of certain racial groups are more likely to understand
what consumers in their own group will find appealing, or on the
assumption that customers are more likely to patronize firms that
give a prominent role to employees of their own race. For example:
<P>
<blockquote> Given the national demography and the fact that much of our domestic
business is with city and state governments, walking in with an
all-white male team is a tie-breaker negative, said one chief
executive who was quoted anonymously in the [Glass Ceiling] report.
"If I go to Washington, I need black representatives to interact
with the people who can give me contracts." (53)</blockquote>
<P>
 Assuming that such assumptions are correct, they do not answer
the moral and political question: Should private firms be allowed
to enhance their efficiency by engaging in racial discrimination
or pandering to the racial preferences of their customers? And
even if one believes that private firms should be allowed to do
this for the sake of efficiency, the economic argument cannot
justify forbidding firms to discriminate against some groups but
not others. Efficiency is efficiency, whether it leads firms to
appeal to the preferences of black consumers or white consumers.
Thus, if the economic argument justifies allowing firms to engage
in discriminatory affirmative action, it must also justify allowing
firms to resume old-fashioned patterns of discrimination <I>against</I>
women and minorities.
<P>
 For moral and political reasons, Congress is not likely to give
serious consideration to "deregulating" the market by
repealing Title VII. Some in Congress, however, may be tempted
to believe that leaving private-sector affirmative action programs
alone is an economically benign form of "partial deregulation."
This temptation must be resisted, for the theory on which it rests
is entirely false.
<P>
<h4>INADEQUACY OF LIMITING REFORM TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</B>
</h4>
Some opponents of racial preferences support a legislative strategy
that focuses primarily on the most notorious forms of direct discrimination
by the federal government, such as contract set-asides. There
certainly are plenty of deserving candidates for extinction among
these programs. Most of them, however, should be doomed in any
event by the Supreme Court's recent decision in <I>Adarand Constructors,
Inc. v. Pe&ntilde;a</I> (54), which held that racial classifications
by the federal government are unconstitutional unless they are
narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. Congress
can and should prevent the Clinton Administration from wasting
society's resources by engaging in protracted litigation in defense
of programs that are legally dubious and morally wrong. But genuine
leadership requires more than staying half a step ahead of the
courts. In any case, this alone would barely touch the most significant
problems that federal law has created. To suppose that the federal
government can get its own house in order merely by ceasing to
practice direct discrimination ignores the pervasive effects that
its laws have on the rest of society.
<P>
 First, even from a strictly economic or libertarian perspective,
reforms that are limited to the federal government would be grossly
inadequate. Such reforms would allow discrimination to continue
in important economic sectors that are not subject to the full
discipline of market forces. This includes state and local governments,
as well as firms that are otherwise insulated from competitive
forces, such as those in the nonprofit sector and in some heavily
regulated industries. No "reform" that leaves these
institutions free to discriminate can be defended on the basis
of free-market principles.
<P>
 Second, the federal government does not merely permit private
firms to engage in discriminatory affirmative action. On the contrary,
it actively <I>pressures</I> them to discriminate through compliance
reviews of federal contractors by the Labor Department and through
the litigation policies of the EEOC. Just as the supposedly "voluntary"
racial quotas at issue in <I>Weber</I> actually were adopted in
the face of Labor Department pressure, much of the current culture
of affirmative action has developed in an effort to satisfy the
demand of federal bureaucrats for the "right numbers."
<P>
 Third, and perhaps most important, the current legal doctrines
on affirmative action <I>inherently</I> promote discrimination
by private firms because of the asymmetrical treatment of different
groups. Even if federal agencies were to get completely out of
the business of promoting discrimination, the law itself would
continue to promote discrimination through the incentives it creates
for private employers. Consider the choice confronting an employer
who has two candidates, one minority and one white, for a promotion
to a managerial position. If both candidates possess the minimal
qualifications for the position, the employer faces a substantial
risk of litigation if the white is promoted, even if the white
candidate has better qualifications. If the employer denies the
promotion to the better-qualified white candidate under an affirmative
action plan, however, the risk of liability is near zero. Faced
with these asymmetrical incentives, rational employers inevitably
and systematically will discriminate against legally disfavored
groups, especially whites and men. Allowing this to continue is
not a benign form of "partial deregulation," but a powerful
engine of government-sponsored favoritism. Until these incentives
are removed, market forces will continue to <I>foster</I> discrimination
rather than discourage it.
<P>
<h4>THE EXAGGERATED THREAT OF DISPARATE IMPACT LITIGATION</h4>
<P>
Because the economic, or "free market," rationale for
allowing minority preferences is untenable, business lobbyists
may claim that they must engage in this form of discrimination
in order to protect themselves from litigation based on statistical
underrepresentation. This argument has some merit in theory, but
its practical significance can easily be overstated. To the extent
that the argument is valid, moreover, it suggests the need for
reform of the rules governing statistics-based litigation, <I>not</I>
for the preservation of rules permitting employers to engage in
discriminatory affirmative action. To understand why the threat
of litigation over "bad numbers" is less than pressing,
though still worth solving, a brief discussion of the law's evolution
is required.
<P>
 In a 1971 decision, <I>Griggs v. Duke Power Co.</I> (55), the Supreme
Court accepted the Nixon Administration's contention that employment
criteria that lead to "underrepresentation" of minorities
in a company's workforce can be unlawful even if the employer
has not intentionally discriminated against anyone. This theory,
which goes by the name of "disparate impact analysis,"
had no basis in the law and in fact was incompatible with the
statute. Chief Justice Burger's opinion flouted the text of Title
VII, distorted and misrepresented the legislative history, and
even went so far as to misstate the factual findings of the district
court in the <I>Griggs</I> case itself. (56) Apart from being a legislative
rather than a judicial exercise, the legislative draftsmanship
in the <I>Griggs</I> opinion was utterly incompetent. Burger declared
that statistical disparities could lead to liability, but he offered
no intelligible test either for deciding what statistical comparisons
should be used or for deciding how large the disparities must
be.
<P>
 Burger's opinion also created a legal defense that employers
could use to justify disparities that otherwise would produce
liability, but he offered no fewer than eight different and conflicting
formulations of the standard that such employment criteria must
meet. The hopeless ambiguities and vagueness of <I>Griggs</I>,
and the impossibility of seeking guidance from the statute that
<I>Griggs</I> had recklessly amended, set the Court on a long
and difficult search for a manageable set of legal standards.
During the early years of this process, many lower courts made
it relatively easy for plaintiffs to establish a statistical case
against an employer, and employers often were held to absurdly
high standards of "business necessity" in defending
employment criteria that failed to generate "enough"
minorities and women in certain jobs.
<P>
 Employers that used race-neutral hiring criteria (as Kaiser Aluminum
had been doing before the Labor Department pressured it to adopt
the racial quota that was challenged in <I>Weber</I>) thereby
exposed themselves to liability if such criteria had a disparate
impact on minorities. Unless employers were allowed to get their
numbers "right" by discriminating against whites, they
would be placed in a Catch-22: vulnerable to Labor Department
sanctions and/or lawsuits by minorities if race-neutral criteria
led to disparate effects and liable to whites if they sought to
avoid such suits by instituting preferential policies. By permitting
employers to engage in preferential treatment of minorities, the
Court offered them a comparatively cheap way of escaping this
Catch-22.
<P>
 Employers will oppose any legal regime that forces them to make
decisions that expose them to liability no matter what they do.
They can hardly be blamed for this, and the law certainly should
not create Catch-22s for anyone. In 1989,however, the Supreme
Court articulated standards of proof for disparate impact cases
that were much more favorable to employers than the rules that
had taken root in the lower courts. (57) Under these standards, plaintiffs
were required to show that the employer's conduct actually caused
substantial underrepresentation. The Court also concluded that
defendants could escape liability simply by producing evidence
that their employment criteria were based on legitimate business
reasons. This ruling greatly reduced the threat of disparate impact
liability for all but the most inexplicably arbitrary employment
practices, and thus greatly reduced the pressure on employers
to adopt preferential policies designed to produce statistically
balanced workforces.
<P>
 In the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Congress codified the theory
of disparate impact, thus ratifying a previously illegitimate
doctrine. In doing so, however, the legislation preserved almost
all of the safeguards for employers that the Supreme Court had
established in its 1989 decision. More important, perhaps, the
1991 statute created a new remedial scheme authorizing compensatory
and punitive damages in cases involving intentional discrimination,
but <I>not</I> in cases arising under the disparate impact theory. (58) 
This new rule creates tremendously powerful incentives for plaintiffs
and their attorneys to forego disparate impact litigation in favor
of claims based on the standard theory of intentional discrimination. (59)
<P>
 These incentives, together with the relatively circumscribed
disparate impact standards codified in the 1991 statute, have
caused the virtual disappearance of serious disparate impact litigation. (60) 
For that reason, business interests no longer can legitimately
maintain that the restoration of a color-blind legal rule will
create the Catch-22 described above.
<P>
 Business lobbyists nonetheless might argue that courts and enforcement
agencies may revive disparate impact litigation at some future
time. This possibility cannot be ruled out completely. The most
likely way for this to happen would involve an aggressive disparate
impact campaign by the EEOC and the Justice Department, combined
with judicial misinterpretation of ambiguous language in the 1991
statute. Because EEOC and Justice are public agencies, they are
less subject than the private plaintiffs' bar to the financial
disincentives that the 1991 Act created for disparate impact litigation.
And the courts, as we have seen so often in the past, are perfectly
capable of seizing on any real or imagined ambiguity in the civil
rights statutes when they want to expand the reach of those statutes
beyond what Congress has authorized.
<P>
 This possibility -- that federal agencies and the courts again
will cause disparate impact litigation to become a serious problem
-- does not seem likely to materialize in the foreseeable future.
The EEOC's workload has gone up dramatically in recent years,
largely because of an increase in intentional discrimination claims
under Title VII (especially claims involving sexual harassment)
and under the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990. The agency's
budget, however, has not seen commensurate increases, and the
agency would therefore have difficulty in diverting significant
resources to disparate impact litigation. Similarly, while the
courts certainly have the power to interpret the 1991 statute
in a way that would greatly facilitate abuses of the disparate
impact theory, recent judicial trends do not suggest that this
is likely to happen.
<P>
<h4>RESTORE THE COLOR-BLIND LAW THAT CONGRESS ENACTED</B>
</h4>
Congress is not to blame for the misinterpretations to which Title
VII has been subjected. Writing in 1979, then-Justice Rehnquist
noted: 
<P>
 <blockquote>Were Congress to act today specifically to prohibit the type
of racial discrimination suffered by [the plaintiff in <I>Weber</I>],
it would be hard pressed to draft language better tailored to
the task than that found in [sections 703(a) and (d)] of Title VII.  (61)</blockquote>

<P>
 Rehnquist's comment remains equally valid today, and there is
little reason to tamper with the operative language of the statute.
Rather, what is needed is an amendment requiring the courts and
executive agencies to begin obeying the law that Congress framed
three decades ago.
<P>
 In fact, Congress foresaw in 1964 that its clear language might
be misconstrued and included in the statute a provision specifically
foreclosing any interpretation requiring the correction of statistical
imbalances in an employer's workforce. (62) Had the <I>Weber</I> majority
not been driven by an Orwellian contempt for the meaning of words, (63) 
this precautionary provision would have accomplished its purpose. (64)

<P>
 A more comprehensive and carefully drafted statement of congressional
insistence that Title VII means what it says, however, can now
accomplish what Congress sought to achieve in 1964. While there
can be no absolute assurance against the flouting of legislative
commands, the courts have become less reckless in recent years.
They are unlikely to defy Congress on this issue, and enactment
of legislation embodying the principles summarized below should
assure that the principle of equal opportunity finally is accepted
into the law.
<P>
<B>Legislative Solutions</B>
<P>
 The key provisions of such a legislative approach are as follows:
<P>
Ban quotas and preferences. Congress should forbid courts and
enforcement agencies from interpreting Title VII to authorize,
permit, or encourage the use of quotas or preferences relating
to race or sex. 
<P>
<B>Permit legitimate affirmative action.</B> Congress should state
that employers may adopt <I>legitimate</I> affirmative action
policies that promote equal opportunity without using or encouraging
the use of quotas or preferences. This proviso would allow employers
to ensure that minorities and women are not excluded from employment
opportunities by managers' prejudices, stereotypes, or inappropriate
recruiting habits. (65)
<P>
<B>End backdoor quotas.</B> Employers should be prohibited from
engaging in indirect forms of discrimination through euphemisms
like "diversity," "inclusiveness," or developing
a "multicultural workforce." The existing cast of bureaucrats
and corporate affirmative action officers also should be forbidden
from repackaging the same old surreptitious racial quotas under
some new rubric like "socially disadvantaged background." (66)
<P>
 The promoters of preferences repeatedly have shifted their language
and invented new excuses for continuing the discriminatory policies
of the past. In order to deprive them of the legalistic arguments
at which they have proven so adept, any legislation adopted by
Congress must contain airtight legislative language that closes
the door to the use of new euphemisms and new rationales for discrimination.

<P>
 This, in brief, is the appropriate way to restore the ideal of
equal treatment under the law to which Title VII originally was
dedicated. There is neither any need nor any justification for
compromises, incremental changes, or further temporizing.<p>

the meaning of Section 116, then Section 107(a) can be interpreted
to allow their continuation.  Because the legislative history
of the 1991 Act does not evince an intent to overrule those judicial
precedents, the Supreme Court is unlikely to hold that Section
107(a) outlawed previously permissible affirmative action policies.
 <I>Cf.  Officers for Justice v.  Civil Service Commission</I>,
979 F.2d 721 (9th Cir.  1992), cert.  denied, 113 S.  Ct.  1645
(1993).  By the same token, however, the legislative history of
the 1991 statute does not manifest congressional intent to codify
the judicial decisions that permit discriminatory affirmative
action.  For further detail, see Nelson Lund, "Lawyers and
the Defense of the Presidency," <I>Brigham Young University
Law Review</I>, 1995, pp.  17, 90 n.196.

<li>Federal regulations, for example, require that every "utilization
analysis" consider the minority population of the surrounding
labor area, the size of the minority unemployment force, and the
percentage of the minority workforce compared with the total workforce.
 In addition to such factors, which ignore qualifications entirely,
the regulations also require the consideration of factors that
do not take account of the relative qualifications among individuals,
such as the availability of "promotable and transferable
minorities" within the contractor's organization.  See 41
C.F.R.  602.11(b)(1).  Contractors must take "special corrective
action" when there is an "underutilization" of
minorities, or when other phenomena occur, as when a lower percentage
of minority than nonminority applicants meets the firm's employment
criteria, or minorities meet the firm's promotion criteria at
a lower rate than nonminorities.  <I>Id.</I>  602.23.  These phenomena,
obviously, are not necessarily caused by discrimination, and "special
corrective action" often will entail discrimination against
better qualified individuals.

<li>This applies, obviously, only to the sector of the economy in
which an antidiscrimination law is enforced.  Because Title VII
contains an exemption for firms with fewer than 15 employees,
its actual effect could consist largely in shifting minorities
and women from smaller firms to larger firms.  Such an effect
is magnified when pressure is exerted on larger firms to discriminate
in favor of minorities and women.  There is some empirical evidence
suggesting that exactly this has occurred.  See, <I>e.g.</I>,
Ferrell Bloch, "Affirmative Action Hasn't Helped Blacks,"
<I>The Wall Street Journal</I>, March 1, 1995, p.  A14:  "While
black unemployment rates have remained twice those of whites,
the proportion of blacks working for firms with 100 or more employees
(who must file annual EEO1 reports to the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission), federal contractors (who are subject to Labor Department
affirmative action requirements), and local, state and federal
government has grown dramatically.  For example, in 1966, black
female managers were 40% less likely than white male managers
to work in firms with 100 or more employees.  But by 1980, black
female managers were 50% more likely than their white male counterparts
to work in these larger companies."

<li>See Thomas Sowell, <I>Civil Rights:  Rhetoric or Reality</I> (New
York:  William Morrow, 1984), p.  116:  "There is neither
evidence nor even the pretense of evidence for the proposition
that all groups are prepared to make the same sacrifices to achieve
the same ends, quite aside from any question of equal capability,
natural or acquired.  Yet without that assumption, there is no
reason to expect the even representation which is used as a norm
to measure discrimination."

that "the income gap between different tiers of black income
groups has been steadily growing since the enactment of the first
civil rights legislation.  Between 1970 and 1986, the percentage
of black families with incomes over $50,000 nearly doubled, while
the percentage of black families with incomes under $10,000 rose
from 26.8 to 30.2 of the population."  Robert L.  Woodson,

action supporters must understand that this is 'psychologically,
a difficult time for a lot of white males  the socalled angry
white male.'"

<li>A recent <I>USA Today</I>/CNN/Gallup Poll found that 19 percent
of black women and 28 percent of black men believe that their
colleagues "privately questioned your abilities or qualifications
because of affirmative action."  The same survey found that
32 percent of whites thought that "a racial minority where
you worked got an undeserved job or promotion as a result of affirmative
action programs."  "Affirmative Action:  The Public
Reaction," <I>USA Today</I>, March 24, 1995, p.  3A.

<li>The mere possibility of a voter initiative to curtail affirmative
action in California has generated threats of an economic boycott
against that state.  And those threats apparently are meant to
have a wider effect:  "This [boycott threat] is also directed
at two Washington players:  Congress and the White House,"
said one civil rights leader, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
 "Both have to be reminded that there is going to be a major
effort to bring political costs into this debate and balance the
scales of consideration.  Right now the debate is tilted in favor
of accommodating the political views of white males."  Steven
A.  Holmes, "Government Acts to Set its Policy on Race Programs,"
<I>The New York Times</I>, June 24, 1995, p.  1.  The Clinton
Administration obviously will not challenge the civil rights establishment.
 Unfortunately, the urge to temporize in the face of intimidating
tactics undoubtedly remains strong even among conservatives. 
One prominent Republican, for example, recently made the amazing
pronouncement that "we as a party need to work hard to earn
the right to deal with this issue and to deal with it in a sensitive
way."  See Nancy E.  Roman, "GOP Panel To Go Slow on
Affirmative Action:  Leaders Don't Want to Alienate Blacks,"
<I>The Washington Times</I>, June 7, 1995, p.  A12.  Because it
is obvious that no one has to "earn" the right to do
the right thing, statements like this inevitably give off an aroma
of cynical political calculation.

<li>On the other hand, if the beneficiaries (and thus the victims)
of preferential policies are actually the rare exception in the
American workplace, what harm could there be in restoring the
law of equal treatment?

<li><I>Cf., e.g.</I>, Judith H.  Dobrzynski, "Some Action, Little
Talk," <I>The New York Times</I>, April 20, 1995, p.  D1:
 "[W]hile many of the more than two dozen company and industry
association executives contacted spoke privately about affirmative
action, almost none would comment for the record."

<li>This argument is developed at length in Richard A.  Epstein, <I>Forbidden
Grounds:  The Case Against Employment Discrimination Laws</I>
(Cambridge, Mass.:  Harvard University Press, 1992).

<li>In addition, there are substantial costs involved in administering
and enforcing the antidiscrimination laws.  If those costs were
eliminated, some of the savings would be used to increase wages
and/or create more jobs.

<li>See, <I>e.g.</I>, Jonathan Kaufman, "Management:  How Workplaces
May Look Without Affirmative Action," <I>The Wall Street
Journal</I>, March 20, 1995, p.  B1:  "Eastman Kodak Co.
 maintains it is committed to diversity because the composition
of the American work force is changing and so is its customer
base. ' If affirmative action wasn't legislated, we'd still continue
with our goal of building a diverse work force,' says Patricia
Fleming, Kodak's director of affirmative action.  Kodak won't
specify how many women or blacks it has in top positions, but
it recently tied a portion of management compensation to recruitment
and promotion of minorities and women."

New York Times</I>, March 17, 1995, p.  A14.

Review</I> (forthcoming).

<li><I>Wards Cove Packing Co.  v.  Atonio</I>, 490 U.S.  642 (1989).

<li>In a disparate impact case, remedies are confined largely to injunctive
relief, limited back pay, and attorney's fees.  These limitations
applied to all Title VII cases prior to 1991.  The new statute
caps compensatory and punitive damages for intentional discrimination
at different levels according to the size of the defendant.  For
the large firms that offer the most attractive targets for disparate
impact and class action lawsuits, the cap is set at $300,000 per
claim.

<li>For further detail, see Glen D.  Nager and Julia M.  Broas, "Enforcement
Issues:  A Practical Overview," <I>Louisiana Law Review</I>,
Vol.  54 (1994), pp.  1473, 14821483.

<li>I have been able to find only one reported case in which a private
firm was held liable under the disparate impact provisions of
the 1991 Act.  In <I>Bradley v.  Pizzaco of Nebraska, Inc.</I>,
7 F.3d 795 (8th Cir.  1993), the court forbade a pizza chain's
relatively trivial practice of requiring employees to be cleanshaven.
 This case almost certainly will not become an important precedent,
for the court's reasoning was extremely poor.  The Eight Circuit's
opinion, for example, did not even discuss the operative provision
of the statute, and it actually misquoted the provision on which
it purported to rely.  In <I>EEOC v.  Joint Apprenticeship Committee</I>,
828 F.  Supp.  264 (S.D.  N.Y.  1993), the court used a disparate
impact theory to invalidate a high school education  requirement
for admission into an apprenticeship program.  This case was tried
well before the 1991 Act came into effect, and its significance
is reduced by the fact that the defendant chose for tactical reasons
at trial only to challenge the government's <I>prima facie</I>
case without offering a "business justification" defense.

<li><I>Weber</I>, 443 U.S.  at 226 (dissenting opinion).  See also
<I>Johnson</I>, 480 U.S.  at 657 (Scalia, J., dissenting).

<li>Section 703(j) provides:  "Nothing contained in [Title
VII] shall be interpreted to require any employer...  subject
to this [title] to grant preferential treatment to any individual
or to any group because of the race, color, religion, sex, or
national origin of such individual or group on account of an imbalance
which may exist with respect to the total number or percentage
of persons of any race, color, religion, sex, or national origin
employed by any employer...  in comparison with the total number
or percentage of persons of such race, color, religion, sex, or
national origin in any community, State, section, or other area,
or in the available work force in any community, State, section,
or other area."  42 U.S.C.  2000e2(j).

<li>For a discussion comparing the <I>Weber</I> majority's behavior
to that of the nightmare government in Orwell's <I>1984</I>, see
Justice Rehnquist's <I>Weber</I> dissent.  443 U.S.  at 219221.

<li>The <I>Weber</I> majority inferred from 703(j)'s ban on interpretations
<I>requiring</I> employers to grant preferential treatment that
Congress meant to allow interpretations <I>permitting</I> employers
to grant preferential treatment.  This negative inference is absurd.
 There are an infinite number of possible misinterpretations of
any statutory language, and 703(j) could not possibly list them
all.  The fact that it rules out one misinterpretation, therefore,
does not imply that it means to allow any others.  By contrast,
a valid negative inference can arise when a statute creates express
exceptions to an otherwise general rule.  Absent contrary evidence,
the creation of such express exceptions implies that similar exceptions
are not intended because it shows that the legislature considered
and rejected the need for exceptions other than the ones it expressly
included.  Title VII includes an express exception for preferential
policies, which is carefully limited to certain circumstances
involving Indians living on or near reservations.  See 703(i),
42 U.S.C.  2000e2(i).  This exception clearly implies that other
forms of preferential affirmative action are forbidden.

<li>The legislation should leave untouched the existing law regarding
employers' use of classifications based on sex, religion, or national
origin where such characteristics are a "bona fide occupational
qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of
that particular business or enterprise."  703(e), 42 U.S.C.
 2000e2(e).  This exception to Title VII's prohibition against
discrimination has been construed more narrowly than Congress
had reason to anticipate in 1964, but the issues raised by these
narrowing constructions are separate from the issues raised by
affirmative action.

<li>For concise critiques (from different points on the political
spectrum) of the notion of giving preferences to the "socially
disadvantaged," see James P.  Scanlan, "No Substitute
for The Real Thing," <I>Legal Times</I>, May 1, 1995, p.
 29; Abigail Thernstrom, "A Class Backwards Idea:  Why Affirmative
Action for the Needy Won't Work," <I>The Washington Post</I>,

 A Solution," <I>The New Republic</I>, May 8, 1995, pp.

<p>

   The issue is often raised, particularly in presidential election years, whether or not America needs a third party.  More specifically, for the past few presidential election cycles, voters have not been completely satisfied with the nominees from both major parties and they pine for a third option.  This year is no different.
<p>
   A recent poll conducted by the Gordon S. Black Corporation revealed that 46 percent of voters are angry at both parties and 47 percent said a new party is needed.  However, the percentage of those who are angry with both parties is down 10 points from four years ago.
   Voters have a virtual panoply of third-party options.  Besides the somewhat familiar Libertarian Party, Green Party and Ross Perot's Reform Party, there are the lesser known Natural Law Party, Patriot Party, Democratic Socialists of America, Communist Party, Independence Party, Socialist Party and D.C. Statehood Party, to name a few.
<p>
   Nevertheless, the existence of so many parties with relatively small constituencies and narrow agendas poses an obstacle for the creation of a competitive third party.  The 22 percent core supporters of a new party are too diverse in their beliefs and issue positions to coalesce within a single party effectively.
<p>
   No better evidence of this exists than the hodgepodge of attendees at the United We Stand America convention in Dallas last year, which I attended.  This was the much-publicized conference to which Perot invited all of the contending GOP candidates, including Sen. Bob Dole and Patrick J. Buchanan, as well as a representative of the Clinton administration.  The lack of a resounding theme, other than anger with Democrats and Republicans, was instructive.
<p>   
Those attending ranged from opponents of NAFTA and GATT, to strict constitutionalists, to gun owner enthusiasts, to conspiracy theorists, to balanced budget advocates, to critics of the Council on Foreign Relations, to pro-lifers and pro-choicers, to even a fair sprinkling of what could accurately be described as kooks.  No common thread recurred during my conversations with conference attendees, except disillusionment with the two major parties.
<p>
   Perot's Reform Party appears to have the most momentum for now.  As this edition went to press, it had met ballot access requirements in New Mexico, bringing to 12 the number of states where the party has qualified to appear on the 1996 ballot.  The other states are California, Maine, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia and Minnesota.
<p>   
Petition drives are under way in 25 other states and organizers are confident the party will be on the ballot in all 50 states.  The party is in court in Arkansas, in a suit to get on that state's ballot.  Ballot access is being achieved either by placing the actual party on the ballot or through a stand-in candidate who, in most cases, will presumably be Ross Perot.
<p>
   Perhaps the threat of a viable third party will persuade the Democrats and/or Republicans to more directly address voters' concerns with substantive proposals, rather than campaign using attack ads, sound bites, wedge issues and symbolic gestures.  The quality of the campaigns waged during the coming months, or the lack thereof, should be a good indicator.

<TITLE><HEAD>National Minority Politics - From the Publisher - May 1996</title>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<h2>From the Publisher</h2><p><h3>MAY 1996</h3><p><img src="red-line.gif"><p>	
<P>

The cover of this May 1996 edition features portraits 
of six individuals who represent the spectrum of 
present-day conservatism.  (Two of the gentlemen, Sen. 
Robert Dole (R-Kans.) and retired general Colin Powell, 
are often described as political moderates, but they 
both have support from a significant portion of the 
self-identified conservative populace.)<P>
Among those portrayed, syndicated columnist and two-
time presidential candidate Patrick Buchanan and former 
ambassador Alan Keyes are furthest to the right of the 
political spectrum.  Buchanan, who has emphasized the 
controversial issues of abortion, immigration, 
affirmative action and the exportation of American jobs, 
calls his a "conservatism of the heart."<P>  
Keyes waged his presidential campaign this year on 
the primary issue of returning America to its moral 
foundation, beginning with the restoration of the two-
parent, marriage-based family.  For Keyes, the most 
crucial aspect of this moral revival starts with 
outlawing legalized abortions, which he says is the 
single most important issue in relationship to 
everything else.<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, with his championing of 
the GOP "Contract With America," has advanced an agenda 
which combines fiscal and social conservatism.  
Unfortunately, after several months of relentless 
pummeling by the media, as well as a few public missteps 
of his own, Gingrich has the highest negative ratings of 
any political figure today.  The existence of these high 
negatives, in effect, precludes his ability to carry the 
conservative banner to the American electorate.<P>
Former Congressman and HUD Secretary Jack Kemp 
focuses most of his attention on the fiscal and economic 
issues of restructuring the tax system by creating a 
flat tax, cutting taxes and expanding the economy.  He 
has also concentrated much of his energy on swelling the 
ranks of the Republican Party by including more minority 
and low-income voters.  However, he has had limited 
results, though not from a lack of effort.  In fact, 
Kemp has been criticized in some quarters for even 
making an attempt to bring non-traditional voters into 
the GOP's "big tent".<P>
Dole and Powell, who are perhaps the least 
conservative of the bunch, nonetheless enjoy broad 
support among many conservatives who believe that in 
order to maintain a Republican legislative majority in 
both houses of Congress and expand majority status to 
the state and local levels, effective outreach to 
moderates and independents is essential.  Both have been 
chided by some of their fellow Republicans for not being 
conservative enough on social issues.<P>
As is the case with most political movements, 
conservatism is largely defined by its messengers.  When 
a greater proportion of these messengers are described 
as "extreme," then, by extension, conservatism itself is 
believed to be extreme as well.<P>
Much of this definition process takes place through 
the mass media.  For example, conservatives are often 
referred to disparagingly by journalists as members of 
the "far right," the "religious right" or the "extreme 
right."  Yet liberals are almost never referred to by 
the press as the "far left."  These negative 
descriptions of conservatives are planted in the minds 
of the American public to the point where they as 
presumed to be true, whether they are factual or not.<P>
Conservatives would do well to get a handle on how 
they are defined, if they hope to expand their ranks 
beyond their base of committed activists.

<TITLE><HEAD>National Minority Politics - From the Publisher - April 1996</title></HEAD>
<BODY>
<h2>From the Publisher</h2><p><h3>APRIL 1996</h3><p><img src="red-line.gif"><p>	
<P>
     Our April cover visually describes the Democrats' current operating philosophy.  For the past few election cycles, voters have been pulling Democrats in the direction of limited and more efficient government which is less intrusive and less costly.  Yet, Democrats resist, opting instead for the status quo.  Present the Democrats with a problem and they will, always, present a federal government program as the solution.<p>
     A recent case in point is President Clinton's handling of the issue of domestic abuse, with his unveiling of a national 1-800 "hotline" for abuse victims.<p>
     On its face, a national domestic abuse hotline sounds like a good idea.  The thought that some poor woman is being physically abused on a regular basis by her spouse or boyfriend is frightening to women from all sectors of society.  Donna Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, applauded the President's effort.  "[B]ecause of this president's leadership every woman in this country will have a toll-free and anonymous lifeline to safety, whenever or wherever she needs it," she said.<p>
     Sounds good so far.  But that, among other things, is exactly what is wrong with most federal social programs.  They appeal to our emotions, rather than our logic.<p>
     In this case, logic would dictate that a centralized government program administered from Washington to assist domestic abuse victims is inefficient at best, when local programs can operate more quickly and effectively, and at a lower cost.  After all, what good would it do for a woman who is being abused to call a bureaucrat hundreds or thousands of miles away in Washington?<p>
     In addition, this program exacerbates the time-honored tradition of politicians nudging citizens to look to Washington for solutions, rather than find them in their own communities.  Rather than promoting community-based problem solving, this hotline promotes Washington-based problem solving, adding to our already massive national deficit.<p>
     In fact, this hotline program could actually be dangerous.  A woman who is experiencing an abusive situation could waste precious time calling our nation's capitol, when she should be calling 911 in her local area where help is only minutes away.<p>
     And at a cost of $1 million, this hotline hardly comes cheap.  But, from all accounts, media were so busy "cheerleading" the president for his sensitivity, that they forgot to ask about whether or not the program would actually benefits those for whom it was designed.  Members of Congress were silent as well.  And who ends up holding the bag for media's and politicians' failure to do their jobs?  All of us do, as American taxpayers.<p>
     Programs like this hotline can be a ready-made source of data on social problems.  This information can then be used to justify increased funding or to dramatize an issue.  In five or 10 years, when the program's budget has multipled 10-fold and Congress examines whether the growth in spending should be cut to help the government live within its means, constituents can then point to the numbers of calls received via the hotline and declare, "If you cut this program, 10,000 women will die every year as a result of domestic violence."<p>
     Of course, they have no hard evidence to support their declaration, other than the fact that they have, by virtue of starting the hotline, funneled calls into a central location.  But these battle cries are enough to make all but the most vigilent of Congressmembers back down.<p>
     It is up to each of us, as taxpayers, to keep a watchful eye on politicians' attempts to buy our votes in the future.  Unless we refuse to keep falling for the scam repeated by our elected officials every election year, our federal deficit and national debt will only continue to spiral out of control. <p>

<h2>From the Publisher</h2><p>
<h3>January 1996</h3>
<p><img src="red-line.gif"><p>      
<P>

<P>
When Republicans won control of
both houses of Congress in 1994, a significant portion of the
electorate had high hopes that, for the first time in several
decades, some fiscal restraint would be instituted by our elected
officials on Capitol Hill. Two years earlier, Ross Perot had put
the concept of a balanced budget on the table. The idea of leaving
our children and grandchildren saddled with debt that we created
was unthinkable. Now, voters thought in November 1994, we have
a new crop of leaders who will straighten things out.
<P>
At this point in the budget debate,
however, I believe it is fair to say that the Republicans have
lost the high ground. Rather than being perceived as the champions
of responsible government, many voters view the GOP and its legions
as pawns of the rich--willing to cut government programs for the
poor while leaving the programs that benefit the well-to-do largely
intact.
<P>
The Democrats have so successfully
demagogued the issue of balancing the federal budget that, any
time the Republicans propose reducing the rate of growth in programs,
a collective chorus of Democrats labels them &quot;extremists&quot;
who want to starve children and throw the elderly out into the
streets. The Democrats have simply been better at casting the
argument in human terms, making the Republicans look like cold-hearted
numbers crunchers.
<P>
Witness President Clinton's handling
of the budget negotiations. When he vetoed one of the Republican
budget proposals, the President was surrounded by young children,
as he vowed that he would not let the GOP harm those youngsters.
Granted, the children all appeared to be well-dressed and well-fed,
exactly the kind of children least likely to need government assistance.
But a picture is worth a thousand words.
<P>
Utilizing constituents as props
is one of the Democrats' best tactics. And Republicans have either
been caught off guard or simply have not mastered the fine art
of relating to the average taxpayer.
<P>
A case in point is a CNN town
hall meeting in December in which House Majority Whip Tom DeLay
participated. In my personal dealings with DeLay, I have always
found him to be a responsive, compassionate officeholder. But
he could have shown more sensitivity in his handling of the questions
asked at the meeting.
<P>
A gentleman in the audience asked
the Texas congressman, &quot;Since government employees are missing
portions of their paychecks during the Christmas season, why doesn't
the Congress forego getting paid until it resolves the budget
mess?&quot;
<P>
DeLay's response: &quot;I'm not
a government employee; I'm a 'constitutional officer.'&quot;
<P>
The audience was stunned. While
DeLay relied on the specifics of the Constitution to defend his
receiving his salary during the government shutdown, he failed
to make another constitutional observation. The Founding Fathers
never intended for our elected representatives' salaries to be
so much greater than the typical American family. 
<P>
Senators and representatives earn
$133,600 per year, nearly four times the $35,800 the average American
family earns. Their high incomes make them so far removed from
the daily lives of their constituents that they cannot relate
to their problems. Democrats compensate for this income disparity
by tauting their credentials as champions of the poor, but Republicans
don't have a shield to defend them against critics' charges that
they are arrogant and greedy.
<P>
Perhaps Republican activist William
Bennett best summed up the party's dilemma: &quot;What's come
across quite clearly is that we Republicans are smart and serious
and that we are going to shrink the government. What hasn't come
across is a lot of compassion.&quot;

<P>
On its face, the concept of children's rights appears to be worthwhile.
After all, none of us want to see children abused by adults--be
they parents, guardians or others were are biologically unrelated,
but who wield dominance and power based on their size and experience.
<P>
However, some child-welfare advocates, usually liberal in their
political persuasion, have taken things too far. The policies
of well-meaning liberals have already resulted in the virtual
destruction of poor families and the weakening of middle-class
families by making the role of the male-husband and father-dispensable.
They are now on the road to dealing the final blow by separating
children from the one remaining parent--the mother.
<P>
Just listen to the rhetoric of so called children's advocates
like Marian Wright Edelman of the Children's Defense Fund. In
her speeches, Edelman, a close friend of first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton, cites numerous statistics on the numbers and conditions
of poor children.
<P>
But Edelman and others like her, while perhaps well intentioned,
fail to recognize that children have no income-earning ability.
They are the responsibility of their parents, not wards of the
state. There is no substitute for loving, responsible parents,
who discipline their children-no matter what their incomes.
<P>
Government interference with child-rearing has already weakened
parental authority. Parents report instances of their children
calling (or threatening to call) Children's Protective Services--not
because of child abuse, but because of disciplinary measures they
don't like.
<P>
Children also threaten to file lawsuits when they are unhappy
with curfews and limitations on activities. Mothers raising teen-age
children alone often have difficulty maintaining control when
the government is always in the background, thwarting their control
in their own homes.
<P>
And, as we've seen in several cases over the past few years, children
are now given power within our court system to divorce their parents.
Our government has given our children, who are in our care as
ordained by God, the wherewithal to usurp our authority.
<P>
Added to this, most state governments have completely removed
teachers' authority to utilize discipline in the classroom. Unlike
classrooms of 20 to 30 years ago, students are now aware that
teachers' and principals' hands are tied by the state when it
comes to applying punishment for deeds done in school. With this
knowledge, students threaten and, in many cases, inflict bodily
harm upon teachers. This is indeed a sad state of affairs.
<P>
The primary problem we face with youth today is that many parents
no longer take an active role in child-rearing and depend on others--schools,
churches and the government-to do it for them.
<P>
Liberals have found no solution to child poverty with their theories;
but they will create a whole different set of problems if they
continue to focus on government programs rather than strengthening
the family and home environment.

<h2>From the Publisher</h2><p>

<h3>OCTOBER 1995</h3>
<p>
<img src="red-line.gif">
<p>
	Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas may be one of the most maligned political figures today.  Besides being castigated for his court opinions, Thomas has had to endure attacks on his racial loyalty.
	<P>At the NAACP annual convention in Minneapolis this summer, Thomas' name was raised at virtually every session.  He was called a traitor to his community, a "pimp," and "Clarence 'I don't want to be black' Thomas."  In her opening speech, the group's chair, Myrlie Evers-Williams, read a long sarcastic poem in his honor:<P>
<blockquote>"How did his mind get so twisted<br>
And who does he think he is. . .<br>
And how can he imagine he is able<br>
To be anything but black?"<P></blockquote><P>

	In the June 26 edition of <I>Time</i> magazine, columnist Jack E. White, who is black, described Thomas as "the scariest of all the hobgoblins" in Washington, D.C.  "The most disturbing thing about Thomas is not his conclusions, but his twisted reasoning and bilious rage," continued White, as if he knows Thomas personally.<P>
	On Sept. 12, the infamous New York preacher, Rev. Al Sharpton, led a band of 600 people in a protest near the associate justice's Northern Virginia home.<P>
	Thomas was not home during Sharpton's 90-minute prayer meeting and rally.  "We are his people and we have the right to come see what we have done for him, even if he wants to act like he has forgotten," said Sharpton.<P>
	He pointed to Thomas' opinions in cases that overhauled federal affirmative action programs, voting rights and a school desegregation plan, calling Thomas an "Uncle Tom" and comparing him to the apostle Thomas, who demanded to see the marks of Jesus' crucifixion.<P>
	But Sharpton, a flamboyant publicity seeker, has it wrong.  He wants to claim Thomas' success for himself while, at the same time, bring him down to his level.  I think not.
	<P>Whether or not one agrees with Thomas' Supreme Court decisions, it is clear that he is being judged by a harsher standard than any other justice sitting on the high court.  Thomas is expected to make rulings which are in line with the civil rights establishment's agenda, even though he disagrees with their approach.  Having actually read Thomas opinions, I've concluded that he would like to bring an end to the racial categorization we have instituted for the last 30 years and bring us all into one tent of Americans--before it's too late.
	<P>Thomas may be ahead of his time.  His vision for black Americans may be one which will be reached in the next millennium, but certainly not with the help of the black elite.  In their view, blacks will remain perpetual victims.  They will never be able to compete on a level playing field, as long as they are outnumbered by white Americans.  
	<P>This distorted view not only gives no hope to today's young people, but is utterly false.  Over and over again, blacks have demonstrated that they can compete in all aspects of American life.  Thomas just doesn't want blacks to be automatically assumed to be inferior, and he rejects the notion that, in all things intellectual and economic, black Americans are simply outgunned at every turn.
	<P>I join Thomas in rejecting that notion.  And I will keep him in my prayers, as he may be paving the way for a brighter American future.

<b>VOL. 7, NO. 9 SEPTEMBER 1995</b><br>

Hollywood and television are permeated with class, racial, gender, religious and other biases.  The more
time people spend watching television and movies, the more their impressions of the world seem to resemble
those of the self-created world of the media.<p>

     Stereotyping of blacks in the media is fairly well-known, although still influential in shaping images. 
Blacks are usually portrayed in films as either crooks, pimps, informers or persons needing assistance from the
government.  Television is not much better.<p>  

     In fact, in a book by Michael Parenti titled Make-Believe Media, the author describes black shows as
being slanted "toward the ridiculous with no redeeming counter-images."<p>

     And there are subtle alterations in these images.  As Parenti notes, when blacks are portrayed as
criminals, they often have leading roles.  When portrayed as police, they are more often in subsidiary roles.  "For
a while," writes Parenti of films in the 1980s, "no African-American male could survive to the end of a film."<p>

     While the stereotyping of blacks in Hollywood is rather obvious, the stereotyping of families and
Christians is not as easy to detect, but is harmful nonetheless.  Television programming and movies in the 1950s,
1960s and even 1970s more often included a nuclear family with father, mother and children fully aware of their
respective roles.  Adultery was depicted at a minimum and, usually, the guilty party suffered the consequences of
his or her actions.<p>

     Now it seems that the nuclear family is the exception, rather than the rule, in Hollywood.  I personally
have not watched sitcoms and the bulk of prime-time television in nearly 20 years, because I find it too shallow
for my taste.<p>

     But I have it on good authority that prime-time television today, with its loveless sex and misplaced
values, have had a deleterious effect on our culture.  Programs like ABC's "Roseanne" flaunt time-honored
values by putting a positive spin on homosexuality, premarital sex, illegitimacy, parental disrespect and anti-Christian bigotry.  Another ABC show, "My So-Called Life," focuses on life through the eyes of a 15-year-old
girl with a bisexual pal.  FOX programs "Married With Children" and "Martin" are risque with steamy sexually
themed storylines.<p>

     Daytime television is even worse as the programming line-up consists primarily of soap-operas with
virtually no happily married couples and sexual promiscuity run amok, along with sleazy talk shows which leave
nothing to privacy.<P>

     And media attack anyone who objects to the values--or lack thereof--they promote to our children as
right-wing, extreme, mean-spirited or dangerous.  Remember Dan Quayle?<P>

     Those of us who care about media stereotyping need to let our voices be heard.  Selective buying
campaigns and boycotting advertisers are one way to get Hollywood's attention.  But we need to take it a step
further.  We must develop our own media and promote positive images of ourselves.  Only then can we bring
some balance to the myriad of Hollywood stereotypes affecting us all.<p>

<h2>From the Publisher</h2>

<b>VOL. 7, NO. 8 AUGUST 1995</b>
<img src="red-line.gif">
<p>
<p>
<p>

Over the past two decades, numerous research projects have been conducted concerning the plight of the cities. A myriad of magazine articles, newspaper editorials and television programs have been produced. Countless books on inner cities, edge cities and outer cities (suburbs) have been written also. In fact, public hand-wringing by social scientists and policy analysts about the crises in our urban areas has almost become a national pastime.<p>

Most of what has been written seems to be fairly clear about the problems of the cities, but few, if any, analyses appear to have ideas about solving cities' problems, especially without government programs.<p>

Much of the discourse about the pathologies which exist disproportionately in our major cities--be they unemployment, drug abuse, crime, teen pregnancy, illegitimacy, family breakdown, welfare dependence, poor education, etc. -- flows from the premise that, whatever the problem, there is a government program that can solve it.<p>

Elected officials at the municipal, county, state and national levels have submitted innumerable funding proposals for social welfare, housing, transportation, education, job training, drug treatment and small business projects, believing that money alone can solve the problem. But few have turned to what we call community-based problem solving.<p>

Community-based problem solving is one of the primary tenets of our magazine's political philosophy. We promote the ideal that, rather than look to the federal government to solve local problems, such as crime and education, we can and should develop solutions in our local communities.<p>

Let me explain how this works. First, residents in a community begin meeting with their neighbors to discuss specific problems. They form several groups to examine different aspects of the problem, then group leaders meet and develop a plan. Their planning development may include meeting with leaders from other nearby communities to exchange ideas and see how resources can be shared.<p>

The leaders then begin marshaling the resources to implement their plan, all at the local level. These resources may come from local businesses or the residents themselves. Government involvement should be a last resort, but can be sought if necessary.<p>

Community-based problem solving is bottom up, instead of top down. It operates at the grass roots level and uses a minimum amount of resources because there are no layers of bureaucracy.<p>

Once citizens start operating at the community level, they'll begin asking themselves why they need a big, expensive, intrusive, overbearing federal government in the first place. This is part of the devolution process we're seeing in Washington with the 104th Congress, although it is meeting great resistance from those who don't have faith in citizens to solve their own problems.<p>

When we solve our problems on a local level, then we can truly reduce the size of the bloated federal government. Wouldn't it be nice to stop sending so much of our money to Washington to Support distant bureaucrats who are eager to micro manage our lives? Would it be great to have a smaller federal government in exchange for lower taxes, less regulations and more responsibility at the local level? I think so, what about you?<p>
<p>

<p>
<p>
The Alan Keyes story is one which deserves a closer look.  At the beginning of the campaign season, most political analysts said Keyes would have little, if any, impact on the republican presidential nomination.  But they may be wrong.<p>

Keyes is the most credible candidate in the GOP field on the pro-family issues.  In private conversations with Christian conservatives, both black and white,the Keyes candidacy is resonating.<p>

When we attend GOP seminars and confrences, many people approach us and say positive things about the former ambassador's message and the intensity of his delivery.  his appeal is his passion for the issues -- particularly the issue of abortion.  Keyes has likened abortion to the moral dilemma faced by Republicans in the mid-1800's regarding the issue of slavery.  For Keyes, the two issues are morally equivalent.<p>

In fact, many Republicans, without prompting, tell us they believe Keyes is the only candidate who deserves their vote.<p>

But Keyes does not have the family issues all to himself.  Senate Majority Leader and presidential candidate Bob Dole struck a chord in recent weeks when he attacked Time Warner, Inc. for the violence, filth and foolishness the corporation promotes through movies and music.<p>

Dole, who is perceived as a Johnny-come-lately to this issue, has nonetheless gotten a lot of ink and air time with his attacks on Hollywood, including front-page stories in <i>The New York Times, Washington Post</i> and other major media.  Television coverage of Dole lambasting Hollywood has been prolific as well, with all major networks running stories.  Even <i>Time</i> magazine, which Time-Warner owns, did a cover story on the controversy.<p>

Although Keyes has not specifically addressed the issue of cultural images perpeuated through the media, he has been the strongest voice concerning getting the nation back on a moral course.  The question Keyes campaign operatives must be asking themselves is "How can we get this initiative back from Dole?"  The media have decided to cover Dole's approach to this issue, rather than Keyes' approach to this issue, even though Keyes was out front on the moral issues from the start.<p>

It's part of the media's tendency to declare someone a front-runner and, as a result of the declaration, give that person the majority of the media coverage.  Thus, the media's prediction becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.  In this era when the majority of voters receive their information on political candidates through the media in general, and via television in particular, how can a candidate break out of the pack if he or she receives no media coverage?<p>

Can Alan Keyes win?  Only those faithful to his campaign believe he has a chance of winning the nomination.  The two-time U.S. Senate candidate will have a tough time getting back on track, particularly if he cannot get back momentum from this major issue.<p>

But Keyes has one clar advantage and that is his oratorical skills.  Frankly, he is the best speaker in the entire pack of GOP presidential hopefuls.  Given the opportunity, he can outshine all the other candidates on the stump.  Winning the nomination may be a long shot, but he'll go far in winning the hearts and minds of conservative activists who dominate the Republican primary process.<p>

<p>
When we look at the educational mess in which we find ourselves, it can clearly be traced back to the interference of politicians and liberal social theorists. For the past 30 years, these pols and academicians have focused more on racial integration, multicultural diversity, and boosting self-esteem than they have on improving academic performance in our nation's public schools. As a result, academic standards, test scores and achievement ale lower and per-pupil costs have skyrocketed.<p>

Much of the focus on the failures of public education have concentrated on inner-city schools. But suburban schools have most of the same problems, although perhaps not quite as visible to the public eye. The one advantage suburban schools have ova those in urban areas is parental involvement. Because most suburban children come from two-parent families, at least one parent is available to participate in school activities, help with homework and consult with teachers and principals.<p>

It would seem that if more parental involvement is good for students, the public school system would welcome innovative ideas which would increase parental control and choice. However, the system has self-preservation as its primary objective, rather than educating students. That's the reason for all the hand-wringing whenever options like home schooling, charter schools and school choice are proposed.<p>

Teachers' unions and organized groups, like the National Education Association, spend millions to lobby (read arm-twist) state legislatures to maintain the status quo. Some even label efforts to change the way we educate our students as racist. In the state of Texas, for example, one of our state representatives said on the floor of the legislature that home-rule will resegregate the state's school system.<p>

Has he been to a Texas public school lately (or to any other school in the U.S., for that matter)? They're already re-segregated.<p>

My first concern, as is the concern of the overwhelming majority of American parents, is not who their child sits beside in the classroom, but whether or not their child is learning basic skills to be successful in adult life.<p>

My second concern is that all students be ready to take advantage of the new opportunities a good education will provide, as we prepare to compete internationally with compares in Europe and the Pacific Rim.<p>

Some wonder why Asian students (both in America and in Asia) tend to perform m better on standardized tests than do Americans. Could it be that Asian parents exercise more control over their children's academic performance, and place more significance on education?<p>

We Americans tend to place a great deal of emphasis on sport perhaps much more than is warranted All we have to do is observe the interest in this month's National Basketball Association playoffs. There are basketball courts in nearly every residential neighborhood and most evenings, when the weather cooperates, we see young men "hooping" on the courts. I wonder if they spend the same amount of time studying as they do sharpening their dunking skills?<p>

I encourage parents to instill in their children the idea that one can be a good athlete <b><i>and</i></b> a superior student.<p>

<b>DOES AMERICA NEED A THIRD PARTY?</b><br>
   Support for a new, or third, political party is at an all-time high.  In the 1930s, support ranged from 13 to 14 percent of the populace; in the 1990s, between 55 to 65 percent back the notion of a third party, and 38 to 45 percent of voters are independent, not wedded to either major party, according to a recent poll conducted by the Gordon S. Black Corporation (GSBC).
<p>
   The polling firm's explanation for the increase in the market size of potential third party voters is that the major parties have moved progressively to the political left and right, thus leaving a vacuum for the concerns of moderate voters in the political center.  Politics, as does nature, abhors a vacuum.
<p>   
Still, the GSBC survey reveals even more fascinating findings.  A majority of voters (59 percent) say the current incumbents will never reform the political system; an overwhelming majority (79 percent) say special interest groups have more influence than voters; 74 percent say Congress is largely owned by special interest groups; and 44 percent say if Democrats and Republicans continue to run things, we will never get real reform.
<p>
   Perhaps even more telling, 61 percent of voters say they would vote for the candidates of a centrist reform party as opposed to Republicans and Democrats.
<p>   
But America still has a long way to go before it has a viable third party from which candidates are elected at all levels of government.  And the reasons are numerous.
<p>   
First, most voters are in the habit of voting for either Democrats or Republicans and these voting habits, or patterns, will not be easily changed.  The strongest possibility lies with younger Americans, who also are much less likely to vote than are their parents and grandparents.
<p>
   Second is the issue of credibility.  Because third parties and their candidates are considered to have little, if any, chance for victory, voters believe they may be wasting their votes if they cast it for these candidates.
   <p>
The concept of the wasted vote was expressed repeatedly by media during the 1992 presidential campaign when Perot ran as an independent candidate.
<p>
   Noted journalist Sam Donaldson's comments on ABC's "This Week With David Brinkley," Oct. 25, 1992, provides a glaring example of the media's standard position concerning the Perot campaign.
<p>   
"Well, let me tell you something about this election," said Donaldson.  "Some people say,  Vote for who you like best, even though they don't have a chance to win.'  I think that's wrong.  I think life is full of tough choices that are always--often second and third choices because the first choice doesn't make any sense."
<p>   
Later during that same broadcast, Donaldson added, "You can vote for a loser if you want to.  Now, you know--but if you want to have an impact on the election, there is a choice between Clinton and Bush."
<p>
   The idea of a vote for Perot being a wasted vote was repeated so much by the media that the Texas businessman felt compelled to address the issue in the presidential debates and in his 30-minute infomercials.
<p>
   This brings us to the third reason why it will be quite a while before third party candidates actually have a credible shot at political races.  Media generally dismiss them as "not viable" and provide them with little or no media exposure.  Thus, voters are not familiar enough with third-party challengers to make an informed decision one way or the other.  Their only option is to pick from among the tried and true--Democrats or Republicans.
<p>
   Fourth, and perhaps most important, is the issue of money, which has been described as the mother's milk of politics.  Currently, our political system is skewed in favor of the two major parties in terms of financial resources candidates and the two parties receive from the Federal treasury.
<p>
   The Federal Election Commission will give $12 million to each of the two major political parties for their 1996 presidential nominating conventions.  In addition, both the Clinton and Dole campaigns have received in excess of $12 million each in Federal matching funds during this election cycle.  The only third party presidential candidate who has received matching funds thus far is John Hagelin, nominee for the Natural Law Party, who has received $246,961.
<p>
   This edition of Headway includes commentaries by three individuals active in the political arena.  Reginald Jones, a New Jersey political commentator and part-time radio talk show host, says he's a conservative Republican who has been disillusioned by some of the GOP's political shortcomings.  Jones, however, believes the answer is to improve the two parties, not build a third one.
<p>
   Richard Toliver, who has written a number of commentaries for Headway in the past, is former southwest regional director for United We Stand America.  Toliver has some words of wisdom for the Reform Party, summarizing his comments by writing, "The Reform Party must be able to relate to those who are still denied an opportunity to achieve the American dream."
<p>
   Finally, Harry Browne is a presidential candidate running under the banner of the Libertarian Party.  He makes the case for why voters should take a look at his party and chose him as their alternative to the Democrat and Republican standard bearers.

<h3>May 1996</h3><p>
<img src="red-line.gif">
<P>
There are probably as many definitions for the term “conservative” as there are faces on the cover of this edition of Headway.<P>
Webster’s defines 'conservative' as "disposed to preserve existing conditions, institutions, etc., and to agree with gradual rather than abrupt change."  But, the term is also defined as "a member of a conservative political party," which, in the U.S., is the Republican Party.  And leaders of today’s GOP tend to be more interested in instituting sweeping, rather than incremental changes in the way government works.<P>
New York Times columnist William Safire, in his New Political Dictionary, says a conservative is a "defender of the status quo," a definition which is also inaccurate in the current political environment.  In fact, the Democrats are bigger defenders of the status quo than are the Republicans.<P>
Edwin J. Feulner, president of the conservative policy organization, The Heritage Foundation, describes conservatism as an intellectual movement which, over a 30-year period, blossomed into a political movement.  "Conservatism’s next step--the one we’re in the midst of right now--is as a governing movement," said Feulner in his seventh annual essay on "The State of Conservatism," delivered on April 11.<P>
And that may be conservatives’ biggest problem: As they attempt to govern, they come under relentless assaults on their motives, character and intentions by media and the opposing party, so much so that they are more easily defined by others, than by themselves.<P>
Thus, the ugly definitions of “conservative” abound and the term becomes synonymous with derogatory expressions such as bigot, racist, mean-spirited, extreme and radical; individuals who want to give tax cuts to the rich and cut free lunch programs for the poor.<P>
Feulner has one explanation for why these loathsome terms may be resonating in some sectors of the electorate.<P>
"Perhaps the [conservative] message became too unfocused and thus susceptible to redefinition by the special interests and the media," he says.  "Those are understandable, forgivable mistakes.  I say, learn and move on."<P>
Maybe.  But moving on will not be a simple task as long as there is confusion about what exactly constitutes modern-day conservatism.<P>
Most mainstream conservatives today would say they believe more in the genuine power of the individual than they do in the misplaced and often intrusive power of the government.  They also believe government should live within its means; that there should be a safety net for the poor and disadvantaged, but not one that leads to dependency; that the free enterprise system is the best way to ensure long-term opportunity for all; and that America should maintain a strong defense to ensure peace and freedom within its borders.<P>
But there are extreme elements which have latched onto the conservative movement which do it more harm than good, because these segments tend to overshadow the positive aspects of conservatism.  What are some of these extreme elements?  David Duke is a good example.  Duke, who is a former Ku Klux Klan member in Louisiana and two-time gubernatorial candidate, hides behind conservatism to disguise his genuine racism toward blacks and others he considers to be unworthy of equal protection under the laws.<P>
Then there are militia groups, like the Freemen of Montana, who claim to be constitutionalists and use (or misuse) portions of the constitution when it is convenient.  But they selectively ignore American laws and believe they can declare an area within America’s borders as a separate country, simply because they say so.<P>
There are others who claim to advocate a color-blind society and equality of opportunity, yet they only protest discrimination when it occurs against white males, not against blacks, women or members of minority groups.<P>
When these extreme, and usually hypocritical elements abound within the conservative movement, there is no doubt that they will become larger than life and overpower the pro-America message that is conservatism’s foundation.<P>
This edition of Headway includes commentaries by three activists within the conservative movement who provide their own definitions of conservatism.  Robert Woodson, president of the Washington, D.C.-based National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, got involved in the conservative movement in the early 1970s, in part because he was disillusioned with liberals.  Woodson says conservatives have lost the battle of public perception, and provides his view on how this can be changed.<P>
Georgene Brazer, who is active in Republican political circles in the state of New Jersey, says true conservatism lies in the political center.  Brazer sees Ronald Reagan’s conservative vision as the embodiment of what is best about this contemporary movement.<P>
Clarence Carter, a former operative for the Republican National Committee, believes conservatism will labor under offensive definitions by others as long as it appears to be an exclusive, rather than inclusive, political force.  He recommends "diversifying the face of conservatism."

<h2>Editor's Roundup</h2><P>
<h3>April 1996</h3><p>
<img src="red-line.gif">
<P>


     It is a widely held conception that our two-party political system, with its attendant peaceful transfer of executive power, makes it one of the world's most stable and reliable.  Yet, with this stability, a significant portion of the American electorate has become restless, feeling that neither major party is filling the bill.  <p>
     In our February edition, we examined the Republican Party's apparent lack of balance in advocating getting the federal budget's house in order with an equal compassion for the less fortunate.  In this edition, we examine the Democrats' resistance to changing the way the federal government works, and a myopic view that all problems can be solved by simply implementing new government programs or instituting more expansive government regulations.<p>
     A classic example of the Democrats' proclivity for the status quo is contained in a Feb. 27 speech delivered by House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt to the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington, D.C.  The theme of the Missouri Congressman's remarks was job and wage insecurity, in particular, and the American economy in general.  Gephardt stayed true to form regarding the Democrats' world view and political approach.<p>
     First, the Democrats' strategy is to frighten the American public or capitalize on already existing fears.  In Gephardt's speech he described the "endangered middle class," implying that our nation's huge middle class is on the verge of extinction.  He also said "an estimated 1,200 Americans los(e) their jobs every single day," implying that they remain perpetually unemployed thereafter.<p>
     Yet, Clinton and Democrats have recently taken credit for millions of new jobs created since Clinton took office and a falling unemployment rate.  In other words, they are trying to have it both ways. 
     Second, while frightening the American public, Democrats identify the culprits causing such public angst as either Republican policies, "the rich," or "deep cuts" in programs which, in most cases, are not cuts at all, but simply decreases in the rate of growth.<p>
They then convince the American public that Democrats, through government programs and policies, can, in Gephardt's words, "guarantee a good life."  Based on Biblical teachings, even God does not guarantee us a good life.  But somehow Democrats want us to believe that they can. 
     <p>The President made a similar assessment in a Mar. 17 speech before the United Jewish Appeal, in which he said the government should "guarantee the American dream to everyone who wants it."  
   <p>  Democrats just don't understand that a guarantee and a dream are, by definition, mutually exclusive.  Also, dreams are individual, so how can the government guarantee each individual the dream he or she desires?
     <p>Another characteristic of the Democratic approach is that it operates under a false premise.  In the party's scenarios, business owners are always evil and workers are always virtuous.  Having served in both capacities for nearly equal amounts of time, I can honestly say this is completely inaccurate.
     <p>There are business owners who bend over backwards to protect their employees jobs and wages, and there are workers who are downright lazy and incompetent.  But the Democrats' scenarios never allow for the broad spectrum represented on both sides of the worker/management divide.
     <p>In his speech, Gephardt concluded that our political system is unresponsive, leading people to turn away from politics altogether.  But, truthfully, our political system and our politicians over promise and, when they don't deliver, people, in turn, become cynical.  The House Minority Leader is himself, perhaps unwittingly, an example of the very thing that is wrong with the system.  According to him and his fellow Democrats, the solution is always more government, but they consistently ignore the costs and impact of their proposals.
     <p>The principle that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction, seems to completely escape the realm of the Democrats' understanding.  It appears that they think their policies are enforced in a vacuum; that there is no resultant impact on corporate behavior, worker behavior or consumer behavior.  Either they are naive or ignorant, neither of which is a desirable trait.
     <p>For example, one of the proposals Gephardt advances as a solution to worker insecurity is to bar the federal government from offering contracts to companies that do not offer basic health and pension benefits to workers.  This sounds good, but it will have at least two immediate impacts.
    <p> One is to increase the dollar amount of all federal government contracts, since corporations which have generous benefits packages also charge higher prices for their services or products.  Another impact is that is will eliminate most small businesses from doing business with the federal government, since they generally cannot afford to provide health and pension benefits until they increase in size, revenues and profits.
    <p> In this edition of Headway, three contributors critique the Democratic Party.  All three have been Democrats themselves at one time or another, but two left the party within the last several years precisely because of its seemingly congenital attachment to government solutions.  The other calls himself a "lifelong, yellow dog Democrat," who is proud of the programs Democrats developed in the past and seems to be hopeful that the American public will turn to them in the future if times get tough.

National Minority Politics - Editor's Roundup - October 1995</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Editor's Roundup</h2><P>
<h3>October 1995</h3><p>
<img src="red-line.gif">
<P>

	In former Sen. John Danforth's (R-Mo.) book, <i>Resurrection: The Confirmation of Clarence Thomas</i>, the author explains how the youngest justice on the U.S. Supreme Court was able to get through the grueling final days before the Senate voted to confirm his nomination.  Danforth writes that Thomas collapsed emotionally under the onslaught.  "[Thomas] felt quite certain that no job, even one on the Supreme Court, was worth the feelings of annihilation he was experiencing," writes the retired senator.
<P>
	Danforth watched, counseled and consoled Thomas as he slowly and dramatically made his way back from the depths of utter hopelessness and self-doubt.  In the book, Danforth describes an unforgettable scene, in his office, in which the two couples, the Danforths and the Thomases, held hands and prayed for God's strength for Thomas, who had no strength of his own left.
	<P>
There is no doubt in my mind that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has had to call upon that same divine strength on numerous occasions since his Supreme Court confirmation in 1991.  Since then, at least two unflattering books have been written about Thomas and the sexual harassment charges brought by Anita Hill, both by journalists.  <P>

	<i>Capitol Games</i>, written in 1992 by Timothy Phelps, the <I>Newsday</I> reporter who broke the Hill allegations, and Helen Winternitz, supposedly presents a behind-the-scenes investigative report, but their view is obviously slanted in Hill's favor.  According to the authors, they document how Thomas "positioned himself as a black conservative in Washington," and "how the radical Right backed his cause."<P>

	The other tome, <I>Strange Justice: The Selling of Clarence Thomas</i>, was written by Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson, a <i>Wall Street Journal</i> reporter.  The book cleverly attempts to paint Thomas as having an obsession with pornography and, by extension, being more likely to sexually harass his female employees. <P>
 
	But, interestingly, the writers only interview women who corroborate their assertion and do not interview the dozens of women who disagree; in other words, journalism with an agenda.  And Mayer and Abramson make the incongruous claim that "while the Republican senators defended Thomas, the Democrats were impartial factfinders, not Hill advocates."  It's no small wonder that Thomas declines all media interviews.<P>

	Besides being disparaged by book writers, Thomas has been harshly criticized and caricatured by leaders of the civil rights establishment.  Although many of them are men of the cloth, they appear to have little Christian charity for the associate justice.<P>
	Dr. Joseph Lowery, in his president's address to the 1995 convention of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, described the Supreme Court as having "three white males, one white female, and a whatchamacallit." <P>
 	On Sept. 12, political gadfly Rev. Al Sharpton and a few dozen ministers joined other protesters and picketed near Clarence Thomas' home.  Sharpton claimed this demonstration was in response to Thomas' Supreme Court decisions on affirmative action and majority-minority congressional districts. <P>

	The New York preacher appears to blame Thomas solely for the high court's opinions.  If Sharpton was consistent, which he generally is not, he would have picketed at the homes of all the Supreme Court justices who sided with the majority in those cases.  But Sharpton's objective was not consistency, but to question Thomas' "blackness."<P>
	Rep. J. C. Watts, a freshman Congressman from Oklahoma, says Thomas will likely have to labor under a double standard for years to come.  "I don't think Clarence Thomas will ever be treated fairly or will be judged by a level standard," Watts said in an August interview.<P>
	"There is a different standard that Clarence Thomas and most black conservatives will have to live by," Watts added.  "But I think it is very important that we continue to tout our message, because there are many people in the minority community who agree with us."<P>

	Three of those who agree, and also know Thomas personally, are included in this month's edition of <I>National Minority Politics</i>.  Armstrong Williams, who has known the associate justice for more than a decade and worked with Thomas at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as his confidential assistant, details an exclusive conversation he had with Thomas after the recent court session ended.<P>

	John N. Doggett III has been a friend to Thomas for nearly 25 years.  The two were law students together at Yale University in the early 1970s.  Doggett, a Texas lawyer and business owner, testified on Thomas' behalf at the confirmation hearings.<P>

	Brian W. Jones, president of the Washington, D.C.-based think tank, the Center for New Black Leadership, met Thomas in the early 1990s.  "My first encounter with Thomas came during my senior year in college," writes Jones, who is in his late 20s.  Thomas had just been appointed to the U.S. Circuit Court by President Bush.<P>
	These three columns are some of the most revealing ever written about Thomas and his approach to the law, from people who know his personally, rather than from armchair psychiatrists who are ideologically opposed to the Supreme Court justice.<P>

<h3>HOLLYWOOD STEREOTYPES</h3>
<p>
<img src="red-line.gif"><p>

     Hollywood--through both movies and television--does a good job of typecasting many entities and groups
throughout American society.  But three of the most egregious examples of Hollywood stereotyping involve its
images of blacks, families and Christians.<p>

     For blacks, the typecasting is especially deplorable.  In fact, because the stereotyping for blacks has gone
unchecked for so many years, many people mistakenly believe these images represent reality.  In movies and on
television, the images for blacks are extremely limited.  In films, black males are cast as either criminals, gangsters,
drug dealers or pimps, and females are usually the girlfriends of these male deviants.  The notable exception to this
pattern in films today is actor Denzel Washington, who is described in this edition of National Minority Politics by
writer Stanley Crouch as a modern-day Sidney Poitier.<P>

     Television for black images is hardly better, as Americans see blacks largely in comedic roles--sitcoms.  In
other words, seen through Hollywood's myopic prism, blacks are viewed in two theatrical extremes: comedies and
tragedies.  The depth and breadth of everyday drama, in which most blacks lead ordinary lives, is nearly nonexistent
in Hollywood productions. <P>

     Images of the American family are slightly better, but still outside the norm.  Motion pictures focus
relentlessly on family dysfunction and divorce, while television programs broadcast the virulent message that kids
know better than their old-fashioned and irrelevant parents.  In addition, commercial television regularly and
powerfully encourages casual sex, espousing the underlying message that sensuality is most satisfying when it is
shared outside of marriage, and that long-term relationships only serve to lessen the pleasure of the partners.<P>
     An analysis of television programming by S. Robert Lichter, Linda Lichter and Stanley Rothman reveals
that in addition to a spectacular increase in the amount of erotic activity in prime time, the context in which that
behavior occurs has shifted dramatically.  Prior to 1969, their tracking studies turned up references to sex outside of
marriage in only one out of every thirty shows on television's nightly lineup.  More recently, extramarital
experiences appeared in one show in six, and they report that the ratio "continues to narrow."<P>

     Another key element in the entertainment industry's attack on the family involves its relentlessly negative
portrayal of marital relationships.  In Hollywood's view of the world, marriage is an institution that is outmoded,
oppressive and frequently dangerous. <P>

     But no notion has been more aggressively and ubiquitously promoted in films, popular music and
television than the idea that children know best--that parents are unscrupulous, phony idiots who must learn decency
and integrity from their enlightened offspring.  Witness the animated FOX network program "The Simpsons," in
which the children wrestle with contemporary problems while getting sincere but useless, perhaps even detrimental,
advice from their parents.<P>

     Then there's Hollywood's abysmal treatment of people holding spiritual or religious beliefs.  A 1994
Harris poll showed almost all Americans believe in God (95 percent) and in heaven (90 percent).  Approximately
four out of five adults (79 percent) describe themselves as Christians.  More surprising than the total numbers
perhaps are the numbers of people who say they are not Christians who believe in some uniquely Christian beliefs.<P>

     Yet, we wouldn't know it from what we see in movies and on television.  Maybe this is due to the dearth of
religious conviction or affiliation among those who produce and create programming.<P>
  
     A 1983 Public Opinion survey of 104 of the most influential leaders of television's creative community
showed a full 45 percent who claim no religious affiliation whatsoever and an astounding 93 percent who say they
seldom or never attend religious services.<P>

     In an October 1991 interview with a Catholic newspaper in New York, veteran television producer John
Prizer conceded, "The lack of religious commitment on the part of people in Hollywood is quite astonishing.  I can't
think of a director or actor or writer under 45 who goes to church or synagogue."<P>

     Film critic Michael Medved, in his book, Hollywood vs. America, suggests that this lack of participation in
religious activities may account for many of the bizarre portrayals of men of God in film.<P>

     "Whenever someone turns up in a contemporary film with the title "Reverend," "Father," or "Rabbi" in
front of his name," writes Medved "you can count on the fact that he will turn out to be corrupt or crazy--or
probably both."<P>

     Since the only committed Christians many movie makers see regularly are television evangelists, they do
not get a balanced picture of what members of the clergy do on a daily basis.  The movie executives and producers
are more familiar with Jimmy Swaggert than they are with the working clergy in their local communities.<P>

     And there are more examples of religious imbalance in Hollywood.  In a 1992 study, professors from
Northwestern University, the University of Dayton, and Duke University Medical Center evaluated more than one
hundred productions on the four major networks for their religious content and images.  <P>

     They concluded that only 5.4 percent of the characters had an identifiable religious affiliation--although 89
percent of Americans claim affiliation with an organized faith.  In summing up their report, the researchers
concluded: "Television's treatment of religion tends to be best characterized as abuse through neglect."<P>

     This edition of National Minority Politics explores the subject of Holly-wood stereotyping.  As mentioned,
New York writer Stanley Crouch explains the historical evolution of black images in films and television, from the
early 1900s to the present.  Family Research Council president Gary L. Bauer discusses Hollywood's typecasting of
families and Christians.<P>

     After reading the commentaries by Crouch and Bauer, one may ask what can be done about these
inaccurate portrayals.  There are at least two answers.  One, we can let Hollywood know our displeasure through
calls and letters to producers, directors and script writers.  Two, we can affect the ratings of undesirable
programming by simply watching more appropriate programs or turning off the tube altogether.<P>

<h2>Editor's Roundup</h2><p>
<h3>Saving our Cities without government Programs</h3>
<img src="red-line.gif"><p>
<p>
<p>
One of the real tragedies of modern times is the lack of a  
historical perspective by those who were born in the late 1960s  
and 1970s concerning Americans' abilities to solve their problems  
individually, and with the help of family, friends and neighbors.   
Our sense of community and neighborhood has been lost, and young  
people today have little or no knowledge of how things were  
before a lot of community functions were usurped by local, state  
and national governments.  
<p>     
Often when I encounter young people and we get into a  
discussion concerning issues like welfare reform, job training  
and assistance to the poor, I present the argument that these  
issues can best be addressed with a greater emphasis on the  
private sector and neighbor helping neighbor.  The involvement of  
the federal government has been expensive and, in some cases,  
detrimental, resulting in unintended consequences.  
<p>
But these young adults often give me a puzzled look.  It  
seems they have no concept of how problems can be solved without  
the establishment of a government program.  And this should come  
as no surprise since, in their lifetimes, we have approached most  
national issues in this manner.  
<p>
Those of us who were born in the 1950s and before should  
consider ourselves lucky, because we remember how neighbors  
helped each other and did not rely upon the government for basic  
needs.  I can remember how our family would take clothes we had  
outgrown to needy neighbors, and share food with them as well.  
<p>     
Our church played a major role in the community also, as  
parishioners would contribute whatever they could spare to help  
those who were less fortunate.  Hardly anyone we knew was well  
off financially; most were from middle class and working class  
families.  But collectively those items and monies donated made a  
difference for a lot of families during hard times.  
<p>
Young people today simply have no memory of this sort of  
thing; in fact, it's totally foreign to their sensibilities.   
They've bought into the liberal notion that we should first look  
to the government when we encounter an obstacle.  
<p>
For example, if a young person needs a job, setting up a  
government job assistance program is the way most liberal  
politicians would approach it.  The bureaucrats' method is to  
establish a special agency just for this purpose.  Identify those  
teens who need jobs, identify those employers who might be  
hiring, hire analysts to study the results, and administrators to  
police the project.  This is very expensive.  
<p>     
The conservative approach is to have a parent, local teacher  
or neighbor encourage that young person to look for work on his  
own, in his own neighborhood.  He or she can even become  
entrepreneurial, offering babysitting, yard work or cleaning  
services to people in his or her community for an agreed upon  
price.  Or he or she can ask a local merchant or small business  
owner if they need assistance during the summer months and after  
school.  
<p>     
No bureaucrats involved, no expense to the taxpayers and,  
more importantly, the young person learns an important lesson in  
the process--how to sell his or her skills while seeking  
employment.  But it is interesting that, in the current political  
environment, those of us who advocate local solutions are accused  
of lacking compassion.  It seems that compassion is no longer  
measured by how effective a system or process is, but by how much  
money is taken from a large pool of taxpayers to address a  
problem, even if the solutions do not work.  
<p>     
As author Marvin Olasky wrote in his book, The Tragedy of  
American Compassion, the problems "seem intractable because so  
many things, costing so much money, have been tried so often  
without success."  
<p>     
In fact, it seems that the plight of the poor is often used  
as a camouflage for spending billions of dollars to make it more  
convenient to be poor, rather than showing the poor how to earn a  
middle class income.  
<p>     
There is a simple formula to upward mobility in America:  
Stay in school and get a good education; take a job, any job, no  
matter how much it pays, as a first step toward employment  
opportunities; and delay childbearing until marriage.  An  
emphasis on this common sense formula would go a lot further than  
all the government programs that we can develop over the next 20  
years.  
<p>     
Of course, there is a role for government.  There are some  
instances where government involvement is necessary, but again it  
should be a last resort, not the first option.  
<p>     
For those who are unfamiliar with private alternatives to  
public assistance, this edition of National Minority Politics  
will be a real eye-opener.  Robert L. Woodson, founder and  
president of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise,  
provides an insightful analysis of the difference in approaches  
between government programs and community-based initiatives.    
<p>    
Woodson is very specific about why government initiatives  
are a less desirable option than are projects derived from  
indigenous community sources.  He cites an example of a  
successful project in the Columbia Heights neighborhood of  
Washington, D.C., which he describes as a "virtual oasis" in the  
nation's capital.  
<p>
Deroy Murdock, economics and government correspondent for  
National Minority Politics, searched from coast to coast and  
found several inspiring examples of how the private sector can  
best the state in aiding the disadvantaged and building their  
communities.  One such program called Fridays in Portland, Ore.,  
is a job training project which takes no government funds on the  
notion that if welfare makes individuals dependent, it must do  
the same to organizations.  
<p>     
Murdock's findings should encourage us all to be more  
creative in our quest for a better society and rely less on  
Washington-based solutions.

<h2>Editor's Roundup</h2><p>


<h3>CAN ALAN KEYES WIN?</h3>
<img src="red-line.gif"><p>
Alan Keyes, as the conventional wisdom would have it, is the quintessential also-ran in the race for the Republican presidential nomination.  He's never been elected to public office, holds beliefs which would be characterized by some as "far right, hosts a syndicated radio talk show and served in the Reagan administration.  He's a committed Christian (Catholic) and is strongly pro-life.<p>

Oddly enough, that description fits, almost to a tee, another presidential candidate--Pat Buchanan.  The only difference is that Buchanan made a run for
the presidency in the 1992 election cycle. But that was Buchanan's first bid for office.  Keyes has run twice before, for the U.S. Senate in Maryland, and lost.  Yet he
got just as big a percentage of Republican votes as Buchanan did three years ago.<p>

It appears Keyes is one of those kinds of candidates whose role in the campaign
is hard for the media to pinpoint. Therefore, they simply choose to ignore him.<p>

When Keyes first announced his candidacy, I received several calls from media representatives who wanted to know my opinion of his national political debut.  They just couldn't understand how Keyes could be anything other than a "black" candidate.<p>

"Isn't he running to galvanize black Republicans?" one reporter asked me in a telephone interview.  When I responded that Keyes' support was coming primarily from pro-life advocates, most of whom were white Christians, the reporter seemed dumbfounded.<p>

Because of the way our national political campaigns have been waged in the past, she just could not envision a black candidate getting significant support from  anything other than black voters.  She expected Keyes to be sort of a Republican
Jesse Jackson.<p>

In reality, I told the reporter, Keyes is making a smart move.  There are presently not enough blacks in the Republican Party (in national polls, only 5 percent identify themselves as Republicans) to make that much difference in the primary process.<p>

But pro-life voters number in the millions and have a disproportionate impact during the GOP presidential primaries.  They are well-organized and passionate about their cause.  And many believe Keyes is the best vehicle for channeling that passion into clout at the 1996 Republican convention.<p>

In fact, when Keyes speaks at conservative or Republican events, he always revs up the crowd and leaves them wanting more.<p>

Keyes may have significant grassroots support but, so far, that support does not
show up in national polls.  In every national poll of registered Republicans I've seen, he either receives 1 percent support or not enough to even register on the radar screen.<p>

But polls can be misleading.  Several of the Republican primaries are in the form of caucuses, which give candidates like Keyes--who don't have a lot of name identification but have spirited supporters who are willing to stick with their guy (or
gal) during the primary process--an edge.<p>

In 1988, Sen. Bob Dole won the Republican vote in Iowa, followed by Christian broadcaster Pat Robertson, who won almost 25 percent of the vote and
pushed then-vice president George Bush into third place.  Robertson's showing
enabled him to grab the spotlight.<p>

A big question this year is how this large, powerful bloc of conservative Christian voters who backed Robertson in 1988 will break in 1996.<p>

If Keyes can do reasonably well in some of the early caucus states and stay in
the race through at least the first round of contests, he and his supporters may have
an impact on shaping the debate at the convention.<p>

If he does, success will have its price.  Thus far, Keyes has not received very much media scrutiny because he is not considered a major player.  However, as other presidential candidates can confirm, being toward the front of the pack takes its toll.
Media start delving into the backgrounds of candidates they consider "viable," digging up dirt and, in many cases, casting a shadow on a person's reputation where none existed before.<p>

In Keyes' case, the fact that he paid himself several thousand dollars a month out of his campaign funds during his 1992 senate race will raise eyebrows.  And the former
ambassador still has a campaign debt left over from that election. Lingering campaign debts are certainly nothing new in politics.  But media have a way of making indiscretions or mistakes appear worse than they actually are.<p>

Yes, Keyes has a tough row to hoe.  His campaign faces a Catch-22.  If voters believe he can't win, they'll likely cast their ballots for someone else to avoid "wasting"
their votes.<p>

Whether or not he wins, he may have already succeeded in one regard. His candidacy demonstrates that a black politico can run nationally on the basis of ideology or issues, rather than race.<p>

This edition of National Minority Politics includes an exclusive interview with
the candidate himself.  To give added insight into how he's faring with the party
faithful, Sharon Brooks Hodge, NMP's social/cultural correspondent, followed
Keyes around during the North Carolina Republican convention.  Hodge spoke
with those who support Keyes, to find out why, and she also talked to those
who are skeptical, to get their take on his campaign.<p>

Finally, Deborah Burstion-Donbraye,  a Maryland writer and former media relations specialist during the Reagan administration, assesses Keyes' impact from the
state where he ran his two Senate campaigns. Burstion-Donbraye says the
candidate is "still unspoiled by compromises."<p>

<h3>Education Revolution:</h3>
<b>Home Schooling Choice Schools find School Choice</b><p>
<img src="red-line.gif"><p>

It appears that hardly anyone is pleased with the current state of our
public education system. We seem to be paying more and getting less.<p>

A few weeks ago National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) scores were released and revealed that national reading scores have dropped for high school seniors. Only about a third of seniors were rated proficient readers, a significant decrease from the same test two years earlier.<p>

Yet the national per-pupil average we spend to educate our children continues to increase fairly rapidly, and is now $6,100. And only 52 cents of the average dollar spent on public education gets into the classroom. Where does the rest go? Nobody knows.<p>

School systems typically have only a vague idea of how much goes where. When Christine Todd Whitman, New Jersey's Republican governor, recently instituted a new accounting system that disclosed costs, school districts discovered they were spending $3,000 to S6,000 per student every year for administration alone.<p>

A survey accompanying the 1994 NAEP test found that, compared to seniors who took the 1992 test, students were less likely to: read for fun on their own time, read more than 11 pages per day, or be asked at least once at school to discuss something they read.<p>

Education Secretary Richard W. Riley said the results indicate students are spending "too much time watching mind-numbing television."<p>

And the test results get worse. About 30 percent of the seniors failed to reach even basic, which denotes "partial mastery" of the reading skills they should have. Two years ago, that figure was 25 percent.<p>

Fewer than 5 percent of any grade reached the advanced level. The decline in 12th-grade reading scores seemed almost universal -- the average scores dropped for both girls and boys; for whites, blacks and Hispanics; for private school students as well as public school students.<p>

But there was a notable trend: Scores for the top quarter of students remained the same. The decrease came from those in the middle and, most especially, at the bottom of the achievement scale.<p>

One problem may be that only students who wanted to be admitted to a top university are required to achieve, said Chester Finn, a member of the test governing board. The rest "aren't obligated to read," he said.<p>

Ten states showed significant declines in reading proficiency. No state showed significant improvement in average scores.<p>

One would think that these results would signal a receptivity for innovation and educational reform. Parents seem ripe for change.<p>

And in some cases, transformation has taken place. But it's usually on the micro, rather than a macro, level. Change comes from the bottom up, not the top down, and often meets significant resistance from teachers' unions and administrators.<p>

Take Milwaukee, which has the nation's 15th-largest urban school district, for example. While politicians and pundits make much of vouchers, or school choice, Milwaukee is the only place in the country that actually has such a program.<p>

In 1991, an unusual coalition of supporters--Republican and Democrat, rich and poor-made the voucher program law. It allows up to 1.5 percent of Milwaukee's student population, about 1,500 students, to apply for slots at 12 private schools. For each student taken in, 830 this school year, the state pays $3,209 a year. The rest is paid by parents or through fund-raising.<p>

Howard Fuller, who was appointed superintendent of Milwaukee's public schools in 1991, revolutionized the system by allowing schools to control more of their funds. Before, the central administration had power over a school's entire budget. Now, it controls roughly 80 percent, and Fuller wanted to go further.<p>

"You have to break up the monopoly," Fuller said in a Business Week interview in mid-April. "All of the adults have been organized to protect their interests. You run into union contracts, board mandates, state mandates, and the tremendous intangible--the way it's always been done."<p>

But on April 18, Fuller abruptly resigned, angrily blaming ''powerful forces of the status quo" for impeding further progress. Unions fumed over proposals to close failing schools and start charter schools free of district control. The result: inertia.<p>

There are some bright spots, however. It is clear that parents want more control over their children's educational destinies. A virtual education revolution is taking place at the community level.<p>

Many parents, like Barry Brooks of the Texas Home School Coalition, have decided to educate their children at home --with a positive outcome. Others, like Vernon Robinson of the North Carolina Education Reform Foundation, have formed grassroots organizations to fight for the implementation of charter schools and vouchers Still others, like Jacqueline Joyner Cissell, are working with other parents in Indianapolis, Ind. to make sure parents' concerns are heard by administration officials.<p>

Brooks, Robinson and Cissell each tell their stories in this month' s edition of National Minority Politics.<p>

National Center for Policy Analysis 
Saving the Medicare System with Medical Savings Accounts 
September 15, 1995
</center><p>
 
Earlier this year, the National Center for Policy Analysis addressed 
the Medicare financing crisis with a proposal similar to the one now 
being considered by the Republican leadership in Congress.  Under this 
plan, the elderly would be given a voucher allowing them to obtain 
coverage from a full range of private sector options, including a 
Health Maintenance Organization (HMO).  However, the most interesting 
option would be catastrophic insurance paired with a Medical Savings 
Account (MSA).  
<p>
Patient power through Medical Savings Accounts.  
 Under the MSA alternative, the elderly would have catastrophic 
insurance plus a Medical Savings Account.  They would control more of 
their own health care dollars without answering to a health care 
bureaucracy and would likely become more value-conscious shoppers in 
the health care marketplace.  
<p>
What could private insurers do with voucher money?  Milliman & 
Robertson analyzed the cost of high-deductible policies with and 
without a managed care element for Medicare beneficiaries and 
estimated the amount of money that would remain for the MSA.  
According to the analysis:

<p>Without managed care, private insurers could put about $1,500 in a 
Medical Savings Account for each beneficiary and the insurance policy 
would pay for all expenses above $3,000.
<p>
With managed care, private insurers could put about $2,100 in a 
Medical Savings Account and pay for all medical bills above $3,000. 
[See Figure I.]
<p>
Protection against health care costs. 
 One problem with the current Medicare system is that it leaves 
seniors exposed to thousands of dollars in catastrophic health care 
expenses.  By contrast, the MSA plan would allow beneficiaries to 
obtain real catastrophic insurance.
<p>
For example, more than 418,000 Medicare beneficiaries currently pay 
more than $5,000 out of pocket every year.  Under the plan illustrated 
in Figure I, their out-of-pocket expenses could not exceed about $900 
in 1996.
<p>
Cash refunds for being prudent purchasers of care.  Under the current 
Medicare system, if a patient does something to eliminate waste, the 
benefit of that action goes to the government.  But under the MSA 
option, elderly patients who make wise and frugal choices would 
realize financial benefits.  They would keep any money they had not 
spent at the end of each year.  Thus, Medicare beneficiaries would 
receive up to $2,100 a year in cash.
<p>
Coverage for prescription drugs and other services.  Under the current 
system, Medicare does not pay for most prescription drugs and this 
leaves the elderly at risk for limitless pharmaceutical expenses.  But 
under the MSA plan, beneficiaries could have coverage for services not 
currently covered by Medicare by accepting a modest decrease in their 
MSA balance.  For example, the voucher plan would allow private 
insurers to extend coverage to drugs and other items.  Instead of a 
$2,100 MSA deposit, people could have drug coverage and receive a 
Medical Savings Account deposit of about $1,500. 
<p>
Meeting the congressional budget goals without any loss of benefits.  
A peer-reviewed analysis by Milliman & Robert-son demonstrates that 
this proposal for reforming Medicare could save $270 billion over the 
next seven years, and that Medicare beneficiaries would get more - not 
less - protection against health care costs.  Specifically, a voucher 
plan allowing the elderly to switch from Medicare to Medical Savings 
Accounts and catastrophic health insurance would save as much as $195 
billion without any other changes.
<p>
Extending the program to the disabled and making modest reductions in 
the amount of the voucher would save an additional $40 billion.  
<p>
Such options as means-testing benefits by requiring the highest-income 
elderly to pay higher premiums or increasing the age of eligibility 
(currently 65) by one month per year would save at least $30 billion 
more.  
<p>
More savings and an economic boost. 
<p> Currently, Medicare costs are growing faster than private sector 
health care costs, causing medical inflation for everyone.  [See 
Figure II.]  Less health care spending by the elderly would ease the 
pressure on all medical prices and slow the rate of increase in health 
spending.  Using the National Center for Policy Analysis/Fiscal 
Associates Health Care Model, the NCPA finds that by the year 2005, 
Medicare spending would be 18 percent lower than currently projected 
spending, and total U.S. health care costs would be 8.7 percent lower.  
Spending on all health care would decrease by $186 billion and the 
output of other goods and services would increase by $241 billion.
<p>
Best news of all:  seniors would benefit.  This MSA plan is better 
than traditional Medicare in at least five ways:
<p>
<ul><li>The plan provides full coverage for expenses over the deductible, 
while Medicare leaves seniors exposed to catastrophic expenses that 
could devastate their savings.  
<p>
<li>With the MSA, out-of-pocket exposure could be virtually eliminated 
by encouraging the 70 percent of the elderly now paying for private 
Medigap insurance to contribute their Medigap premiums (about $1,200 
per year) to their MSA.
<p>
<li>The MSA funds could be used to pay for health expenses such as 
prescription drugs, which are not covered by Medicare.
<p>
<li>At the end of the year, the beneficiaries could withdraw and spend 
their remaining MSA funds for any purpose, thus sharing directly in 
the reward for keeping Medicare costs down.
<p>
<li>People with MSAs plus catastrophic insurance would be free from 
Medicare rationing restrictions and from concerns about quality of and 
access to care.

Institute Description
<p>
The National Center for Policy Analysis is a nonprofit, nonpartisan 
public policy research institute founded in 1983 and internationally 
known for its studies on public policy issues. It draws on an 
international network of academic advisors, including several Nobel 
Prize winners, to address the most critical policy issues in the 
world. Additionally, the NCPA has several policy experts readily 
available for media inquiries.
<p>
The Center concentrates on health care, tax and environmental issues. 
It is probably best known in the U.S. for its work on tax policy and 
health policy. The NCPA is the only private sector organization that 
prepares a formal forecast of every major bill before Congress. The 
NCPA's concept of Medical Savings Accounts has been endorsed by more 
than 150 members of Congress as the alternative to the Clinton health 
reform plan. And, the NCPA's task force report on pro-free-enterprise 
approaches to environmental problems is being republished in countries 
around the world.
<p>
The NCPA was founded by John C. Goodman, an economist who serves as 
its president, and the late Sir Anthony Fisher. It's primary goal is 
to, "discover and promote private alternatives to government 
regulations and control, solving problems by relying on the strengths 
of the competitive, entrepreneurial private sector."

BRAVO, BILL ARCHER
</font></bold><br><p>
  
<font size=+1><bold>W</font></bold>ays and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer is poised to become the greatest
leader of the most powerful panel in the House of Representatives since that committee
was established in 1795.  Archer plans to remake the entire U.S. economy in his image
by writing a brand-new tax code for enactment on January 1, 1998.  With those great
stakes, and that looming deadline, Archer knows he had better do it right.<p>
  <center><bold>Serious Study</bold></center><p>
  <font size=+1><bold>T</font></bold>he first step in doing something right from scratch is to study the alternative possibilities.  This Archer has begun to do with great solemnity.  On June 6-8, Archer
convened his panel to hear testimony on the national sales tax, the value-added tax
(VAT), the Nunn-Domenici USA Tax, and variants of the Hall-Rabushka flat tax, such as
those proposed by Majority Leader Dick Armey, Presidential candidate Senator Arlen
Specter, and freshman Rep. Mark Souder.<p>
  <font size=+1><bold>T</font></bold>he results were instructive.  First, the only proposal that underwent direct attack
was the flat tax.  These came mostly from ranking Democrat Rep. Sam Gibbons,
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, and Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Leslie
Samuels, an Administration spokesman.  No attack was particularly credible.
  Second, despite a scolding from Archer, the Administration refuses to come up with
a plan, though rumors of White House interest in a "flatter" tax perhaps like the one
Gephardt promised in a forthcoming proposal persist.  Remember that White House
Chief of Staff Leon Panetta actually introduced a Hall-Rabushka variant of his own in
1982.  Last week the White House introduced a balanced budget plan  to the
consternation of Congressional Democrats.  Is a Clinton flat tax next?<p>
  <center><bold>No Sales Tax Bill</bold></center><p>
  
<font size=+1><bold>T</font></bold>hird, there is still no actual bill for a national sales tax.  At least one bill expected in
April has failed to materialize, though Reps. Billy Tauzin and Dan Schaefer suggested
their bill might be ready soon.  Why the lag?  The exceptional workload undertaken by
this Congress may be one reason, but the vast engineering difficulties inherent in
creating a credible national sales tax may be another.  The reticence of sales tax
supporters to present any more than an outline plan recalls that of the theoreticians
who constructed the USA Tax.  So long as the proposal remained an abstract exercise,
one took it seriously.  The moment the USA Tax authors revealed their plan would
impose a 40 percent marginal tax rate on single taxpayers' incomes as low as $21,350 -
- less than the earnings of a first-year Congressional aide -- the proposal died.
  Fourth, and most importantly, all are willing to learn.  Aside from a testy exchange
between Archer and witness Jack Kemp, who incurred the Chairman s displeasure by
forthrightly stating that a VAT would  Europeanize  the American economy, the
hearings generally showed goodwill and serious intent by most participants.  
  Curiously, a lot of learning remains to be done.  Some members of the panel clearly
do not understand the difference between a "consumption tax" and an "income tax", or
between a "progressive tax" and graduated rates.  Archer must see that they do.  If he
is successful, his place in history is secure.<p>

<center><bold>Tax Cut Total:  $245 Billion</bold></center><p>
  <font size=+1><bold>I</FONT></BOLD>n the House-Senate Budget conference, conferees have reached agreement on an
aggregate tax cut number -- $245 billion -- but will leave specifics on most tax cuts to
committees involved in the reconciliation process.  Congress will vote on the plan next
week.
  <font size=+1><bold>I</FONT></BOLD>n announcing the agreement Thursday evening, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and
House Speaker Newt Gingrich itemized certain tax cuts which they believe will be enacted
with the passage of a reconciliation bill.  These include a $500 per child tax credit for most
families, capital gains and estate tax relief, IRA s for non-working spouses, small business
tax relief, and possibly some reduction in corporate alternative minimum tax.  According
to staff sources, the family tax credits would be capped but permanent.<P>  
  <font size=+1><bold>T</FONT></BOLD>he budget agreement will contain more detail than the typical conference report but
less detail than in the House and Senate budget resolutions and committee reports.  The
agreement will make reference in places to committee report language, but the GOP
Leadership s list of illustrative tax cuts will not be made more specific.<P>  
  <font size=+1><bold>T</FONT></BOLD>he budget agreement walks a narrow  line in balancing family tax relief with incentives
for savings, investment, and economic growth.  Both pro-family and pro-business tax
credits will be needed to maintain the broadbased coalition which has supported the new
GOP majority in enacting provisions of the Contract with America to date.<P>
  <font size=+1><bold>T</FONT></BOLD>he budget agreement calls for $983 billion in spending cuts to provide tax relief while
still balance the budget by the year 2002.  Only the Commerce Department will be
eliminated, while defense spending will be up slightly.  
The agreement appears to reflect House demands for an aggregate total of spending
cuts while preserving the Senate's choices for actual spending cuts.<p>

Testimony
</font></bold><br><p>

<center><bold>Two Strikes Against VAT
</bold></center><P>  <font size=+1><bold>I</FONT></BOLD>n his testimony before the Ways and Means Committee June 7, a leading European
authority on the VAT said that a 20 percent rate would be necessary to replace the U.S.
personal and corporate income taxes.  Dr. Sijbren Cnossen of Erasmus University in the
Netherlands made two additional points which deserve further notice.<p> 
  <font size=+1><bold>F</FONT></BOLD>irst, Cnossen advocates a phase-in period during which both the VAT and income tax
would apply.  Otherwise, economic dislocations would be considerable.  Announcement
effects alone would be  enormous,  he said.<p>  
  <font size=+1><bold>S</FONT></BOLD>econd, Cnossen stated that a transactional VAT which is  unambiguously assessible 
to specific products would be necessary in order to comply with WTO provisions.  This
would apparently rule out the possiblity of a border-adjustable, subtraction-method VAT
as proposed by Rep. Sam Gibbons.<p> 
  <font size=+1><bold>T</FONT></BOLD>he June  5 Joint Committee on Taxation staff document describing reforms proposals
likewise states that it is  not clear  whether a subtraction-method VAT could be made
border adjustable under GATT rules and notes there is no test-case precedent for doing
so.<p>

<P><h2>Mission Statement</h2></center>
<p>
Progress is the belief that Mankind has advanced in the past, is presently
advancing, and will continue to advance through the foreseeable future.<p>

No idea is more American, no idea has played a more central role in the
development of Western, and more recently, American Civilization. No idea is more
important to our collective future, and no idea has suffered more from the
cultural nihilism of the past 30 years than the idea of progress.<p>

America's Founding Fathers were unwavering disciples of the idea of progress<p>

But theirs' was a special brand of progress. They understood history, to borrow
Hegel's words, as "none other than the progress of the consciousness of freedom,"
and they placed their own concept of freedom at the heart of the American
Declaration -- in the "self-evident" proposition that "all men are created equal;
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that
among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."<p>

From John Adams, who wrote that the American Revolution occurred first "in the
hearts and minds of the people," to G.K. Chesterton ("America is the only nation
in the world founded on a creed") to Margaret Thatcher ("No other nation has been
built upon and idea"), it has always been clear that America's identity
transcends geography and ethnicity. Historians have devoted thousands of pages to
explaining our nation's history as the history of her ideas, and if we can be
certain of one thing, it is that America's future will be determined by the
future of her ideas.<p>

The challenge we face is to describe for ourselves and our progeny the historical
underpinnings, economic principles, cultural mores and practical implications of
the next incarnation of the American Idea. We will be judged by our sons and
daughters on our success at renewing, reapplying and passing on the core values
of the American Creed.<p>

That explains the mission of The Progress & Freedom Foundation: To restore, to
renew and to recreate America's sense of its future, a future woven inextricably
with the ideas of progress and freedom. It has been said that "The best way to
predict the future is to create it." Creating ideas that will define America's
future is what the Foundation has set about to do since its inception in April
1993.<p>

The Foundation is a private, non-profit, non-partisan idea center organized under
<a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/treasury/bureaus/irs/irs.html">Section 501(c)(3)</a> of the Internal Revenue Code.

<P>
<H2>WELFARE'S BATTLE LINES</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER>
<I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Jennifer E. Marshall</I></CENTER>
<P>
Again, in the course of the welfare debate, the abortion issue
has demonstrated its unique capacity to mobilize and divide.
<P>
Pro-life advocates who resist the so-called family cap, which
would freeze benefits to mothers who bear additional illegitimate
children while on welfare, fear that the cap could promote an
increase in abortions.  Pro-life advocates who support the measure
share both this concern and the long-term goal of driving abortions
to the point of zero.  Unlike the more conventional conflict between
pro-life and pro-choice groups, pro-life differences over the
family cap represent a dispute over means, not ends, that is complicated
by the absence of any hard data from actual experimentation.
<P>
Such differences lend themselves to reasoned discussion and, ultimately,
resolution far more easily than the larger debate for and against
abortion rights, which Laurence Tribe has characterized as a &quot;clash
of absolutes.&quot;  While the choice between life and death cannot
be accurately described as a &quot;clash of absolutes,&quot; the
phrase does capture usefully the impossibility of winning adherents
to the pro-life cause without first changing hearts, one at a
time.  We should forfeit no battles, but neither can we expect
to win the war against abortion on demand without a comprehensive,
long-term strategy to develop and sustain a pro-life consensus.
<P>
While a pro-life position must be part of the agenda for national
renewal, opposition to abortion must be only one plank of the
pro-life platform.  A crisis as broad and deep as abortion on
demand requires a transformation of the political and moral culture
as well as a reform of law.  Reducing illegitimacy is the <I>sine
qua non</I> of moral reconstruction; and right-to-life activists
should realize that, as one of the few weapons in the anti-illegitimacy
arsenal, the family cap not only serves their cause in the long
term but deserves their active support in the short term.
<P>
Even assuming that our ultimate objective is to save as many lives
as possible, it is by no means clear that the appropriate operational
measure of success in assessing the family cap would be the number
of lives saved in the short term -- if such a number could be
approximated in the future as it cannot be now.  The question
itself is a red herring because it obscures the larger and more
important 
issue: &quot;What constitutes progress toward ending altogether
the culture that finds abortion acceptable?&quot;
<P>
To increase the logic and appeal of pro-life arguments to a significant
number of people who do not now see the moral force in such arguments,
we must begin the task of rebuilding civil institutions that will
nourish human souls and liberate them to fulfill their full potential.
 Such an ambitious project will require a multifaceted strategy,
and eliminating the welfare benefits that encourage illegitimacy
must be a key component of that strategy.
<P>
The real fault-line in the current welfare debate is not between
pro-life social conservatives and economic libertarians.  Rather,
the crucial dispute pits those who think relimiting government
is a prerequisite for moral reform against those who believe that
the size of government bears no relation to cultural decay.
<P>
Most of the outspoken pro-life opponents of welfare reform do
not deny that reducing illegitimacy will reduce abortions.  Instead,
they deny that welfare subsidies increase illegitimacy.  The blame
belongs exclusively, they say, to &quot;the sex-drenched culture.&quot;
<P>
Yet, in a perverse twist of logic, the same pro-lifers also maintain
that abortion rates respond quite sensitively to small changes
in the size of cash benefits.
<P>
If man is more than a material being, then it is not unreasonable
to expect some individual moral decisions to override the economic
incentives that run against the grain of virtue.  Nor is it implausible
to suggest that, of all the choices an individual mother must
make, the decision to abort her child -- the most galvanizing
moral issue of our day -- is the one <I>least</I> likely to respond
to economic policy variables.  To suggest otherwise, in fact,
is to assert a particularly virulent form of economic determinism,
with the implication that morality is little more than a product
of rational choices in response to dollar incentives.
<P>
Thus, some pro-life advocates arrive at the argument that government
must pay women not to have abortions.  And while they advocate
incentivizing virtue, they are unwilling to give any credence
to the suggestion that welfare's economic incentives encourage
vice -- including abortion.
<P>
Cultural conservatives believe the diametric opposite: Public
policy can undermine, but never instill, virtue because government
cannot be an effective moral teacher.  Rather than attempting
to devise the perfect bundle of carrots and sticks to reward virtue
and penalize vice, we must eliminate altogether the government
subsidies that skew welfare recipients' decisions by shielding
them from the natural economic consequences.
<P>
Getting government out of the way, of course, is the theme that
unites social conservatives and economic libertarians.  The vast
majority of pro-life social conservatives support restrictions
on welfare benefits, while the majority of pro-lifers who oppose
reform couple their concerns about abortion with a commitment
to big government.
<P>
Failure to understand the real source of the pro-life dispute
now threatens to obscure the critical nexus between morality and
freedom from government intervention.  Misunderstanding the relationship
between morality and freedom in turn threatens both the moral
authority of limited government and the efficacy of cultural reform.
<P>
The Founders instituted a limited government to secure natural
rights, including the right to life; but as George Will noted
in a recent editorial, &quot;Our creed of limited government has
a corollary vision of human capacities and of the life worth living,&quot;
captured by the phrase &quot;pursuit of happiness.&quot;
<P>
The Founders would have scoffed at the notion that the protection
of life and limb alone is an adequate notion of &quot;happiness,&quot;
and right-to-life proponents forget that at their peril in the
present debate over illegitimacy.  By opposing the current system
of welfare benefits, we advocate a transformation of the political
and social culture that will sustain both &quot;happiness&quot;
and a more enduring pro-life consensus than even legal reform
can hope to accomplish.

<LI>  The movement away from cash benefits affects only a small percentage
of the prospective caseload.  It is the least we can do and still
claim that we are changing the system.
<P>
<LI>  By targeting teenagers, we intend to stop the cycle of misery
before it starts.
<P>
<LI>  Liberal social groups base their projections about the number
of children who will be cut from the rolls on a flawed and biased
study by a liberal think-tank, which derived the figures by going
back in time 10 years and implementing the bill, then returning
to the present -- without assuming any change in behavior or population
size.   
<P>
<LI>  The elimination of benefits affects only potential future additions
to the welfare rolls.  Not one person currently receiving welfare
would lose any benefits the day after the bill is passed. Given the Faustian bargain we have made
with current recipients,
it would be unethical to require them to function normally at
this stage.  Instead, we must protect future generations from
becoming mired in the habits of dependency.
<P>
The under-18 provision applies only with respect to federal funding.
 States are free to use state funds as they see fit.
<P>
<LI>  Minor mothers retain Medicaid, food stamps, and housing benefits.
<P>
<LI>  The federal government spends welfare dollars very inefficiently.
 One study found that less than 35 cents out of every federal
welfare dollar was paid in cash directly to the needy.  If the
federal government gave all the money it spends on welfare directly
to the poor, each family of four would receive more than the average
American family income.
<P>
<LI>  By cashing out AFDC benefits, the federal government frees
new dollars which the states can then spend on services for young
unwed mothers -- more compassionate alternatives that will minister
personally to mothers and children, instead of sapping their spirits.
<P>
<LI>  Private charitable efforts rescue far more individuals than
government social programs. Historically, private-sector organizations have succeeded in
transforming
the poor by setting behavioral standards for the receipt of assistance.
 Because it is far easier to receive a check in the mail, no questions
asked, federal welfare has kept the needy from receiving real
help. 
<P>
<LI>  In 1991, private charities provided, in cash or in kind, over
$176 billion for health, education, and welfare.  More than $100
billion of that amount was in cash.  The same year, Americans
volunteered time and manpower the equivalent of nine million full-time
employees.  After declining steadily through the 1960s and 1970s,
charitable giving rose during the 1980s.
<P>
<LI>  It is wrong to defer welfare cuts until some direct replacement
is identified for every current recipient because bad charity
drives out good.

<TITLE>THE TRUTH ABOUT AFDC</TITLE>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>THE TRUTH ABOUT AFDC</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
 <I>MYTH:  Single mothers heading households
alone are being unfairly singled out in the discussion of reforming
the Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) program.</I>
<P>
<B>FACT:</B>  According to the Census Bureau, the vast majority (87 percent)
of AFDC recipients live in single-parent households.  Nearly half
(47 percent) of the mothers on AFDC have never married; 23 percent
are widowed or divorced; and 17 percent are married, but living
without a husband present in the home.  Only 13 percent of women
receiving AFDC are married and living with a spouse. 
<P><BR>
<I>MYTH:  Women
receiving AFDC have the same childbearing patterns as non-AFDC
women.</I>
<P>
<B>FACT:</B>  Women on AFDC are significantly younger than other
first-time mothers when they bear their first child.  The average
age of new mothers in the AFDC population (age 20) is three years
younger than the average age of non-AFDC mothers at first birth.
 AFDC mothers also have a slightly higher average number of children
(2.6 children).
<P>
<BR>
<I>MYTH:  If AFDC mothers had guaranteed child care
and additional material resources, they could earn their college
degrees in a matter of years.</I>
<P>
<B> FACT:</B>  While 85 percent of non-AFDC
women are at least high school graduates, almost half (44 percent)
of AFDC mothers do not have a high school diploma.  Only 19 percent
of women receiving AFDC have completed at least one year of college.
<P>
<BR>
<I>MYTH: The majority of AFDC recipients are minorities.</I>
<P>
<B>FACT:</B>  There are far more white women in their childbearing years on AFDC (27.4
million) than African-American and Hispanic mothers combined (5.7
million and 4.2 million respectively).  Minority women, however,
do receive aid in numbers disproportionate to their population
size.  Only 7 percent of white mothers collect AFDC, while 26
percent of African-American mothers and 19 percent of Hispanic
mothers receive AFDC benefits.

<TITLE>QUOTABLE COMMENTS ON WELFARE REFORM AND
ILLEGITIMACY</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>QUOTABLE COMMENTS ON
<BR>WELFARE REFORM AND
<BR>ILLEGITIMACY</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
&quot;Welfare programs must contribute to the attack on family
breakdown and illegitimacy.  Unless such problems are dealt with
effectively, they fester, and grow, sapping the strength of society
as a whole and extending their consequences in troubled families
from one generation to the next.&quot;
<BR>
<I>- John F. Kennedy</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;Illegitimacy is the single most important social problem
of our time because it drives everything else.  The task is not
to devise a public relations campaign to discourage single teenage
girls from having babies, but to neutralize whatever is impeding
the age-old impulse of human beings to form families.&quot;
<BR>
<I>- Charles Murray</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;The real source of the problem is the inordinate number
of out-of-wedlock births in this country.  There's no question
that ending welfare for unwed mothers would work.  The question
is, 'Is it morally right?'&quot;
<BR>
<I>- Bill Clinton</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;I do believe that having children out of wedlock is wrong.&quot;
<BR>
<I>- Donna Shalala</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;Unmarried teen childbearing is morally wrong because of
its costs for children and society.  It is wrong -- not simply
foolish or impractical -- for women and men to make babies they
cannot support emotionally and financially.  We must reject moral
relativism and reassert our common values.  It is also time to
challenge the complacent view that having babies out of wedlock
is simply a lifestyle choice, and that since all lifestyles choices
are equally valid, no behavior should be condemned.  This stance
is untenable in the face of compelling evidence that not all choices
are equal in terms of their impact on children, and that children
need fathers as well as mothers.  Massive federal spending on
remedial programs will not solve the problem.  Families are the
primary socializers of children; families teach children how to
be citizens.  To deprive children of crucial adult models of citizenship,
anthropologist David Murray suggests, is to 'undercapitalize'
society's investment in its own future.  The social welfare system
has 'normalized' fatherless families.  The dilemma is this: Everything
the welfare system does to create normal and acceptable lives
for the children of teen mothers creates the perception that their
parents' behavior is normal and acceptable.  The system makes
government rather than parents ultimately responsible for the
lives of children.&quot;
<BR>
<I>- Progressive Policy Institute</I>

<P>
<BR>
&quot;The essential first step is to acknowledge that at root,
in almost every area of important public concern, we are seeking
to induce persons to act virtuously.  Not only is such conduct
desirable in its own right, it appears now to be necessary if
large improvements are to be made in those matters we consider
problems.  In Victorian England and Victorian America, countless
organizations tried to save the children and they succeeded. 
They did so on the basis of firm convictions as to what constitutes
a decent family life.  We have rejected implicitly if not explicitly
the moral convictions that underlay that effort, replacing child-saving
programs with something we now call condescendingly welfare. 
Replacing our desire to save children with the desire merely to
end poverty or dependency [sic].&quot;
<BR>
<I>- James Q. Wilson</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;After making the most arduous attempt to objectify the problem
of poverty, to divorce poverty from any moral assumptions and
conditions, we are learning how inseparable the moral and material
dimensions of that problem are.  And after trying to devise social
policies that are scrupulously neutral and 'value-free,' we are
finding these policies fraught with moral implications that have
grave material and social consequences.&quot;
<BR>
<I>- Gertrude Himmelfarb</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;We looked at a hundred different programs around the country
that were trying to deal with out-of-wedlock births, and not one
of them moved the needle.  There just weren't any results.&quot;
<BR>
<I>- anonymous Clinton aide</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;I know this must seem a strange message from a not particularly
religious writer in an utterly secular newspaper, but I am increasingly
struck by two phenomena.  The first is the growing sense that
America's major failings are not political or economic but moral.
 The second is the discovery that the most successful <I>social</I>
programs are those that are driven -- even if only tacitly --
by moral or religious values.&quot;
<BR>
<I>- William Raspberry</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;Washington's continued medicalization of teen pregnancy
ignores the lessons of the past 20 years and is doomed to fail.
 Dealing with teenage pregnancy requires a one-on-one discussion
of values and morality.  What many call sexual liberation has
brought with it unhappy consequences for millions of teens.  This
is not liberation.  It is bondage for the child-mother and the
mother's child.&quot;
<BR>
<I>- Joseph Califano</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;The project of self-government depends on the capacity of
citizens to govern their own passions, urges, habits, and expectations.
 If they cannot govern their own lives individually, how can they
be successful in self-government as a republic?&quot;
<BR>
<I>- Michael Novak</I>

<html><title>Cong. Kingston on Welfare Reform</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
Note: This document is the unofficial version of the Congressional Record.
      The printed Congressional Record produced by the Government Printing
      Office is the only official version.
<center>
      CONGRESSIONAL RECORD (HOUSE)<br>
     September 19, 1995<p>
                                                              PAGE H9223
       <p>IMPORTANCE OF A BALANCED BUDGET, WELFARE REFORM AND MEDICARE TO
                                        AMERICA
        <p></center>The SPEAKER pro tempore.  Under a previous order of the House,
          the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Kingston) is recognized for 5
          minutes.
            Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, I have just returned from 4 days in
          Georgia visiting with constituents, meeting with a few civic clubs,
          and riding in a parade or two.  In talking around the district that
          I represent, the coastal area of Georgia, Georgia`s first district,
          the three predominant things that seem to be on people`s minds are
          balancing the budget, reforming welfare, and the changes in the
          Medicare Program.
            On balancing the budget, even though the other body across the
          Hall failed to pass the balanced budget amendment, it is absolutely
          undeniable that the American people want us to balance the budget.
          As a member of the Committee on Appropriations I can say that we
          are moving in that direction.  We have 1 appropriations bill left
          out of 13. Hopefully, we will pass that this week or next week.
          When we do, we will have all of our appropriations bills passed,
          which take us to having a balanced budget by the year 2002.
    <p><center> PAGE H9223</center><p>
            The importance of this, Mr. Speaker, is that as we have these
          billion dollar deficits each year, it takes money away from other
          programs and we are unable to pay down the debt.  Now all we are
          doing is servicing the interest.  Currently, the interest on the
          national debt is the third largest item in our budget every year.
          In 2 years that interest is expected to exceed all of the military
          spending.  Once we get rid of the deficit, we can start paying off
          the principal beyond the interest of the debt.  Of course, it will
          take many, many years.  We have a $4.8 trillion debt.
            The definition, Mr. Speaker, of a trillion, to illustrate it,
          and, first of all, it is almost beyond comprehension, but if we
          spent $100,000 a minute, 24 hours a day, it would take 19 years to
          get to $1 trillion.  We currently have a debt of $4.8 trillion.  We
          simply cannot pass that on to the children of the United States of
          America.
            I think it is very important that this House is moving toward a
          balanced budget as fast as we can.  I certainly hope the folks in
          the other body feel the same way.
     <center><p>PAGE H9223 <p></center>
            We have passed welfare reform in the House. Our welfare reform
          has four significant planks to it.
            No. 1, a work requirement.  If an individual is able-bodied, in
          order to get welfare, they should have to work.
            No. 2, a mechanism to discourage illegitimate births, since that
          is one of the biggest problems in America today.
     <center><p>    PAGE H9223<p></center>
            No. 3, State flexibility.  We may do it differently in Georgia
          than the folks in New York, but let us make those decisions.
            And No. 4, no welfare benefits to illegal aliens.  We want to
          help them if they are hurt in this country, but we also want them
          to get back home if they are not American citizens, so that they
          are not coming over to America to enjoy the benefits of our
          generous public benefits system.
            The third thing people are interested in, of course, is the
          Medicare Program. The current trustees in April said that Medicare
          is going broke.  We have to move to save it.  We are trying to slow
          the growth of it, trying to make the growth of Medicare inflation
          about 6 percent, which is closer to what it is in regular medical
          inflation.  Actually, regular medical inflation was down last
          year.  It was not even inflation.  But the costs were down.
    <p><center>PAGE H9223</center><p>
            The thing we need to do on Medicare is protect and preserve it by
          simplifying it.  We want to give senior citizens a whole list of
          options: choice of doctors, choice of traditional fee-for-service
          plans, choice of traditional Medicare, and, along with that, some
          other options like Medisave accounts and so forth.
            We believe all this can be done, Mr. Speaker, and the result will
          be a better product to American seniors.  Again, we want to protect
          and preserve it.
            The big frustration that the American people seem to be having is
          while we have done a lot of things in the House, across the Hall,
          in the other body, they are taking the route of inaction.  It is
          true today they passed welfare reform, but we passed ours back in
          March. It is time to bring these issues to a question.  Will the
          other body and will the executive branch join the House, the lower
          Chamber, in making the reforms necessary to preserve our country?
  <p><center>PAGE H9223<p></center>
            I hope that they will, because we are clearly on the road to
          personal responsibility, personal discipline, balancing the budget,
          lowering taxes, decreasing Government regulation and
          micromanagement out of Washington, and, best of all and most
          importantly, increasing personal freedom.  We cannot do it alone.
          We have to have the cooperation of the full legislative branch of
          Government, which means the other body, and we have to have the
          executive branch to sign this into law.
            Mr. Speaker, if we can get the cooperation of the folks across
          the hall, I believe we will have a balanced budget, we will have
          Medicare reform, and we will have welfare reform.  This, Mr.
          Speaker, I believe, is what the American people are asking for.

<h3>Job Prospects for College Graduates:  What's the Problem?</h3><br>
<h4>by Kate Obenshain Griffin<br>
Director of Program Development<br>
<a href="/yaf">Young America's Foundation</a><br>
September 7, 1995</h4><br>
</center>

	Students arriving at the "Ivies" this fall are encountering a surprising phenomenon.  Women's studies courses outnumber economics classes, often by as much as two to one.  Princeton remains the lone exception, but not by much:  25 women's studies courses compared with 32 in economics.<p>
	This phenomenon has something to do with the fact that over 50 percent of those who graduated from college in May still cannot find jobs appropriate for their degrees.  But that's only half the picture;  the following anecdote completes it.  <p>
	<i>New Republic</i> editor and outspoken liberal Michael Kinsley wrote this of his attempt to hire a recent college graduate as his research assistant:  "[T]he government makes it comically difficult for the honest citizen to hire a single employee."  Comical to some, but not to the new graduate.  Kinsley said government regulation "plunges you into an entirely new dimension of complexity as an employer" with "a minimum of 37 different forms and 50 separate checks to hire a single employee for a year."  As a result of government regulation, Kinsley's young assistant ended up right back where he found her:  in the unemployment line.<p>
	Two simple reasons explain why half of today's college graduates cannot find jobs befitting their degree.  First, colleges are not preparing students adequately and employers know it.  They are focusing on fads such as women's studies rather than spending limited resources on core academic subjects.  And second, burgeoning government regulation is having a pernicious, and often underestimated, impact on the job market. <p>
	Thanks to a dramatic shift in the direction of college curricula, a degree no longer indicates proficiency in the basic skills.  The <i>New York Times</i> reported that employers, "express a lack of confidence in the ability of schools and colleges to prepare young people for the workplace."  According to a major report by the National Center on the Educational Quality of the Workforce, employers, well aware of grade inflation, "pay little attention to measurements of school performance."  Nevzer Stacey of the Department of Education went one step further:  "Employers have given up on the schools."<p>
	What are our colleges and universities doing wrong?  While skill requirements for employment are increasing (57 percent of employers say skill requirements have increased), the quality and substance of our educational institutions are eroding.  Except at a few select schools which have maintained their commitment to quality academic instruction, multicultural and politically correct courses supplant classes that have practical value for future employment.  <p>
	What courses are now preparing our students for the work force?  At Columbia University this fall: <i> Race, Gender, and the Politics of Rock 'n' Roll</i> and <i>The Invisible Women in Literature</i>:<i> The Lesbian Literary Tradition</i>.   At Penn:  <i>Search for Extraterrestrial Life</i> and <i>(Im)possible Animals</i>.  At Brown:  <i>Unnatural Acts and Split Britches</i>, <i>Circumcision: Male and Female, Jewish and Gentile and Daughters of Darkness: Lesbian Tropes</i>.  And Harvard, not to give students the idea that the free market might is a good thing, offers <i>Alternative Economies:</i>  <i>The Case Against Capitalism</i>, <i>1648-1848</i> in addition to activist-oriented <i>Status of Environmental Justice as a Public Policy Issue</i> and<i> AIDS, Health, and Human Rights</i>.  Other courses influencing students' outlook on the free market include Cornell's <i>The Selfish Individual and the Modern World</i>, Princeton's <i>Income Distribution</i>, and Yale's<i> Gender and the Politics of Resistance:  Feminism, Capitalism and the Third World.</i> <p>
	According to a recent survey in <i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i>, finding a good job is the number one reason students attend college.  Yet schools are so caught up in hot political issues that they have lost sight of a critical aspect of their mission:  training students for the workforce.  As Wendy Bounds of the<i> Wall Street Journal</i> said, "After an outlay of thousands of dollars, college graduates discover that a bachelor's degree doesn't buy what it did 10 years ago."<p>
	Hand in hand with higher education's own responsibility for the attrition of opportunities for college graduates is another culprit:  government regulation.  While Clinton panders to the twenty-something crowd with his expensive AmeriCorps and student loan programs, his administration's regulatory policies are having a baleful effect.  Businesses are forced to spend vast resources on compliance with regulations rather than on expansion and hiring.  Take the paper industry for example.  Over the past four years, one of the largest book paper suppliers in North America, P.H. Glatfelter, spent <i>$180 million</i> to satisfy regulatory requirements.  That is $180 million that will not be spent developing the business or hiring new workers. <p>   
	The numbers are staggering.  There are four times more federal regulations today than in 1965 and 14 times more than in 1950, totaling over 200 volumes and 132,000 pages.  Estimates show regulations costing the U.S. economy over $500 billion annually.  Employment quotas, for instance, set businesses back between $5 and $8 billion annually on direct compliance (government paperwork, mandated advertising in minority newspapers, etc.).  Many billions more, however, are lost in indirect costs due to the diversion of management time, resources, and energy.  And according to author Thomas Sowell, minorities have not benefited from this loss.  He says the relative economic position of minorities has actually fallen since the United States implemented employment quotas.  <p>
	As a result of new and existing regulations, the jobs students have counted on are just not there.  Rather than pay the price of expansion, businesses are either stagnant or cutting back.  During July and August 1995, manufacturing jobs declined by an average of 38,000 per month.  Yet in August alone, government <i>increased</i> its payroll by 73,000 jobs.  That is 73,000 new bureaucrats to write, revise and enforce regulations which are largely responsible for factories losing 120,000 jobs overall in 1995. <p>
	While universities educate students in <i>The Drama of Homosexuality </i>(Harvard) and <i>Spirit Possession</i>, <i>Shamanism</i>, <i>Curing and Witchcraft</i> (Cornell), the Clinton administration is doing little to plan for the employment needs of future graduates.   For instance, there are <i>one million </i>cosmetology grads who cannot find jobs in their field.  Yet this year, there will be <i>200,000</i> new cosmetology students, many of whom will seek and receive assistance from federal loan programs.  While the Clinton administration demands increases in student loan program funding, those funds are not granted to students according to any reasonable estimate of what the market can sustain.  Rather, this administration is more concerned about building demand for federal student loan programs than in planning for employment needs.  Consequently, higher education continues to send graduates into ridiculously glutted markets, or no markets at all. <p> 
	Is it any wonder that over 50 percent of May's graduates are still looking for the jobs they hoped their degrees would lead them to?  If we continue to ignore the obvious impact of an increasingly politically correct curriculum, staggering new and existing regulations, and poor investment planning with taxpayer dollars on the part of the Clinton administration, recent college graduates, once our brightest hope for the future, will be increasingly unwanted in the workforce.<p>

<hr>
<br>
  Education will surely be an important issue in the 1996 presidential election.  President Clinton
regularly uses the issue as a weapon against Republican budget austerity and fiscal conservatism,
as was the case when a smaller than anticipated increase in federal funding for school lunches
(but an increase none the less) became a "cut" in the program and thus an attack on the whole
education system.<P>
    The next battle is likely to be over the financial aid program for college students--specifically the
Clinton administration's plan to provide direct government funded student loans.  Congress in
1993 approved a phase-in of the program over at least five years.  The Administration hopes to
accelerate the program to reach 100% participation in 1997-8.  Rep. William Goodling (R-PA),
Chairman of the Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee, and Nancy Kassebaum
(R-Kan), Chairman of Labor and Human Resources Committee, have separately introduced
legislation (HR 530 and S 495) to cap the growth of the direct loan program at the 40% level.  In
light of recent cost estimates for the program, some are now calling for a complete repeal of the
program.<P>

    This time around conservatives are on solid ground.  The prudent and fiscally responsible
position is to eliminate the program before it costs American taxpayers -- not to mention
American college students -- more than they can afford.  Besides, getting rid of this program is
pro-education.  Here are four reason why.<P>
<ol>
<li> <STRONG>The Direct Loan Program does not save money</STRONG>.  By streamlining and centralizing the
whole student loan program, direct lending is supposed to save taxpayers billions of dollars. 
President Clinton's 1996 budget claims $5.2 billion in savings if the direct loan program is fully
implemented and replaces guaranteed loans.  A recent report by the Congressional Budget
Office, however, argues that the direct loan program, if fully implemented, would save only $115
million over the next seven years.  The difference is largely explained by changes in official
budget scoring to account for the complicated long-term administrative costs of direct loans.  (It
is also due to the removal from the cost estimate of savings that are not due to the direct loan
program.)  Indeed, according to the updated CBO report, eliminating the direct loan program and
maintaining the guaranteed program would save $1.5 billion over the next seven years.  <P>
<li> <STRONG>The Direct Loan Program adds considerably to the national debt</STRONG>.  As it currently stands
private lenders provide the capital for the loans, private and state guarantor agencies process the
loans and the federal government subsidizes the loan interest rate, guarantees the loans in cases
of default and exercises regulatory authority over the whole program. That is to say, the vast bulk
of capital is provided by private sources.  Under the Clinton plan the federal government would
borrow the money necessary to provide capitol for the loans and would service and collect the
loans itself.  This would require the federal government to borrow an additional $20-25 billion a
year to provide capital for the program.  According the Rep. Ernest Istook (R-OK) in testimony
last spring, a complete shift to direct loans could add $348 billion to the national debt by the year
2014.  And this does not consider any additional borrowing costs this expansion of debt will have
on the existing debt!<P>
<li><STRONG>The Direct Loan Program creates a new government bureaucracy</STRONG>.  Direct lending
centralizes control in the Department of Education and creates the potential for vast inefficiencies
and unconstrained costs.  The Department is hiring 600 new employees to administer the
program and anticipates 20,000 contract employees by the time the program is fully operational. 
The government is already funding the expansion with an unencumbered $2.5 billion
authorization.  This in a government department that is notoriously disorganized and
mismanaged.  In 1994, for instance, the Department of Education gave out $700 million in direct
loans but is unable to account for some $100 million.  The Advisory Committee on Student
Financial Assistance recently reported that the direct loan program is "potentially exposed to
multiple loans, overawards, loans to ineligible students, and excessive cash drawdowns" and, in
general, cannot "ensure program integrity."  This is the program that wants to take over
responsibility for making six million loans and dispersing over $20 billion a year?<P>
<li> <STRONG>The Direct Loan Program is bad for students and education</STRONG>.  Direct lending radically
changes the federal government's involvement in college lending programs by nationalizing what
for three decades has been a private-public partnership.  There are currently efforts to nationalize
(though not directly within the government) the college accreditation process, which allows a
college's students to be eligible for financial aid.  One can only imagine the temptations
presented to education reformers if the power of accreditation is combined with government
control over student loan money.  If recent history is any guide--witness Goals 2000 and the
drive for multicultural curriculum changes--further government intrusion in the academy will
only hinder and not help college and university education.  <P>
</ol>

    At a time when many existing programs are being reconsidered in light of the need to balance the
federal budget, Congress should think very carefully before completely federalizing the multi-billion dollar student loan program.  In the early 1970s Congress experimented with a direct loan
program called the Federally Insured Student Loan (FISL) program.  It was poorly managed and,
because the government was ineffective at collecting the loans, default rates increased above
previous levels.  Not surprisingly it was phased out in 1976.  It was largely because of this failure
that there emerged the current decentralized system that relies on private lenders and guarantors. 
Taxpayers should not be expected to tolerate more bureaucracy and an increased federal debt in
order to support another inefficient and costly program that does not help students or their
families.<P>  
    Let's eliminate the direct loan program and focus our energy on reforming the existing system
rather than replacing it with a new government-run program.  <P>

DUMB AND DUMBER
<P>
<a name="alumni">Alumni</a> to the Rescue
<BR>
T. KENNETH CRIBB JR.
<P>
<font size="-1"><i>*Selected definitions from ``A Short Educational Dictionary,''
by Kingsley Amis and Robert Conquest, published in Black Paper
3, 1970.
<P>
Mr. Cribb, president of the Intercollegiate Studies Institute,
was chief of domestic affairs in the Reagan White House.
</i></font>
<P>
THE development officer of a reputable Western university recently
took one of the school's deans to meet a wealthy alumnus. In the
alum's office, the dean spied a bumper sticker that read: ``Socialists
reject history. Fair enough: History rejects Socialism.'' Upon
leaving, the dean condescendingly remarked that the sticker was
annoying, to which the development officer replied: ``You have
to learn how to talk to these people. This is the future.''
<P>
``These
people'' are concerned university alumni, and they represent the
best hope for influencing colleges and universities back toward
sanity. At schools such as Dartmouth, Princeton, Stanford, Wellesley,
Duke, Mount Holyoke, and Yale, alumni groups are demanding the
de-politicization of higher learning and better stewardship of
donations. According to the<I> Wellesley News</I>, in 1994 fewer than
50 per cent of alumnae contributed to Wellesley, for the first
time since 1978. Wellesley's alumnae-association director attributes
the decrease in part to a demand for accountability. A group of
Dartmouth alumni sued the Board of Trustees after rule changes
severely limited alumni involvement in decision-making. At South
Carolina's Converse College, trustees and alumni forced the president's
resignation after a string of multicultural excesses.
<P>
Until very
recently, the well-documented politicization of colleges and universities
went unchecked by alumni. The somnambulance of this core group
of university benefactors has allowed college administrators to
accede to the political demands of the academic Left without cost.
This inattentiveness, however, is ending at a propitious historical
moment, a time when universities are facing great financial pressure
from reduced government subsidies, resistance to skyrocketing
tuition hikes, and the hangover from years of improvident spending.
Universities depend to a significant extent on private giving.
According to <I>The Chronicle of Higher Education</I>, university trustees,
alumni, and private donors provide 49 per cent of the total revenue
of American colleges and universities, or nearly $3.4 billion
in 1994. With the increasing importance of the marginal dollar
should come an opportunity for those seeking authentic university
reform. 
<P>
While alumni slept, radicals who entered the academic world
in the Sixties slowly achieved positions of power in faculties
and administrations. Along with younger disciples, they redesigned
traditional curricula, revamped reading lists and course requirements,
instituted speech codes, redefined acceptable behavior outside
the classroom, and generally subverted the traditional mission
of the university. The end of higher learning was no longer to
be the cultivation of the mind but rather, as Richard Weaver observed,
``the conditioning [of] the young for political purposes.''
<P>
This
revolution within the university marched on virtually unnoticed
by alumni principally because the college public-relations apparatus
held a monopoly on the flow of information. Even when the national
press picked up on political correctness (years after the fact),
alums were lulled by reassurances that at their alma mater ``nothing
had changed.''
<P>
But the university stranglehold on information began
to loosen when in the early 1980s entrepreneurial students, aided
by the introduction of desktop-publishing technology and educational
institutes willing to contribute money and expertise, established
alternative student newspapers at a number of campuses. Coordinated
nationally by the Collegiate Network, these papers gave 75 to
100 schools voices independent of university control. To serve
the 2,000 campuses that had no such publication, the Intercollegiate
Studies Institute (ISI) launched in 1990 a nationwide alternative
student newspaper, CAMPUS:<I> America's Student Newspaper</I>, and began
informational mailings to tens of thousands of targeted alumni
donors. As these efforts took hold, alumni started to realize
that their alma maters were becoming radicalized laboratories
for multicultural experimentation.
<P>
The potential for exercising
real clout was most recently evidenced by an expose in an ISI-published
student journal at Yale, <I>Light and Truth</I>, which broke the story
of Yale's refusal to administer as promised $20 million given
by alumnus Lee Bass to establish an integrated program in Western
civilization. When it became evident to Mr. Bass that he had been
kept in the dark while the Yale administration explored ways to
divert the money from the agreed-upon program, he asked that Yale
refund the $20 million, plus interest. Yale was forced to comply,
to the accompaniment of nationwide headlines and the reaction
of a donor community infuriated by the sorry treatment of Mr.
Bass.
<P>
According to reports in both the New York Times and the Boston
Globe, much of the opposition to the Bass-funded Western-civilization
program was ideological. The Globe reported that ``Some Yale faculty
have resisted the emphasis on Western Civilization, favoring a
more multicultural curriculum.'' The Times stated that ``Liberals
had criticized the restrictions placed on the donation, arguing
that the money could be better spent on courses with a multicultural
perspective.'' John Leo noted in <I>U.S. News &amp; World Report</I>
that the Bass affair is ``a reminder of how far the modern university
. . . will go these days to avoid hurting the feelings of the
campus Left.'' Meanwhile, Yale's donor community was kept minutely
informed by successive mailings of <I>Light and Truth</I> and other updates.
<P>
Such
shoddy treatment of one of their most prominent confreres led
many Yale alumni to ask, in effect, ``If Yale values a left-leaning
political agenda over $20 million, how will it treat my $1,000,
$10,000, or $100,000 gift?''
<P>
After subscribing to <I>Light and Truth</I>,
reform-minded alumni like Yale's Robert T. Eskridge are considering
novel ways to redirect their philanthropy. Mr. Eskridge wrote:
``We have been shocked when reading the <I>Light and Truth</I> publication,
and having recently arranged in our wills to leave most of our
estates to Yale and my wife's college, Beaver College, we feel
now that we would prefer to support an effort . . . to return
the education of future generations to its traditional moorings.''
Yale is out of the will, and the Eskridges have established a
trust to promote genuine higher learning.
<P>
The cost of Yale's behavior
is now estimated to be several times the original Bass gift of
$20 million. The principled stand of Lee Bass encouraged many
others to join a nationwide alumni movement committed to using
its financial muscle to restore the traditional foundations of
higher education. Already, alumni have organized for collective
action at Stanford (Winds of Freedom), Dartmouth (The Ernest Martin
Hopkins Institute), Yale (<I>Light and Truth</I>), Wellesley (Women for
Freedom), and Princeton (Princeton Alumni Viewpoints).
<P>
In countering
the agenda of the academic Left, these and other alumni efforts
will doubtless be accused of having a conservative agenda of their
own. If the impulse toward reform is indeed conservative, it is
the noble impulse to conserve the proper ends of an authentically
humane education.
<P>
From the earliest beginnings of Western culture,
the ends of education were those of Plato's Academy: wisdom and
virtue. If these ancient ends are to be rescued from the will
to power of campus politicians, all of us -- students, faculty,
trustees, donors, and alumni -- need to act with a sense of urgency.
As William F. Buckley Jr. stated in his landmark book God and
Man at Yale, ``If the present generation does not check the university's
ideological drive, the next generation most probably will not
want to.''

<p>
The House of Representatives returns to Washington on Wednesday, September 6 to face two grueling months of budget debate.  The public attention has been focused on Medicare, but there are also 13 appropriations bills, reconciliation, and the debt ceiling that all must be dealt with during this time period.  It is not at all certain how the debate will turn out, but it is safe to assume that everyone will be happy to put these months behind them.
<p>
<b>Medicare:</b>
<p>
The trustees of the Medicare Trust Fund -- including three members of President Clinton's Cabinet -- have predicted the imminent bankruptcy of this health care safety net for the elderly.  Despite this, many politicians and special interest groups have been fighting the efforts to keep Medicare solvent.  Among the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/govern/gip4.html">special interests</a> that have fought reform are several that feed at the public trough.  The House will have to cut through the scare tactics, roll up their sleeves, and find real solutions to the Medicare crisis.  The Heritage Foundation has contributed <a href="/heritage/library/index/i2.html">several useful studies</a> for Congress to consider in the debate.
<p>
<b>The Federal Budget:</b>
<p>
There is much speculation in Washington as to what will occur with the 13 spending bills that Congress must pass -- in theory -- before the start of the new fiscal year on October 1.  The President has issued several veto threats for some of the appropriations bills, and it is anticipated that there will be significant disagreements between the Congress and the President over what the nation's <a href="/heritage/library/index/a2.html">spending priorities</a> should be.  If a new law funding a particular agency is not in place by October 1, Congress must either pass a "continuing resolution" to permit it to remain open, or all but essential activities must be closed down.  It is likely that the Congress will send 13 bills to the President by the deadline, but delays in the bill becoming law may occur due to the give-and-take between the two branches of government.
<p>
<b>Reconciliation:</b>
<p>
"Reconciliation," although it is a fancy word, essentially describes the process by which Congress etches all aspects of the budget -- including taxes, appropriations, and entitlements -- in concrete.  It is through this process that the Congress hopes to reduce the tax burden on Americans, control entitlement spending, and enact a budget that will achieve balance by 2002.  The reconciliation process likely will not be completed until sometime in mid-October.
<p>
<b>Debt Ceiling:</b>
<p>
Since the federal government has repeatedly run up large deficits over the past 30 years, the Treasury Department must borrow money -- through bonds -- to finance the government's activities.  The government is limited by law as to how much money can be borrowed at any time.  A good way to think of this is like the credit limit on your credit cards.  This credit limit will be reached by the Treasury Department in October or November, so a new law must be enacted to permit further borrowing.  The key question in this debate will be how much to raise the limit by.  In the past, Congress has passed both long-term and short-term increases.  A number of freshman representatives have been quoted publicly as opposing any increase in the debt and this could be a significant factor in the debate.

<title>Heritage Exclusive -- Fall Agenda of the 104th Congress</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center><h3><i>Heritage Exclusive</i> -- The Fall Agenda of the 104th Congress -- Senate</h3>
By <a href="mailto:rennej@heritage.org">Jim Renne</a><br>
Congressional Relations<br> <a href="/heritage/welcome.html">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
September 5, 1995<br>
</center>
<p>
	Hello everyone!  Welcome to the Heritage Foundation on Town Hall.  This is a first for me.  I've never "surfed the Net" before, let alone go on-line with a U.S. Senate update.  But, there's a first for everything including my Internet Inaugural Exclusive.
<P>
	The last few months of this year's Congressional session will be one of the busiest times in Congressional history.  Not only will a balanced budget be passed for the first time since Nixon's first term, but major reform legislation such as welfare and Medicare will be stacked end to end waiting for consideration on the ever-deliberative Senate floor.
<P>
	As you may be aware, the Senate, unlike the House of Representatives, has a general rule: If a Senator wants to "debate" an issue, he can debate until the cows come home.  There is no limit on the amount of time a Member of the Senate can talk once he's been recognized, except maybe the call of nature.  This can result in delays of days, weeks, even years.  This is known as a filibuster.
<P>
	I don't know how familiar you are with Parliamentary Procedure, so I thought I'd briefly explain key  parliamentary differences between the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate; and explain why it's more difficult for the Majority Party in the Senate to get things through.  
<P>
	One of the major differences is that in the House, rules governing time-limit and number of amendments on a particular bill are put up for a vote for each separate bill.  That means a simple majority of House Members can control and set limits to debate. This allows the Majority Party to dictate the timeframe and subject matter of any given issue allowing the Speaker of the House to ram through legislation.
<P>
	In the Senate, floor action is controlled by Unanimous Consent ("UC") -- meaning technically, one Senator can bring crucial legislation to a stand still at any time.  Sometimes even a threat of a filibuster is enough to kill a bill depending on whether the Majority leader can afford the time and effort required to beat one back. On the overwhelming majority of legislation, however, the majority and minority leaders agree on the terms of debate and pass a UC decree in which every Senator agrees on the terms.  
<P>
	But in the case where one Senator objects to the UC, a bill can be delayed indefinitely with a filibuster.  In this case, the only safeguard against a total shut down is a Cloture Petition.  Passing a Cloture Petition requires a vote of 3/5th of the Senate or 60 out of 100.  If Cloture is invoked, debate is automatically limited to 30 additional hours whereupon the bill will be immediately moved to a final vote. Thus, after Cloture has been invoked, a bill can pass with only 51 or a simple majority, where it took 60 to force the final vote.  Given the number of controversial bills coming before the Senate over these next few months, look for most if not all of the major issues to require 60 out of 100 votes instead of the usual simple majority of 51.  
<P>
	Having explained a little parliamentary procedure, I'll give a brief run down on what to expect in the Senate for the next few months.  
<P>
	The Senate reconvenes Tuesday, September 5, 1995, to begin the final lap of this marathon legislative session.  Look for the following issues to become prominent during the remainder of the session.<p>

<b>Welfare:</b><p>
The Senate has been the center of intrigue and Presidential politics over the last few months when it comes to welfare reform.  GOP Presidential candidates Bob Dole and Phil Gramm have been battling over whose welfare provisions will reign supreme.  Heritage's welfare expert <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a> has written extensively on the subject and has been called upon to provide technical assistance to a powerful group of conservative Senators seeking to turn the tepid approach coming out of the Senate Finance Committee into bold, sweeping reform.  Heritage's <a href="/heritage/library/index/i5.html">reform proposals</a> will go a long way in addressing the critical ailments of the current system.  Already, the initial Senate version of the welfare reform bill has been strengthened by the inclusion of key Heritage proposals.  Some of Heritage's key provisions include measures to strengthen work requirements for recipients, reduce and discourage <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/cbrief18.html">illegitimacy</a>, and stop welfare abuse by illegal immigrants.  Look for a welfare reform showdown between Congress' real reforms and the Clinton Administration's status-quo approach.
<p>
<b>Medicare:</b>
<P>
Medicare reform legislation is another highly contentious issue making its way through the halls of Congress.  Again, Heritage Foundation proposals to save billions of tax-payer dollars while providing fair, more efficient medical service are at the center of the debate.  Domestic Policy Studies Director <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm">Dr. Stuart Butler</a> and Health Care Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/liu.htm">John Liu</a> have written several papers providing a <a href="/heritage/library/index/i2.html">blueprint</a> on how to save billions while giving recipients increased options and  more control over their benefits.  At the same time, these reforms will drastically reduce government bureaucracy.  The sweeping proposal is based on a novel idea: allowing beneficiaries to take advantage of the best health care system in the entire world -- the American private sector health industry.  Liberals are sure to shamelessly demagogue the issue, but a reform package will be passed.  The system is too close to bankruptcy to continue along its current path.
<p>
<b>Budget Reconciliation:</b>
<p>
By far the most tangible and contentious legislative confrontation to come will be the massive budget-balancing proposal known as the budget reconciliation process.  Budget reconciliation is an extremely complex process by which the House and Senate enact into law major budgetary reform legislation giving the U.S. Treasury authority to spend your tax money.  The usual formula by which Congress approves its yearly budgets includes two main components, Authorization and Appropriations.  Without both, taxpayer dollars cannot be spent.  However, when Congress finds itself deep in the red as it finds itself this year after forty years of liberal control, it must quickly and efficiently pass legislation to exact meaningful spending cuts.  The normal process is too convoluted to handle such sweeping change. Thus, Congress has created a hybrid process known as reconciliation as a way to exact savings out entitlement and other programs.  Since these programs are highly contentious and difficult for the authorizers to reconcile, Congress created a process by which the deficit hawks on the Budget Committee would provide authorizers with spending limits which can't be exceeded.  Then it's up to the numerous committees of jurisdiction to make the necessary changes to meet the numbers.  The reconciliation process also provides the added advantage of putting the budget balancing bill on a fast track for floor consideration.  This avoids potential filibuster delays and a host of other hurdles.  
<p>
This year's budget process is even more contentious than most.  Holdover liberals from the big-taxing, big-spending Congresses of old are teaming up with the decidedly leftist Clinton Administration in a bitter fight to preserve the gargantuan welfare state.  And, for the first time in decades, a newly elected conservative Congress will actually vote on a monumental bill which will wipe out the entire federal deficit by the year 2002.  Because such a goal is so novel in Congress -- an encouraging sign of the newly elected conservative majority's will to lead -- budget reconciliation is taking on a truly revolutionary aura.  Look for a major confrontation between Congress and the Clinton Administration and a temporary shut down of non-essential government services during October, maybe even lasting into November.  Also, expect to see the welfare and Medicare bills pushed into the Reconciliation process because of gridlock in the normal authorization process.
<P>
<b>Debt Limit:</b>
<P>
Probably the most crucial issue to come before the Congress prior to the end of this session will be the annual debt ceiling bill.  For decades, the liberals in Congress nonchalantly raised the credit limit on America's national credit card by billions of dollars without as much as a blink of an eye.  The debt limit is the ultimate hammer on deficit spending.  If it is not raised, all government spending is immediately halted.  This would be a calamity beyond compare for both Congress and the President.  Thus, the new conservative leadership plans to attach sweeping spending cuts to this bill in order to force the big spending Clinton Administration to change its ways and make real cuts.  Look for the White House to seek a compromise early by accepting many of the spending cuts (and trying to take credit for them, too) in exchange for a debt limit increase.
<P>
I hope this information is interesting and informative to you all.  Please <a href="mailto:rennej@heritage.org">contact me</a> if you have any questions or comments.  Enjoy the rest of this Congressional Session!!

<center><h3>HOW OUR LAWS ARE MADE</h3></center><p>

I. <a name="introduction"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></a><p>

This handbook is intended to provide a readable and 
nontechnical outline of the background and the numerous steps 
of our Federal lawmaking process from the origin of an idea 
for a legislative proposal through its publication as a 
statute. This is a matter about which every citizen should be 
well informed so as to be able to understand the everyday 
news reports and discussions concerning the work of Congress.<p>

 It is hoped that this handbook will enable every citizen to 
gain a greater understanding of the Federal legislative 
process and its role as one of the bulwarks of our 
representative system. One of the most practical safeguards 
of the American democratic way of life is this legislative 
process that, with its emphasis on the protection of the 
minority, gives ample opportunity to all sides to be heard 
and make their views known. The fact that a proposal cannot 
become a law without consideration and approval by both 
Houses of Congress is an outstanding virtue of our 
legislative system. Open and full discussion provided for 
under our Con stitution frequently results in the notable 
improvement of a bill by amendment before it becomes law, or 
the defeat of a bad  proposal.<p>

 Because the large majority of laws originate in the House of 
Representatives, this discussion will be directed principally 
to the procedure in that body.<p>

 
 II. <a name="congress"> <b>THE CONGRESS</b></a><p>

Article I, Section 1, of the United States Constitution, 
provides that--<p>

 All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a 
Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a 
Senate and House of Representatives.

 The Senate is composed of 100 Members--2 from each State, 
irrespective of population or area--elected by the people in 
conformity with the provisions of the 17th Amendment to the 
Constitution. That amendment changed the former 
Constitutional method under which Senators were chosen by the 
respective State legislatures. A Senator must be at least 30 
years of age, have been a citizen of the United States for 9 
years, and, when elected, be a resident of the State for 
which the Senator is chosen. The term of office is 6 years 
and one-third of the total membership of the Senate is 
elected every second year. The terms of both Senators from a 
particular State are so arranged that they do not terminate 
at the same time. Of the 2 Senators from a State serving at 
the same time the one who was elected first--or if both were 
elected at the same time, the one elected for a full term--is 
referred to as the "senior" Senator from that State. The 
other is referred to as the "junior" Senator. If a Senator 
dies or resigns during the term, the governor of the State 
must call a special election unless the State legislature has 
authorized the governor to appoint a successor until the next 
election, at which time a successor is elected for the 
balance of the term. Most of the State legislatures have 
granted their governors the power of appointment.<p>

Each Senator has one vote.<p>

 As constituted in 1989--the 101st Congress--the House of 
Representatives is composed of 435 Members elected every 2 
years from among the 50 States, apportioned to their total 
populations. The permanent number of 435 was established 
following the Thirteenth Decennial Census in 1910, as 
directed in Article I, Section 2, of the Constitution, and 
was increased temporarily to 437 for the 87th Congress, to 
provide for one Representative each for Alaska and Hawaii. It 
seems undesirable to make a considerable increase in the 
number of Members, because a larger body, similar to the 
British House of Commons, consisting of 650 members, would be 
too unwieldy. The Constitution limits the number of 
Representatives to not more than one for every 30,000 of 
population, and, under a former apportionment in one State a 
particular Representative represented more than 900,000 
constituents, while another in the same State was elected 
from a district having a population of only 175,000. The 
Supreme Court * has since held unconstitutional a Missouri 
statute permitting a maximum population variance of 3.1 
percent from mathematical equality. The Court said that the 
variances among the districts were not unavoidable and, 
therefore, were invalid. This is an interpretation of the 
Court's earlier decision that "as nearly as is practicable 
one man's vote in a Congressional election is to be worth as 
much as another's".<p>

 * Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, 394 U.S. 526 (1969).<p>

 A law enacted in 1967 abolished all "at-large" elections 
(that is, Representatives elected by the voters of the entire 
State rather than in a Congressional district within the 
State) except, of course, in States entitled to only one 
Representative.<p>

 A Representative must be at least 25 years of age, have been 
a citizen of the United States for 7 years, and, when 
elected, be a resident of the State in which the 
Representative is chosen. If a Representative dies or resigns 
during the term, the governor of the State must call a 
special election for the choosing of a successor to serve for 
the unexpired portion of the term.<p>

Each Representative has one vote.<p>

In addition to the Representatives from each of the States, 
there is a Resident Commissioner from the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico and Delegates from the District of Columbia, 
American Samoa, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. The Resident 
Commissioner and the Delegates have most of the prerogatives 
of Representatives, with the important exception of the right 
to vote on matters before the House.<p>

Under the provisions of Section 2 of the 20th Amendment to 
the Constitution, Congress must assemble at least once every 
year, at noon on the 3d day of January, unless by law they 
appoint a different day.<p>

 A Congress lasts for 2 years, commencing in January of the 
year following the biennial election of Members, and is 
divided into 2 sessions.<p>

 Unlike some other parliamentary bodies, both the Senate and 
the House of Representatives have equal legislative functions 
and powers (except that only the House of Representatives may 
initiate revenue bills), and the designation of one as the 
"upper" House and the other as the "lower" House is not 
appropriate.<p>

 The Constitution authorizes each House to determine the 
rules of its proceedings. Pursuant to that authority the 
House of Representatives adopts its rules on the opening day 
of each Congress. The Senate, which considers itself a 
continuing body, operates under standing rules that it amends 
from time to time.<p>

 The chief function of Congress is the making of laws. In 
addition, the Senate has the function of advising and 
consenting to treaties and to certain nominations by the 
President. In the matter of impeachments, the House of 
Representatives presents the charges--a function similar to 
that of a grand jury--and the Senate sits as a court to try 
the impeachment. Both Houses meet in joint session on the 6th 
day of January, following a presidential election, to count 
the electoral votes. If no candidate receives a majority of 
the total electoral votes, the House of Representatives 
chooses the President from among the 3 candidates having the 
largest number of votes, and the Senate chooses the Vice 
President from the 2 candidates having the largest number of 
votes for that office.<p>

 
 III. <a name="legislation"><b>SOURCES OF LEGISLATION</b></a><p>

 Sources of ideas for legislation are unlimited, and 
proposed drafts of bills originate in many diverse quarters. 
First of these is, of course, the idea and draft conceived by 
a Member. This may emanate from the election campaign during 
which the Member had promised to introduce legislation on a 
particular subject, if elected. The entire campaign may have 
been based upon one or more such proposals. Or, through 
experience after taking office the Member may have become 
aware of the need for amendment or repeal of existing laws or 
the enactment of a statute in an entirely new field.<p>

 In addition, the Member's constituents--either as 
individuals or by corporate activity such as citizen groups 
or associations, bar associations, labor unions, 
manufacturers' associations, and chambers of commerce--may 
avail themselves of the right to petition, which is 
guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution, and 
transmit their proposals to the Member. Many excellent laws 
have originated in this way inasmuch as some of those 
organizations, because of their vital concern with various 
areas of legislation, have considerable knowledge regarding 
the laws affecting their interests and have the services of 
expert legislative draftsmen at their disposal for this 
purpose. If favorably impressed by the idea, the Member may 
introduce the proposal in the form in which it has been 
submitted or may first redraft it. In all events, the Member 
may consult with the Legislative Counsel of the House or the 
Senate, as the case may be, to frame the ideas in suitable 
legislative language and form for introduction.<p>

 In modern times the "executive communication" has become a 
prolific source of legislative proposals. This is usually in 
the form of a letter from a member of the President's Cabinet 
or the head of an independent agency--or even from the 
President--transmitting a draft of a proposed bill to the 
Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of 
the Senate. Despite the system of separation of powers, 
Article II, Section 3, of the Constitution imposes an 
obligation on the President to report to Congress from time 
to time on the "State of the Union" and to recommend for 
consideration such measures as the President considers 
necessary and expedient. Many of these executive 
communications follow on the President's message to Congress 
on the State of the Union. The communication is then referred 
to the standing committee having jurisdiction of the subject 
matter embraced in the proposal because a bill may be 
introduced only by a Member of Congress. The Chairman of that 
committee usually introduces the bill promptly either in the 
form in which it was received or with changes the Chairman 
considers necessary or desirable. This practice prevails even 
when the majority of the House and the President are not of 
the same political party, although there is no constitutional 
or statutory requirement that a bill be introduced to 
effectuate the recommendations. Otherwise, the message may be 
considered by the committee or one of its subcommittees to 
determine whether a bill should be introduced. The most 
important of the regular executive communications is the 
annual message from the President transmitting the proposed 
budget to Congress. This, together with testimony by 
officials of the various branches of the Government before 
the Appropriations Committees of the House and Senate, is the 
basis of the several appropriation bills that are drafted by 
the Committee on Appropriations of the House.<p>

 Several of the executive departments and independent 
agencies have staffs of trained legislative counsels whose 
functions include the drafting of bills to be forwarded to 
Congress with a request for their enactment.<p>

 The drafting of statutes is an art that requires great 
skill, knowledge, and experience. In some instances a draft 
is the result of a study covering a period of a year or more 
by a commission or committee designated by the President or 
one of the Cabinet officers. The Administrative Procedure Act 
and the Uniform Code of Military Justice are only 2 of many 
examples of enactments resulting from such studies. In 
addition, Congressional committees sometimes draft bills 
after studies and hearings covering periods of a year or 
more. Bills to codify the laws relating to crimes and 
criminal procedure, the judiciary and judicial procedure, the 
armed forces, and other subjects, have each required several 
years of preparation.<p>

 
 IV. <a name="Action"><b> FORMS OF CONGRESSIONAL ACTION</b></a><p>

The work of Congress is initiated by the introduction of a 
proposal in one of 4 principal forms. These are: the bill, 
the joint resolution, the concurrent resolution, and the 
simple resolution. By far the most customary form used in 
both Houses is the bill. During the 100th Congress (1987 
-1988), there were introduced in both Houses, 8,515 bills and 
1,073 joint resolutions. Of this number 5,585 bills and 678 
joint resolutions originated in the House of Representatives.<p>

 For the sake of simplicity this discussion will be confined 
generally to the procedure on a House of Representatives 
bill, but a brief comment will be made about each of the 
forms.<p>

<b> BILLS</b><p>

 A bill is the form used for most legislation, whether 
permanent or temporary, general or special, public or 
private.<p>

 The form of a House bill is as follows:<p>
<center>
                    A BILL<br
<br>
<br
 For the establishment, etc. 
            [as the title may be].<p>
</center>
 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
the United States of America in Congress assembled, That, 
etc.<p>

 The enacting clause was prescribed by law in 1871 and is 
identical in all bills, whether they originate in the House 
of Representatives or in the Senate.<p>

 Bills may originate in either the House of Representatives 
or the Senate, with one notable exception provided for by the 
Constitution. Article I, Section 7, of the Constitution, 
provides that all bills for raising revenue shall originate 
in the House of Representatives but the Senate may propose or 
concur with amendments, as on other bills. General 
appropriation bills also originate in the House of 
Representatives.<p>

 There are 2 types of bills--public and private. A public 
bill is one that affects the public generally. A bill of a 
private character, that is, a bill that affects an individual 
rather than the population at large, is called a private 
bill. A private bill is used for relief in matters such as 
immigration and naturalization and claims by or against the 
United States.<p>

 Article I, Section 8, prescribes the matters concerning 
which Congress may legislate, while Section 9 of the same 
Article places certain limitations on Congressional action.<p>

 A bill originating in the House of Representatives is 
designated by the letters "H.R." followed by a number that it 
retains throughout all its parliamentary stages. The letters 
signify "House of Representatives" and not, as is sometimes 
supposed, "House resolution". A Senate bill is designated by 
the letter "S." followed by its number. The term "companion 
bill" is used to describe a bill introduced in one House of 
Congress that is similar or identical to a bill introduced in 
the other House of Congress. <p>

 A bill that has been agreed to in identical form by both 
bodies becomes the law of the land only after--<p>

 (1) Presidential approval; or<p>

 (2) failure by the President to return it with objections to 
the House in which it originated within 10 days while 
Congress is in session; or<p>

 (3) the overriding of a Presidential veto by a two-thirds 
vote in each House.<p>

 It does not become law without the President's signature if 
Congress by their adjournment prevent its return with 
objections. This is known as a "pocket veto".<p>

<b> JOINT RESOLUTIONS</b><p>

 Joint resolutions may originate either in the House of 
Representatives or in the Senate--not, as may be supposed, 
jointly in both Houses. There is little practical difference 
between a bill and a joint resolution and, although the 
latter are not as numerous as bills, the 2 forms are often 
used indiscriminately. Statutes that have been initiated as 
bills have later been amended by a joint resolution, and vice 
versa. Both are subject to the same procedure--with the 
exception of a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the 
Constitution. When a joint resolution amending the 
Constitution is approved by two-thirds of both Houses, it is 
sent directly to the Archivist of the United States for 
submission to the several States for ratification. It is not 
presented to the President for approval.<p>

 The form of a House joint resolution is as follows:<p>
<center>
                 JOINT RESOLUTION<br>
<br>
<br
Authorizing, etc. [as the title may be].<p>
</center>

   Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives
   of the United States of America in Congress assembled,
   That all, etc.<p>

 The resolving clause is identical in both House and Senate 
joint resolutions, having been prescribed by statute in 1871. 
It is frequently preceded by one or more "whereas" clauses 
indicating the necessity for or the desirability of the joint 
resolution.<p>

 The term "joint" does not signify simultaneous introduction 
and consideration in both Houses.<p>

 A joint resolution originating in the House of 
Representatives is designated "H.J. Res." followed by its 
individual number which it retains throughout all its 
parliamentary stages. One originating in the Senate is 
designated "S.J. Res." followed by its number.<p>

 Joint resolutions become law in the same manner as bills.<p>

<b> CONCURRENT RESOLUTIONS</b><p>

 Matters affecting the operations of both Houses are usually 
initiated by means of concurrent resolutions. In modern 
practice, these normally are not legislative in character but 
are used merely for expressing facts, principles, opinions, 
and purposes of the 2 Houses. They are not equivalent to a 
bill and their use is narrowly limited within these bounds.<p>

 The term "concurrent" does not signify simultaneous 
introduction and consideration in both Houses.<p>

 A concurrent resolution originating in the House of 
Representatives is designated "H. Con. Res." followed by its 
individual number, while a Senate concurrent resolution is 
designated "S. Con. Res." together with its number. On 
approval by both Houses, they are signed by the Clerk of the 
House and the Secretary of the Senate and transmitted to the 
Archivist of the United States for publication in a special 
part of the Statutes at Large volume covering that session of 
Congress. They are not presented to the President for action 
as in the cases of bills and joint resolutions unless they 
contain a proposition of legislation, and that, of course, is 
not within their scope in their modern form.<p>

<b> SIMPLE RESOLUTIONS</b><p>

 A matter concerning the operation of either House alone is 
initiated by a simple resolution. A resolution affecting the 
House of Representatives is designated "H. Res." followed by 
its number, while a Senate resolution is designated "S. Res." 
together with its number. They are considered only by the 
body in which they were introduced and on adoption are 
attested to by the Clerk of the House of Representatives or 
the Secretary of the Senate, as the case may be, and are 
published in the Congressional Record.<p>

 
 V. <a name="reference"><b>INTRODUCTION AND REFERENCE TO COMMITTEE</b></a><p>

  Any Member, the Resident Commissioner, and the Delegates in 
the House of Representatives may introduce a bill at any time 
while the House is actually sitting by simply placing it in 
the "hopper" provided for the purpose at the side of the 
Clerk's desk in the House Chamber. Permission is not required 
to introduce the measure or to make a statement at the time 
of introduction. Printed blank forms for use in typing the 
original bill are supplied through the Clerk's office. The 
name of the sponsor is endorsed on the bill. A public bill 
may be sponsored by an unlimited number of Members. On 
request, a Member may be added as a sponsor no later than the 
day the bill is reported to the House. (For a discussion of 
"Reported bills", see Part VII.) In addition, a Member listed 
as a sponsor (other than the first sponsor) may have the 
Member's name deleted as a sponsor no later than the day the 
bill is reported to the House. To forestall the possibility 
that a bill might be introduced in the House on behalf of a 
Member without that Member's prior approval, the sponsoring 
Member's signature must appear on the bill before it is 
accepted for introduction. When there are multiple sponsors 
of a bill, the signature must be that of the Member first 
named thereon. In the Senate, unlimited multiple sponsorship 
of a bill also is permitted. Occasionally, a Member may 
insert the words "by request" after the Member's name to 
indicate that the introduction of the measure is in 
compliance with the suggestion of some other person.<p>

 In the Senate, a Senator usually introduces a bill or 
resolution by presenting it to one of the clerks at the 
Presiding Officer's desk, without commenting on it from the 
floor of the Senate. However, a Senator may use a more formal 
procedure by rising and introducing the bill or resolution 
from the floor. A Senator usually makes a statement about the 
measure when introducing it on the floor. Frequently, 
Senators obtain consent to have the bill or resolution 
printed in the body of the Congressional Record, following 
their formal statement.<p>

 If any Senator objects to the introduction of a bill or 
resolution, the introduction of the bill or resolution is 
postponed until the next day. If there is no objection, the 
bill is read by title and referred to the appropriate 
committee.<p>

 In the House of Representatives it is no longer the custom 
to read bills--even by title--at the time of introduction. 
The title is entered in the Journal and printed in the 
Congressional Record, thus preserving the purpose of the old 
rule. The bill is assigned its legislative number by the 
Clerk and referred to the appropriate committees by the 
Speaker (the Member elected to be the Presiding Officer of 
the House) with the assistance of the Parliamentarian. These 
details appear in the daily issue of the Congressional 
Record. It is then sent to the Government Printing Office 
where it is printed in its introduced form, and printed 
copies are available shortly thereafter in the document rooms 
of both Houses. <p>

 One copy is sent to the office of the Chairman of the 
committee to which it has been referred, for action by that 
committee. The clerk of the committee enters it on the 
committee's Legislative Calendar.<p>

 Perhaps the most important phase of the Congressional 
process is the action by committees. That is where the most 
intensive consideration is given to the proposed measures and 
where the people are given their opportunity to be heard. 
Nevertheless, this phase where such a tremendous volume of 
hard work is done by the Members is sometimes overlooked by 
the public, particularly when complaining about delays in 
enacting laws. There are, at present, 22 standing committees 
in the House and 16 in the Senate, as well as several select 
committees. In addition, there are several standing joint 
committees of the 2 Houses.<p>

 Each committee has jurisdiction over certain subject matters 
of legislation and all measures affecting a particular area 
of the law are referred to that committee that has 
jurisdiction over it. For example, the Committee on the 
Judiciary has jurisdiction over measures relating to judicial 
proceedings (civil and criminal) generally, and 18 other 
categories, of which Constitutional amendments, immigration 
and naturalization, bankruptcy, revision and codification of 
statutes, civil liberties, antitrust, patents, copyrights and 
trademarks, are but a few. In all, the rules of the House and 
of the Senate each provide for approximately 200 different 
classifications of measures that are to be referred to 
committees.<p>

 Membership on the various committees is divided between the 
2 major political parties. The proportion of the Members of 
the minority party to the Members of the majority party is 
determined by the majority party, except that one-half of the 
Members on the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct are 
from the majority party and one-half from the minority party. 
The respective party caucuses nominate Members of the caucus 
to be elected to each standing committee at the beginning of 
each Congress. Membership on a standing committee during the 
course of a Congress is contingent on continuing membership 
in the caucus that nominated the Member for election to the 
committee. If the Member ceases to be a Member of the caucus, 
the Member automatically ceases to be a Member of the 
standing committee.<p>

 A Member may serve on more than one committee. However, the 
rules of the caucus of the majority party in the House 
provide that the Chairmen of certain committees may not serve 
on another committee and that a Member may be Chairman of 
only one subcommittee of a committee or select committee with 
legislative jurisdiction, excepting certain committees 
performing housekeeping functions and joint committees.<p>

 A Member usually seeks election to the committee that has 
jurisdiction over a field in which the Member is most 
qualified and interested. For example, the Committee on the 
Judiciary traditionally is composed entirely of lawyers. Many 
Members are nationally recognized experts in the specialty of 
their particular committee or subcommittee.<p>

 Members rank in seniority in accordance with the order of 
their appointment to the committee, and usually the ranking 
majority Member is elected Chairman. The rules of the House 
require that committee Chairmen be elected from nominations 
submitted by the majority party caucus at the commencement of 
each Congress.<p>

 Most committees have 2 or more subcommittees that, in 
addition to having general jurisdiction, specialize in the 
consideration of particular classifications of bills. Each 
standing committee of the House, except the Committee on the 
Budget, that has more than 20 Members must establish at least 
4 subcommittees.<p>

 Each committee is provided with a professional and clerical 
staff to assist it in the innumerable administrative details 
and other problems involved in the consideration of bills. 
For the standing committees, the professional staff 
(consisting of not more than 18, 6 of whom may be selected by 
the minority) is appointed on a permanent basis solely on the 
basis of fitness to perform the duties of their respective 
positions. The clerical staff (consisting of not more than 
12, 4 of whom may be selected by the minority) is appointed 
to handle correspondence and stenographic work for the 
committee staff and the Chairman and ranking minority Member 
on matters related to committee work. All staff appointments 
are made by a majority vote of the committee without regard 
to race, creed, sex, or age. The minority staff provisions do 
not apply to the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct 
because of its bipartisan nature. The Committee on 
Appropriations and the Committee on the Budget have special 
authority under the rules of the House for appointment of 
staff and assistants for the minority.<p>

 Under certain conditions, a standing committee may appoint 
consultants on a temporary or intermittent basis and also may 
provide financial assistance to members of its professional 
staff for the purpose of acquiring specialized training, 
whenever the committee determines that such training will aid 
the committee in the discharge of its responsibilities.<p>

 
 VI. <a name="committee"><b> CONSIDERATION BY COMMITTEE</b></a><p>

The rules adopted by the caucus of the majority party in 
the House provide that the Chairman of the committee to which 
a bill has been referred must refer the bill to the 
appropriate subcommittee within 2 weeks, unless a majority of 
the Members of the majority party on the committee vote to 
have the bill considered by the full committee. One of the 
first actions taken is the transmittal of copies of the bill 
to the departments and agencies concerned with the subject 
matter and frequently to the General Accounting Office with a 
request for an official report of views on the necessity or 
desirability of enacting the bill into law. Ample time is 
given for the submission of the reports and when received 
they are accorded serious consideration but are not binding 
on the committee in determining whether or not to act 
favorably on the bill. Reports of the departments and 
agencies in the executive branch are submitted first to the 
Office of Management and Budget to determine whether they are 
consistent with the program of the President.<p>

 <b>COMMITTEE MEETINGS</b><p>

 Standing committees are required to have regular meeting 
days at least once a month, but the Chairman may call and 
convene additional meetings. Three or more Members of a 
standing committee may file with the committee a written 
request that the Chairman call a special meeting. The request 
must specify the measure or matter to be considered. If the 
Chairman fails, within 3 calendar days after the filing of 
the request, to call the requested special meeting, to be 
held within 7 calendar days after the filing of the request, 
a majority of the Members of the committee may call the 
special meeting by filing with the committee written notice 
specifying the time and date of the meeting and the measure 
or matter to be considered.<p>

 With the exception of the Committees on Appropriations, on 
the Budget, on Rules, on Standards of Official Conduct, on 
Ways and Means, and on House Administration, committees may 
not, without special permission, meet while the House is 
reading a measure for amendment under the "five-minute rule". 
(See first paragraph under heading "Second Reading" in Part 
XI.) Special permission to meet will be given unless 10 or 
more Members object. The rules of the House also provide that 
House committees may not meet during a joint session of the 
House and Senate or during a recess when a joint meeting of 
the House and Senate is in progress. Committees may meet at 
other times during a recess up to the expiration of the 
constitutional term.<p>

 <b>PUBLIC HEARINGS</b><p>

 If the bill is of sufficient importance, and particularly if 
it is controversial, the committee will usually set a date 
for public hearings. Each committee (except the Committee on 
Rules) is required to make public announcement of the date, 
place, and subject matter of any hearing to be conducted by 
the committee on any measure or matter at least one week 
before the commencement of that hearing, unless the committee 
determines that there is good cause to begin the hearing at 
an earlier date. If the committee makes that determination, 
it must make a public announcement to that effect at the 
earliest possible date. Public announcements are published in 
the Daily Digest portion of the Congressional Record as soon 
as possible after the announcement is made by the committee, 
and are often noted in news papers and periodicals. Personal 
notice, usually in the form of a letter, but possibly in the 
form of a subpena, is sent frequently to individuals, 
organizations, and Government departments and agencies that 
are known to be interested.<p>

 Each hearing by a committee and subcommittee is required to 
be open to the public except when the committee or 
subcommittee, in open session and with a majority present, 
determines by rollcall vote that all or part of the remainder 
of the hearing on that day shall be closed to the public 
because disclosure of testimony, evidence, or other matters 
to be considered would endanger the national security or 
would violate a law or a rule of the House. The committee or 
subcommittee by the same procedure may vote to close one 
subsequent day of hearing, except that the Committees on 
Appropriations and on Armed Services and the Permanent Select 
Committee on Intelligence, and subcommittees of those 
committees, by the same procedure may vote to close up to 5 
additional consecutive days of hearings. When a quorum for 
taking testimony is present, a majority of the Members 
present may close a hearing to discuss whether the evidence 
or testimony to be received would endanger national security 
or would tend to defame, degrade, or incriminate any person.<p>

 Hearings on the budget are required to be held by the 
Committee on Appropriations in open session within 30 days 
after its transmittal to Congress, except when the Committee, 
in open session and with a quorum present, determines by 
rollcall vote that the testimony to be taken at that hearing 
on that day may be related to a matter of national security. 
The Committee may by the same procedure close one subsequent 
day of hearing.<p>

 On the day set for the public hearing an official reporter 
is present to record the testimony in favor of and against 
the bill. The bill may be read in full at the opening of the 
hearings and a copy is inserted in the record. After a brief 
introductory statement by the Chairman and often by the 
ranking minority Member or other committee Member, the first 
witness is called. Members or Senators who wish to be heard 
are given preference out of courtesy and because of the 
limitations on their time. Cabinet officers and high-ranking 
civil and military officials of the Government, as well as 
interested private individuals, testify either voluntarily or 
at the request or summons of the committee.<p>

 Committees require, so far as practicable, that witnesses 
who appear before it file with the committee, in advance of 
their appearance, a written statement of their proposed 
testimony and limit their oral presentations to a brief 
summary of their arguments.<p>

 Minority party Members of the committee are entitled to call 
witnesses of their own to testify on a measure during at 
least one day of the hearing.<p>

 All committee rules in the House must provide that each 
Member shall have only 5 minutes in the interrogation of 
witnesses until each Member of the committee who desires to 
question a witness has had an opportunity to do so.<p>

 A typewritten transcript of the testimony taken at a public 
hearing is made available for inspection in the office of the 
clerk of the committee and frequently the complete transcript 
is printed and distributed widely by the committee.<p>

<b> BUSINESS MEETINGS</b><p>

 After hearings are completed, the subcommittee usually will 
consider the bill in a session that is popularly known as the 
"markup" session. The views of both sides are studied in 
detail and at the conclusion of deliberation a vote is taken 
to determine the action of the subcommittee. It may decide to 
report the bill favorably to the full committee, with or 
without amendment, or unfavorably, or suggest that the 
committee "table" it, that is, postpone action indefinitely. 
Each Member of the subcommittee, regardless of party 
affiliation, has one vote.<p>

 All meetings for the transaction of business, including the 
markup of legislation, of standing committees or 
subcommittees must be open to the public except when the 
committee or subcommittee, in open session with a majority 
present, determines by rollcall vote that all or part of the 
remainder of the meeting on that day shall be closed to the 
public. This requirement does not apply to any meeting that 
relates solely to internal budget or personnel matters. 
Members of the committee may authorize congressional staff 
and departmental representatives to be present at any 
business or markup session that has been closed to the 
public.<p>

<b> COMMITTEE ACTION</b><p>

 At committee meetings reports on bills may be made by 
subcommittees. Reports are fully discussed and amendments may 
be offered. Committee amendments are only proposals to change 
the bill as introduced and are subject to acceptance or 
rejection by the House itself. A vote of committee Members is 
taken to determine whether the full committee will report 
favorably or "table" the bill. If the committee votes to 
report the bill favorably to the House, it may report the 
bill with or without amendments or report a "clean bill". If 
the committee has approved extensive amendments, the 
committee may decide to report a new bill incorporating those 
amendments, commonly known as a "clean bill". The new bill is 
introduced (usually by the Chairman of the committee), and, 
after referral back to the committee, is reported favorably 
to the House by the committee. Because tabling a bill 
normally is effective in preventing action on it, adverse 
reports to the House by the full committee ordinarily are not 
made. On rare occasions, a committee may report a bill 
without recommendation or unfavorably.<p>

 Generally, a majority of the committee constitutes a quorum, 
the number of Members who must be present in order for the 
committee to act. This ensures adequate participation by both 
sides in the action taken. However, a committee may vary the 
number of Members necessary for a quorum for certain actions. 
For example, a committee may fix the number of its Members, 
but not less than 2, necessary for a quorum for taking 
testimony and receiving evidence. Except for the Committees 
on Appropriations, on the Budget, and on Ways and Means, a 
committee may fix the number of its Members, but not less 
than one-third, necessary for a quorum for taking certain 
other actions. The absence of a quorum is the subject of a 
point of order--that is, an objection that the proceedings 
are out of order--that is, that the required number of 
Members is not present.<p>

<b> PUBLIC INSPECTION OF RESULTS OF ROLLCALL VOTE IN COMMITTEE</b><p>

 The result of each rollcall vote in any meeting of a 
committee must be made available by that committee for 
inspection by the public at reasonable times in the offices 
of that committee. Information available for public 
inspection includes (1) a description of each amendment, 
motion, order, or other proposition, (2) the name of each 
Member voting for and each Member voting against the 
amendment, motion, order, or proposition, and whether by 
proxy or in person, and (3) the names of those Members 
present but not voting.<p>

 With respect to each rollcall vote by a committee on a 
motion to report a bill or resolution of a public character, 
the total number of votes cast for, and the total number of 
votes cast against, the reporting of the bill or resolution 
must be included in the committee report.<p>

<b> PROXY VOTING</b><p>
 A vote by a Member of a committee with respect to a measure 
or other matter may not be cast by proxy unless that 
committee adopts a written rule that permits voting by proxy 
and requires that the proxy authorization (1) be in writing, 
(2) assert that the Member is absent on official business or 
is otherwise unable to be present at the meeting of the 
committee, (3) designate the person who is to execute the 
proxy authorization, and (4) be limited to a specific measure 
or matter and any amendments or motions pertaining to the 
measure or matter. A Member may authorize a general proxy 
only for motions to recess, adjourn or other procedural 
matters. A proxy must be signed by the Member and must 
contain the date and time of day that it is signed. A proxy 
may not be counted for a quorum.<p>

 <b>POINTS OF ORDER WITH RESPECT TO COMMITTEE PROCEDURE</b><p>

 A point of order does not lie with respect to a measure 
reported by a committee on the ground that hearings on the 
measure were not conducted in accordance with required 
committee procedure. However, certain points of order may be 
made by a Member of the committee which reported the measure 
if, in the committee, that point of order was (1) timely made 
and (2) improperly overruled or not properly considered.<p>

<b> BROADCASTING COMMITTEE HEARINGS AND MEETINGS</b><p>

 It is permissible to cover open committee hearings and 
meetings in the House by television, radio, and still 
photography. This permission is granted under well defined 
conditions as provided in the rules of the House. Similarly, 
the rules of the Senate permit broadcasting of open hearings 
of a Senate committee under such rules as the committee may 
adopt.<p>

 
 VII. <a name="reported bills"><b>REPORTED BILLS</b></a><p>

  If the committee votes to report the bill favorably to the 
House, one of the Members is designated to write the 
committee report. The report describes the purpose and scope 
of the bill and the reasons for its recommended approval. 
Generally, a section-by-section analysis is set forth in 
detail explaining precisely what each section is intended to 
accomplish. All changes in existing law must be indicated in 
the report and the text of laws being repealed must be set 
out. This requirement is known as the "Ramseyer" rule; a 
similar rule in the Senate is known as the "Cordon" rule. 
Committee amendments also must be set out at the beginning of 
the report and explanations of them are included. Executive 
communications regarding the bill usually are quoted in full.<p>

 If at the time of approval of a bill by a committee (except 
the Committee on Rules) a Member of the committee gives 
notice of an intention to file supplemental, minority, or 
additional views, that Member is entitled to not less than 3 
calendar days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal 
holidays) in which to file those views with the clerk of the 
committee and they must be included in the report on the 
bill. Committee reports, with certain exceptions, must be 
filed while the House actually is sitting unless unanimous 
consent is obtained from the House to file at a later time.<p>

 The report is assigned a report number when it is filed, and 
it is delivered to the Government Printing Office for 
printing during that night. Beginning with the 91st Congress, 
in 1969, the report number contains a prefix-designator which 
indicates the number of the Congress. For example, the first 
House report in 1969 was numbered 91-1.<p>

 The bill is reprinted when reported and committee amendments 
are indicated by showing new matter in italics and deleted 
matter in line-through type. The report number is printed on 
the bill and the calendar number is shown on both the first 
and back pages of the bill. However, in the case of a bill 
that was referred to 2 or more committees for consideration 
in sequence, the calendar number is printed only on the bill 
as reported by the last committee to consider it. See Part 
IX, "Calendars".<p>

 Committee reports are perhaps the most valuable single 
element of the legislative history of a law. They are used by 
courts, executive departments and agencies, and the public 
generally, as a source of information regarding the purpose 
and meaning of the law.<p>

<b> CONTENTS OF REPORTS</b><p>

 The report of a committee on a measure that has been 
approved by the committee must include (1) the committee's 
oversight findings and recommendations, (2) the statement 
required by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, if the 
measure provides new budget authority (other than continuing 
appropriations), certain new spending authority, new credit 
authority, or an increase or decrease in revenues or tax 
expenditures, (3) the cost estimate and comparison prepared 
by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office whenever 
the Director has submitted that estimate and comparison to 
the committee prior to the filing of the report, and (4) a 
summary of the oversight findings and recommendations made by 
the Committee on Government Operations whenever they have 
been submitted to the legislative committee in a timely 
fashion to allow an opportunity to consider the findings and 
recommendations during the committee's deliberations on the 
measure. Each of these items are set out separately and 
clearly identified in the report. For a discussion of the 
Congressional budget process, see Part XII.<p>

<b> INFLATIONARY IMPACT AND COST ESTIMATES IN REPORTS</b><p>

 In addition, each report of a committee on a bill or joint 
resolution of a public character reported by the committee 
must contain a detailed analytical statement as to whether 
the enactment of the bill or joint resolution into law may 
have an inflationary impact on prices and costs in the 
operation of the national  economy.<p>

 Each report also must contain an estimate, made by the 
committee, of the costs which would be incurred in carrying 
out that bill or joint resolution in the fiscal year reported 
and in each of the 5 fiscal years thereafter or for the 
duration of the program authorized if less than 5 years. In 
the case of a measure involving revenues, the report need 
contain only an estimate of the gain or loss in revenues for 
a one-year period. The report must include a comparison of 
the estimates of those costs with the estimate made by any 
Government agency and submitted to that committee. The 
Committees on Appropriations, on House Administration, on 
Rules, and on Standards of Official Conduct are not required 
to include cost estimates in their reports. In addition, the 
cost estimates are not required to be included in reports 
when a cost estimate and comparison prepared by the Director 
of the Congressional Budget Office has been submitted prior 
to the filing of the report and included in the report.<p>

 <b>FILING OF REPORTS</b><p>

 Measures approved by a committee must be reported promptly 
after approval. A majority of the Members of the committee 
may file a written request with the clerk of the committee 
for the reporting of the measure. When the request is filed, 
the clerk immediately must notify the Chairman of the 
committee of the filing of the request, and the report on the 
measure must be filed within 7 days (excluding days on which 
the House is not in session) after the day on which the 
request is filed. This does not apply to a report of the 
Committee on Rules with respect to the rules, joint rules, or 
order of business of the House or to the reporting of a 
resolution of inquiry addressed to the head of an executive 
department.<p>

<b> AVAILABILITY OF REPORTS AND HEARINGS</b><p>

 With certain exceptions (relating to emergency situations, 
such as a measure declaring war or other national emergency 
and Government agency decisions, determinations, and actions 
that are effective unless disapproved or otherwise 
invalidated by one or both Houses of Congress), a measure or 
matter reported by a committee (except the Committee on Rules 
in the case of a resolution making in order the consideration 
of a bill, resolution, or other order of business) may not be 
considered in the House until the third calendar day 
(excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) on which 
the report of that committee on that measure has been 
available to the Members of the House. In addition, the 
measure or matter may not be considered unless copies of the 
report and the reported measure or matter have been available 
to the Members for at least 3 calendar days (excluding 
Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays during which the House 
is not in session) before the beginning of consideration. 
However, it is always in order to consider a report from the 
Committee on Rules specifically providing for the 
consideration of a reported measure or matter notwithstanding 
this restriction. If hearings were held on a measure or 
matter so reported, the committee is required to make every 
reasonable effort to have those hearings printed and 
available for distribution to the Members of the House prior 
to the consideration of the measure in the House. General 
appropriation bills may not be considered until printed 
committee hearings and a committee report thereon have been 
available to the Members of the House for at least 3 calendar 
days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays).<p>

 
 VIII. <a name="legislative"><b>LEGISLATIVE REVIEW BY STANDING COMMITTEES</b></a><p>

  Each standing committee (other than the Committees on 
Appropriations and on the Budget) is required to review and 
study, on a continuing basis, the application, 
administration, execution, and effectiveness of the laws 
dealing with the subject matter over which the committee has 
jurisdiction and the organization and operation of Federal 
agencies and entities having responsibility for the 
administration and evaluation of those laws.<p>

 The purpose of the review and study is to determine whether 
laws and the programs created by Congress are being 
implemented and carried out in accordance with the intent of 
Congress and whether those programs should be continued, 
curtailed, or eliminated. In addition, each committee having 
oversight responsibility is required to review and study any 
conditions or circumstances that may indicate the necessity 
or desirability of enacting new or additional legislation 
within the jurisdiction of that committee, and must 
undertake, on a continuing basis, futures research and 
forecasting on matters within the jurisdiction of that 
committee. Each standing committee also has the function of 
reviewing and studying, on a continuing basis, the impact or 
probable impact of tax policies on subjects within its 
jurisdiction.<p>

 In addition, several of the standing committees have special 
oversight responsibilities, the details of which are 
contained in the rules of the House.
<p>
 
 IX. <a name="calendar"><b>CALENDARS</b><p></a>

  The House of Representatives has 5 calendars of business: 
the Union Calendar, the House Calendar, the Private Calendar, 
the Consent Calendar, and the Calendar of Motions to 
Discharge Committees. The calendars, together with a listing 
of all bills introduced and a history of all bills reported 
out of committee in the current Congress, are printed each 
day the House is in session to provide information on the 
status of pending legislation.<p>

 As soon as a public bill is favorably reported, it is 
assigned a calendar number on either the Union Calendar or 
the House Calendar, the 2 principal calendars of business. 
The calendar number is printed on the first page of the bill 
and, in certain instances, is printed also on the back page. 
In the case of a bill that was referred to 2 or more 
committees for consideration in sequence, the calendar number 
is printed only on the bill as reported by the last committee 
to consider it.<p>

<b> UNION CALENDAR</b><p>

 The rules of the House provide that there shall be:<p>

 First. A Calendar of the Committee of the Whole House on the 
state of the Union, to which shall be referred bills raising 
revenue, general appropriation bills, and bills of a public 
character directly or indirectly appropriating money or 
property.<p>

 
 This is commonly known as the Union Calendar and the large 
majority of public bills and resolutions are placed on it on 
being reported to the House. For a discussion of the 
Committee of the Whole House, see Part XI.<p>

 <b>HOUSE CALENDAR</b><p>

 The rules further provide that there shall be:<p>

 Second. A House Calendar, to which shall be referred all 
bills of a public character not raising revenue nor directly 
or indirectly appropriating money or property.<p>

 
 The public bills and resolutions that are not placed on the 
Union Calendar are referred to the House Calendar.<p>

<b> PRIVATE CALENDAR</b><p>

 The rules also provide that there shall be:<p>

 Third. A Calendar of the Committee of the Whole House, to 
which shall be referred all bills of a private character.<p>

 
 This is commonly known as the Private Calendar and all 
private bills are placed on it on being reported to the 
House. The Private Calendar is called on the first and third 
Tuesdays of each month.  If objection is made by 2 or more 
Members to the consideration of any measure called, it is 
recommitted to the committee that reported it. As in the case 
of the Consent Calendar (see below) there are 6 official 
objectors, 3 on the majority side and 3 on the minority side, 
who make a careful study of each bill or resolution on the 
Private Calendar and who will object to a measure that does 
not conform to the requirements for that calendar, thereby 
preventing the passage without debate of nonmeritorious bills 
and resolutions.<p>

<b>CONSENT CALENDAR</b><p>

 If a measure pending on either the House or Union Calendar 
is of a noncontroversial nature, it may be placed on the 
Consent Calendar. After a bill has been favorably reported 
and is on either the House or Union Calendar, any Member may 
file with the Clerk a notice that the Member desires the bill 
placed on the Consent Calendar. On the first and third 
Mondays of each month immediately after the reading of the 
Journal, the Speaker directs the Clerk to call the bills in 
numerical order (that is, in the order of their appearance on 
that calendar) that have been on the Consent Calendar for 3 
legislative days. If objection is made to the consideration 
of any bill so called, it is carried over on the calendar 
without prejudice to the next day when the Consent Calendar 
is again called, and if then objected to by 3 or more Members 
it is immediately stricken from the calendar and may not be 
placed on the Consent Calendar again during that session of 
Congress. If objection is not made and if the bill is not 
"passed over" by request, it is passed by unanimous consent 
without debate. Ordinarily, the only amendments considered 
are those sponsored by the committee that reported the bill.<p>

 To avoid the passage without debate of measures that may be 
controversial or are sufficiently important or complex to 
require full discussion, there are 6 official objectors--3 on 
the majority side and 3 on the minority side--who make a 
careful study of bills on the Consent Calendar. If a bill 
involves the expenditure of more than a fixed maximum amount 
of money or if it changes national policy or has other 
aspects that any of the objectors believes demand explanation 
and extended debate, it will be objected to and will not be 
passed by unanimous consent. That action does not necessarily 
mean the final defeat of the bill because it may then be 
brought up for consideration in the same way as any other 
bill on the House or Union Calendars.<p>

<b> CALENDAR OF MOTIONS TO DISCHARGE COMMITTEES</b><p>
 When a majority of the Members of the House sign a motion to 
discharge a committee from consideration of a public bill or 
resolution, that motion is referred to the Calendar of 
Motions to Discharge Committees. For a further discussion of 
Motions to Discharge, see "Motion to Discharge Committee" in 
Part X.<p>

 X. <a name="measures"><b> OBTAINING CONSIDERATION OF MEASURES</b></a><p>

  Obviously certain measures pending on the House and Union 
Calendars are more important and urgent than others and it is 
necessary to have a system permitting their consideration 
ahead of those that do not require immediate action. Because 
all measures are placed on those calendars in the order in 
which they are reported to the House, the latest bill 
reported would be the last to be taken up if the calendar 
number alone were the determining factor.<p>

 <b>SPECIAL RESOLUTIONS</b><p>

 To avoid delays and to provide some degree of selectivity in 
the consideration of measures, it is possible to have them 
taken up out of order by obtaining from the Committee on 
Rules a special resolution or "rule" for their consideration. 
That Committee, which is composed of majority and minority 
Members but with a larger proportion of majority Members than 
other committees, is specifically granted jurisdiction over 
resolutions relating to the order of business of the House. 
Usually the Chairman of the committee that has favorably 
reported the bill appears before the Committee on Rules 
accompanied by the sponsor of the measure and one or more 
Members of the Chariman's committee in support of the request 
for a resolution providing for its immediate consideration. 
If the Committee on Rules is satisfied that the measure 
should be taken up it will report a resolution reading 
substantially as follows with respect to a bill on the Union 
Calendar:<p>

 Resolved, That upon the adoption of this resolution it shall 
be in order to move that the House resolve itself into the 
Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for 
the consideration of the bill (H.R. ___) entitled, etc., and 
the first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. After 
general debate, which shall be confined to the bill and shall 
continue not to exceed __ hours, to be equally divided and 
controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on ___, the bill shall be read for amendment under 
the five-minute rule. At the conclusion of the consideration 
of the bill for amendment, the Committee shall rise and 
report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have 
been adopted, and the previous question shall be considered 
as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final 
passage without intervening motion except one motion to 
recommit.<p>

 
 If the measure is on the House Calendar the resolution reads 
substantially as follows:<p>

 Resolved, That upon the adoption of this resolution it shall 
be in order to consider the bill (H.R. ___) entitled, etc., 
in the House.<p>

 
 The resolution may waive points of order against the bill. 
When it limits or prevents floor amendments, it is popularly 
known as a "closed rule".<p>

<b> CONSIDERATION OF MEASURES MADE IN ORDER BY PREVIOUS 
RESOLUTION</b><p>

 When a "rule" has been reported to the House, and is not 
considered immediately, it is referred to the calendar and, 
if not called up for consideration by the Member making the 
report within 7 legislative days thereafter, any Member of 
the Committee on Rules may call it up as a question of 
privilege (after having given one calendar day notice of the 
Member's intention to do so) and the Speaker will recognize 
any Member of the Committee seeking recognition for that 
purpose. For a discussion of privileged questions, see the 
matter under the heading "Privileged Matters" at the end of 
this part.<p>

 If, within 7 calendar days after a measure has, by 
resolution, been made in order for consideration by the 
House, a motion has not been offered for its consideration, 
the Speaker may recognize a Member of the committee that 
reported the measure to offer a motion that the House 
consider it, if the Member has been duly authorized by that 
committee to offer the motion.<p>

 There are several other methods of obtaining consideration 
of bills that either have not been reported by a committee 
or, if reported, for which a special resolution or "rule" has 
not been obtained. Two of those methods, a motion to 
discharge a committee and a motion to suspend the rules, are 
discussed below.<p>

<b> MOTION TO DISCHARGE COMMITTEE</b><p>

 A Member may present to the Clerk a motion in writing to 
discharge a committee from the consideration of a public bill 
or resolution that has been referred to it 30 days prior 
thereto. A Member also may file a motion to discharge the 
Committee on Rules from further consideration of a resolution 
providing either a special order of business, or a special 
rule for the consideration of a public bill or resolution 
favorably reported by a standing committee, or a special rule 
for the consideration of a public bill or resolution that has 
remained in a standing committee 30 days or more without 
action. This motion may be made only when the resolution, 
from which it is moved to discharge the Committee on Rules, 
has been referred to that committee at least 7 days prior to 
the filing of the motion to discharge. The motion is placed 
in the custody of the Clerk, who arranges some convenient 
place for the signature of Members. When a majority of the 
total membership of the House have signed the motion, it is 
entered on the Journal, printed with the signatures thereto 
in the Congressional Record, and referred to the Calendar of 
Motions to Discharge Committees.<p>

 On the second and fourth Mondays of each month, except 
during the last 6 days of a session, a Member who has signed 
a motion to discharge, that has been on the calendar at least 
7 days, may seek recognition and be recognized for the 
purpose of calling up the motion. The bill or resolution is 
then read by title only. After 20 minutes' debate, one-half 
in favor of the proposition and one-half in opposition, the 
House proceeds to vote on the motion to discharge.<p>

 If the motion to discharge the Committee on Rules from a 
resolution pending before the Committee prevails, the House 
immediately votes on the adoption of that resolution.<p>

 If the motion to discharge one of the standing committees of 
the House from a public bill or resolution pending before the 
committee prevails, a Member who signed the motion may move 
that the House proceed to the immediate consideration of the 
bill or resolution. If the motion is agreed to, the bill or 
resolution is considered immediately under the general rules 
of the House. If the House votes against the motion for 
immediate consideration, the bill or resolution is referred 
to its proper calendar with the same rights and privileges it 
would have had if reported favorably by the standing 
committee.<p>

<b> MOTION TO SUSPEND THE RULES</b><p>

 On Monday and Tuesday of each week and during the last 6 
days of a session, the Speaker may entertain a motion to 
suspend the rules of the House and pass a bill or resolution. 
Arrangement must be made in advance with the Speaker to 
recognize the Member who wishes to offer the motion. Before 
being considered by the House, the motion must be seconded by 
a majority of the Members present, by teller vote, if 
demanded. However, a second is not required on a motion to 
suspend the rules when printed copies of the proposed bill or 
resolution have been available for one legislative day before 
the motion is considered. The motion to suspend the rules and 
pass the bill is then debated for 40 minutes, one-half by 
those in favor of the proposition and one-half by those 
opposed. The motion may not be amended and if amendments to 
the bill are proposed they must be included in the motion 
when it is made. The rules may be suspended and the bill 
passed only by affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Members 
voting, a quorum being present.<p>

 The Speaker may postpone all recorded and yea-nay votes on 
motions to suspend the rules and pass bills and resolutions 
until the end of that legislative day or the next 2 
legislative days. At that time the House disposes of the 
deferred votes consecutively without further debate. After 
the first deferred vote is taken, the Speaker may reduce to 
not less than 5 minutes the time period for subsequent 
deferred votes. If the House adjourns before completing 
action on one or more deferred votes, these must be the first 
order of business on the next legislative day. By eliminating 
intermittent recorded votes on suspensions, this procedure 
reduces interruptions of committee meetings and also reduces 
the time Members spend on suspension days going back and 
forth between the floor and their committee rooms or offices.<p>

<b> CALENDAR WEDNESDAY</b><p>

 On Wednesday of each week, unless dispensed with by 
unanimous consent or by affirmative vote of two-thirds of the 
Members voting, a quorum being present, the standing 
committees are called in alphabetical order. A committee when 
named may call up for consideration any bill reported by it 
on a previous day and pending on either the House or Union 
Calendar. Not more than 2 hours of general debate is 
permitted on any measure called up on Calendar Wednesday and 
all debate must be confined to the subject matter of the 
measure, the time being equally divided between those for and 
those against it. The affirmative vote of a simple majority 
of the Members present is sufficient to pass the measure.<p>

 <b>DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA BUSINESS</b><p>

 The second and fourth Mondays in each month, after the 
disposition of motions to discharge committees and after the 
disposal of business on the Speaker's table requiring only 
referral to committee, are set aside, when claimed by the 
Committee on the District of Columbia, for the consideration 
of any business that is presented by that Committee.<p>

<b> PRIVILEGED MATTERS</b><p>

 Under the rules of the House certain matters are regarded as 
privileged matters and may interrupt the order of business, 
for example, reports from the Committee on Rules and reports 
from the Committee on Appropriations on the general 
appropriation bills.<p>

 At any time after the reading of the Journal, a Member, by 
direction of the appropriate committee, may move that the 
House resolve itself into the Committee of the Whole House on 
the State of the Union for the purpose of considering bills 
raising revenues, or general appropriation bills. General 
appropriation bills may not be considered in the House until 
3 calendar days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal 
holidays) after printed committee reports and hearings on 
them have been available to the Members. The limit on general 
debate is generally fixed by unanimous consent.<p>

 Other examples of privileged matters are conference reports, 
certain amendments to measures by the Senate, veto messages 
from the President of the United States, and resolutions 
privileged pursuant to statute. The Member in charge of such 
a matter may call it up at practically any time for immediate 
consideration. Usually, this is done after consultation with 
both the majority and minority floor leaders so that the 
Members of both parties will have advance notice and will not 
be taken by surprise.<p>

 
 XI. <a name="consideration"><b>CONSIDERATION</b></a><p>

  Our democratic tradition demands that bills be given 
consideration by the entire membership with adequate 
opportunity for debate and the proposing of amendments.<p>

<b> COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE HOUSE</b><p>

 In order to expedite the consideration of bills and 
resolutions, the rules of the House provide for a 
parliamentary usage that enables the House to act with a 
quorum of less than the requisite majority of 218. The House 
resolves itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the 
State of the Union (a quorum of which consists of 100 
Members) to consider a measure. All measures on the Union 
Calendar--involving a tax, making appropriations, or 
authorizing payments out of appropriations already made--must 
be first considered in the Committee of the Whole.<p>

 The Committee on Rules reports a special resolution or 
"rule" allowing for immediate consideration of a measure by 
the Committee of the Whole. After adoption of the resolution 
by the House, the House votes on a motion to resolve itself 
into the Committee of the Whole or, in certain situations, 
the Speaker declares the House resolved into the Committee of 
the Whole without intervening motion. When the House resolves 
into the Committee of the Whole, the Speaker leaves the chair 
after appointing a Chairman to preside.<p>

 The special resolution or "rule" referred to in the 
preceding paragraph also fixes the length of the debate in 
the Committee of the Whole. This may vary according to the 
importance and controversial nature of the measure. As 
provided in the resolution, the control of the time is 
divided equally--usually between the Chairman and the ranking 
minority Member of the committee that reported the measure. 
Members seeking to speak for or against the measure usually 
arrange in advance with the Member in control of the time on 
their respective side to be allowed a certain amount of time 
in the debate. Others may ask the Member speaking at the time 
to yield to them for a question or a brief statement. A 
transcript of the proceedings and debate in the House and the 
Senate is printed daily in the Congressional Record. 
Frequently permission is granted a Member by unanimous 
consent to extend the Member's remarks in the Congressional 
Record if sufficient time to make a lengthy oral statement is 
not available during actual debate.<p>

 The conduct of the debate is governed principally by the 
rules of the House that are adopted at the opening of each 
Congress. Another recognized authority is Jefferson's Manual 
that was prepared by Thomas Jefferson for his own guidance as 
President of the Senate from 1797 to 1801. The House, in 
1837, adopted a rule that still stands, providing that the 
provisions of Jefferson's Manual should govern the House in 
all cases to which they are applicable and in which they are 
not inconsistent with the rules and orders of the House. In 
addition, there is a most valuable compilation of precedents 
up to the year 1935 set out in Hinds' Precedents and Cannon's 
Precedents of the House of Representatives, consisting of 11 
volumes, to guide the action of the House. A later 
compilation, Deschler's Precedents of the House of 
Representatives, covers years 1936 to date. Summaries of the 
House precedents prior to 1959 can be found in a single 
volume entitled Cannon's Procedure in the House of 
Representatives. A later volume, Procedure in the U.S. House 
of Representatives, fourth edition, as supplemented, is a 
compilation of the parliamentary precedents of the House, in 
summary form, together with other useful related material, 
from 1959 to date. Also, various rulings of the Speaker since 
1931 are set out as notes to the current House Rules and 
Manual. Most parliamentary questions arising during the 
course of debate are susceptible of ruling backed up by a 
precedent of action in a similar situation. The 
Parliamentarian of the House is present in the House Chamber 
in order to assist the Chairman or the Speaker in making a 
correct ruling on parliamentary questions.<p>

<b> SECOND READING</b><p>

 During the general debate an accurate account is kept of the 
time used on both sides and when all the time allowed under 
the rule has been consumed the Chairman terminates the 
debate. Then begins the "second reading of the bill", section 
by section, at which time amendments may be offered to a 
section when it is read. A Member is permitted 5 minutes to 
explain the proposed amendment, after which the Member who is 
first recognized by the Chair is allowed to speak for 5 
minutes in opposition to it; there is no further debate on 
that amendment, thereby effectively preventing any attempt at 
filibuster tactics. This is known as the "five-minute rule". 
There is, how ever, a device whereby a Member may offer a pro 
forma amendment--"to strike out the last word"--without 
intending any change in the language, and be allowed 5 
minutes for debate, thus permitting a somewhat more 
comprehensive debate. Each amendment is put to the Committee 
of the Whole for adoption. Generally, a pro forma amendment 
is withdrawn. However, in the absence of being withdrawn, it 
must be voted on.<p>

 At any time after a debate is begun under the five-minute 
rule, on proposed amendments to a section or paragraph of a 
bill, the Committee of the Whole may by majority vote of the 
Members present, close debate on the section or paragraph. 
However, if debate is closed on a section or paragraph before 
there has been debate on any amendment that a Member has 
caused to be printed in the Congressional Record after the 
reporting of the bill by the committee but at least one day 
prior to floor consideration of the amendment, the Member who 
caused the amendment to be printed in the Record is given 5 
minutes in which to explain the amendment, after which the 
first person to obtain the floor has 5 minutes to speak in 
opposition to it, and there is no further debate on that 
proposed amendment. However, time for debate is not allowed 
when the offering of the amendment is dilatory. Material 
placed in the Congressional Record must indicate the full 
text of the proposed amendment, the name of the proponent 
Member, the number of the bill to which it will be offered 
and the point in the bill or amendment thereto where the 
amendment is intended to be offered, and must appear in a 
portion of the Record designated for that purpose.<p>

 When an amendment is offered, while the House is meeting in 
the Committee of the Whole, the Clerk is required to transmit 
5 copies of the amendment to the majority committee table, 5 
copies to the minority committee table, and at least one copy 
each to the majority and minority cloak rooms.<p>

<b>THE COMMITTEE "RISES"</b><p>

 At the conclusion of the consideration of a bill for 
amendment, the Committee of the Whole "rises" and reports the 
bill to the House with the amendments that have been adopted. 
In rising the Committee of the Whole reverts back to the 
House and the Chairman of the Committee is replaced in the 
chair by the Speaker of the House. The House then acts on the 
bill and any amendments adopted by the Committee of the 
Whole.<p>

<b> HOUSE ACTION</b><p>

 Debate is cut off by moving "the previous question". If this 
motion is carried by a majority of the Members voting, a 
quorum being present, all debate is cut off on the bill on 
which the previous question has been ordered. The Speaker 
then puts the question: "Shall the bill be engrossed and read 
a third time?" If this question is decided in the 
affirmative, the bill is read a third time by title only and 
voted on for passage.<p>

 If the previous question has been ordered by the terms of 
the special resolution or "rule" on a bill reported by the 
Committee of the Whole, the House immediately votes on 
whatever amendments have been reported by the Committee in 
the sequence in which they were reported. After completion of 
voting on the amendments, the House immediately votes on the 
passage of the bill with the amendments it has adopted.<p>

 In those cases where the previous question has not been 
ordered, the House may engage in debate lasting one hour, at 
the conclusion of which the previous question is ordered and 
the House votes on the passage of the bill. During the debate 
it is in order to offer amendments to the bill or to the 
Committee amendments.<p>

 The Speaker may postpone a vote on final passage of a bill 
or resolution or agreement to a conference report. A vote may 
be postponed for up to 2 legislative days.<p>

 Measures that do not have to be considered in the Committee 
of the Whole are considered in the House in the first 
instance under the hour rule or in accordance with the terms 
of the special resolution limiting debate on the measure.<p>

 After passage of the bill by the House, a pro forma motion 
to reconsider it is automatically made and laid on the table-
-that is, action is postponed indefinitely--to forestall this 
motion at a later date, because the vote of the House on a 
proposition is not final and conclusive on the House until 
there has been an opportunity to reconsider it.<p>

<b> MOTIONS TO RECOMMIT</b><p>

 After the previous question has been ordered on the passage 
of a bill or joint resolution, it is in order to make one 
motion to recommit the bill or joint resolution to a 
committee and the Speaker is required to give preference in 
recognition for that purpose to a Member who is opposed to 
the bill or joint resolution. This motion is normally not 
subject to debate. However, with respect to a motion to 
recommit with instructions after the previous question has 
been ordered, it is in order to debate the motion for 10 
minutes before the vote is taken, except that the majority 
floor manager may demand that the debate be extended to one 
hour. Whatever time is allotted for debate is divided equally 
between the proponents and opponents of the motion.<p>

<b> QUORUM CALLS AND ROLLCALLS</b><p>

 In order to speed up and expedite quorum calls and 
rollcalls, the rules of the House provide alternative methods 
for pursuing these procedures.<p>

 In the absence of a quorum, 15 Members, including the 
Speaker, if there is one, are authorized to compel the 
attendance of absent Members. Such a call of the House is 
ordered by a majority vote, and a minority of 15 or more 
favoring a call is not sufficient. A call of the House is 
then ordered, and the Speaker is required to have the call 
taken by electronic device. However, the Speaker instead may 
name one or more clerks "to tell" the Members who are 
present. In that case the names of those present are recorded 
by the clerks, and entered in the Journal of the House and 
absent Members have not less than 15 minutes from the 
ordering of the call of the House to have their presence 
recorded. If sufficient excuse is not offered for their 
absence, by order of a majority of those present, they may be 
sent for by officers appointed by the Sergeant-at-Arms for 
that purpose, and their attendance secured and retained. The 
House then determines the conditions on which they may be 
discharged. Members who voluntarily appear are, unless the 
House otherwise directs, immediately admitted to the Hall of 
the House and they must report their names to the Clerk to be 
entered on the Journal as present. However, the former 
practice of presenting Members at the Bar of the House, 
during a call, is now obsolete, and Members now report to the 
Clerk and are recorded without being formally excused unless 
brought in under compulsion.<p>

 Whenever a quorum fails to vote on any question, and a 
quorum is not present and objection is made for that reason, 
there is a call of the House unless the House adjourns. The 
call is taken by electronic device unless the Speaker orders 
the call in the manner described in the preceding paragraph, 
and the Sergeant-at-Arms proceeds to bring in absent Members. 
The yeas and nays on the pending question are at the same 
time considered as ordered and an automatic rollcall vote is 
taken. The Clerk calls the roll and each Member who is 
present may vote on the pending question as the Member 
answers the roll. After the rollcall is completed, each 
Member, whose attendance was secured, is brought before the 
House by the Sergeant-at-Arms, where the Member's presence is 
noted. The Member then is given an opportunity to vote. If 
those voting on the question and those who are present and 
decline to vote together make a majority of the House, the 
Speaker declares that a quorum is constituted, and the 
pending question is decided according to the will of the 
majority of those voting. Further proceedings under the call 
are considered as dispensed with. At any time after the 
rollcall has been completed, the Speaker may entertain a 
motion to adjourn, if seconded by a majority of those present 
as ascertained by actual count by the Speaker; and if the 
House adjourns, all quorum call proceedings are vacated.<p>

 The rules prohibit points of no quorum (1) before or during 
the daily prayer, (2) during administration of the oath of 
office to the Speaker or any Member, (3) during the reception 
of messages from the President or the Senate, (4) in 
connection with motions incidental to a call of the House, 
and (5) against a vote in which the Committee of the Whole 
agrees to rise (but an appropriate point of no quorum would 
be permitted against a vote defeating a motion to rise). If 
the presence of a quorum has been established at least once 
on any day, further points of no quorum are prohibited (1) 
during the reading of the Journal, (2) between the time a 
Committee of the Whole rises and its Chairman reports, and 
(3) during the period on any legislative day when Members are 
addressing the House under special orders. The language 
prohibiting quorum calls "during any period" when Members are 
speaking under special orders includes the time between 
addresses delivered during this period as well as the 
addresses themselves. Furthermore, a quorum call is not in 
order when no business has intervened since the previous 
call. For the purposes of this provision, all the situations 
described above are not to be considered as "business".<p>

 The rules prohibit points of no quorum when a motion or 
proposition is pending in the House unless the Speaker has 
put the motion or proposition to a vote. However, the Speaker 
has the discretion to recognize a Member of the Speaker's 
choice to move a call of the House.<p>

 The first time the Committee of the Whole finds itself 
without a quorum during any day the Chairman is required to 
order the roll to be called by electronic device, unless the 
Chairman orders a call by naming clerks "to tell" the Members 
as described above. However, the Chairman may refuse to 
entertain a point of order that a quorum is not present 
during general debate. If on a call a quorum appears, the 
Committee continues its business. If a quorum does not 
appear, the Committee rises and the Chairman reports the 
names of the absentees to the House. The rules provide for 
the expeditious conduct of quorum calls in the Committee of 
the Whole. The Chairman may suspend a quorum call after 
determining that a bare or minimum quorum has been reached, 
that is, 100 or more Members. Under such a short quorum call 
the Committee will not rise, and therefore Members' names 
will not be published. Once the presence of a quorum of the 
Committee of the Whole has been established for the day, 
quorum calls in the Committee are only in order when the 
Committee is operating under the five-minute rule and the 
Chairman has put the pending motion or proposition to a vote.<p>

<b> VOTING</b><p>

 There are 4 methods of voting in the Committee of the Whole, 
that are also employed, together with an additional method, 
in the House. These are the voice vote (viva voce), the 
division, the teller vote, the recorded vote, and the yea-
and-nay vote that is used only in the House. If a Member 
objects to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not 
present in the House, there may be an automatic rollcall 
vote.<p>

 To obtain a voice vote the Chair states "As many as are in 
favor (as the question may be) say `Aye'." "As many as are 
opposed, say `No'.". The Chair determines the result on the 
basis of the volume of ayes and noes. This is the form in 
which the vote is ordinarily taken in the first instance.<p>

 If it is difficult to determine the result of a voice vote, 
a division may be demanded. The Chair then states that a 
division has been demanded and says "As many as are in favor 
will rise and stand until counted." After counting those in 
favor he calls on those opposed to stand and be counted, 
thereby determining the number in favor of and those opposed 
to the question.<p>

 If a demand for a teller vote is supported by one-fifth of a 
quorum (20 in the Committee of the Whole, and 44 in the 
House), the Chair appoints one or more tellers from each side 
and directs the Members in favor of the proposition to pass 
between the tellers and be counted. After counting, a teller 
announces the number in the affirmative, and the Chair then 
directs the Members opposed to pass between the tellers and 
be counted. When the count is stated by a teller, the Chair 
announces the result.<p>

 If any Member requests a recorded vote and that request is 
supported by at least one-fifth of a quorum of the House, or 
25 Members in the Committee of the Whole, the vote is taken 
by electronic device, unless the Speaker orders clerks "to 
tell", that is, record the names of those voting on each side 
of the question. After the recorded vote is concluded, the 
names of those voting together with those not voting are 
entered in the Journal. Members usually have 15 minutes to be 
counted from the time the recorded vote is ordered or the 
ordering of the clerks "to tell" the vote. The Speaker may 
reduce the period for voting to 5 minutes in certain 
situations.<p>

 In addition to the foregoing methods of voting, in the 
House, if the yeas and nays are demanded, the Speaker directs 
those in favor of taking the vote by that method to stand and 
be counted. The assent of one-fifth of the Members present 
(as distinguished from one-fifth of a quorum in the case of a 
demand for tellers) is necessary for ordering the yeas and 
nays. When the yeas and nays are ordered (or a point of order 
is made that a quorum is not present) the Speaker directs 
that as many as are in favor of the proposition will, as 
their names are called, answer "Aye"; as many as are opposed 
will answer "No". The Clerk calls the roll and reports the 
result to the Speaker who announces it to the House. The 
Speaker is not required to vote unless the Speaker's vote 
would be decisive.<p>

 The rules prohibit a Member from (1) casting another 
Member's vote or recording another Member's presence in the 
House or the Committee of the Whole or (2) authorizing 
another individual to cast a vote or record the Member's 
presence in the House or the Committee of the Whole.<p>

<b> ELECTRONIC VOTING</b><p>

 Recorded and rollcall votes are usually taken by electronic 
device, except when the Speaker orders the vote to be 
recorded by other methods prescribed by the rules of the 
House, and in emergency situations, such as, the failure of 
the electronic device to function. In addition, quorum calls 
are generally taken by electronic device. Essentially the 
system works as follows: A number of vote stations are 
attached to selected chairs in the Chamber. Each station is 
equipped with a vote card slot and 4 indicators, marked 
"yea", "nay", "present", and "open". The "open" indicator is 
used only when a vote period is in progress and the system is 
ready to accept votes. Each Member is provided with a 
personalized Vote 09ID Card. A Member votes by inserting the 
voting card into any one of the vote stations and depressing 
the appropriate push button to indicate the Member's choice. 
The machine records the votes and reports the result when the 
vote is completed. In the event the Member is without a Vote 
09ID Card, the Member may still vote by handing a paper 
ballot to the Tally Clerk, who may then record the vote 
electronically according to the indicated preference of the 
Member. The paper ballots are green for "yea", red for "nay", 
and amber for "present".<p>

<b> PAIRING OF MEMBERS</b><p>

 When a Member anticipates being unavoidably absent at the 
time a vote is to be taken, the Member may arrange in advance 
to be recorded as being either in favor of, or opposed to, 
the question by being "paired" with a Member who will also be 
absent and who holds contrary views on the question. A 
specific pair of this kind shows how the Member would have 
voted if present. Occasionally, a Member who has arranged in 
advance to be paired, actually is present at the time of 
voting. The Member then votes as if not paired, and 
subsequently withdraws that vote and asks to be marked 
"present" to protect the other Member. This is known as a 
"live pair". If the absence is to continue for several days 
during which a number of different questions are to be voted 
upon the Member may arrange a "general pair". A general pair 
does not indicate how the Member would have voted on the 
question, but merely that the paired Members would not have 
been on the same side of the question.<p>

 Pairs are not counted in determining the vote on the 
question, but, rather, provide an opportunity for absent 
Members to express formally how they would have voted had 
they been present. Pairs are announced by the Clerk of the 
House and are listed in the Congressional Record immediately 
after the names of those Members not voting on the question.<p>

 <b>SYSTEM OF LIGHTS AND BELLS</b><p>

 Because of the large number and the diversity of daily tasks 
that they have to perform it is not practicable for Members 
to be present in the House (or Senate) Chamber at every 
minute that the body is actually sitting. Furthermore, many 
of the routine matters do not require the personal attendance 
of all the Members. A legislative call system (consisting of 
electric lights and bells or buzzers located in various parts 
of the Capitol Building and of the House and Senate Office 
Buildings) alerts Members to certain occurrences in the House 
and Senate Chambers.<p>

 In the House, the Speaker has ordered that the bells and 
lights comprising the system be utilized as follows:<p>

 1 ring and 1 light on the left--Teller vote.<p>

 1 long ring followed by a pause and then 3 rings and 3 
lights on the left--Start or continuation of a notice or 
short quorum call in the Committee of the Whole that will be 
vacated if and when 100 Members appear on the floor. Bells 
are repeated every 5 minutes unless the call is vacated or 
the call is converted into a regular quorum call.<p>

 1 long ring and extinguishing of 3 lights on the left--Short 
or notice quorum call vacated.<p>

 2 rings and 2 lights on the left--Recorded vote, yea-and-nay 
vote or automatic rollcall vote by electronic device or by 
tellers with ballot cards. The bells are repeated 5 minutes 
after the first ring.<p>

 2 rings and 2 lights on the left followed by a pause and 
then 2 more rings--Automatic rollcall vote or yea-and-nay 
vote taken by a call of the roll in the House. The bells are 
repeated when the clerk reaches the R's in the first call of 
the roll.<p>

 2 rings followed by a pause and then 5 rings--First vote 
under Suspension of the Rules or on clustered votes. 2 bells 
are repeated 5 minutes after the first ring. The first vote 
will take 15 minutes with successive votes at intervals of 
not less than 5 minutes. Each successive vote is signaled by 
5 rings.<p>

 3 rings and 3 lights on the left--Regular quorum call in 
either the House or in the Committee of the Whole by 
electronic device or by clerks. The bells are repeated 5 
minutes after the first ring.<p>

 3 rings followed by a pause and then 3 more rings--Regular 
quorum call by a call of the roll. The bells are repeated 
when the Clerk reaches the R's in the first call of the roll.<p>

 3 rings followed by a pause and then 5 more rings--Quorum 
call in the Committee of the Whole that may be followed 
immediately by a five-minute recorded vote.<p>

 4 rings and 4 lights on the left--Adjournment of the House.<p>

 5 rings and 5 lights on the left--Any five-minute vote.<p>

 6 rings and 6 lights on the left--Recess of the House.<p>

 12 rings at 2-second intervals with 6 lights on the left--
Civil Defense Warning.<p>

 The 7th light indicates that the House is in session.<p>

<b> BROADCASTING LIVE COVERAGE OF FLOOR PROCEEDINGS</b><p>

 The rules of the House provide for unedited radio and 
television broadcasting and recording of proceedings on the 
floor of the House. However, the rules prohibit the use of 
these broadcasts and recordings for any political purpose or 
in any commercial advertisement. Likewise, the rules of the 
Senate provide for broadcasting and recording of proceedings 
in the Senate Chamber with similar restrictions.<p>

 
 XII. <a name="budget"><b>CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET PROCESS</b></a><p>

  The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 
l974 provides Congress with a procedure for establishing 
appropriate budget and revenue levels for each year. 
Essentially, the Congressional budget process involves 
"concurrent resolutions on the budget" that are passed each 
year.  These resolutions are designed to coordinate the 
revenue and spending decisions that the various legislative 
committees of Congress make in acting on measures within 
their respective jusrisdictions in order to provide fiscal 
discipline for Congress.<p>

 Congress must complete action on a concurrent resolution on 
the budget for the next fiscal year by April 15. This 
resolution sets levels of new budget authority and spending, 
revenue, and debt levels. However, Congress may adopt a later 
budget resolution that revises or reaffirms the most recently 
adopted budget resolution.<p>

 One of the mechanisms Congress uses to enforce projected 
budget authority and spending, revenue, and debt levels is 
called the reconciliation process. Under reconciliation, 
Congress in a budget resolution directs one or more of the 
legislative committees to determine and recommend changes in 
laws or bills that will achieve the levels set by the budget 
resolution. The directions to the committees specify the 
total amounts that must be changed but leaves to the 
discretion of the committees the changes that must be made to 
achieve the required levels.<p>

 If only one committee has been directed to recommend 
changes, that committee reports its reconciliation 
legislation directly to the floor for consideration by the 
whole House. How ever, if more than one committee has been 
directed to make changes, the committees report the 
recommended changes to the Committee on the Budget. The 
Committee then reports an omnibus reconciliation bill to the 
floor for consideration by the whole House. The Committee may 
not change the reconciliation legislation substantively.<p>

 When changes are to be made in legislation that already has 
been enacted or enrolled (for an explanation of enrollment, 
see Part XVII), the vehicle used is a reconciliation bill 
that is enacted in the same manner as any other bill. 
However, if changes are to be made in bills or resolutions 
that have not been enrolled yet, Congress enacts the changes 
in a concurrent resolution not requiring approval of the 
President. The concurrent resolution directs the Clerk of the 
House or the Secretary of the Senate to make the necessary 
changes in the bill or resolution as directed by the 
reconciliation resolution. Congress must complete action on a 
reconciliation bill or resolution by June 15 of each year.<p>

 Generally, after Congress has completed action on a 
concurrent resolution on the budget for a fiscal year, it is 
not in order to consider legislation that does not conform to 
the budget authority and spending, revenue, and debt levels 
set for that fiscal year.<p>

 In 1985, Congress enacted legislation establishing a 
procedure to gradually reduce the Federal deficit to zero. 
The current target date for a zero deficit is 1993. Under the 
new procedure, if the estimated deficit for a fiscal year 
exceeds the statutory level for that year, across-the-board 
cuts in the Federal budget (with certain exceptions) would go 
into effect automatically pursuant to order of the President.<p>

 
 XIII.<a name="message"><b> ENGROSSMENT AND MESSAGE TO SENATE</b></a><p>

  The preparation of a copy of the bill in the form in which 
it has passed the House is sometimes a detailed and 
complicated process because of the large number and 
complexity of amendments to some bills adopted by the House. 
Frequently these amendments are offered during a spirited 
debate with little or no prior formal preparation. The 
amendment may be for the purpose of inserting new language, 
substituting different words for those set out in the bill, 
or deleting portions of the bill. It is not unusual to have 
more than 100 amendments, including those proposed by the 
committee at the time the bill is reported and those offered 
from the floor during the consideration of the bill in the 
Chamber. Some of the amendments offered from the floor are 
written in longhand and others are typewritten. Each 
amendment must be inserted in precisely the proper place in 
the bill, with the spelling and punctuation exactly the same 
as it was adopted by the House. Obviously, it is extremely 
important that the Senate receive a copy of the bill in the 
precise form in which it has passed the House. The 
preparation of such a copy is the function of the enrolling 
clerk.<p>

 There is an enrolling clerk in each House. In the House, the 
enrolling clerk is under the Clerk of the House. In the 
Senate, the enrolling clerk is under the Secretary of the 
Senate. The enrolling clerk receives all the papers relating 
to the bill, including the official Clerk's copy of the bill 
as reported by the standing committee and each amendment 
adopted by the House. From this material the enrolling clerk 
prepares the engrossed copy of the bill as passed, containing 
all the amendments agreed to by the House. At this point, the 
measureceases technically to be called a bill and is termed 
"an act signifying that it is the act of one body of the 
Congress, although it is still popularly referred to as a 
bill. The engrossed bill is printed on blue paper and a 
certificate that it passed the House of Representatives is 
signed by the Clerk of the House. The engrossed bill is 
delivered by a reading clerk to the Senate, while that body 
is actually sitting, in a rather formal ceremonious manner 
befitting the dignity of both Houses. The reading clerk is 
escorted into the Chamber by the Secretary or another officer 
of the Senate and on being recognized by the Presiding 
Officer of the Senate states that the House has passed the 
bill, giving its number and title, and requests the 
concurrence of the Senate.<p>

 
 XIV. <a name="senate"><b>SENATE ACTION</b></a><p>

  The Presiding Officer of the Senate refers the engrossed 
bill to the appropriate standing committee of the Senate in 
conformity with the rules of the Senate. The bill is 
reprinted immediately and copies are made available in the 
document rooms of both Houses. This printing is known as the 
"Act print" or the "Senate referred print".<p>

 <b>COMMITTEE CONSIDERATION</b><p>

 Senate committees give the bill the same kind of detailed 
consideration as it received in the House, and may report it 
with or without amendment or "table" it. A committee Member 
who wishes to express an individual view, or a group of 
Members who wish to file a minority report, may do so, by 
giving notice, at the time of the approval of the measure, of 
an intention to file supplemental, minority or additional 
views, in which event those views may be filed within 3 days 
with the clerk of the committee and they become a part of the 
report.<p>

 When a committee reports a bill, it is reprinted with the 
committee amendments indicated by showing new matter in 
italics and deleted matter in line-through type. The calendar 
number and report number are indicated on the first and back 
pages, together with the name of the Senator making the 
report. The committee report and any minority or individual 
views accompanying the bill also are printed at the same 
time. Any Senator may enter a motion to discharge a committee 
from further consideration of a bill that it has failed to 
report after what is deemed to be a reasonable time. If the 
motion is agreed to by a majority vote, the committee is 
discharged and the bill is placed on the Calendar of Business 
under the rules of the Senate.<p>

 All committee meetings, including those to conduct hearings, 
must be open to the public. However, a majority of the 
Members of a committee or subcommittee may, after discussion 
in closed session, vote in open session to close a meeting or 
series of meetings on the same subject for no longer than 14 
days if it is determined that the matters to be discussed or 
testimony to be taken will disclose matters necessary to be 
kept secret in the interests of national defense or the 
confidential conduct of the foreign relations of the United 
States; will relate solely to internal committee staff 
management or procedure; will tend to charge an individual 
with a crime or misconduct, to disgrace or injure the 
professional standing of an individual, or otherwise to 
expose an individual to public contempt, or will represent a 
clearly unwarranted invasion of the privacy of an individual; 
will disclose law enforcement information that is required to 
be kept secret; will disclose certain information regarding 
certain trade secrets; or may disclose matters required to be 
kept confidential under other provisions of law or Government 
regulation.<p>

 <b>CHAMBER PROCEDURE</b><p>

 The rules of procedure in the Senate differ to a large 
extent from those in the House. The Senate relies heavily on 
the practice of obtaining unanimous consent for actions to be 
taken. For example, at the time that a bill is reported, the 
Senator who is making the report may ask unanimous consent 
for the immediate consideration of the bill. If the bill is 
of a noncontroversial nature and there is no objection, the 
Senate may pass the bill with little or no debate and with 
only a brief explanation of its purpose and effect. Even in 
this instance the bill is subject to amendment by any 
Senator. A simple majority vote is necessary to carry an 
amendment as well as to pass the bill. If there is any 
objection, the report must lie over one day and the bill is 
placed on the calendar.<p>

 Measures reported by standing committees of the Senate may 
not be considered unless the report of that committee has 
been available to Senate Members for at least 2 days 
(excluding Sundays and legal holidays) prior to consideration 
of the measure in the Senate. This requirement, however, may 
be waived by agreement of the majority and minority leaders 
and does not apply in certain emergency situations.<p>

 In the Senate, measures are brought up for consideration by 
a simple unanimous consent request, by a complex unanimous 
consent agreement, by a motion to proceed to the 
consideration of a measure, or by a motion to consider a 
measure on the calendar. A unanimous consent agreement, 
sometimes referred to as a "time agreement", makes the 
consideration of a measure in order and often limits the 
amount of debate that will take place on the measure and 
lists the amendments that will be considered. The offering of 
a unanimous consent request to consider a measure or the 
offering of a motion to proceed to the consideration of a 
measure is reserved, by tradition, to the majority leader.<p>

 Usually a motion to consider a measure on the calendar is 
made only when unanimous consent to consider the measure 
cannot be obtained. There is only one Calendar of Business in 
the Senate, there being no differentiation, as there is in 
the House, between (1) bills raising revenue, general 
appropriation bills, and bills of a public character 
appropriating money or property, and (2) other bills of a 
public character not appropriating money or property.<p>

 The rules of the Senate provide that at the conclusion of 
the morning business for each "legislative day" the Senate 
proceeds to the consideration of the calendar. In the Senate, 
the term "legislative day" means the period of time from when 
the Senate adjourns until the next time the Senate adjourns. 
Because the Senate often "recesses" rather than "adjourns" at 
the end of a daily session, the "legislative day" usually 
does not correspond to the 24-hour period comprising a 
calendar day. Thus, a "legislative day" may cover a long 
period of time--from days to weeks, or even months. Because 
of this and the modern practice of waiving the call of the 
calendar by unanimous consent at the start of a new 
"legislative day", it is rare to have a call of the calendar. 
When the calendar is called, bills that are not objected to 
are taken up in their order, and each Senator is entitled to 
speak once and for 5 minutes only on any question. Objection 
may be interposed at any stage of the proceedings, but on 
motion the Senate may continue consideration after the call 
of the calendar is completed, and the limitations on debate 
then do not apply.<p>

 On any day (other than a Monday that begins a new 
"legislative day"), following the announcement of the close 
of morning business, any Senator obtaining recognition may 
move to take up any bill out of its regular order on the 
calendar. Usually, this is the majority leader. The five-
minute limitation on debate does not apply to the 
consideration of a bill taken up in this manner, and debate 
may continue until the hour when the Presiding Officer of the 
Senate "lays down" the un finished business of the day. At 
that point consideration of the bill is discontinued and the 
measure reverts back to the Calendar of Business and may 
again be called up at another time under the same conditions.<p>

 When a bill has been objected to and passed over on the call 
of the calendar it is not necessarily lost. The majority 
leader, after consulting the majority policy committee of the 
Senate and the minority leadership, determines the time at 
which the bill will be called up for debate. At that time, a 
motion is made to consider the bill. The motion is debatable 
if made after the morning hour.<p>

 Once a Senator is recognized by the Presiding Officer, the 
Senator may speak for as long as the Senator wishes and loses 
the floor only when the Senator yields it or takes certain 
parliamentary actions that forfeit the Senator's right to the 
floor. How ever, a Senator may not speak more than twice on 
any one question in debate on the same legislative day 
without leave of the Senate. Debate ends when a Senator 
yields the floor and no other Senator seeks recognition, or 
when a unanimous consent agreement limiting the time of 
debate is operating.<p>

 On occasion, Senators opposed to a measure may extend debate 
by making lengthy speeches intended to prevent or defeat 
action on the measure. This is the tactic known as 
"filibustering". Debate, however, may be closed if 16 
Senators sign a motion to that effect and the motion is 
carried by three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and 
sworn. Such a motion is voted on without debate on the second 
day after the day it is filed. This procedure is called 
"invoking cloture". In 1986, the Senate amended its rules to 
limit "post-cloture" debate to 30 hours. A Senator may speak 
for not more than one hour and may yield all or a part of 
that time to the majority or minority floor managers of the 
bill under consideration or to the majority or minority 
leader. The Senate may increase the time for "post-cloture" 
debate by a vote of three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen 
and sworn. After the time for debate has expired, the Senate 
may consider certain amendments before voting on the bill.<p>

 While a measure is being considered it is subject to 
amendment and each amendment, including those proposed by the 
committee that reported the bill, is considered separately. 
Generally, there is no requirement that proposed amendments 
be germane to the subject matter of the bill except in the 
case of general appropriation bills. Under the rules, a 
"rider" (an amendment proposing substantive legislation to an 
appropriation bill) is prohibited, but this prohibition may 
be suspended by two-thirds vote on a motion to permit 
consideration of such an amendment on one day's notice in 
writing. Debate on the measure must be germane during the 
first 3 hours after the morning hour unless determined to the 
contrary by unanimous consent or on motion without debate. 
After final action on the amendments the bill is ready for 
engrossment and the third reading, which is usually by title 
only, although if demanded, it must be read in full. The 
Presiding Officer then puts the question on the passage and a 
voice vote (viva voce) is usually taken although a yea-and-
nay vote is in order if demanded by one-fifth of the Senators 
present. A simple majority is necessary for passage. Before 
an amended measure is cleared for its return to the House of 
Representatives (or an unamended measure is cleared for 
enrollment), a Senator who voted with the prevailing side, or 
who abstained from voting, may make a motion within the next 
2 days to reconsider the action. If the measure was passed 
without a recorded vote, any Senator may make the motion to 
reconsider. That motion is usually tabled and its tabling 
constitutes a final determination. If, however, the motion is 
granted, the Senate, by majority vote, may either affirm its 
action, which then becomes final, or reverse it.<p>

 The original engrossed House bill, together with the 
engrossed Senate amendments, if any, is then returned to the 
House with a message stating the action taken by the Senate. 
Where amendments have been made by the Senate the message 
requests that the House concur in them.<p>

  On their return to the House the official papers relating 
to the amended measure are placed on the Speaker's table to 
await House action on the Senate amendments. If the 
amendments are of a minor or noncontroversial nature the 
Chairman of the committee that originally reported the bill--
or any Member--may, at the direction of the committee, ask 
unanimous consent to take the bill with the amendments from 
the Speaker's table and agree to the Senate amendments. At 
this point the Clerk reads the title of the bill and the 
Senate amendments. If there is no objection, the amendments 
are then declared to be agreed to, and the bill is ready to 
be enrolled for presentation to the President. Lacking 
unanimous consent, bills that do not require consideration in 
the Committee of the Whole are privileged and may be called 
up from the Speaker's table by motion for immediate 
consideration of the amendments. A simple majority is 
necessary to carry the motion and thereby complete floor 
action on the measure. A Senate amendment to a House bill is 
subject to a point of order that it must first be considered 
in the Committee of the Whole, if, originating in the House, 
it would be subject to that point.<p>

<b> REQUEST FOR A CONFERENCE</b><p>

 If, however, the amendments are substantial or controversial 
the Member may request unanimous consent to take the bill 
with the Senate amendments from the Speaker's table, disagree 
to the amendments and request a conference with the Senate to 
resolve the disagreeing votes of the 2 Houses. If there is 
objection it becomes necessary to obtain a special resolution 
from the Committee on Rules. However, the Speaker may 
recognize a Member for a motion, authorized by the committee 
having jurisdiction over the subject matter of the bill, to 
disagree to the amendments and ask for a conference. If there 
is no objection to the request, or if the motion is carried, 
the Speaker then appoints the managers (as the conferees are 
called) on the part of the House and a message is sent to the 
Senate advising it of the House action. A majority of the 
Members appointed to be managers must have been supporters of 
the House position, as determined by the Speaker. The Speaker 
must name Members primarily responsible for the legislation 
and must include, to the fullest extent feasible, the 
principal proponents of the major provisions of the bill as 
it passed the House. The Speaker usually follows the 
suggestions of the Chairman of the committee in charge of the 
bill in designating the managers on the part of the House 
from among the Members of the committee. The number is fixed 
by the Speaker and majority party representation generally 
reflects the ratio for the full House committee, but may be 
greater on important bills. Representation of both major 
parties is an important attribute of all our parliamentary 
procedures but, in the case of conference committees, it is 
important that the views of the House on the House measure be 
fully repre sented.<p>

 If the Senate agrees to the request for a conference, a 
similar committee is appointed by unanimous consent by the 
Presiding Officer of the Senate. Both political parties may 
be represented on the Senate conference committee also. The 
Senate and House committees need not be the same size.<p>

 The conference committee is sometimes popularly referred to 
as the "Third House of Congress".<p>

 The request for a conference can be made only by the body in 
possession of the official papers. Occasionally the Senate, 
anticipating that the House will not concur in its 
amendments, votes to insist on its amendments and requests a 
conference on passage of the bill prior to returning the bill 
to the House. This practice serves to expedite the matter 
because several days' time may be saved by the designation of 
the Senate conferees before returning the bill to the House. 
The matter of which body requests the conference is not 
without significance because the one asking for the 
conference acts last on the report to be submitted by the  
conferees.<p>

<b> AUTHORITY OF CONFEREES</b><p>

 Although the managers on the part of each House meet 
together as one committee they are in effect 2 separate 
committees, each of which votes separately and acts by a 
majority vote. For this reason the number of managers from 
each House is largely immaterial.<p>

 The conferees are strictly limited in their consideration to 
matters in disagreement between the 2 Houses. Consequently, 
they may not strike out or amend any portion of the bill that 
was not amended by the Senate. Furthermore, they may not 
insert new matter that is not germane to the differences 
between the 2 Houses. Where the Senate amendment revises a 
figure or an amount contained in the bill, the conferees are 
limited to the difference between the 2 numbers and may not 
increase the greater nor decrease the smaller figure. Neither 
House may alone, by instructions, empower its managers to 
make a change in the text to which both Houses have agreed, 
but the managers for both bodies may be given that authority 
by a concurrent resolution adopted by a majority of each 
House.<p>

 When a disagreement to an amendment in the nature of a 
substitute is committed to a conference committee it is in 
order for the managers on the part of the House to propose a 
substitute which is a germane modification of the matter in 
disagreement, but the introduction of language in that 
substitute presenting a specific additional topic, question, 
issue, or proposition not committed to the conference 
committee by either House does not constitute a germane 
modification of the matter in disagreement. Moreover, their 
report may not include matter not committed to the conference 
committee by either House, nor may their report include a 
modification of any specific topic, question, issue, or 
proposition committed to the conference committee by either 
or both Houses if that modification is beyond the scope of 
that specific topic, question, issue, or proposition as 
committed to the conference committee.<p>

 An amendment by the Senate to a general appropriation bill 
which would be in violation of the rules of the House, if the 
amendment had originated in the House, or an amendment by the 
Senate providing for an appropriation on a bill other than a 
general appropriation bill, may not be agreed to by the 
managers on the part of the House, unless a specific 
authority to agree to such an amendment is given first by the 
House by a separate vote on each specific amendment.<p>

<b> MEETINGS AND ACTION OF CONFEREES</b><p>

 The rules of the House require that conference meetings be 
open, unless the House, in open session, determines by a 
rollcall vote of a majority of those Members voting that all 
or part of the meeting will be closed to the public. When the 
report of the conference committee is read in the House, a 
point of order may be made that the conferees failed to 
comply with the House rule referred to in the preceding 
sentence. If the point of order is sustained, the conference 
report is considered rejected by the House and a new 
conference is  requested.<p>

 There are generally 4 forms of recommendations available to 
the conferees when reporting back to their bodies:<p>

 (1) The Senate recede from all (or certain of) its 
amendments.<p>

 (2) The House recede from its disagreement to all (or 
certain of) the Senate amendments and agree thereto.<p>

 (3) The House recede from its disagreement to all (or 
certain of) the Senate amendments and agree thereto with 
amendments.<p>

 (4) The House recede from all (or certain of) its amendments 
to the Senate amendments.<p>

 In many instances the result of the conference is a 
compromise growing out of the third type of recommendation 
available to the conferees. The complete report may, of 
course, be comprised of any one or more of these 
recommendations with respect to the various amendments. 
Occasionally, the conferees find themselves unable to reach 
an agreement with respect to one or more amendments and 
report back a statement of their inability to agree on those 
particular amendments. These may then be acted upon 
separately. This partial disagreement is, of course, not 
practicable where the Senate strikes out all after the 
enacting clause and substitutes its own bill which must be 
considered as a single amendment.<p>

 If they are unable to reach any agreement whatsoever, the 
conferees report that fact to their respective bodies and the 
amendments are in the position they were before the 
conference was requested. New conferees may be appointed in 
either or both Houses. In addition, the Houses may instruct 
the conferees as to the position they are to take.<p>

 After House conferees on any bill or resolution in 
conference between the 2 bodies have been appointed for 20 
calendar days and have failed to make a report, the rules of 
the House provide for a motion of the highest privilege to 
instruct the House conferees or discharge them and appoint 
new conferees. Further, during the last 6 days of a session 
it is a privileged motion to move to discharge, appoint, or 
instruct House conferees after House conferees have been 
appointed 36 hours without having made a report.<p>

<b>CONFERENCE REPORTS</b><p>

 When the conferees, by majority vote of each group, have 
reached complete agreement (or find that they are able to 
agree with respect to some but not all amendments) they make 
their recommendations in a report made in duplicate that must 
be signed by a majority of the conferees appointed by each 
body. The minority portion of the managers have no authority 
to file a statement of minority views in connection with the 
report. The report is required to be printed in both Houses 
and must be accompanied by an explanatory statement prepared 
jointly by the conferees on the part of the House and the 
conferees on the part of the Senate. The statement must be 
sufficiently detailed and explicit to inform Congress as to 
the effect that the amendments or propositions contained in 
the report will have on the measure to which those amendments 
or propositions relate. The engrossed bill and amendments and 
one copy of the report are delivered to the body that is to 
act first on the report; namely, the body that had agreed to 
the conference requested by the other.<p>

 In the Senate, the presentation of the report always is in 
order except when the Journal is being read or a point of 
order or motion to adjourn is pending, or while the Senate is 
voting or ascertaining the presence of a quorum. When the 
report is received, the question of proceeding to the 
consideration of the report, if raised, is immediately voted 
on without debate. The report is not subject to amendment in 
either body and must be accepted or rejected as an entirety. 
If the time for debate on the adoption of the report is 
limited, the time allotted must be equally divided between 
the majority and minority party. If the Senate, acting first, 
does not agree to the report it may by majority vote order it 
recommitted to the conferees. When the Senate agrees to the 
report, its managers are thereby discharged and it then 
delivers the original papers to the House with a message 
advising that body of its action.<p>

 A report that contains any recommendations which go beyond 
the differences between the 2 Houses is subject to a point of 
order in its entirety. Any change in the text as agreed to by 
both Houses renders the report subject to the point of order 
and the matter is before the House de novo.<p>

 The presentation of the report in the House always is in 
order, except when the Journal is being read, while the roll 
is being called, or the House is dividing on any proposition. 
The report is considered in the House and may not be sent to 
the Committee of the Whole on the suggestion that it contains 
matters ordinarily requiring consideration in that Committee. 
The report may not be received by the House if the required 
statement does not accompany it.<p>

 It is, however, not in order to consider either (1) a 
conference report or (2) an amendment (including an amendment 
in the nature of a substitute) proposed by the Senate to a 
measure reported in disagreement between the 2 Houses, by a 
conference report, that the conferees have been unable to 
agree, until the third calendar day (excluding Saturdays, 
Sundays, and legal holidays) after the report and 
accompanying statement have been filed in the House, and 
consideration then is in order only if the report and 
accompanying statement have been printed in the edition of 
the Congressional Record for the day on which the report and 
statement have been filed. However, these provisions do not 
apply during the last 6 days of the session. Nor is it in 
order to consider a conference report or such an amendment 
unless copies of the report and accompanying statement, 
together with the text of the amendment, have been available 
to Members for at least 2 hours before the beginning of 
consideration. However, it is always in order to call up for 
consideration a report from the Committee on Rules only 
making in order the consideration of a conference report or 
such an amendment notwithstanding the requirement that the 
report and text of the amendment be available for at least 2 
hours before the beginning of consideration. The time 
allotted for debate on a conference report or such an 
amendment is divided equally between the majority party and 
the minority party. However, if the majority and minority 
floor managers both are supporters of the conference report, 
one-third of the debate time must be allotted to a Member who 
is opposed to the conference report. If the House does not 
agree to a conference report that the Senate has already 
agreed to, the report may not be recommitted to conference 
because the Senate conferees are discharged when the Senate 
agrees to the report.<p>

 When a conference report is called up before the House 
containing matter which would be in violation of the rules of 
the House with respect to germaneness if the matter had been 
offered as an amendment in the House, and which is contained 
either (1) in a Senate amendment to that measure (including a 
Senate amendment in the nature of a substitute for the text 
of that measure as passed by the House) and accepted by the 
House conferees or agreed to by the conference committee with 
modification or (2) in a substitute agreed to by the 
conference committee, it is in order, at any time after the 
reading of the report is completed or dispensed with and 
before the reading of the statement, to make a point of order 
that nongermane matter, which must be specified in the point 
of order, is contained in the report. It is also in order to 
make a point of order to nongermane Senate matter in the 
conference report that originally appeared in the Senate bill 
but was not included in the House-passed version. If the 
point of order is sustained, it is then in order for the 
Chair to entertain a motion, that is of high privilege, that 
the House reject the nongermane matter covered by the point 
of order. It is in order to debate the motion for 40 minutes, 
one-half of the time to be given to debate in favor of, and 
one-half in opposition to, the motion. Notwithstanding the 
final disposition of a point of order made with respect to 
the report, or of a motion to reject nongermane matter, 
further points of order may be made with respect to the 
report, and further motions may be made to reject other 
nongermane matter in the conference report not covered by any 
previous point of order which has been sustained. If a motion 
to reject has been adopted, after final disposition of all 
points of order and motions to reject, the conference report 
is considered as rejected and the question then pending 
before the House is whether (1) to recede and concur with an 
amendment that consists of that portion of the conference 
report not rejected or (2) to insist on the House amendment 
with respect to nongermane Senate matter that originally 
appeared in the Senate bill but was not included in the 
House-passed version. If all motions to reject are defeated, 
then, after the allocation of time for debate on the 
conference report, it is in order to move the previous 
question on the adoption of the conference report.<p>

 Similar procedures are available in the House when the 
Senate proposes an amendment to a measure that would be in 
violation of the rule against nongermane amendments, and 
thereafter it is (1) reported in disagreement by a committee 
of conference or (2) before the House and the stage of 
disagreement is reached.<p>

 The amendments of the Senate in disagreement may be voted on 
separately and may be adopted by a majority vote after the 
adoption of the conference report itself as though no 
conference had been had with respect to those amendments. The 
Senate may recede from all amendments, or from certain of its 
amendments, insisting on the others with or without a request 
for a conference with respect to them. If the House does not 
accept the amendments insisted on by the Senate the entire 
conference process begins again with respect to them.<p>

<b> CUSTODY OF PAPERS</b><p>

 The custody of the original official papers is important in 
conference procedure because either body may act only when in 
possession of the papers. As indicated above the request for 
a conference may be made only by the body in possession. The 
papers are then transmitted to the body agreeing to the 
conference and by it to the managers of the House that asked 
for the conference. The latter in turn carry the papers with 
them to the conference and at its conclusion turn them over 
to the managers of the House that agreed to the conference. 
The latter deliver them to their own House, that acts first 
on the report and then delivers the papers to the other House 
for final action on the report.<p>

 Each group of conferees, at the conclusion of the 
conference, retains one copy of the report that has been made 
in duplicate, and signed by a majority of the managers of 
each body--the House copy signed first by the House managers 
and the Senate copy signed first by its managers.<p>

 Obviously a bill cannot become a law of the land until it 
has been approved in identical terms by both Houses of the 
Congress. When the bill has finally been approved by both 
Houses all the original papers are transmitted to the 
enrolling clerk of the body in which the bill originated.<p>

 
 XVI. <a name="bill"><b> BILL ORIGINATING IN SENATE</b></a><p>

  The preceding discussion has described the legislative 
process for bills originating in the House. When a bill 
originates in the Senate, this process is reversed. When the 
Senate passes a bill that originated in the Senate, it is 
sent to the House for consideration. The bill is referred to 
the appropriate House committee for consideration. If the 
committee reports the bill to the full House and if the bill 
is passed by the House without amendment, it is ready for 
enrollment. (See Part XVII.) If the House passes an amended 
version of the Senate bill, the bill is returned to the 
Senate for action on the House amendments. The Senate may 
agree to the amendments or request a conference to resolve 
the disagreement over the House amendments.<p>

 
 XVII. <a name="enrollment"><b>ENROLLMENT</b></a><p>

  When the bill has been agreed to in identical form by both 
bodies--either without amendment by the Senate, or by House 
concurrence in the Senate amendments, or by agreement in both 
bodies to the conference report--a copy of the bill is 
enrolled for presentation to the President.<p>

 The preparation of the enrolled bill is a painstaking and 
important task because it must reflect precisely the effect 
of all amendments, either by way of deletion, substitution, 
or addition, agreed to by both bodies. The enrolling clerk of 
the House (with respect to bills originating in the House) 
receives the original engrossed bill, the engrossed Senate 
amendments, the signed conference report, the several 
messages from the Senate, and a notation of the final action 
by the House, for the purpose of preparing the enrolled copy. 
From these the enrolling clerk must prepare meticulously the 
final form of the bill, as it was agreed to by both Houses, 
for presentation to the President. On occasion there have 
been upward of 500 amendments, particularly after a 
conference, each of which must be set out in the enrollment 
exactly as agreed to, and all punctuation must be in accord 
with the action taken.<p>

 The enrolled bill is printed on parchment paper, with a 
certificate on the reverse side of the last page, to be 
signed by the Clerk of the House stating that the bill 
originated in the House of Representatives (or by the 
Secretary of the Senate when the bill has originated in that 
body). It is examined for accuracy by the Committee on House 
Administration (or by the Secretary of the Senate when the 
bill originated in that body). When the Committee is 
satisfied with the accuracy of the bill the Chairman of the 
Committee attaches a slip stating that it finds the bill 
truly enrolled and sends it to the Speaker of the House for 
signature. All bills, regardless of the body in which they 
originated, are signed first by the Speaker and then by the 
Vice President of the United States, who, under the 
Constitution, serves as the President of the Senate. The 
Speaker of the House may sign enrolled bills whether or not 
the House is in session. The President of the Senate may sign 
bills only while the Senate is actually sitting unless 
advance permission is granted to sign during a recess or 
after adjournment. If the Speaker or the President of the 
Senate is unable to sign the bill, it may be signed by the 
authorized presiding officer of the respective House. After 
both signatures are affixed the bill is returned to the 
Committee for the purpose of being presented to the President 
for action under the Constitution.<p>

 
 XVIII. <a name="presidential"><b> PRESIDENTIAL ACTION</b></a><p>

  Article I, Section 7, of the Constitution provides in part 
that--<p>

 Every Bill which shall have passed the House of 
Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it becomes a 
Law, be presented to the President of the United States.<p>

 
 In actual practice a clerk of the Committee on House 
Administration (or the Secretary of the Senate when the bill 
originated in that body) delivers the original enrolled bill 
to an employee at the White House and obtains a receipt, and 
the fact of the delivery is then reported to the House by the 
Chairman of the Committee. Delivery to a White House employee 
has customarily been regarded as presentation to the 
President and as commencing the 10-day Constitutional period 
for Presidential action.<p>

 Copies of the enrolled bill usually are transmitted by the 
White House to the various departments interested in the 
subject matter so that they may advise the President who, of 
course, cannot be personally familiar with every item in 
every bill.<p>

 If the President approves the bill, he signs it and usually 
writes the word "approved" and the date, although the 
Constitution requires only that the President sign it.<p>

 The Supreme Court has stated that undoubtedly the President 
when approving bills may be said to participate in the 
enactment of laws, which the Constitution requires the 
President to execute.<p>

 The bill may become law without the President's signature by 
virtue of the Constitutional provision that if the President 
does not return a bill with objections within 10 days 
(excluding Sundays) after it has been presented to the 
President, it shall be a law in like manner as if the 
President had signed it. However, if Congress by their 
adjournment prevent its return, it does not become law. The 
latter event is what is known as a "pocket veto", that is, 
the bill does not become law even though the President has 
not sent his objections to the Congress.<p>

 Notice of the signing of a bill by the President is sent 
usually by message to the House in which it originated and 
that House informs the other, although this action is not 
necessary to the validity of the act. The action is also 
noted in the Congressional Record.<p>

 A bill becomes law on the date of approval (or passage over 
the President's veto), unless it expressly provides a 
different effective date.<p>

<b> VETO MESSAGE</b><p>

 By the terms of the Constitution, if the President does not 
approve the bill "he shall return it, with his Objections to 
that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter 
the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to 
reconsider it". It is the usual but not invariable rule that 
a bill returned with the President's objections, must be 
voted on at once and when laid before the House the question 
on the passage is considered as pending. A vetoed bill is 
always privileged, and a motion to take it from the table is 
in order at any time.<p>

 The Member in charge moves the previous question which is 
put by the Speaker, as follows: "The question is, Will the 
House on reconsideration agree to pass the bill, the 
objections of the President to the contrary 
notwithstanding?". The Clerk calls the roll and those in 
favor of passing the bill answer "Aye", and those opposed 
"No". If fewer than two-thirds of the Members present 
(constituting a quorum) vote in the affirmative the bill is 
killed, and a message is usually sent to the Senate advising 
that body of the decision that the bill shall not pass. If, 
however, two-thirds vote in the affirmative, the bill is sent 
with the President's objections to the Senate together with a 
message advising it of the action in the House.<p>

 There is a similar procedure in the Senate where again a 
two-thirds affirmative vote is necessary to pass the bill 
over the President's objections. If then passed by the Senate 
the measure becomes the law of the land notwithstanding the 
objections of the President, and it is ready for publication 
as a binding statute.<p>

 
 XIX. <a name="publication"><b> PUBLICATION</b></a><p>

  One of the important steps in the enactment of a valid law 
is the requirement that it shall be made known to the people 
who are to be bound by it. Obviously, there would be no 
justice if the state were to hold its people responsible for 
their conduct before it made known to them the unlawfulness 
of such behavior. That idea is implicit in the Constitutional 
prohibition against enacting ex post facto laws. In practice, 
our laws are published immediately upon their enactment so 
that they may be known to the people.<p>

 If the President approves a bill, or allows it to become law 
without signing it, the original enrolled bill is sent from 
the White House to the Archivist of the United States for 
publication. If a bill is passed by both Houses over the 
objections of the President the body that last overrides the 
veto likewise transmits it. There it is assigned a public law 
number, and paginated for the Statutes at Large volume 
covering that session of Congress. The public and private law 
numbers run in sequence starting anew at the beginning of 
each Congress, and since 1957 are prefixed for ready 
identification by the number of the Congress--that is, the 
first public law of the 101st Congress is designated Public 
Law 101-1 and the first private law of the 101st Congress is 
designated Private Law 101-1. Subsequent laws of this 
Congress also will contain the same prefix designator.<p>

 <b>SLIP LAWS</b><p>

 The first official publication of the statute is in the form 
generally known as the "slip law". In this form, each law is 
published separately as an unbound pamphlet. The heading 
indicates the public or private law number, the date of 
approval, and the bill number. The heading of a slip law for 
a public law also indicates the United States Statutes at 
Large citation. If the statute has been passed over the veto 
of the President, or has become law without the President's 
signature because he did not return it with objections, an 
appropriate statement is inserted in lieu of the usual 
notation of approval.<p>

 The Office of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration, which prepares the slip laws, 
provides marginal editorial notes giving the citations to 
laws mentioned in the text and other explanatory details. The 
marginal notes also give the United States Code 
classifications, thus enabling the reader immediately to 
determine where the statute will appear in the Code. Each 
slip law also includes an informative guide to the 
legislative history of the law consisting of the committee 
report number, the name of the committee in each House, as 
well as the date of consideration and passage in each House, 
with a reference to the Congressional Record by volume, year, 
and date. A reference to Presidential statements--relating to 
the approval of a bill (or the veto of a bill when the veto 
was overridden and the bill becomes law)--is included in the 
legislative history in the form of a citation to the Weekly 
Compilation of Presidential Documents.<p>

 Copies of the slip laws are delivered to the document rooms 
of both Houses where they become available to officials and 
the public. They may also be obtained by annual subscription 
or individual purchase from the Superintendent of Documents, 
U.S. Government Printing Office.<p>

 Section 113 of title 1 of the United States Code provides 
that slip laws are competent evidence in all the courts, 
tribunals and public offices of the United States, and of the 
several States.<p>

 <b>STATUTES AT LARGE</b><p>

 For the purpose of providing a permanent collection of the 
laws of each session of Congress, the bound volumes (which 
are called the United States Statutes at Large) are prepared 
by the Office of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration. When the latest volume containing the 
laws of the first session of the 101st Congress becomes 
available it will be No. 103 in the series. Each volume 
contains a complete index and a table of contents. From 1956 
through 1976, each volume contained a table of earlier laws 
affected. These tables were cumulated for 1956-1970 and 
supplemented for 1971-1975 in pamphlet form, and discontinued 
in 1976. From 1963 through 1974, each volume also contained a 
most useful table showing the legislative history of each law 
in the volume. This latter table was not included in 
subsequent volumes because, beginning in 1975, the 
legislative histories have appeared at the end of each law. 
There are also extensive marginal notes referring to laws in 
earlier volumes and to earlier and later matters in the same 
volume.<p>

 Under the provisions of a statute originally enacted in 
1895, these volumes are legal evidence of the laws contained 
in them and will be accepted as proof of those laws in any 
court in the United States.<p>

 The Statutes at Large are a chronological arrangement of the 
laws exactly as they have been enacted. There is no attempt 
to arrange the laws according to their subject matter or to 
show the present status of an earlier law that has been 
amended on one or more occasions. That is the function of a 
code of laws.<p>

<b> UNITED STATES CODE</b><p>

 The United States Code contains a consolidation and 
codification of the general and permanent laws of the United 
States arranged according to subject matter under 50 title 
headings, in alphabetical order to a large degree. It sets 
out the current status of the laws, as amended, without 
repeating all the language of the amendatory acts except 
where necessary for that purpose and is declared to be prima 
facie evidence of those laws. Its purpose is to present the 
laws in a concise and usable form without requiring recourse 
to the many volumes of the Statutes at Large containing the 
individual amendments.<p>

 The Code is prepared by the Law Revision Counsel of the 
House of Representatives. New editions are published every 6 
years and cumulative supplements are published after the 
conclusion of each regular session of the Congress.<p>

 Twenty-two of the 50 titles have been revised and enacted 
into positive law, and 2 have been eliminated by 
consolidation with other titles. Titles that have been 
revised and enacted into positive law are legal evidence of 
the law and the courts will receive them as proof of those 
laws. Eventually all the titles will be revised and enacted 
into positive law, and thereafter they will be kept up to 
date by direct amendment.<p>

<H1>The U.S. House of Representatives<BR>
The Legislative Process - Tying it All Together</H1>
<br>
<I>Prepared by U.S. House of Representatives Information Systems.</I>
<HR>
<DL> 
<DD>  "All Legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a
  Senate and House of Representatives."<BR>
  (Article I, Section 1, of the <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/Constitution/Constitution.html">United States Constitution</A>)
</DL>
<P>
The chief function of Congress is the making of laws.  The legislative process comprises a number of steps, and much
information is available from this page concerning the legislation introduced and considered in the 104th Congress.  To
help you understand the information and how it interrelates, a very brief overview of the legislative process within the
House of Representatives is presented below.  There are many aspects and variations of the process which are not
addressed here.  A much more in-depth discussion and presentation of the overall process is available in <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/HOLAM.TXT">How Our Laws Are Made</A>.  Most of the information presented below was excerpted from that Congressional document.
<P>
<BR>
<H3>Forms of Congressional Action</H3>
<P>
The work of Congress is initiated by the introduction of a proposal in one of four principal forms: the bill, the joint
resolution, the concurrent resolution, and the simple resolution.
<P>
<DL>
<DL>
<DT><B>Bills</B>
<DD>  A bill is the form used for most legislation, whether permanent or temporary, general or special, public or
     private.  A bill originating in the House of Representatives is designated by the letters "H.R.",  signifying
     "House of Representatives", followed by a number that it retains throughout all its parliamentary stages.  Bills
     are presented to the President for action when approved in identical form by both the House of Representatives
     and the  Senate.
<DT><B>Joint Resolutions</B>
<DD>   Joint resolutions may originate either in the House of Representatives or in the Senate.  There is little practical
     difference between a bill and a joint resolution.  Both are subject to the same procedure, except for  a joint
     resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution.  On approval of such a resolution by two-thirds of both
     the House and Senate, it is sent directly to the Administrator of General Services for submission to the
     individual states for ratification.  It is not presented to the President for approval.  A joint resolution originating
     in the House of Representatives is designated "H.J.Res." followed by  its individual number.  Joint resolutions
     become law in the same manner as bills.
<DT><B>Concurrent Resolutions</B>
<DD> Matters affecting the operations of both the House of Representatives and Senate are usually initiated by means
     of concurrent resolutions.  A concurrent resolution originating in the House of Representatives is designated
     "H.Con.Res." followed by its individual number.  On approval by both the House of Representatives and
     Senate, they are signed by the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate.  They are not presented to the
     President for action.
<DT><B>Simple Resolutions</B>
<DD> A matter concerning the operation of either the House of Representatives or Senate alone is initiated by a
     simple resolution.  A resolution affecting the House of Representatives is designated "H.Res." followed by its
     number. They are not presented to the President for action.
<P>
</DL>

</DL>
<P>
<BR>
<H3>Introduction and Referral to Committee</H3>
<P>
Any Member in the House of Representatives may  introduce a bill at any time while the House is in session  by simply
placing it in the "hopper" provided for the purpose at the side of the Clerk's desk in the House Chamber.  The  sponsor's
signature must appear on the bill.  A public bill may have an unlimited number of co-sponsoring Members.  The bill is
assigned its legislative number by the Clerk and referred to the appropriate committee by the Speaker, with the
assistance of the Parliamentarian.  The bill is then printed in its introduced form, which you can  read in <A HREF="gopher://wgate.house.gov:70/7waissrc%3A/USHOUSE_house_bill_text_103rd">Bill Text</A> (
See <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/help/bill_text_help_104.html">Help</A> for searching examples).  If a
bill was introduced today, summary  information about it can be found in <A HREF="gopher://wgate.house.gov:70/7waissrc%3A/USHOUSE_bill_status_today">Bill Status Today</A> (
See <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/help/bills_status_today_help.html">Help</A> for searching examples).
<P>
An important phase of the legislative process is the action taken by committees.  It is during committee action that the
most intense consideration is given to the proposed measures; this is also the time when the people are given their
opportunity to be heard.   Each piece of legislation is referred to the committee that has <A HREF = "http://www.house.gov/under_construction.html">jurisdiction</A> over the area
affected by the measure.
<P>
For more information on this step of the legislative process see <A HREF = "gopher://gopher.house.gov:70/0F-1%3A218%3AE.%20Intro%20and%20Reference%20to%20Cmte">Introduction and Reference to Committee</A> of <A HREF="HOLAM.TXT">How Our Laws Are Made</A>.
<P>
<BR>
<H3>Consideration by Committee</H3>
<P>
<DL>
<DL>
  <DT><B>Public Hearings and Markup Sessions</B>
  <DD>Usually the first step in this process is a public hearing, where the committee members hear witnesses representing various viewpoints on the measure.
    Each committee makes public the date, place and subject of
     any hearing it conducts.  The <A HREF="gopher://gopher.house.gov:70/0F-1%3A942%3ACommittee%20Schedules">Committee Meetings</A> scheduled for today are available along with other <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/Schedule.html">House Schedules </A>.
       Public announcements are also published in the Daily Digest portion of the 
       <A HREF = "gopher://wgate.house.gov:70/7waissrc%3A/USHOUSE_cong_record_103-2">Congressional Record</A>.
<P>
     A <A HREF = "http://www.house.gov/under_construction.html">transcript</A> of the testimony taken at a hearing is made available for inspection in the committee office, and
     frequently the complete transcript is printed and distributed by the committee.
<P>
     After hearings are completed, the bill is considered in a session that is popularly known as the "mark-up"
     session.  Members of the committee study the viewpoints presented in detail.  Amendments may be offered to
     the bill, and the committee members vote to accept or reject these changes.
<P>
     This process can take place at either the subcommittee level or the full committee level, or at both.  Hearings
     and markup sessions are status steps noted in the Legislative Action portion of <A HREF="gopher://wgate.house.gov:70/7waissrc%3A/USHOUSE_bill_status_104th">Bill Status</A>. (
     See <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/help/bill_status_help.html">Help</A> for searching examples).
<P>
  <DT><B>Committee Action</B>
  <DD>At the conclusion of deliberation, a vote of committee or subcommittee Members is taken to determine what
     action to take on the measure.  It can be reported, with or without amendment, or tabled, which means no
     further action on it will occur.  If the committee has approved extensive amendments, they may decide to report
     a new bill incorporating all the amendments.  This is known as a "clean bill," which will have a new number. 
     Votes in committee can be found in <A HREF = "http://www.house.gov/under_construction.html">Committee Votes</A>.
<P>
     If the committee votes to report a bill, the <A HREF = "http://www.house.gov/under_construction.html">Committee Report</A> is written.  This report describes the purpose and
     scope of the measure and the reasons for recommended approval.  House Report numbers are prefixed with
     "H.Rpt." and then a number indicating the Congress (currently 104). 
<P>
</DL></DL>
For more  information on bills and resolutions see <A HREF = "gopher://gopher.house.gov:70/1D-1%3A231%3AF.%20Consideration%20by%20Committee">Consideration by Committee</A> in <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/HOLAM.TXT">How Our Laws Are Made</A>.
<P>
<BR>

<H3>House Floor Consideration</H3>
<P>
<DL>
<DL>
   <DD>Consideration of a measure by the full House can be a simple or very complex operation.   In general a measure
     is ready for consideration by the full House after it has been reported by a committee.  Under certain
     circumstances, it may be brought to the Floor directly.
<P>
   <DD>The consideration of a measure may be governed by a "rule."  A rule is itself a simple resolution, which must
     be passed by the House, that sets out the particulars of debate for a specific bill -- how much time will allowed
     for debate, whether amendments can be offered, and other matters. 
<P>
   <DD>Debate time for a measure is normally divided between proponents and opponents.  Each side yields time to
     those Members who wish to speak on the bill.  When amendments are offered, these are also debated and voted upon.  If the House is in session today, you can see a summary of <A HREF="gopher://gopher.house.gov:70/0F-1%3A947%3ACurrent%20Floor%20Proceedings">Current House Floor Proceedings </A>.
<P>
   <DD>After all debate is concluded and amendments decided upon, the House is ready to vote on final passage.  In
     some cases, a vote to "recommit" the bill to committee is requested.  This is usually an effort by opponents to
     change some portion or table the measure.  If the attempt to recommit fails, a vote on final passage is ordered.
<P>
</DL>
</DL>
<H3>Resolving Differences</H3>
<DL>
<DL>
   <DD>After a measure passes in the House, it goes to the Senate for consideration.  A bill must pass both bodies in
     the same form before it can be presented to the President for signature into law.
<P>
   <DD>If the Senate changes the language of the measure, it must return to the House for concurrence or additional
     changes.  This back-and-forth negotiation may occur on the House floor, with the House accepting or rejecting
     Senate amendments or complete Senate text.  Often a conference committee will be appointed with both House
     and Senate members.  This group will resolve the differences in committee and report the identical measure
     back to both  bodies for a vote.  Conference committees also issue reports outlining the final version of the bill.
<P>
<BR>
</DL>
</DL>

<H3>Final Step</H3>
<DL>
<DL>
   <DD>Votes on final passage, as well as all other votes in the House, may be taken by the electronic voting system
     which registers each individual Member's response.  These votes are referred to as Yea/Nay votes or recorded
     votes, and are available in <A HREF = "http://www.house.gov/under_construction.html">House Votes</A> by Bill number, roll call vote number or words describing the reason
     for the vote.
<P>
   <DD>Votes in the House may also be by voice vote, and no record of individual responses is available.
<P>
   <DD>After a measure has been passed in identical form by both the House and Senate, it is considered "enrolled."  It
     is sent to the President who may sign the measure into law, veto it and return it to Congress, let it become law
     without signature, or at the end of a session, pocket-veto it.

       employees, including officeholders:

                  <h2><center>CODE OF ETHICS FOR GOVERNMENT SERVICE</h2></center>

<P>    <b> Any person in Government service should:

<P>    </b><b>1.</b> Put loyalty to the highest moral principals and to
country above loyalty to Government persons, party, or department.

<P>     <b>2.</b> Uphold the Constitution, laws, and legal regulations of
the United States and of all governments therein and never be a party to
their evasion.

<P>     <b>3.</b> Give a full day's labor for a full day's pay; giving to
the performance of his duties his earnest effort and best thought.

<P>     <b>4.</b> Seek to find and employ more efficient and economical
ways of getting tasks accomplished.

<P>     <b>5.</b> Never discriminate unfairly by the dispensing of special
favors or privileges to anyone, whether for remuneration or not; and
never accept for himself or his family, favors or benefits under
circumstances which might be construed by reasonable persons as
influencing the performance of his governmental duties.

<P>     <b>6.</b> Make no private promises of any kind binding upon the
duties of office, since a Government employee has no private word which
can be binding on public duty.

<P>     <b>7.</b> Engage in no business with the Government, either
directly or indirectly which is inconsistent with the conscientious
performance of his governmental duties.

<P>     <b>8.</b> Never use any information coming to him confidentially
in the performance of governmental duties as a means for making private
profit.

<P>     <b>9.</b> Expose corruption wherever discovered.

<P>    <b>10.</b> Uphold these principles, ever conscious that public
office is a public trust.

<P>
	The Rules of the House of the 103rd Congress would be adopted as the rules for the 104th Congress together with the following amendments:<P>
<P>
	Title I.  CONTRACT WITH AMERICA: A BILL OF ACCOUNTABILITY<P>
<P>
[Note: Each section below in Title I would be under a separate introductory paragraph adopting House Rules from the 103rd Congress as the Rules of the 104th Congress with the additional amendment(s) in the section, thereby permitting a division of the question and separate debate and vote on each of the 8 Contract items.  The 23 items in Title II, on the other hand, would be subject to a single vote.]<P>
<P>
	Sec. 101.  Committee, Subcommittee and Staff Reforms:  Committee staff in the 104th Congress is reduced by at least one-third from comparable levels in the 103rd Congress.  No committee could have more than 5 subcommittees (except Appropriations which could have no more than 13; Government Reform and Oversight, no more than 7; and Transportation and Infrastructure, no more than 6).  Statutory and investigative staff salary authorization levels would be consolidated in a single, 2-year committee expense resolution (except for the Committee on Appropriations).  The distinction between professional and clerical staff would be eliminated while retaining the overall core staff of 30 for each committee (20-majority, 10-minority, or a one-third guarantee to the minority if less than 30).  Committee chairmen would be required to ensure that sufficient staff is made available to each subcommittee to exercise its responsibilities under committee rules, including fair treatment to the minority in subcommittee staffing.  Interim funding authority for House committees, consistent with planned staff reductions, would be provided pending the adoption of the primary expense resolution for 1995-96.<P>

<P>
	Sec. 105.  Committee Sunshine Rules:  Committee meetings, which can now be closed for any reason, could only be closed by majority rollcall vote if disclosure would endanger national security, compromise sensitive law enforcement information, or tend to defame, degrade or incriminate any person. Broadcast coverage of any committee or subcommittee meeting or hearing open to the public would be a right (not requiring a vote of approval as at present).<P>
<P>
	Sec. 106.  Limitations on Tax Increases: (a)  No bill, joint resolution, amendment or conference report carrying an income tax rate increase, could be considered as passed or agreed to unless so determined by a vote of at least three-fifths of the House.

<P>
	Sec. 208.  Prohibition on Committee Meetings During House Consideration of Amendments: No committee (except the Committees on Appropriations, Rules, Standards and Ways and Means) could sit while the House is reading a measure for amendment under the five- minute rule without special leave (which shall be granted unless 10 members object), or unless upon the adoption of a motion offered by the majority leader which shall be privileged.

Non-emergency items could not be reported or offered as amendments to emergency spending bills (except to rescind budget authority or reduce direct spending to pay for the emergency benefits).  Off-setting, deficit neutral amendments could be offered en bloc to any appropriations measure.

<P>
	Sec. 221.  Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence:  The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence would be reduced in size from 19 to 16 members, with a 9-7 majority to minority ratio. Member terms would be increased from three to four and the chairman and ranking minority member could serve a fifth term if they held those positions for only one Congress.  The Speaker (currently the majority leader) and minority leader would serve as ex officio, non-voting members, and may designate a member of their leadership staff to assist them and have access to committee proceedings and materials, as if committee staff, subject to the same security clearance and confidentiality requirements as committee staff.

<BODY background="/townhall/background.jpg" BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><H2>THE 1996 REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION</CENTER></H2>
<BR>
 Although the Founding Fathers warned against partisan party politics, US political history has taken a different course.  Partisan strife has evolved from the 1790's with the Anti-Federalists vs. the Federalists to the the current day two party division.  National nominating <a href="http://www.rnc.org/convention/history.html">conventions</a> 
have historically been the clearest demonstration and showcase of party politics and they continue to be a staple in American politics even today.  Political conventions, held by numerous parties beginning in the 1820's and 30's, underscored the fervent party politics of the past and created the traditions we witness every fourth summer.  <p>
In 1856, after only two years in existence, the Republican Party held its first nominating national convention in Philadelphia.  Since that time the Republican National Convention has grown from a delegate count of 600 to approximately. 2500 and attracted the interest of the public and media along the way.  This year's GOP faithfuls will arrive in San Diego, CA for the <a href="http://www.rnc.org/convention">1996 Republican National Convention</a> (Aug. 12-15) and, as expected, debate the key issues in the campaign in the hopes of creating a successful winning platform for the nominee.  Come the 15th the balloons will be on the ground, the money will have been spent and the reporters will go home, but the candidate and the platform which depart the San Diego Convention Center victorious will serve as historical reminders of this important political tradition.<p>
The convention, throughout the years, has provided an opportunity to define the GOP, and at times change the course of its ideological direction.	In 1964 the convention nominated arch-conservative Barry Goldwater, and despite his loss in the general election, spearheaded the influx of conservatives into the national political sphere and culture.  This, some say, contributed to the careers of many prominent conservatives and the the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980.  Speeches, of course, are the main centers of attraction at the convention and they have historically done the most to altar the direction of the party.  From Lincoln to Buchanan, the words said at the podium have left an everlasting impression at each convention since 1856. <p>  
The main issues this year center around familiar areas of debate: abortion, taxes, education and  a host of other economic and social concerns.  The question still remains whether a conservative agenda will arise as the dominate ideology in the platform. Recently, conservatives in the GOP have been fighting for a traditional GOP platform, one which is sensitive to the changing times as well as preserving core conservative values.  Only the results of the convention will tell which direction the Republican party is heading.  <p>

<center><h2>On The Job in D.C.</h2></center>

<h5>[ <a href="/townhall/spotlights/interns/7-10-96/">Graphics On</a> ]</h5>






<p><br><b>What To Expect</b><br>
Working in Washington in D.C. as an intern is not glamorous. Interns 
invariably get the jobs that no one else in the office wants; that's why 
they hire interns. Licking postage stamps, sorting diskettes, running 
errands, and other sometimes monotonous activities are par for the 
course.
<table><tr>
<td>



</td><td>
<center><h3>Important Mindless Skills To Cultivate</h3>
</center>
<ul>
<li>photo-copying
<li>faxing
<li>delivering messages 
<li>stuffing envelopes
<li>filing
<li>kissing up to the boss
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><i>How the rest of the employees view interns.</i></td></tr></table>

<HR>
<p>Fortunately, there are brief moments of interesting activities 
interspersed between the doldrums. Be careful to not discount activities
that may be beneficial in gaining more responsibility; doing a poor
job on one task does not recommend you to more interesting activities.
Not everyone can make policy decisions or author position papers.
If your job is kind of boring to start just live with it; things will improve.
<p>
The office staff will most likely enjoy having some one around to do the grunt 
work, but do not expect them to invite you out to lunch. Watch and learn are intern 
necessities; on the job training is a fundamental feature of an internship. Make sure 
you pick up skills from co-workers; sometimes there is a much easier process for accomplishing mindless tasks.
<hr>

<h3>Ten Worst Washinton D.C. <br>Intern Positions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Fry cook for Bill Clinton.
<li>Marion Barry's Pharmacist
<li>Ted Kennedy's Chauffeur
<li>Tree trimmer for Al Gore
<li>Accountant for Al D'Amato
<li>Newt's Dietician
<li>Hillary's Psychic Channeler
<li>Political Correctness Tutor for Jesse Helms
<li>Personal Trainer for Strom Thurmond
<li>Bob Dole's Campaign Manager
</ol></td>




</tr></table>
<hr>

<p><br>




<b>Caveats</b><br>
<ol>
<li>Be on time- The only thing worse than D.C. traffic in the mornings is D.C. 
traffic in the evenings. Allow a time cushion or face the consequences. 
<li>Dress nicely- Unlike in Seattle, grunge is not regarded as a viable
fashion option in D.C.
<li>Don't whine- Interns willingly enlist in peonage for the summer; 
the bottom rung on the ladder is not the place for grandstanding.
<li>Be respectful- Especially to people who you don't know. It's not always obvious 
who's a big shot. (example: Who in their right mind in 1990 would have thought Slick Willie would become President?)

<blockquote> 
Scandal and corruption in politics has become, unfortunately, something that the public has grown accustomed to.  However, even the numbest and most cynical citizens have been overwhelmed by the criminal activities of the unscrupulous Clinton White House.  From Whitewater, to Travel-Gate, to the recent discovery of the misuse of FBI files, the American public has been witness to a seemingly endless stream of information concerning the illegal escapades of the Clinton administration.<p>  
Because the onslaught of information has been so relentless, so complicated, we here at Town Hall thought it might be useful to present a list of Clinton personnel who have been accused or convicted of wrong doing.  The following is exactly that, with especially bad little monkeys being marked with a banana next to their names.<p>
The information for this spotlight was provided courtesy of <a href="http://dolphin.gulf.net">Washington Weekly</a>, an Internet publication dedicated to presenting both unbiased news and boldly conservative editorials.  Our special thanks go out to them for their help on this project.<center><p>

<H2><CENTER>Internet Law and the Communications Decency Act</CENTER></H2>

<h5>[<a href="/townhall/spotlights/6-13-96/">Graphics On</a>]</h5>



<p>
<blockquote>
The first blow against government control of the Internet was struck on Wednesday, June 12, when a three judge panel in Philadelphia unanimously ruled that the <a href="http://www.seamless.com/rcl/iplaw/decact.html">Communications Decency Act</a> was in violation of the First Amendment.  The case could go to the Supreme Court as soon as next fall, if the Justice Department decides to appeal, and it is clear that this issue will not be decided in any definitive way until it is adjudicated upon by the highest court in the land. 
<p>
The controversy began when the White House signed the <a href="http://www.technologylaw.com/techlaw/act.html">Telecommunications Bill of 1996</a> on February 8 of this year.  Included as an addendum was the Communications Decency Act, sponsored by <a href="http://www.senate.gov/senator/exon.html">Senator Exon</a> (D-Nebraska), which formally restricts "indecent" material transmitted on the Internet.  This material is specifically defined by the Act as "any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication which is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent, with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass."  This issue united both sides of congress and passed by an overwhelming majority in both the House and the Senate.  
<p>
However, despite the apparently clear cut nature of the issue in the minds of the members of congress, a number of people were outraged by the passage of the Act.  Internet, free speech, and human rights groups began immediately protesting and filing <a href="http://ruby.ils.unc.edu/~koyam/lawsuit.html">lawsuits</a>.  A number of Internet users altered their Web pages, changing their backgrounds to black, or displaying blue ribbons, as a sign of protest and solidarity.  Congress heard testimony from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/corpinfo/bill-g.htm">Bill Gates</a>, representatives of the <a href="http://www.aclu.org">ACLU</a>, and others, but were unswayed by the arguments against censorship.
<p> 
And that is what this issue is really all about.  Do the citizens of the United States really want the government to intervene on their behalf and protect them from things that they shouldn't see?  The issue is further complicated by the fact that the Act was intended to protect the many children who utilize the Internet daily, and because of the extreme obscenity of the material available on the Internet.  People have been divided along the traditional lines of the First Amendment debate: those who feel the right to free "speech" must be protected above all else, and those who feel that they have a right and a duty to control the disbursement of material which they find to be grossly offensive.  Obviously, this is a complex issue with powerful arguments being made by both sides, but as it stands, those opposing censorship have won the first battle of what looks to be a long and grueling war over the valuable territory of Cyberspace.

<h2>The Minimum Wage and Election-Year Politics</h2>
</center>

</h5>



<P>With House passage of the minimum wage bill (HR 1227) two weeks ago, the Democrats have proven successful in their attempts to find their voice for the upcoming '96 elections.  Although the Democrats had the opportunity to raise the minimum wage when they were in the majority during the first two years of the Clinton presidency, they chose not to.  They knew that the increase does more harm than good for the poor working families they claim to represent.  But now, with the elections a few months away, it is time to play politics by blaming American businesses and gaining favor with voters.  The Democrats have managed to dredge up one of their favorite liberal pet issues in the minimum wage debate.</p>

<p>On May 23, House Republicans stood divided over the minimum wage issue.  As reported by <i>Congressional Quarterly</i>, the final vote was 281-144 for a bill that increases the federal minimum wage from $4.25 to $4.75 an hour effective July 1, and then to $5.15 an hour a year later.  In all, this is a 21% increase in the wage.  Ninety-three Republicans broke ranks with the conservative House leadership to vote with 187 Democrats in agreement with the measure.  The debate on this issue is not over; this week the bill goes to the more deliberative Senate.  Nothing would please the Democrats more than to have this issue alive up until the November elections.</p>

<p>Why does an increase in the minimum wage hurt American workers more than it is intended to help?  Conservatives refer to prominent economic studies which, according to the <a href="/sbsc/">Small Business Survival Committee</a>, continually conclude that increasing the minimum wage has a direct result in the decrease of the number of entry-level employment opportunities.  "The General Accounting Office, the 
<a href="http://www.brook.edu/">Brookings Institution</a>, the Employment Policies Institute Foundation, the Congressional Budget Office and 
various presidential commission's have all reached this universal conclusion," reports the <a href="/sbsc/">Small Business Survival Committee.</a></p>

<p><a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation's</a> Mark Wilson points out several reasons why the "emotionally appealing" arguments for an increase in the minimum wage are misleading.  For one, increasing the wage will raise the price of consumer goods and eliminate over 200,000 entry-level jobs by 1999.  In addition, a higher wage does not help low income households on the whole, when you consider that over one-half of those individuals who earn the minimum wage are teenagers and spouses living in well-to-do families.  What's more, an increased minimum wage fails to help poor working families when, "of the 23.5 million Americans in poor families, just over 2 percent are working and paid $4.25 an hour."</p>  

<p>Conservatives take a different approach toward raising the level of take home pay for all American workers.  That is, getting the government out of the way of small businesses in terms of the excessive taxes, regulations, and mandates which hamper productivity and growth.  Mark Wilson lists items of the conservative policy: "cut payroll taxes . . . cut the capital gains tax . . . balance the budget . . . increase the skills of the future work force . . . increase the skills of the current work force . . . and enact regulatory reform."  These measures remove the burdensome barriers currently faced by small businesses, allowing them to accomplish extraordinary things in contributing to a robust economy.</p>

<H2> Getting an Internship in Washington, DC </H2>

<blockquote>





<p>

So you want to be an intern in Washington, DC?  The key to having an enjoyable internship experience is finding one in an area that you are interested in.  A genuine interest in the work of your office will enable you to maintain your sanity while executing many mundane tasks.  In this spotlight, I will give some pointers on why anyone would ever consider interning and how to go about finding a position that you will enjoy.  These are not just tips from a creative mind, but from an intern here at <a href="/townhall/">Town Hall</a>.  This summer marks my third internship experience, so I figure I'm qualified to give advice on this matter.  Looking back, I realize how much I have benefited from my experiences and how little I knew about finding a position when I first got started.  I hope that you will find this information beneficial.

<p>Interning can be an immeasurable benefit to an academic and vocational development.  Whether an internship involving an area related to your academic concentration, or just an interesting diversion, it can give you experience and contacts for future job searches.  At the same time, you will be able to see how the real world works.  Your experience may guide you along your educational trail or abruptly halt it and point you in the opposite direction, but the more you find out about the job market the better off you will be. <p>





While enhancing your education greatly, most internships will hurt you financially.  I would estimate that nearly three out of every four internships are unpaid, particularly in Washington, DC.  And many of the paid positions will not provide enough income to cover your living expenses.  To make matters worse, the internships that are paid are also the most competitive.  Long story short, nobody gets rich interning.  It's an investment in the future; down the road, the financial toll of your internship experience will be rewarded with a well paid job.<p>

There are ways to ease the financial burden.  One of the most popular is to find friends or family in the Washington, DC area.  Not only will your housing expenses disappear, you should be able to mooch numerous meals.  There are also scholarship opportunities out there for those in need; so search them out.  Also, there are many free meal opportunities in the District.  Keep your eyes open for receptions with food.  They're everywhere, just look for them. <p>





If you are willing to put the time in to looking for an internship, there will almost certainly be one that suits your interest.  Washington, DC is ripe with internship opportunities in every field of interest.  The most difficult part is getting started.  I found that searching for what's available was the easiest way to start.  Finding the opportunities that are available will motivate you to put together the necessary paper work.  There are many places to look:

<p> <ul> <li>Who do you know?  Family and friends are often the best sources of internship opportunities.  Figure out who you know and where they work.

<li>There are <a href="http://www.carleton.edu/campus/career/bibliography.html">books</a> which list internship opportunities.  I recommend Peterson's Guide to Internships. 

<li>Keep an eye out for internship opportunities in magazines and newspapers.  Check the classifieds.

<li>Look into the <a href="http://www.american.edu/other.depts/washsem_worldcaps/">American University Internship Program</a> for a summer in Washington, DC.  For a fee, they will help you find a place to work, provide you with housing, and usually you will be able to get course credit.

<li>Go to your career center at school.  Most schools provide some kind of assistance for finding internships.  Be careful not to limit yourself to what your school recommends.  There are many more opportunities available than just what your school will point you towards.

<li>Search the web.  There are numerous sources out there.  I found a few, but this is not a comprehensive list.
<a href="http://www.fga.com/twc/intern.html">The Washington Center</a>, 
<a href="/heritage/intern_program/intern.html">The Heritage Foundation</a>,
<a href="http://www.med.ufl.edu/oihp/students/intern.html">National Council for International Health</a>,
<a href="http://www.tvjobs.com/intern.htm">Radio and Television Internship Opportunities</a>,
<a href="http://www.si.edu/youandsi/ofgfel.htm">The Smithsonian Institution Opportunities</a>,
<a href="http://www.americanexpress.com/student/moneypit/getjob/intern/intern.html">American Express University</a>,
<a href="/discovery/educate.html">The Discovery Institute</a>,
<a href="/conservative/intern.html">American Conservative Union</a>,
<a href="/lead-inst/eps.html">The Leadership Institute</a></ul>

It is essential to apply to several internships that you are interested in, as the competition is fierce, especially in the summer.

<p>Once you have composed a list of internship opportunities that you would like, you are ready to put together the necessary materials.  At the very least you will need a <a href="/townhall/spotlights/interns/6-7-96/resume.html">resume</a> and <a href="/townhall/spotlights/interns/6-7-96/coverltr.html">cover letter</a>.  The key to a good resume and cover letter is to distinguish yourself.  Emphasize any experiences, accomplishments, leadership positions, etc. that will set you apart.  In addition, if you are applying to different types of positions you may want to emphasize different experiences and accomplishments accordingly.

<p>You will often be asked to submit additional information, such as a transcript, writing samples, recommendations, and applications.  Recommendations can be very helpful, depending on who writes them.  This is partly luck, but try to find someone that has a talent for emphasizing and/or creating your special talents.  In a writing sample, look for something that relates to the work of the office you are interested in.  In addition, originality is good.  These people will see many writing samples, make yours stand out.  Keep in mind it doesn't have to be a paper, I found that brochures and advertisements I created for a previous job worked well.  The key is to make your materials as personal as possible.  It is important to give the impression that you are putting a lot of effort into the materials you send.  The process can be time consuming and frustrating.  However, it is definitely worth the effort.

<p>After you have submitted all the necessary materials, you may be contacted for an interview.  Interviews are a nerve-racking experience for most people.  The key is to be yourself.  After all, the purpose of the interview is for your potential employer to get to know you.  At the same time, keep in mind what they want to here.  Do the little things that can impress them.  Pay attention to name, highlight experiences that relate to the work they have described, and anything else that will help.  It may take some practice to figure out what to do.  To get a start, try this <a href="http://www.kaplan.com/career/hotseat/"> practice interview</a>.


<p>Good luck with your internship search.  If you have any questions feel free to <a href="mailto:njg9b@virginia.edu">email </a> me.

<H2>Medicare: The Sequel</H2>
</center>







<h5>[ <a href="/townhall/spotlights/6-4-96/">Graphics On</a> ]</h5>



<blockquote>

<P>On Wednesday, June fifth, the battle over Medicare will begin
anew.  On that day, the Medicare trustees are expected to release
a report showing that Medicare is going broke even faster than
was reported last year.  This means that a solution to the Medicare
dilemma is more urgent than ever.

<P>We are all aware of the bitter fight that occurred last summer
over Medicare.  Led by the <A HREF="http://www.aarp.org">AARP</A>,
the <A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov">Clinton Administration</A>
and the <A HREF="http://aflcio.org">AFL-CIO</A>, a media scare-campaign
was conducted, the likes of which had never been seen before.  Recently 
on C-Span, House Speaker <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/mbr_dir/GA06.html">
Newt Gingrich</A> declared that Medicare ads designed to scare 
85-year olds were and are “despicable.”  And that is just what these
groups tried to do: scare the elderly away from the reform proposals
of the Republicans.

<P>What these “great defenders” of the elderly neglected to mention was the
fact that when Medicare goes bankrupt, no one will have Medicare.  Instead,
liberals lied atrociously, claiming that a Republican-proposed 6.7% growth
in Medicare per year was actually a “draconian” cut that would starve the
elderly, and was proposed in order to pay for tax breaks for the rich.  
Eventually, the terror efforts were successful: although Congress succeeded
in passing <A HREF="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/L?d104:./list/
d104sh.lst:341[341-342](Medicare_Preservation_Act_of_1995">Medicare Reform
</A>, Clinton vetoed it.  Even <A HREF="http://www.washingtonpost.com">The 
Washington Post</A> lamented that nothing would be done to help save the 
entitlement program.

<P>The arguments won’t change this time around.  John Sweeney, president of
the AFL-CIO, has already launched a 35 million dollar campaign and a <A HREF=
"http://www.townhall.com/townhall/spotlights/6-3-96">"union summer"</A> 
against Republicans.  Adding Republican support of Medicare Reform to his 
list of complaints would suit him fine.  And the AARP receives so much funding
from the federal government (to the tune of seventy-six million dollars)
that swatting down Republican efforts can be done with what must seem to 
them spare change.  

<P>But we cannot let them win this time.

<P>The reforms that Republicans are proposing would substantially improve
the current Medicare system.  Perhaps most important would be granting 
recipients of Medicare the option of choosing from either private plans or
the government program.  Another important reform would be altering the way
benefits from Medicare are distributed: rather than an open-ended system 
which delivers a certain set of benefits, the new program would send a 
defined amount of money in the form of a voucher to recipients, that they
might spend the money as they chose.  Both of these measures would allow 
for greater consumer choice and, through competition, reduce the costs of 
Medicare without reducing the quality of services provided.

<P>For the sake of both the elderly today and the elderly tomorrow, we cannot
lose this fight. Regardless of the political consequences, be they good or
bad, our politicians are called first to serve this nation: they must ignore
the PAC scare-campaigns and enact solutions to our most important problems.
Caving in on Medicare would be a sign of a nation’s leaders adrift in 
extraordinary political impotence.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Big labor is on the move this summer.  On Saturday, June 1, the <a href="http://www.aflcio.org">AFL-CIO</a> is kicking off 
their <a href="http://www.aflcio.org/usummer">"Union Summer"</a> campaign.  The program involves young workers and college students who will organize union campaigns and direct liberal political efforts.  To help workers find their "voice" against "today’s profit-crazed corporations," Union Summer 
participants will work in locations around the country to raise support for their cause.</p>  

<p>This activist program represents the labor unions' latest efforts in attacking corporate 
America and feeding misinformation to honest, hard-working Americans.  In the past few 
weeks, the labor unions rolled out an aggressive ad campaign which supported an 
increase in the minimum wage.  The campaign was directed toward House Republicans in 
districts with high union membership.  With the House passage of the minimum wage a 
few weeks ago, these attack ads had a direct impact on the outcome.</p>  

<p>In her article entitled, <a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/columnists/schlafly/schl030796.html">"Looking Out for Union Politicking in Congressional Campaigns,"</a> Phyllis Schlafly, president of Eagle Forum, has followed the union tactics and how the AFL-CIO plans to spend $35 million on an ad campaign "to defeat 75 Republican Congressmen in the 1996 November elections."  This amount of money spent on advertising is seven times more than is regularly spent in federal elections.  An <a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/columnists/duplantier/dupl032596.html">F.R. Duplantier column</a> provides further insights into the unions’ heavy investment in ad campaigns for the upcoming elections.</p>     

<p>The good news is that some television stations across the country have either refused to 
air or eventually pulled the advertisements from their rotation, according to the National 
Republican Congressional Committee.  In one instance, on May 25, the Evansville 
Courier reported how the WEVV-44 television station canceled AFL-CIO commercials 
which criticized US Rep. John Hostettler because the ads were false, accusing the 
Congressman "of cutting Medicare and student loans."  Skip Simms, WEVV-44 general 
manager, said, "We felt the statement in the ad was not true, therefore we pulled it.  The 
information the AFL-CIO provided us to support the statement was pretty weak."  Other 
freshman Republican Congressmen who have been on the union’s "hit list" include 
Edward Whitfield (KY), Todd Tiahrt (KS), James Longley Jr.(ME), Jon Christensen (NE), and 
Randy Tate (WA).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.townhall.com/sbsc/">The Small Business Survival Committee</a> (SBSC) has written extensively on other tactics and strategies of the labor unions (i.e. Republican attack ads, mismanagement of union 
dues).  The May 23 issue of SBSC’s <a href="http://www.townhall.com/sbsc/laborwatch/lw-14.html">Labor Watch</a> covers how the National Education Association (NEA) and the American Federation of Teachers just finished their strategy session, setting a liberal legislative agenda for the ‘96 elections.  According to Labor Watch, the NEA’s tax-and-spend policies would "increase the size of government by nearly 40%; . . . most of the issues on their list have little or nothing to do with education."</p>  

<p>According to <a href="http://www.townhall.com/abb/">Americans for a Balanced Budget</a> (ABB), AFL-CIO’s president, John Sweeney, fails to represent his rank-and-file members in the union.  In a <a href="http://www.townhall.com/abb/pr/043096.html">poll Frank Luntz 
conducted for ABB</a>, union members overwhelmingly were in favor of Medical Savings Accounts, a balanced budget, and tax cuts.  Sweeney’s blatant disregard for the views of the rank-and-file members illustrates his "leftward views and desire to return the Congress back to Democrat control."<p/>

<p>What’s alarming about Union Summer is that the AFL-CIO is now getting young people involved in their misinformation campaign.  According to AFL-CIO president Sweeney, he will use 1,000 young workers and college students to build the new grassroots campaign by having them "planning, phone calling, door knocking, organizing, and demonstrating."  <a href="http://www.townhall.com/sbsc/laborwatch/lw-11.html">Labor Watch</a> reports their movement will focus on "minimum wage fights at the state and local level, and agitating against the California Civil Rights Institute."  The students involved will work three weeks at a time, receiving "training, free housing, and a stipend of $210 a week."</p>

<html><title>Spotlight on Welfare Reform</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<h2><Center>Welfare Reform in the 104th Congress:<br>Will it happen?</h2>
<hr>
<a href="#welfare">Spotlight on Welfare</a><br></center><P>
During the 1992 campaign, President Clinton promised to reform "welfare as we know it".  So far has failed to live up to his promise.  Will he sign the welfare reform bill into law if the Republican Congress passes it?
<p>
This week, the <b>Town Hall Spotlight</b> will focus on the issue of welfare reform and the welfare bills making their way through Congress.<p>
After an 87-12 affirmative vote in the Senate last week, the welfare reform bill moves to a conference committee where large differences between the two bills must be worked out.  The house bill contains many good provisions to prevent illegitimacy and promote individual responsibility.  The Senate version has been gutted of most of these measures by the liberals so a struggle in conference committee is inevitable.<p>
The looming questions are; will the Republicans be able to come to a consensus on a welfare reform bill, and more importantly, will President Clinton sign it.<P>

<H2>The Great "Train Wreck" on Pennsylvania Avenue:<BR>
The Debate over the 1996 Budget</CENTER></H2>
<HR><center><a href="#Misc">Spotlight on the Budget Battle</a></center>
<P>
If you listen to the rhetoric coming out of Washington D.C. these days, you might think that a natural disaster was bearing down on our nation's capitol.  What is actually happening is quite the opposite.<p>
This Week the <b>Town Hall Spotlight</b> will focus on the issues constituting the budget battle.<P>
As opposed to past years, where the Congress has been irresponsible, the 104th Congress is taking on the tough choices in order to achieve a balanced budget.  Conservatives are in control of the purse-strings and do not plan to let go.  In fact,  Republican leadership has taken a "no-summits" stance in order to avoid the catastrophe that ruined George Bush in 1990.<p>
Because there is little chance of the Congress passing appropriations bills that the President will sign before October, the President must be willing to give in on spending levels or risk a government shut-down. It may sound like a natural disaster to many liberals whose policies are being scrutinized, but conservatives cannot help but enjoy having the upper-hand in the big debate.  When October 1st goes by, Clinton will have to convince the Congress to pass  continuing resolutions in order to keep the federal government working.  As long as the Republicans do not give in,  America will come out of this budget battle having taken the biggest step toward fiscal responsibility in decades.<p>
Throughout the week,  Town Hall will be releasing several spotlights brought to you by the many conservative organizations that make up Town Hall.

<h2>Education: A Conservative Primer <br>
</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
This week Town Hall is pleased to bring you an exclusive spotlight on education in America.  
<p>
Everyone agrees that the success of the tomorrow's Americans is dependant on a good education today; however, the type of education is an ongoing debate between liberals and conservatives.
<p>
No one disagrees that educational progress in the last thirty years is embarrassing.  Low test scores and rankings as compared to other countries, poor discipline in the classroom and violence in school have been the results of liberal ideology on the school system.  Instead of focusing on the immediate purpose of primary education--educating our youth in history, mathematics, social science, and language-- enlightened members of academia have determined that diversity, multicultural curriculum, and self-esteem programs represent the true focus of the American educational experience.  
<p>
What is the solution? Well, in Town Hall's exclusive spotlight this week, you'll discover that leading conservative organizations have developed numerous programs to combat the current state of American education.  Along with raising standards and restoring a sense of order and discipline in the classroom, other policies include school choice, market-based reform, and privatization.  Best of all, these policies are now the central components of the ongoing debate, which is a victory in itself for conservatives.

<H2>What YOU Should Know About the Congress as they Reconvene
to Debate their Fall Agenda</CENTER></H2>
<HR>

<P>
The 104th Congress' Fall session is peeking its head around the
corner and hopefully America is looking. The last full session
of the year has historically been a provider of memorable moments
in our nation's legislature. This year will not disappoint. Issues
such as welfare reform, Medicaid, Medicare, education legislation
and the United States' involvement in the Bosnian civil war will
be discussed until the time the autumn leaves give way to winter
snow.
<P>
In our representative democracy an educated populace is imperative.  The result is a public with
informed, yet differing, opinions. The theory behind a representative democracy
is that citizens, out of their own free will and privilege, vote another citizen to represent them in
our nation's capital. Understanding the political process is essential if we are to hold politicians
accountable. When public opinion coalesces into consensus, legislators take notice.  <p>

The problem is that private citizens are
just that--private. They work, provide for their families, spend
time with their loved ones and raise their children. Many simply don't have the time to acquire,
much less absorb, the mass of information detailing how the system works and impacts their
lives.
<P>
For your convenience, Town Hall has assembled a guide to the 104th Congress and how
legislation becomes law.  Democracy is fragile.  It is absolutely necessary that it be nurtured by
private citizens.  It has never been easier.

<title>TH Spotlight on Leader:  Congressman Dick Armey</title>

<h2><i>TH Spotlight on The Leader</i></h2>
</center>
Some say that true statesmanship is dead in America.  But sometimes there is an exception to the rule.  Whether championing the flat-tax proposal, writing his book, "The Freedom Revolution" or pushing the <i>Contract with America</i> through Congress, Representative Dick Armey is a true leader.  Consistently advancing the ideas of Ronald Reagan -- less government, more freedom, lower taxes and strong families -- Armey is in the vanguard of the "conservative revolution."
<p>
This week's Town Hall Spotlight focuses on the first Republican Majority Leader since 1954.  Town Hall has selected the speeches which get to the core of Armey's philosophy.  Bashing the "arrogant political order," and declaring that now is "not a moment for the timid,"  Armey is paving the way towards a true "Freedom Revolution."  Find out why Empower America's Vin Weber describes him as, "a one-man think tank in cowboy boot."

<br>
8/7/95
<br>
<br>
	I had a problem this week.  With the Waco and Whitewater Hearings, the tax debate, Medicare negotiations, and Bosnia going on, I couldn't decide what I should write.  After spending a solid 5 minutes thinking, I decided to write about Town Hall's new programming schedule.<p>

	Starting Monday, August 7, Town Hall will implement a new programming schedule.  The first component is entitled the <b>Spotlight</b>. A new one will appear each Monday and will focus on an issue, event, organization, or person.  After reading a Spotlight, you will be able to enter a special Forum where you can debate the issues with other Town Hall users.  (It is still under construction so please use the regular Forum to discuss this week's topic.  Look for the one with the <b> Spotlight/Flat Tax</b> title.  <a href="/townhall/hotissues/welcome.html.cgi"> (Click here to jump to the Forum page</a>) <p>
 <A HREF="/townhall/spotlights/i-flatx.html">This week's Spotlight</A> focuses on tax reform.  The Armey-Shelby flat tax plan, the Archer sales tax plan, and Dick Gephardt's 10 percent tax plan are presented, while <a href="/townhall/atr/1.html">Americans for Tax Reform</a>'s Grover Norquist, <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>'s Dan Mitchell, and other tax analysts examine the pros and cons of each plan.  Look for a new book from the <a href="/townhall/sbsc">Small Business Survival Committee</a>'s Raymond Keating to be available through the Town Hall shop in the coming weeks.<p>

	Town Hall will begin to expand our programming next week with news summaries, a daily what's new, polls, surveys, games, etc.  Use the <a href="/townhall/cyber_personth/cyberper.htm">Ask Tom</a> link to suggest other information or activities that you would like to see on Town Hall.<p>

	I hope that you enjoy our inaugural Spotlight on Tax Reform!  Don't forget to go to the <a href="/townhall/hotissues/welcome.html.cgi">Forum</a> to let everyone in Town Hall know what you think about the issue.<p>

INTRODUCTION   
<P>
     With the release last month of the final report of the National
Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline Industry, a verdict
has been entered against government re-regulation and in favor of
economic competition. The way to strengthen the United States airline
industry, the Commission says, is to spur greater flexibility and
international competition in the industry, not to turn back the clock
to regulation.
<P>
     The Airline Commission was created by Congress in 1992 in
response to the financial problems plaguing the airline industry. The
Commission was charged with making policy recommendations about the
"financial health and future competitiveness of the U.S. airline and
aerospace industries."
<P>
     Although there were worries that the Airline Commission would
recommend a government bailout of the industry and a rollback of
airline deregulation, the Commission report avoids these pitfalls and
makes several valuable recommendations that will improve the
efficiency and competitiveness of the U.S. airline industry. Among the
most important recommendations:
<P>
The FAA should be "reinvented" and restructured as an independent
     federal corporate entity, to permit much-needed technological
     modernization of the air traffic control system.
<P>
The current system still suffers from excessive regulation, which
     imposes unneeded costs on the industry. The report recommends a
     new, more objective system of cost-benefit analysis as a basis
     for decisions on regulation, with the use of outside expertise
     and cost impact data from the airline industry early in the
     regulatory process. And total regulatory costs to the industry
     would be constrained within an annual regulatory budget.
<P>
The current international system, based on bilateral national
     agreements, should be entirely renegotiated. The aim of the
     renegotiation should be to further deregulate international
     routes and to make it easier for foreign and U.S. airlines to
     invest jointly in multinational air service. Carriers should be
     free to make business decisions to serve cities internationally
     with many fewer governmental restrictions on landing rights on
     the basis of nationality alone.
<P>
     The bipartisan Airline Commission has firmly rejected calls to
reregulate the airline industry, and it has offered generally sound
proposals to strengthen the industry. Congress and the Administration
would be wise to move ahead swiftly to implement these
recommendations.
<P>

THE GENESIS OF THE COMMISSION
<P>
     With the effects of the 1990-1991 recession lingering into 1992,
the U.S. airline industry experienced severe financial problems. The
airlines suffered heavy losses. Many of the old criticisms of free
markets were raised in favor of renewed government involvement. Cut-
throat competition is unfair or even dangerous, it was said, because
the travelling public is put at risk when airlines must "cut corners"
to make a profit in a highly competitive industry. Moreover, charged
critics, industries with high fixed costs need the stability of
central planning, or regulation, if they are to survive.
<P>
     Although the Airline Commission reached a sensible conclusion
about re-regulation, there should have been no need for a
congressionally mandated, presidentially appointed panel to reach that
conclusion. The 1990-1991 economic downturn affected more sectors of
the economy than air travel; major corporations such as General Motors
and IBM have undergone significant reorganizations without calls for a
presidentially appointed commission. The airlines themselves have
experienced several episodes of significant financial difficulty in
previous recessions -- and the existence of fare and route regulation
before 1978 did not prevent financial losses. In a market economy,
industries often face severe changes. Business planning should be left
to business management and their staff economists, not to ad hoc study
commissions.
<P>
     Congress established the Airline Commission under Section 204 of
the Airport and Airway Safety, Capacity, Noise Improvement and
Intermodal Transportation Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-581). President
Clinton appointed fifteen voting members in 1993. (Heritage Foundation
Visiting Fellow John Robson, a member of the Airline Commission,
discussed the Commission's findings with the author.  This study's
analysis and conclusions, however, are entirely the author's. ) In
addition, five Senators, five Congressmen, and the Chairman of the
President's Council of Economic Advisers served as non-voting members.
The statute instructed the Commission to investigate a comprehensive
range of concerns:<P>

Can the industry continue to provide fast and efficient domestic
transportation?
<P>
How can the financial solvency of carriers be improved and can the
number of bankruptcies be reduced?
<P>
Will the industry be likely to share profits or losses over the next
five years and does it appear that any carriers will go under during
that period?
<P>
Why has there been a declining number of competitors and increased
concentration of market share among the largest carriers?
<P>
Do competitors have enough capital to purchase the equipment required
to continually improve the safety and quality of air travel?
<P>
Can the industry remain competitive globally?
<P>
Can the industry accommodate growing aviation traffic?
<P>
Are airlines providing the highest quality of service at the most
competitive price?
<P>
Can noise be further abated around airports without substantially
damaging the competitive positions of carriers?
<P>
Are there legal impediments to improved competition within the
industry?
<P>
     To be sure, the airline industry has encountered severe financial
problems over the past three years. And the industry saw some
spectacular bankruptcies in the 1980s, including Pan Am, Eastern, and
Continental, due in part to the use of excessive debt financing to
fund rapid growth. Nevertheless, the concern in Congress about the
condition of the airline industry, as illustrated by the findings in
the Airline Commission's authorizing legislation, stands in curious
juxtaposition to the clear benefits that have accrued during the
fifteen years of growth under deregulation. Among these: (John Stoner,
"Commission on Airline Industry Urges Lower Taxes, Streamlining FAA,"
U.S.  Senate Republican Policy Committee Regulation Watch, July 20,
1993.)
<P>
Airline deregulation has created jobs; salaries are higher and fares
     are lower. Airline industry employees numbered 540,412 in 1992,
     up from 330,495 in 1982 (a 64 percent increase). Employment in
     1992 was down slightly from the 1990 record level of 545,809, but
     still far above the number during the era of regulation. Overall,
     industry salaries and wages in 1992 were 5.4 percent higher than
     in 1991, and up 34 percent since 1982 in nominal dollars. Despite
     the record losses between 1990 and 1992, average airline employee
     salaries rose over 4 percent in real terms between 1982 and 1992.
     Since airline deregulation, overall airfares have declined,
     adjusted for inflation.
<P>
More Americans are flying. Air carriers recorded a total of 474.6
     billion revenue passenger miles in 1992, an increase of 6.2
     percent over 1991. Industry forecasts expect gains of between 
     4 percent and 6 percent over 1991.
<P>
Airplane load factors are up. In 1992, the industry's average aircraft
     load factor was 63.8 percent, a new industry record, beating the
     former high mark of 63.2 percent in 1979. Low ticket prices have
     stabilized passenger load factors in a range of 60.3 percent to
     63.8 percent over the past eight years, despite the large number
     of new aircraft placed in service.
<P>
There is increased competition and wider choice for passengers.
     Researchers Steven A. Morrison and Clifford M. Winston, in a
     Brookings Institution paper, note that, "Route selection is
     greater than it was under regulation. Today only 3 percent of
     passengers fly on routes served by only one airline, down from 9
     percent in 1978." ("The Evolution of the Airline Industry" (work
     in progress).)
<P>
     Despite the clear improvement in air service for customers, of
course, there are groups in the industry who are less well off -- a
typical result of tighter competition. Organized labor, in particular,
is in a worse position now than fifteen years ago. John F. Peterpaul,
a commissioner and Vice President for Transportation of the
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers,
strongly opposed the conclusions of the majority. His dissenting
opinion was published as a 22-page monograph by the IAM&AW. "Airline
industry workers," writes Peterpaul, "should have the right to follow
their work to a company acquiring part or all of the assets of their
former employer.... and new provisions should be enacted to guarantee
that any airline employee who is laid-off at one company has an
enforceable priority for hiring at any other carrier....  The U.S.
government, and specifically the FAA, must take action to maintain
high-skill, high-wage employment in the U.S. and provide jobs for
American mechanics, technicians, and managers.... " (Dissenting
Opinion by Commissioner John F.  Peterpaul to the Report of the
National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline Industry,
August 2, 1993.)
<P>
     Some major air carriers, which grew up in a cozy, regulated
environment, have faced wrenching changes. These older airlines
operated for decades with rigid work rules, and thus higher labor
costs than the newer startup airlines, and so have been at a
competitive disadvantage. In an attempt to ease some of these
problems, the Airline Commission recommended several changes in
pension law that would permit more employee ownership and distribution
of shares to employees' retirement plans. Among other advantages,
these measures would help to bring more labor-management flexibility
to some of the airline companies.
<P>

THE COMMISSION REPORT
<P>
     The Airline Commission issued its final report in August.
Unfortunately, most media coverage of the report tended to focus on a
few questions of particular concern to interested groups, such as the
competitive practices of bankrupt airlines. Problems of more general
significance, therefore, were not well spotlighted.
<P>
     The Commission's main proposals:
<P>
1)   Modernizing the Air Traffic Control System
<P>
     The recently announced decision by President Clinton to rehire
former air traffic controllers fired in 1981 for striking illegally
underscores the political nature of an essentially commercial activity
conducted by the government. Significantly, the Commission's first
conclusion is that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), as a
government agency, is unable to modernize and fully adapt to the
technological needs of air travel. The Commission does not call for
total privatization of the FAA. Instead, it says, "The FAA must be
reinvented." Vice President Al Gore's task force on government
reorganization has embraced this proposal.
<P>
     The FAA is an agency of the U.S. Department of Transportation.
The report calls for the FAA to become instead "an independent federal
corporate entity," with its expenditures and revenues removed from the
federal budget. The new body would be exempt from the rigidities of
government procurement and personnel rules, and maintain accounting
practices "consistent with best practices in the private sector." It
would also be granted the right to raise capital in the manner of a
private firm by issuing long-term bonds.
<P>
     Essentially the Airline Commission makes a distinction between
operating the air traffic control system, which the government does
poorly, and setting standards for safety and national defense needs,
which is a more reasonable role for government. The report tells of
the delays and costs in implementing the Aviation System Capital
Investment Plan, and it notes the startling fact that the U.S.
aviation system has not permitted air traffic control to use the
existing satellite navigation system that is available to ships and
other surface transportation. Integrating this available technology
into air traffic control would vastly improve efficiency and safety,
and eliminate costly delays.
<P>
     One of the difficulties faced by the FAA under its current
structure and governmental budgeting rules is that the Airport and
Airway Trust Fund's budget surplus is used to mask the federal
government's general deficit (in the same way the Social Security
surplus is used), rather than being available to support air travel.
The reason is that the "unified budget" concept forces all government
fiscal operations to share a common bottom line, and so encourages the
reduction of services and capital spending throughout government
whenever other, unrelated agencies have cost overruns. Privatizing, or
"reinventing," the FAA's air traffic control system would solve many
of these problems.
<P>
2)   Reducing the Burden of Regulation
<P>
     While acknowledging the government's role in regulating safety
and establishing standards, the Airline Commission strongly criticizes
the way the FAA has carried out this function. Adopting a more
coherent approach to safety regulation, it says, would produce
sizeable cost savings to the industry and to the public. The
Commission cites several examples of the FAA's over-zealous approach
to regulation -- and abuse of cost-benefit estimates to minimize the
appearance of error. 
<P>
     Despite the industry's favorable safety record, billions of
dollars in new regulatory costs have been imposed on the airlines. The
FAA's $4.5 billion estimate of these costs does not include more than
$4 billion the airlines must spend to phase out older, noisier
aircraft. The real costs faced by industry probably are more than
double that amount. And in addition to the cost of meeting regulatory
mandates, the FAA imposes a paperwork burden on the industry
equivalent to 6,900 employees working full time, over 14 million hours
annually, according to the Office of Management and Budget's Office of
Information and Regulatory Affairs.
<P>
     Safety is an unambiguous concern of most regulations, but the FAA
has done little to assure its mandates actually improve safety or do
it in a cost-effective way. For example, the Department of
Transportation in 1990 began to require a random drug testing rate of
50 percent of all employees. In the three years the program has been
in place, less than one-half of one percent of airline employees have
tested positive. According to analysis conducted for the Air Transport
Association by the Philadelphia-based WEFA Group of econometric
forecasters, the regulatory burden could be reduced by $90 million
over five years without threatening safety by reducing the level of
random testing to 10 percent. ("The Potential Impact of Selected
Airline Tax and Regulatory Changes on the U.S.  Economy," The WEFA
Group, May 1992, p.  E-12.) The Airline Commission recommends dropping
the test rate to 25 percent immediately and dropping it even further
if analysis shows there will be no detrimental effects on safety. The
Department of Transportation has already established a test rate of 25
percent for its own safety-related employees.
<P>
     The FAA's interpretation of its regulatory duty to assure safety
may be overreaching as well. An ongoing labor dispute regarding flight
time limitations for flight attendants, for example, is the subject of
a new regulatory proposal. The FAA has the statutory authority to
establish such limitations when necessary for flight safety. It is
unclear, however, how flight attendant duty scheduling decisions
reduce safety.
<P>
     There is also a serious question whether the FAA performs cost-
benefit studies as a genuine economic inquiry into the wisdom of a
regulation or as a post facto rationale. A wide gap is often found
between cost estimates used by the FAA and those performed by non-
governmental economists. For example, in 1992 the FAA issued
regulations for emergency exits to allow smoother passenger evacuation
in the event of a crash. American Airlines told the Airline Commission
that its costs alone would be $16.6 million due to this rule. The
original proposed rule would have cost the industry more than $32
million to make the change, according to American, and over $1 billion
in lost revenue because of seating modifications. The rule was
modified after strong protests from air carriers, and then the FAA
estimated it would then cost only $4.3 million per year. (Submission
to the National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline
Industry, American Airlines, Inc., June 16, 1993, p.  II-3.)
<P>
     The FAA often underestimates the costs that a regulation actually
imposes. Pending requirements for alcohol testing beyond the current
mandate for drug testing, for instance, would require all job
applicants and 50 percent of all current employees to be tested each
year. Although the government claims the cost would be only $66.6
million over ten years, industry estimates suggest the actual costs
would be closer to $1.4 billion over the ten-year period. And when the
FAA issued a rule to increase the restrictions on access to secured
areas of airports, its cost estimate was $168 million. Since the rule
went into effect in 1989, air carriers report they have spent more
than $500 million to comply. Moreover, the rule is still not fully
implemented. The final cost could be up to $1 billion. (Ibid., p. 
I-1.)
<P>
     The Airline Commission cites the FAA's own estimates that more
than $3.5 billion has been added to airline costs since 1984 as a
result of an attempt by regulators to achieve small, incremental
improvements in safety through the imposition of new rules and
procedures, and suggests an inadequate assessment of the gains
relative to the compliance burden. 
<P>
     The Airline Commission recommends an annual regulatory cost
budget, except for emergency safety regulations, to force more careful
consideration by the government of costs and benefits. Such a
budgetary frame of reference would compel regulators to consider the
overall cost picture as they look at individual regulatory issues.
This proposal is innovative and is supplemented by the suggestion that
the FAA be required annually to inform Congress and the Department of
Transportation of the costs of their own proposals.
<P>
3)   Reducing the Tax Burden
<P>
     The Commission report makes the point that financial weakness in
the airline industry is primarily a self-inflicted wound. Although the
1990-1991 recession was a major factor, the report notes the heavy
debt burdens taken on during the long 1983-1989 growth cycle set up
the industry for its current financial weakness. Significantly, the
Commission roundly rejects any notions of government route or price
controls to bolster the balance sheets of air carriers.
<P>
     Nevertheless, the Commission attacks the perverse way in which
federal taxes compound these problems. Taxes can seriously weaken a
capital-intensive industry, such as the airlines. From 1990 to 1992,
the airline industry lost $10 billion, yet paid $670 million in
corporate taxes. "We believe those [tax] provisions violate reasonable
principles of common sense and good public policy," the Commission
concludes. The Alternative Minimum Tax, the ticket tax and cargo
waybill tax, transportation fuel taxes, and a host of other charges
add up to more than $5 billion annually in taxes paid by an industry
that only once in the past quarter century has achieved the average
profit margin for U.S. industry.
<P>
     Just as the FAA's modernization needs have been sacrificed to
other demands in the federal budget, federal tax policy hits
passengers and shippers of air freight disproportionately. As part of
the disastrous 1990 budget agreement, these taxes were increased by 25
percent, yet none of the new revenue was used to modernize or improve
the safety of air travel. Implementing the Airline Commission's
proposal to remove the FAA from the unified budget process would
permit the rollback of these taxes as well, saving passengers,
shippers, and the airlines over $900 million per year.
<P>
4)   Moving Beyond Nationalism in Air Service
<P>
     The international air traffic system, put in place in 1944, now
consists of 1,200 bilateral agreements among governments covering
landing rights and overflight privileges for each other's airlines.
Because these arrangements are not multilateral and regulated by a
regime such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), with
general rules applying to all trading partners, governments commonly
play favorites and abuse the highly structured system. France and
Germany, for instance, currently discriminate against U.S. air
carriers, and the Commission cites studies indicating that passengers
to both Canada and Japan could enjoy a huge expansion in service from
the United States if the bilateral agreement system were changed.
<P>
     The Airline Commission report recommends that the United States
work to create a multinational system both for air services and for
ownership of air carriers. The United States is the largest single
market and has the most efficient air transportation industry. But
under the existing fifty-year-old treaty regime a legal advantage
accrues to the rest of the world in serving the U.S. market, holding
back the generally more efficient U.S. airlines. 
<P>
     The bilateral system tends to exacerbate the perception of a
zero-sum situation, in which every concession a foreign government
might grant for increased service by a U.S. air carrier looks like a
slice of the market taken away from its own air carriers. In truth,
the air service market has demonstrated, through the U.S. domestic
example, the same potential to expand through lower costs and scale
efficiencies as every other kind of service.
<P>
     The Commission suggests negotiating regional multinational
agreements first, then expanding negotiations to a worldwide basis. It
urges the President to appoint an experienced aviation professional to
lead these international negotiations, with the rank of ambassador at
large.
<P>
     Just as important as market access, the Commission recommends a
major change in the rules governing ownership of U.S. airlines.
Specifically, it urges that:

     <UL>The Federal Aviation Act be amended to allow the U.S. to
     negotiate bilateral agreements that permit foreign investors
     to hold up to 49 percent voting equity in U.S. airlines,
     providing those bilateral agreements are liberal and contain
     equivalent opportunities for U.S. airlines; the foreign
     investor is not government-owned; there are reciprocal
     investment rights for U.S. airlines, and the investment will
     advance the national interest and the development of a
     liberal global regime for air services.</UL>
<P>
     Current law limits foreign ownership in domestic airlines to 25
percent of voting stock. Senator John Danforth, the Missouri
Republican, who served as a non-voting member of the Airline
Commission, has introduced a bill (S. 771) similar to the Commission's
proposal. However, the proposal does not go far enough, because there
still would be a cap of 49 percent on the equity share of non-U.S.
citizens. There is no reason for this percentage cap. Foreign
investors are hardly enemy foreign agents and there is no legitimate
reason to limit foreign ownership in airlines any more than the U.S.
limits foreign investment in other industries.
<P>
5)   Declining production of general aviation aircraft.     
<P>
     Whereas sales of small piston-engine airplanes averaged 13,000
per year from 1965 through 1982, product liability insurance costs,
among other factors, have reduced this to barely 500 per year today.
Over 100,000 jobs have been lost in manufacturing, sales, service, and
related industries. The Airline Commission recommends enactment by
Congress of a "statute of repose." This would bar claims against
small-aircraft manufacturers for defective designs on aircraft more
than fifteen years old. Senator Nancy Kassebaum, the Kansas
Republican, has introduced legislation (S. 67) addressing this
concern, among others.
<P>
6)   Airlines in Financial Distress. 
<P>
     The report also calls for the creation of a presidentially
appointed airline financial advisory committee to advise the Secretary
of Transportation when an airline's financial condition poses risks to
the public or to the industry. 
<P>
     While that recommendation may seem sensible or innocuous, there
would be many dangers inherent in a new regulatory panel with special
access to the Secretary of Transportation. In particular, such a body
could become a powerful advocate of re-regulation during periods of
economic recession. (Commissioner John E.  Robson entered a strong
dissent to the proposal for a presidentially appointed financial
advisory board:  "In fact," notes Robson, "it looks dangerously like
what the now-defunct Civil Aeronautics Board used to do back when the
airline industry was regulated.")

     <P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     The National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline
Industry has published an exemplary report that should dispel any
remaining doubts about the wisdom of deregulating the airlines in
1978. If enacted, the proposals to reduce taxes, rationalize the
system of safety regulation, and examine the benefits and costs of
regulation within a budgeted framework will strengthen the financial
condition of the airline industry. Putting the air traffic control
system on a commercial basis, with a normal, private-sector capital
budgeting system, will permit air travel to stay abreast of
communications, navigation, and safety technology -- a most important
responsibility that the FAA demonstrates cannot be done as well as it
should be in the context of the current government bureaucracy.
<P>
     The need to achieve a truly global air service industry is
perhaps the most important conclusion of the Commission, yet at the
same time it recognizes the tremendous obstacles that would have to be
overcome to attain that goal. Encouraging private, multinational
ownership of a few dozen globe-spanning airline corporations, in place
of today's politically dominated structure is a subtle and wise step.
Cross ownership may represent a "people-to-people" strategy that can
break down political rigidities and protectionism.
<P>
     Congress and the Clinton Administration should take the
Commission's recommendations to heart. If they are implemented, the
U.S. airline industry can look forward to a more profitable future,
and passengers will enjoy even better and more economical travel.<P>

<hr><h2>Drivers Could Get Speedy Win in Congress</h2>
<br>By<br> <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Dr. Edwin J. Feulner</a></center><hr>
<p>
	Congress may soon liberate millions of American drivers who are tired of creeping along at 55 mph on roads designed for 65 mph or more.
	<p>Despite continued whining by self-appointed &quot;safety advocates&quot; that higher speeds will increase the carnage on U.S. highways, a measure already has passed the Senate to repeal the National Maximum Speed Limit (NMSL), a bureaucratic nightmare that for years has made it illegal for drivers to exceed the &quot;double nickel&quot;, or 55 mph, anywhere in the country. 
<p>	The law, passed in 1974, deprived states of their historic right to set speed limits within their own borders, based on their particular needs and conditions. Especially upset were drivers in Nevada, which for years had no posted speed limit, and other Western states with thousands of miles of lonely roads connecting sparsely populated areas.
<p>	Hailed as a fuel-saving measure during the Carter administration's &quot;energy crisis,&quot; the double nickel should have died when President Reagan deregulated the energy industry in 1981 and the long lines disappeared at U.S. service stations.
<p>	Faced with the loss of some of their powers, federal transportation bureaucrats changed tactics and decided that NMSL was really a highway safety measure. So Congress kept the double nickel. In the years following, America's drivers voted with their feet and made the double nickel one of the most widely ignored federal laws ever enacted.
<p>	Bowing to public demand, Congress grudgingly decided in 1987 to let states raise the limit to 65 mph ¾ but only on rural interstates. Thousands more people would die because of the higher speed limit, the &quot;safety advocates&quot; predicted.
<p>	Today, as Congress considers repealing NMSL, we hear the same dire predictions. Richard Martinez, President Clinton's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration head, claims the double nickel saves lives, while Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety's Jacqueline Gillan predicts &quot;more than 5,000 additional deaths and millions more injuries on our highways.&quot;
<p>	Gillan's widely reported prediction shows how hocus-pocus statistics can be used to create unjustified public fears in order to protect the power and turf of entrenched Washington bureaucrats.
<p>	In fact, fewer people died on rural interstates after 1987 than before, according to Charles Lave, chairman of the University of California's economics department, in a study for the American Automobile Association's Traffic Safety Foundation and the University of California Transportation Center.
<p>	Adds Jim Baxter, president of the National Motorists Association: &quot;If you look at the 65 mph highways now, there are about 2,500 fatalities on them each year. There were about 2,700 each year before 65 mph. What Gillan is suggesting is that we will have a doubling or tripling of fatalities on those highways. That's just not going to happen.&quot;
<p>	Baxter cites a 1992 study for the U.S. Department of Transportation that found the accident rate went up 5.4 percent in places where speed limits were lowered and fell 6.7 percent where they were raised. &quot;We expect improved safety, not diminished safety&quot; if states set speed limits, he says.
<p>	If the House and Senate agree on repealing NMSL ¾ and it is not vetoed by President Clinton ¾ some states undoubtedly will raise their speed limits. Other states won't. In both cases, America's drivers will, for the first time in 20 years, be able to watch the road ahead for safety traps instead of radar traps.

<P>
INTRODUCTION

<P>     Reacting to America's alleged excessive dependence on Middle
East oil and to last fall's gasoline price increases, Congress is
considering raising the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE)
standards, which mandate average minimum miles per gallon (mpg) for
the fleet of automobiles sold in America by each manufacturer. The
"Motor Vehicle Fuel Efficiency Act" (S. 279), introduced by Senator
Richard Bryan, the Nevada Democrat, would increase the current 27.5
mpg standard to approximately 34 mpg by 1996 and approximately 40 mpg
by 2001. (See News from the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science
and Transportation, 102nd Cong., 1st Sess., March 19, 1991, p. 2. The
bill would require each manufacturer to raise its own fleets' mpg
averages to 20 percent by 1996, and then 40 percent by 1996, over the
levels actually achieved in the 1988 model year. Since different
manufacturers had different fleet averages in 1988, the law no longer
would apply the same standards to all manufacturers after 1996; some
would have to increase their fleet averages more than others.)

<P>     Supporters maintain that this increase is necessary to reduce
America's fuel consumption. The recent fall in oil prices, however,
removes a major reason given for higher CAFE standards. In any case,
to meet higher CAFE standards American manufacturers will be forced to
produce more smaller, lighter and therefore less safe cars. As it is,
the current CAFE standards result in as many as 3,900 additional
highway deaths per model-year fleet. The higher CAFE standards sought
by the Bryan bill would force Americans truly to pay in blood,
increasing the number of highway deaths attributable to CAFE by as
much as 8,600 per model-year fleet.

 <P>    Thousands Out of Jobs. Nearly as bad is what the Bryan bill will
do to American auto workers. To meet the Bryan CAFE standards and
compete with foreign automakers, American manufacturers will have to
transfer operations from the United States to overseas plants. This
will throw tens of thousands of American automakers out of their jobs.
Next will come American workers supplying steel and auto parts who too
would find themselves on the unemployment line.

<P>     Consumer Choice. Because the CAFE law looks only at average fuel
economy, with the averages based on the number of cars sold, American
automobile manufacturers actually can be penalized for producing more
fuel-efficient cars. As American firms have produced more fuel-
efficient mid-sized and large cars, many consumers have switched to
these vehicles from smaller models. But given the peculiar way in
which CAFE compliance is measured, such consumer choices can lower the
fleet average for American manufacturers, even if the mpg for every
individual model goes up.

<P>     The Bryan bill would not greatly reduce American fuel
consumption or America's alleged dependence on foreign oil. It would
not be effective at reducing pollution or at inducing Americans to
drive less.

<P>     If energy prices rise and stay high, this itself will give
consumers an incentive to purchase more fuel-efficient cars and give
auto manufacturers an incentive to produce such vehicles. If fuel
prices remain low, however, it does not make sense to force American
manufacturers to produce cars that consumers do not need or want. If
consumers decide they would rather have larger and hence safer cars,
even if these cars get fewer miles per gallon of gasoline,
manufacturers should not be prevented from selling these cars. The
tradeoff between the safety of a vehicle and its fuel efficiency
properly is the choice of each individual American, not the choice of
Congress.
<P>
ORIGINS OF CAFE
<P>
     The 1973 Arab oil embargo and the ensuing quadrupling of oil
prices by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
prompted Congress to enact the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE)
program in 1975 as part of America's Energy Policy and Conservation
Act. The aim of this program was to reduce the consumption of gasoline
and thus the need for oil imports. Beginning with the 1978 auto model
year, the program required all auto manufacturers to maintain certain
minimum fuel economy averages for their fleets of vehicles sold in the
U.S. The standard for passenger cars was set initially at 18 miles per
gallon in 1978, but since has risen to the current 27.5 mpg.

 <P>    The CAFE standards apply to any manufacturer, domestic or
foreign, that sells over 10,000 cars per year in America. These
manufacturers must satisfy CAFE requirements for each of several
vehicle categories. For instance, vehicles manufactured abroad are
considered separately from those manufactured in the U.S. Thus, a
manufacturer with a 30 mpg average for its combined output of foreign
and domestically produced passenger automobiles nonetheless would fall
short of CAFE requirements if its domestically built passenger cars
taken separately averaged only 25 mpg. The standards are the same for
foreign and domestic fleets, but different standards apply to
different types of vehicles. A lower mpg level is required for light
trucks, for example, whether foreign or domestically produced, than
for passenger vehicles.

<P>   The mpg performance of each model vehicle is calculated from the
combined average of city and highway mileage, according to tests
conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency. If a manufacturer's
average for a particular fleet falls below the mandated levels, a
penalty is imposed amounting to $5 per vehicle for each one-tenth of a
mpg by which the fleet average falls below the required CAFE level.
Significantly, the penalty applies to all cars sold in the fleet in
question, not just the particular models that bring the average below
the minimum level. Thus if a manufacturer produced one million cars
per year and its fleet CAFE average was 27.4 mpg instead of 27.5 mpg,
it would pay a fine of $5 million to the federal government. The Bryan
bill would increase these penalties. Beginning with the 1996 model
year it would: 1) index fines for inflation, and 2) double the fine
for any manufacturer that failed to meet the applicable standard by
one-half mile per gallon or more three years in a row.

<P>     It is questionable whether the 1970s CAFE standards did much to
increase the fuel efficiency of American cars. What actually did boost
mileage per gallon for American-made cars was the searing competition
from the high mileage imports and the sustained high gasoline prices.
In response to this, American manufacturers invested $88 billion to
make their vehicles more fuel-efficient. (Milton R. Copulos, "Why Auto
Mileage Rules Should Be Relaxed," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No.
426, April 23, 1985, p. 3.) As oil prices dropped in the 1980s, the
rate of fuel efficiency gain slowed. The reason: more Americans
preferred larger cars. 
<P>
CAFE KILLS

 <P>   While conservation of fuel is valued by proponents of higher
CAFE standards, they usually ignore what is more important: human
life. The evidence now is overwhelming that CAFE kills. The reason is
simple. The easiest way to increase a vehicle's fuel efficiency, and
beyond a certain point the only way, is to reduce the vehicle's weight
by reducing its size and its steel content. While technological
improvements in engines or body design also contribute to increased
fuel efficiency, there are limits to what technology alone can do. In
fact, other federal regulations often limit such improvements.
Controls on auto emissions, for example, have forced changes in engine
and exhaust system design that reduce gas mileage. (Thomas Gale Moore,
"The Unresolved Conflict Between Auto Safety and Fuel Efficiency,"
Journal of Regulation and Social Costs, Vol. 1, No. 1 (September
1990), p. 72.) 

<P>     Light-weight Cars. As such, reducing auto weight is the main
means by which CAFE standards have been met. The weight of the average
American automobile has been reduced 23 percent since 1974. (Robert W.
Crandall and John D. Graham, "The Effect of Fuel Economy Standards on
Automobile Safety," Journal of Law and Economics, Vol. XXXII (April
1989), p. 101.) Cars over 4,000 pounds accounted for about one-quarter
of all cars sold during the 1978 model year; they constitute only one
percent of the cars built since 1984. Cars of more than 3,500 pounds
made up over 70 percent of the 1978 fleet, but were only 36 percent of
the 1987 fleet. (R.M. Heavenrich, et al., "Light-Duty Automotive Fuel
Economy and Technology Trends Through 1987," Society of Automotive
Engineers, Inc., Technical Papers Series, May 1987, p. 12.)

<P>     While some car weight reduction would have occurred without
CAFE, the standards have had a significant effect in recent years.
According to a study by economists Robert Crandall of the Brookings
Institution and John Graham of the Harvard School of Public Health,
the average weight of passenger automobiles for the 1989 model year is
about 500 pounds less than it would have been without CAFE
regulations. (Crandall and Graham, op. cit., pp. 100-110.) Raising the
CAFE standard still further will force additional weight reductions,
especially since many of the technological improvements that can
increase fuel economy have already been made. 

<P>     This decline in vehicle weight reduces safety. Crandall and
Graham explain that "the negative relationship between weight and
occupant fatality risk is one of the most secure findings in the
safety literature." (Ibid., p. 110.) Today's cars have less steel in
their frames and bodies to absorb the force of a collision.
Furthermore, with their narrower wheelbases they are more prone to
turn over in an accident. The result: More accidents each year produce
major injuries and deaths. 

<P>     Increasing Fatalities. Crandall and Graham estimate that the
500-pound decrease in vehicle weight caused by the current CAFE
standard of 27.5 mpg already has increased the number of occupant
fatalities that will occur over the life of each model year's cars
between 14 percent and 27 percent. This amounts to between 2,200 and
3,900 additional deaths per model year, spread out over the lifetime
of the vehicles. Crandall and Graham also estimate that an additional
11,000 to 19,500 serious injuries are likely to occur over the life of
each model year's cars because of the current CAFE standards. (Ibid.,
pp. 111-116.)

 <P>    These additional deaths and injuries already are occurring
because of the existing CAFE standards. Raising the standards further
will add to the CAFE death and injury toll. Based on his study with
Graham, Crandall estimates that the substantial weight and steel-
content reductions that would be needed to achieve a fleet-wide
average of 40 mpg would raise the CAFE death toll to between 4,800 and
8,600 deaths per model year fleet. (See testimony of Competitive
Enterprise Institute and Consumer Alert (Sam Kazman) before the
Subcommittee on Water, Power, and Offshore Energy Resources of the
House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, 101st Cong., 2nd
Sess., September 11, 1990, p. 4.)

 <P>    Penalizing Safety. Some defenders of CAFE argue that these
weight reductions can be offset by other safety measures such as air
bags. Yet while a small car with an air bag might be safer than such a
car without one, it still will not be as safe as a large car with an
air bag. The weight reductions necessitated by CAFE tend to neutralize
the benefits from air bags and other safety measures. By one estimate,
adding air bags to a car is equivalent, from a safety standpoint, to
increasing the car's weight by about 385 pounds. (Leonard Evans,
"Passive Compared to Active Approaches to Reducing Occupant
Fatalities," General Motors Research Laboratories, March 1989, p. 7.)
Yet CAFE has led to average vehicle weight reductions of about 500
pounds. Moreover, air bags, anti-lock brakes, improved bumpers, and
other safety features also increase vehicle weight and hence also
reduce fuel economy. Higher CAFE standards would punish auto makers
for introducing similar lifesaving improvements in the future if the
improvements would make cars heavier.

<P>     The Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration (NHTSA) has conducted several studies that
confirm a significant relationship between vehicle size and the
incidence of death or serious injury. (Two such studies are reported
together in Effect of Car Size on Fatality and Injury Risk in
Single-Vehicle Crashes U.S. Department of Transportation, National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration, August 1990.) NHTSA
Administrator Jerry Curry, Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner,
and Energy Secretary James Watkins on safety grounds have criticized
proposals to raise CAFE standards further. Watkins has called Bryan's
bill the "Highway Death Act of 1991."

 <P>    Even self-proclaimed consumer advocate Ralph Nader's Center for
Auto Safety in 1972 observed that "Small size and light weight impose
inherent limitations on the degree of safety that can be built into a
vehicle." (Center for Auto Safety, The Nader Report: Small -- on
Safety (New York: Grossman Publishers, 1972), p. 87.) Nader, who does
not own a car himself but is an ardent supporter of the Bryan bill,
conceded in an interview in 1989 that "larger cars are safer" because
"there is more bulk to protect the occupant." (Rebecca E. Greer, "Be
Safer in the 90's: New Warnings from Ralph Nader," Woman's Day,
October 24, 1989, p. 32.) 
<P>
CAFE COSTS AMERICAN JOBS
<P>
     The CAFE standards already have cost over 200,000 American jobs.
CAFE will cost more if the Bryan bill becomes law. By making new cars
more expensive, CAFE reduces the demand for new cars. Studies indicate
that a 10 percent increase in the price of large cars decreases their
demand by 30 percent. (See Andrew N. Kleit, The Impact of Automobile
Fuel Economy Standards, Federal Trade Commission Working Paper No. 160
(February 1988), Technical Appendix, p. 3.) New car sales thus would
slide, and along with them the jobs of American autoworkers. More jobs
would be destroyed by the shift to those small cars that meet Bryan
CAFE levels, since small cars require less labor per car built than
large cars.

 <P>    Shifting Production Overseas. Higher CAFE standards, moreover,
would prompt American manufacturers to shift their large car
production overseas, cutting their U.S. payroll and employing more
foreign workers. This is because the CAFE law divides each
manufacturer's production into two separate fleets, domestic-made and
foreign-made, with each fleet required to meet the CAFE requirements
independently. Because U.S. manufacturers already build many of their
smaller cars overseas, it is even more difficult for them to meet the
CAFE requirements with their domestic fleets. By moving some of their
large car production abroad, they would be able to offset the lower
fuel economy of their larger cars with the higher fuel economy of
their smaller and lighter foreign cars. At the same time, moving
production of larger cars abroad would raise the average fuel economy
of their domestic fleet. 

<P>     In a similar fashion, CAFE also forces foreign auto
manufacturers with American assembly plants to purchase parts from
abroad. To be classified as a foreign car, at least 70 percent of the
total price of a vehicle must consist of value added outside the U.S.
Since their American-built cars tend to be larger and incapable of
meeting CAFE standards by themselves, these manufacturers have to keep
their U.S.-built cars classified as foreign for CAFE purposes.

<P>     Then, by reducing domestic auto production of U.S. and foreign
auto companies, CAFE eliminates jobs in industries that supply the
auto industry. The impact of higher CAFE standards on the steel
industry would be especially pronounced since reducing the steel
content of cars is the easiest way to increase fuel economy. 
<P>
CAFE PENALIZES EFFICIENCY

<P>     CAFE is not calculated on the basis of fuel efficiency
improvements model-by-model, but rather on the average efficiency of
all autos sold. (The averaging method currently used by the EPA counts
low-mpg cars more heavily than high-mpg cars, making it even harder
for manufacturers to achieve their fleet-wide targets. Thus, if two
cars are sold, one of which gets 20 miles per gallon and the other 40
miles per gallon, the average for the two is not 30 under the EPA
method but 26.7 See Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, Status
Report, Vol. 25, No. 8 (September 8, 1990) p. 5.) As a result, changes
in customer choices can place a manufacturer in violation of the CAFE
standards even though every car in its fleet may be more fuel-
efficient than the year before. 

<P>     Because auto makers have increased significantly the fuel
economy of their larger cars over the past decade, and because oil and
gasoline prices have fallen sharply during the same period, more
Americans are again buying larger, safer cars. And yet, although
automobiles of all sizes are more fuel-efficient now than they were in
the past, this shift in consumer demand from smaller to larger cars
brings down the fleet average mpg of American manufacturers. Thus,
because the CAFE formula takes the ability to comply out of the hands
of the manufacturers, the CAFE standards can actually have the
perverse effect of penalizing American auto manufacturers for the
efficiency gains they have made in the past.

<P>     Bizarre Situation. American auto manufacturers are in the
bizarre situation of having to protect themselves against the wishes
of their own customers. If a manufacturer allows its customers to buy
too many efficient but large cars, the manufacturer will end up in
violation of the CAFE standards. To prevent this, auto makers change
the "mix" of cars they sell by increasing the prices of larger cars
and lowering the prices of smaller cars. (For evidence that automakers
actually do this, see, e.g., Competitive Enterprise Institute v.
NHTSA, 901 F.2d 107, 124-25 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (Ginsburg, J.,
concurring).) In effect, CAFE acts as a tax on larger, safer cars
which is used to subsidize sales of smaller, higher-mpg, but less safe
cars. 

<P>  This skewed pricing system imposes burdens on consumers because
it limits their ability to purchase the cars of their choice. As a
result, many legitimate desires or needs of consumers can go
unfulfilled. Large families, for example, may need a large car. Older
citizens often prefer larger cars because they are easier to enter and
exit. CAFE standards make it more expensive for these buyers to
exercise their choices. In this way, CAFE and the Bryan bill penalize
large families and the elderly.

<P>  Recreational users also would suffer from an increase in CAFE
standards. This is because reducing engine horsepower can increase
fuel economy. And yet, large engines are needed for trailer hauling,
off-road driving, and other recreational uses. (Engine power can
sometimes be a safety factor as well. Some minimum degree of engine
power is needed to be able to accelerate quickly enough to get out of
the way of oncoming traffic and to get across railroad intersections
quickly and safely. See, e.g. Center for Auto Safety, op. cit., p.
73.)
<P>
CAFE IS UNNECESSARY FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION

<P>  The average fuel economy average of new cars sold in America has
risen substantially, from about 20 mpg in 1978, when CAFE first took
effect, to about 28 mpg in 1987. (James L. Gattuso and Kent Jeffreys,
"The Mounting Dangers of the 'CAFE' Mileage Standards," Heritage
Foundation Backgrounder No. 676, October 13, 1988, p. 4.) CAFE
supporters point to this as evidence of CAFE's success. In truth, CAFE
had little to do with this dramatic improvement. The evidence shows
that fuel economy rose as the market responded to high fuel prices.

<P>  Indeed, the average fuel efficiency of cars driven in America
began to increase before CAFE standards were enacted. In the four
years before CAFE took effect, new car fuel efficiency rose 40
percent. (Ibid.) When gasoline prices climbed from 36 cents per gallon
of regular leaded gasoline in 1972 to 53 cents per gallon in 1974,
(U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration, Annual
Energy Review 1987, p. 145.) consumers began to demand more efficient
automobiles. No federal regulation was needed to tell auto makers to
improve fuel economy -- the market was sending an unmistakable signal.
Thus when CAFE went into effect in 1978, its mandated 18 mpg standard
was below the average at the time of almost 20 mpg. (Gattuso and
Jeffreys, op. cit., p. 4.)

<P>  From 1978 through 1982 new car mpg averages improved by another
35 percent (Ibid.) as the average price of leaded gasoline reached a
high of $1.31 per gallon (or $1.88 in today's dollars) in 1981.
(Annual Energy Review 1987, op. cit., p. 145. Conversion to 1990
dollars based on Economic Report of the President, 1991, Appendix B,
Table B-58, p. 351.) According to research by Brookings economist
Crandall, these efficiency improvements were almost exactly what could
have been predicted from changes in gas prices alone. (Robert W.
Crandall and Theodore E. Keeler, "Public Policy and the Automobile,"
in Richard L. Gordon, Henry D. Jacoby, and Martin Zimmerman, eds.,
Energy: Markets and Regulation (Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press, 1987).)

<P>  Restricting the Market. Predictably, too, fuel efficiency
improvements in new model cars slowed somewhat after oil prices began
declining in 1982. This is because of the greater demand for larger,
more comfortable, and safer cars. Even so, the average mpg still
increased another 8 percent after 1982. (Gattuso and Jeffreys, op.
cit., p. 4.) But with lower gasoline prices, and the resulting
increase in demand for larger cars, the CAFE standards finally began
to restrict the car market, preventing auto makers from responding to
the turnaround in consumer demand. Instead of simply selling more
large cars, as their customers wanted, manufacturers raised the prices
of larger cars to avoid selling too many of them and thereby running
afoul of the CAFE standards. (See note 17, above.)
<P>
CAFE DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE FUEL CONSUMPTION

<P>  Advocates of higher CAFE standards apparently reckon that if
cars get more miles per gallon of gas, people will burn less gas
driving the same number of miles. But, by reducing the number of
gallons of gas needed to drive a given distance, CAFE makes driving
less expensive. Americans have responded to this as would be expected;
they drive their cars more miles. Greater fuel efficiency prompts more
leisure driving and discourages car pooling and the use of public
transportation.

<P>  At the same time, CAFE makes new cars, particularly large
models, more expensive to buy. Thus it creates an incentive for those
who want the comfort, convenience or safety of a larger car to keep
their older cars longer. Others buy used instead of new cars. Yet,
older cars are generally less fuel-efficient than new ones. The result
is that these drivers use more gasoline in a year than they would have
if they had been allowed to buy the kind of car they wanted at a price
they could afford.

<P>  It thus is questionable whether increased CAFE standards would
reduce American gasoline and oil consumption significantly. If the
standards did reduce oil consumption, moreover, they would increase
the share of oil that America imports. The reason: when demand falls,
it is the marginal, highest-cost suppliers that drop out of the
market. Since American oil producers face substantially higher costs
per barrel than producers in other parts of the world, the Americans
would be forced to stop selling oil if the Bryan bill were to succeed
in reducing U.S. oil consumption. (In fact, the percentage of oil
imported has no connection with "dependence" on foreign oil. See,
e.g., Victor A. Conto, "It's BTU-tiful: Energy Markets in the New
Era," A.B. Laffer Associates, September 8, 1987.)
<P>
NO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT

<P>  Some advocates of higher CAFE standards maintain that cars with
higher mpg will pollute less. But by inducing drivers to keep older,
less efficient cars longer, CAFE may increase total emissions of
pollutants by delaying the introduction of newer cars with cleaner-
burning engines and exhaust systems.

<P>  CAFE represents, moreover, an indirect and very ineffective
approach to controlling pollution. If Congress wants to protect the
environment, it can do so at a much lower cost to consumers and the
economy by adopting measures that target auto emissions directly.

<P>  Studies have shown, for example, that approximately half of all
auto emissions are produced by only 10 percent of all cars, most
usually poorly tuned. (See, e.g. "Roadside Emission Test Targets Prime
Offenders," Chemecology, November 1990, pp. 10-11; Rick Henderson,
"Going Mobile," Reason, August/September 1990, pp. 32-36) A properly-
tuned car puts out less emissions than an untuned one, even if both
are driven the same distance, use the same gasoline, and have the same
mpg. CAFE provides no incentive to keep engines in tune nor does it
help to get high-pollution vehicles off the road. A much better
approach would be to measure periodically the exhaust each car
produces and levy a fee directly on the worst polluters.

<P>  Higher CAFE standards sometimes are defended as a way to deal
with the alleged problem of "global warming." The fear is that
increased concentrations in the atmosphere of what are called
"greenhouse gases," such as carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons
(CFCs) supposedly will warm up the Earth's atmosphere, causing
droughts in some areas and coastal flooding in others. But automobiles
are a relatively minor source of these greenhouse gases. While an
"Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change" and the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency have estimated that at least a 50 percent to 80
percent worldwide reduction in carbon dioxide emissions would be
needed to keep the atmosphere's temperature at its current level, (See
Office of Technology Assessment, U.S. Congress, Changing by Degrees:
Steps to Reduce Greenhouse Gases (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government
Printing Office, 1991), p. iii.) the Bryan bill would reduce such
emissions by only about 0.5 percent, even under the most optimistic
assumptions. (This figure is calculated from data given in ibid., pp.
5, 7, 8, 21.)
<P>
CONCLUSION

<P>  An increase in CAFE standards is a poor way to deal with the
alleged problem of high fuel consumption. The bill introduced by
Senator Richard Bryan uses a regulatory, "command-and-control"
approach that fails to balance the need for more energy-efficient cars
with consumer demands. It ignores the market forces which in the past
did increase fuel efficiency. What is worse, higher CAFE standards
would not achieve any of their ostensible purposes. They would not
significantly reduce American fuel consumption or America's alleged
"dependence" on foreign oil. They would not reduce pollution, nor have
any significant effect on the alleged global warming problem. 

<P>  Tragic Consequence. At the same time, the Bryan bill would
reduce the range of choices available to American car buyers while
requiring them to pay substantially more for their cars. The bill also
would reduce the number of American jobs, first in the auto and steel
industries, and then in other sectors that serve the auto industry.
Most tragic, by forcing manufacturers to sell lighter and smaller cars
than customers want, the Bryan Bill would increase major injuries and
deaths on the highways. 

<P>  If Congress wants to foster energy conservation, it simply
should allow the price system to operate freely. As long as Congress
does not reimpose price controls on gasoline and other petroleum
products, as it did in the early 1970s, market prices will provide
consumers with the proper incentive to conserve.

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">D</FONT></B>uring the 1992 presidential race, the Fleetwood Mac song "Don't Stop Thinking 
About Tomorrow" became the official anthem of the Clinton campaign. Once in office, 
the new administration lost little time infusing every facet of its domestic agenda with 
concern about the future. But its defense agenda has been curiously immune to long-term 
thinking. Rather than planning for tomorrow, the administration's defense policies reflect 
a disturbing preoccupation with the concerns of the moment.</P>
<P>	This is a dangerous flaw. The record of the 20th century suggests that the present 
period of diminished global tensions will not last, and that major new threats to national 
survival may emerge in the near future. However, the Clinton administration seems to 
assume that the end of the Cold War meant the end of history, at least as far as great-
power threats to national security were concerned. The result is a U.S. defense budget 
that exhibits high levels of consumption and very low levels of investment.</P>
<P>	Both in their rhetoric and in their resource allocations, senior Pentagon executives 
and many congressional Republicans have been preoccupied with "readiness"--the 
ability to fight effectively on short notice. Readiness is a notoriously nebulous concept, 
but in economic terms it translates into consumption: Money is spent to preserve and 
enhance current capabilities rather than prepare for the future.</P>
<P>	Like other forms of consumption, readiness tends to be bought at the expense of 
procurement of new weapons. In inflation-adjusted terms, Pentagon procurement 
accounts now stand at the lowest levels since 1950, the year the Korean War began. The 
$39 billion requested by the Clinton Administration for weapons procurement in fiscal 
1996 constitutes only 16 percent of a defense budget that itself has shrunk to a mere 15.5 
percent of overall federal expenditures. In other words, the Pentagon's planned spending 
on all types of equipment for military services in fiscal 1996 adds up to only 2.5 percent 
of the federal budget--an amount of money equal to about four months' of sales by the 
Ford Motor Co.</P>
<P>	The Clinton administration contends that this low level of investment is justified 
by a diminished threat and the huge inventory of weapons accumulated during the Cold 
War. It also claims that a planned increase in procurement will lead to "recapitalization" 
of the armed forces toward the end of the 1996-2001 Future Years Defense Plan. 
However, the Pentagon's current predictions for 2001 may not be any more reliable than 
those of science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke. It is possible that spending on 
procurement will remain depressed. If that occurs--while high levels of readiness are 
sustained--the armed forces will suffer continued depletion of their weapons inventories.</P>

<H3>Lessons of the Past</H3>
<P>	Unfortunately, the depletion of capital stocks could coincide with the reemergence 
of threats abroad and a revolution in military technology, creating a situation not unlike 
that of the 1930s. The current debate over national-security needs presents a rather 
distressing spectacle in historical amnesia. The struggle with communism for the past two 
generations has so strongly influenced policymakers that they exhibit little apparent 
capacity for interpreting that experience in a broader context.</P>
<P>	The Cold War was the third occasion in this century when the U.S. mobilized to 
prevent anti-democratic forces from dominating Eurasia. The century began with the 
challenge posed by German imperialism, and barely a generation later the U.S. was at war 
again, this time to defeat fascism. The outcome of WWII then set the stage for the anti-
communist crusade of the post-war period. </P>
<P>	Note that the same pattern repeated itself with each new danger. Regional powers 
gradually accumulated land and resources while the United States was distracted; early 
warnings that a great-power threat was emerging were greeted with widespread 
skepticism; when the threat became urgent, U.S. leaders discovered they were woefully 
unprepared and commenced a hasty mobilization; once the threat passed, the nation 
engaged in an equally hasty demobilization. After a period of relative tranquillity, the 
cycle has repeated itself.</P>
<P>	It is remarkable that the political elite of a world power could experience three 
complete threat cycles in one century and still not grasp the basic lesson that a fourth 
such challenge is likely sometime relatively soon. As Colin Gray, a military theorist, has 
noted, "American policymaking in the national security area tends to be dominated by 
people with a poor sense of the value of history." Whatever the explanation, current U.S. 
defense policies reflect a startling lack of strategic vision.</P>
<P>	For example, the 1993 Bottom-Up Review was conceived by the Clinton 
administration as a comprehensive assessment of military resources and requirements for 
the post-Cold War period. It prudently concluded that U.S. forces should be able to 
successfully prosecute "two major regional conflicts that occur nearly simultaneously." 
And yet nowhere in the document is the historical significance of regional conflicts 
clearly spelled out--that great-power threats to U.S. security typically originate in 
regional aggression not countered in a timely manner. </P>
<P>	From this perspective, the real danger posed by Saddam Hussein in 1990-91 was 
not his violent annexation of Kuwait, for the invasion of Kuwait was no more significant 
than Japan's occupation of Manchuria in 1931 or Germany's remilitarization of the 
Rhineland in 1936. The danger lies in the bolder designs an aggressor might pursue if he 
encounters no resistance.</P>
<P>	History thus provides a compelling reason for being ready to fight. But it also 
teaches that the emergence of aggressive great powers is characteristic of the geopolitical 
landscape, and that unless the United States continually invests in new defense 
capabilities, it may eventually be unable to avoid defeat at the hands of such a power.</P>
<P>	Viewed against this backdrop, the fundamental defect of the Clinton 
administration's defense plan is all too evident: It purchases current readiness at the price 
of future preparedness. When procurement spending is inadequate, high levels of 
readiness inevitably use up weapons for which there are no replacements. Meanwhile, a 
drop in military contracts prompts the production base of the defense industry to atrophy. 
The U.S. thus gradually loses the military and industrial capacity to respond effectively to 
aggression.</P>
<P>	The Clinton administration recognizes this problem and therefore has begun to 
plan for the "recapitalization" of the armed forces--an unfortunate appropriation of a 
term usually associated with the restructuring of bankrupt organizations. But the concept 
of bankruptcy may not be entirely misplaced, because administration plans make future 
procurement increases contingent on raising the overall defense budget and realizing 
substantial savings from base closures and acquisition reform. None of these sources can 
be counted on to generate enough money for a sustained surge in investment.</P>

<H3>The "Procurement Holiday"</H3>
<P>	The Congressional Budget Office refers to the current slump in weapons 
purchases as a "procurement holiday." But like Franklin Roosevelt's "bank holiday" 
during the darkest days of the Great Depression, this is merely a pleasant way of 
describing a system on the verge of collapse. The real buying power of the Pentagon's 
procurement budget declined 67 percent between fiscal 1985--the peak year of President 
Reagan's defense buildup--and fiscal 1995. The administration proposes a procurement 
budget of only $39 billion in 1996, which would bring the total reduction from the peak 
in fiscal 1985 to 71 percent. Backlogs in defense contracts are expected to contract 
eventually by a similar amount, forcing many defense contractors to exit the business and 
reducing competition among those who remain.</P>
<P>	No other part of the defense budget has experienced a comparable decline. The 
major categories of weapons-related expenditures correspond roughly with the key stages 
in the product life cycle: research and development, procurement, and operations and 
maintenance. The operations and maintenance budget includes most of the spending 
related to readiness, whereas R&D, together with procurement, constitutes most 
investment spending. All three accounts declined between fiscal 1990 (the year the Berlin 
Wall fell) and fiscal 1995. But procurement shrank from 28 percent of a relatively large 
budget to 17 percent of a much smaller budget. In constant 1995 dollars, procurement 
spending fell in just five years from $94 billion to $43 billion--a 54 percent cut.</P>
<P>	The impact of declining procurement expenditures on the production of major 
weapon systems has been dramatic:</P>
<UL><LI>  In fiscal 1996, the Air Force does not plan to purchase a single fighter or bomber. In 
fact, it plans to purchase no new bombers throughout the 1996-2001 Future Years 
Defense Plan, even though nearly half of its long-range bombers are more than 30 years 
old, and the sole fighter program it has in development (the F-22) has been repeatedly cut 
back and delayed.<BR>
<LI>  The Navy plans to purchase seven ships in fiscal 1996, only a third as many as it 
purchased in 1990. Over the course of the Future Years Defense Plan, it will buy just one 
submarine every other year from its last remaining sub manufacturer, and many observers 
believe the recently authorized CVN-76 will be the last large-deck carrier the service 
procures.<BR>
<LI>  The Army has stopped purchasing main battle tanks, and has no plans to resume 
purchases any time in the next 15 years. It has been unable to find sufficient funding to 
support upgrades to its existing tanks at an economic rate.</UL>
<P>	The Clinton administration argues that reduced levels of procurement are an 
appropriate response to the end of the Cold War, and that the high procurement 
expenditures of the Reagan-Bush years have made it possible to adequately equip 
shrinking military forces without buying new weapons. Senior administration officials 
point out that R&D spending for new weapons technologies has declined only 
moderately, and that when recapitalization commences early in the next century, it will 
not be necessary to replace weapons on a one-for-one basis. They also claim that by the 
time it is necessary to increase procurement, acquisition reforms will make it possible to 
acquire some military systems more quickly and less expensively from commercial 
sources. Finally, they note that a 47 percent real increase in procurement is planned 
between fiscal 1996 and 2001.</P>
<P>	If all of these assertions proved true, there would be little reason for concern. The 
U.S. would presumably be well-positioned for the challenges that might arise in the next 
century. However, the administration's positions obscure as much as they reveal, and are 
based on assumptions that may prove to be unreliable. For example, the same acquisition 
reforms that supposedly will enable the armed forces to buy advanced technologies more 
quickly and cheaply from commercial sources will also facilitate the transfer of those 
technologies to potential adversaries. As the acquisition system places increased 
emphasis on "dual-use" technologies with both military and commercial applications, it is 
inevitable that foreign nations will gain greater access to advanced military capabilities. 
Acquisition reform could thus hasten the emergence of new threats.</P>
<P>	The contention that a smaller force structure can be adequately equipped from 
existing weapons inventories has some validity. For instance, the average age of ships in 
the Navy's active fleet is declining despite the low level of new procurement, because 
older ships are being retired in large numbers. However, the administration's own data 
demonstrate that many key military systems are approaching the mid-point of their 
projected lives, and will eventually require replacements. Furthermore, continuously 
depressed levels of new procurement will gradually erode the defense industry's capacity 
to produce those replacements. In the case of the submarine business, the Navy will soon 
be dependent on a single shipyard that is producing only one boat every two years. If 
even one submarine is removed from the production schedule, the supplier base will 
probably collapse.</P>
<P>	The most misleading argument the administration advances is that it is cutting 
procurement while maintaining R&D specifically in order to prepare for future threats. 
That ignores what is being developed and what is actually being procured. In December, 
the administration announced that the Army's highest-priority acquisition program, the 
Comanche helicopter, would be kept in development and not moved forward to 
production. The Comanche is the only truly stealthy aircraft likely to enter the Army 
inventory in the next 20 years, so deferring its production means soldiers will have to 
face future threats in increasingly vulnerable conventional helicopters. Thus the benefits 
of a decade of development are being lost because of a decision not to procure.</P>
<P>	Similarly, the administration is resisting congressional efforts to procure 
additional B-2 "stealth" bombers even though there is extensive evidence that the planned 
force of 20 B-2s and 200 older bombers cannot meet projected operational requirements. 
Opposing further purchases of the B-2 might make sense if a cheaper and equally 
survivable alternative were under development, but it isn't. Instead, the Air Force plans to 
rely on vulnerable B-1s and B-52s to carry out the bulk of future long-range bombing 
missions. Here again, the benefits of a $20-billion development effort are being 
squandered, with no long-term plan for recovery in sight.</P>

<H3>Bad Trade</H3>
<P>	It is obvious that such decisions are not being driven by doctrinal or operational 
considerations. They are dictated by budgetary pressures. The Clinton administration 
apparently has concluded that unless there is a significant increase in defense spending, 
readiness can only be maintained by drastically limiting investment. This is a tradeoff that 
cannot be continued indefinitely because low levels of procurement eventually translate 
into low levels of preparedness. It is a tradeoff that is not only unacceptable, but 
unnecessary. To avoid this trap, the Pentagon must get serious about privatizing military 
support functions.</P>
<P>	In recent years, many private companies have restructured their operations to 
focus on core competencies. By shedding activities that either are not central to the 
organization's mission or can be performed less expensively by others, companies are 
able to emphasize what they do well and thereby improve their efficiency. The 
Department of Defense is overdue for such a restructuring. Although the department has 
undergone considerable downsizing and there is much talk of "reinventing" what 
remains, there is little evidence of greater efficiency. The result is that even in the midst 
of a budget crisis, the Pentagon continues to waste huge amounts of money.</P>
<P>	The defense department lacks market discipline, and exhibits many of the 
managerial defects of a top-down monopoly. That is hardly surprising, because the 
department was established to exercise a monopoly in the application of military power, 
and like the rest of the federal government it is not a product of economic forces. But it 
still can benefit from those forces.</P>
<P>	After WWII, the department accumulated a vast array of support functions--such 
as supply management, equipment maintenance, dependent health care, data processing, 
accounting, and commissaries--that, while necessary to the effective exercise of military 
power, do not need to be performed by the government. One way of freeing up money for 
additional procurement is to gradually privatize those support functions that can be 
provided by private-sector sources.</P>
<P>	The Office of Management and Budget has estimated that the federal government 
saves nearly $10,000 every time the functions of a worker are contracted out. On average, 
the government "outsourcing" saves 20 to 30 percent per contract. However, contracting 
out and privatization have been constrained by convention and by concern that critical 
services might not be available from private-sector providers in wartime. There is little 
empirical basis for this concern, and the cost of continuing to make policy as if it were 
valid is staggering. For example, studies of the $15-billion depot-maintenance system for 
conducting weapons repairs have found 25 to 50 percent of the system is unneeded 
capacity. Some outsourcing of depot maintenance already occurs, but complete 
privatization could probably save billions of dollars every year.</P>
<P>	There are numerous other examples of defense support activities that could be 
privatized. About 48,000 civilian and military personnel are engaged in supply and 
distribution activities. Overhead costs for goods delivered by these personnel average 70 
to 90 percent of the value of the goods themselves, a high figure by private-sector 
standards. The transportation, storage, and administrative costs associated with buying 
and distributing spare parts alone is roughly $5 billion per year, not counting the cost of 
the parts. Many private-sector companies have developed advanced inventory 
management and distribution systems that could substantially cut these costs.</P>
<P>	Financial-information systems is another area that could benefit from 
privatization. The Pentagon reported in 1994 that of 28 major audits of its operations in 
the previous year, 26 were unfavorable. During the same year, the department was unable 
to match $19 billion in disbursements to specific contractual requirements, meaning the 
money may have been paid erroneously. The level of unmatched disbursements is all the 
more striking in view of the fact that it requires more than 100 separate transactions for 
the department to issue a single check. Despite all of these steps, many of which 
presumably exist to prevent mistakes, the chief of staff of the Air Force recently said that 
"it would be nice if we knew what actual costs were, but our accounting systems often do 
not perform this simple and reasonable service."</P>
<P>	The Clinton administration is striving mightily to "reinvent" the Pentagon's 
financial management systems, but "deinvention" might make more sense. The private 
sector is full of data-management and accounting firms that long ago solved the challenge 
of tracking money within large organizations. Many large firms have turned over their 
day-to-day financial-support requirements to these firms. The Pentagon should seriously 
consider doing the same thing, just as it should consider turning over the post-exchange 
and commissary functions to Wal-Mart.</P>
<P>	An example of how greater reliance on the marketplace could reduce defense 
support costs is provided by the General Services Administration's 1991 decision to 
transfer time-urgent delivery functions to FedEx Corp. The General Accounting Office 
estimates that relying on private-sector sources for overnight delivery reduced the 
government's costs by 76 percent. FedEx's performance was such an improvement that 
the Air Force is increasingly relying on private-sector providers for its own deliveries of 
critical spare parts.</P>
<P>	Nobody really knows how much money the Department of Defense might save 
through the wholesale privatization of support functions. But the annual savings could 
eventually be sufficient to sustain higher levels of procurement without cutting readiness 
or force structure. In fact, privatization would have multiple benefits for the procurement 
budget: Not only would it free up funds for weapons purchases, but transferring 
weapons-support functions to the companies that make the systems could also help 
preserve critical industrial capabilities and reduce the overhead costs they charge on 
procurement contracts.</P> 
<P>	If there is a final lesson in all this, it is that there is no substitute for vision, 
whether strategic or managerial. We may not be able to know the future, but we certainly 
can have a reasonably clear idea of what the past tells us about the range of possibilities. 
In the case of defense spending, past experience warns against a prolonged drought in 
investment, particularly when high levels of readiness are gradually consuming existing 
capital equipment. In the case of defense management, past experience dictates that the 
marketplace is the most efficient provider of goods, and that continuing to perform 
support functions within the government reduces the military's capacity to accomplish its 
mission. These are easy lessons to grasp; the question is whether we will have the 
courage to act on them. Investing more in modern weapons while privatizing support 
functions would prove that, for once, we have learned from our past mistakes.</P>

ABUSE OF THE MILITARY</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
Military personnel discharged for homosexuality often file complaints
in federal court seeking reinstatement.  The current groundswell
of cases is tying up the federal court system.  Congress has the
authority to direct that the military courts, which are better
equipped to resolve these cases, assume the litigation burden.
<P>
On January 28, 1993, California-based U.S. District Judge Terry
J. Hatter, Jr. held that the military's policy excluding homosexuals
was unconstitutional and enjoined the entire Department of Defense
from discharging or denying enlistment based on sexual orientation.
 He also enjoined the Pentagon from maintaining files having to
do with the sexual orientation of any member of the armed forces
in the absence of conduct affecting the military mission.
<P>
Hatter's decision came in the case of Petty Officer Keith Meinhold,
who announced on <I>ABC World News Tonight</I>: "Yes, I am,
in fact, gay."  On appeal, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals struck down Hatter's earlier decision to extend the decision
to the entire Defense Department and criticized him for accepting
the case before the military appeal process was exhausted.  
<P>
However, immediately after Hatter's decision and before the appeal,
Assistant Secretary of Defense Edwin Dorn cited the decision in
order to force the armed services to lift the ban.  This was an
unusual response to a district court order.  In the past, decisions
involving only one soldier have never been generalized to the
entire military.
<P>
The military discharges hundreds of personnel for homosexuality
each year.  Homosexual activist groups such as the Lambda Legal
Defense and Education Fund are leading a national campaign to
defeat the military's homosexual law in the courts.  According
to Michelle Benecke, co-director for the pro-homosexual Servicemembers
Legal Defense Network, hundreds of former military members discharged
for homosexuality are seeking reinstatement through the federal
court system.[1]
<P>
Each federal case taxes the courts.  The trail for each case through
the military administrative system and the federal judicial system
is both time-consuming and costly.  For example, a service member
discharged administratively under the Pentagon's homosexual regulations
receives an administrative hearing.  The results of that hearing
are reviewed, and then, subject to the review, the member is discharged
from the service.  Other service members discharged for consensual homosexual acts are often
given administrative misconduct
discharges or courts-martial.  In either case, the former member
has a couple of years to file a complaint against the federal
government seeking reinstatement.  Most discharged members seek
relief by questioning the constitutionality of the decision: 1)
violation of due process, 2) infringement of free speech, 3) discrimination,
and 4) the unlawfulness of criminalizing sodomy.
<P>
<CENTER><H3> A CASE IN POINT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Former midshipman Joseph C. Steffan was dismissed for declaring
himself a homosexual while at the U.S. Naval Academy in 1987.
 He received an administrative hearing and chose to submit a "qualified
resignation" in May 1987.  A year and a half later, he wrote
the Secretary of the Navy seeking to withdraw his resignation
and continue his education at the Academy.  The request was denied.
 Steffan brought suit in federal court in 1989, charging that
the Academy's regulations were unconstitutional.
<P>
Steffan's initial federal court foray was decided in November
1989.  The court dismissed the case, citing Steffan's refusal
to cooperate with the court.  On January 10, 1991 Steffan filed
a request for documents which were to be used in a presumed appeal.
 The appeal that followed was decided by a three-judge panel from
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
on November 16, 1993.  The same appeals court then called for
a rehearing of the case by the entire 11-member court.  The full
court reversed the previous ruling on November 22, 1994.  Steffan
ended his six-year court battle in January 1995 when he decided
not to take his challenge of the military's policy to the Supreme
Court.
<P>
 <CENTER><H3>A COST-SAVING ALTERNATIVE</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The military has an operational court system which could be required
by Congress to hear homosexual discharge complaints.  The military
courts are better equipped to consider such cases than the federal
court system, and such a move would save the federal government
millions of dollars in federal judiciary expenses and likely provide
a more thorough and faster resolution to the growing number of
homosexual complaints.
<P>
Congress must consider passing a law awarding limited civil jurisdiction
to military courts to handle homosexual complaints.  Should there
be a concern that the military courts might try to expand the
jurisdiction, another, although less attractive, alternative is
available.  Congressional designation of the District of Columbia
Circuit Court of Appeals as the sole appeals court for all military
homosexual cases would also provide a more consistent view of
the issue.  Federal district courts would still give decisions
on initial complaints, but only the D.C. Circuit would hear the
cases on appeal.  This both saves the government money and brings
consistency to a complex and specialized issue.

<title> MORE MILITARY BASES NEED TO BE CLOSED -- Heritage </title>

<center><i><h3>MORE MILITARY BASES NEED TO BE CLOSED</i></h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
Backgrounder #1042<br>
July 18, 1995<br>
</center>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
	Congress initiated a process for closing military bases in 1988 when it became clear that the United States was going to reduce the size of its military forces after the Cold War. To provide guidance on base-closing decisions, Congress created the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, an independent body of eight individuals with  expertise in defense policy. The commission was assigned the responsibility of deciding which military bases will be closed or realigned and submitting its recommendations to the President and Congress.
<p>

	Until recently, the base closure process had been successful. Independent commissions made recommendations to reduce defense infrastructure in 1988, 1991, and 1993. The President and Congress ultimately adopted each of the packages of recommendations, and the closure and realignment decisions are being implemented. But the latest round of base closings, which is the last currently planned, has been flawed in several important respects. The process has been politicized by the White House. Anticipated budget savings have been disappointingly meager. And base closures have lagged behind reductions in military forces, personnel, and budgets. There still are too many bases for the size of the U.S. armed forces anticipated by Administration policy.
<p>
	  The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission submitted its recommendations to the President on July 1. These include decisions to close 28 major bases, realign 22 major bases, and close or realign a larger number of minor bases. President Clinton on July 13 reluctantly accepted the commission's recommendations. As Congress considers these recommendations, there are several problems with the base closure and realignment process that must be addressed. Each presents an opportunity for a legislative remedy. Congress should:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Accept the findings of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission.</b> The military services need to close bases. The retention of unneeded bases will impose a financial drain on the military at a time when its budget has been reduced. The money saved by closing bases can be used to fund vital military readiness and modernization programs. The base closure process, therefore, must move forward. A decision by Congress to reject the findings of the commission will require the military to absorb the cost of maintaining 22 major bases and a larger number of minor bases it does not need.
<br>
<li><b>Extend the base closure process for another two rounds.</b> The closing of military bases still lags behind the reduction in military forces, personnel, and budgets. While defense budgets have declined by about 35 percent in real terms between FY1985 and FY1994, and military personnel levels have dropped by 25 percent over the same time, the size of base infrastructure has fallen by only 15 percent. This year's list of base closures and realignments submitted by the Department of Defense, as modified by the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, makes it likely this lag will continue. Since this is the last round of base closures authorized by Title XXIX of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 1991, Congress should extend the closure and realignment process for another two rounds.
<br>
<li><b>Increase its oversight of the process by which the Administration recommends base closures to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission.</b> According to numerous press reports, the White House may have politicized the process of base closings by pressing the Department of Defense to remove bases from the closure list in states that loom large in next year's presidential race. This process was established with the intent of separating political considerations from base closure decisions. Congress needs to call the Clinton White House to account if it has attempted to politicize the process. It can start by holding hearings on whether there were attempts by aides at the White House to intervene.
<br>
<li><b>Reduce the cost of closing bases.</b> The ultimate goal of the base closure process is to reduce the cost of carrying unnecessary infrastructure. This will free up money to support military readiness and modernization. It has become apparent, however, that it is costing the Pentagon considerable sums of money to shut down the bases and that savings are not realized until years later. Congress can ease this problem by scaling back the environmental and other regulations that drive up the initial costs of closing bases. This includes shortening the lengthy process for evaluating the environmental status of bases about to closed. Further, Congress should ensure that such closing costs come not from the defense budget, badly strapped by cuts, but from such other federal accounts as the environmental account or the community development account.
<br>
<li><b>Privatize military depots.</b> The cost of performing depot maintenance is too high. In addition to making recommendations for closing or realigning regular military bases, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission has the power to recommend closing military depots, which are logistical and maintenance facilities. The rate of closing depots is roughly the same as that for regular military bases. Congress could spur this process by enacting legislation to privatize many of the maintenance duties now performed at Defense Department depots.
</ul>
<p>


<b>THE BASE CLOSURE PROCESS IN PERSPECTIVE</b>
<p>
	The Reagan Administration began the base closure process in 1988. Subsequent recommendations for reductions were adopted in 1991 and 1993. Since Cold War defense budgets peaked in 1985 and major military personnel reductions began in 1990, the process has run concurrently with the general budget and force reductions at the Pentagon.
<p>
	But the base closure process has not led to a reduction in military infrastructure that is commensurate with other defense cutbacks. While defense budgets have declined by about 35 percent in real terms between FY 1985 and FY 1994, and military personnel levels have dropped by 25 percent over the same time, the base infrastructure has fallen by only 15 percent as measured in replacement value (see Chart 1).1  The same lag appears between base closures and reductions in military forces. For example, during the period covering FY 1988 through FY 1994, the Army shed eight divisions or, roughly 30 percent of its force structure. Yet base reductions involving all the services, as measured in replacement value, have fallen by just 15 percent. Similar comparisons can be made for the Air Force and Navy (see  Chart 2).
<p>
	The  budget savings derived from the three previous rounds of base closings are disappointing. The Pentagon estimates net savings to the defense budget from all three of the previous rounds of base closures at just $3.1 billion (1996 dollars).2  Savings have been lower than might be expected because the cost of shutting down the bases was $13.1 billion (in 1996 dollars).3  Absent the closure costs, the savings would be $16.2 billion (in 1996 dollars). After the payment of closure costs, the estimated annual savings are $4.2 billion (again in 1996 dollars).4<p>	Excess  depot capacity is likely to be as great a problem as excess military infrastructure. As military equipment inventories have fallen, the depots to service this equipment have not been eliminated. For example, between 1988 and 1994 the Air Force reduced the number of fighter and attack aircraft authorized for deployment by almost 50 percent. Assuming Air Force depots have been reduced at roughly the same rate as bases generally, the depots have been reduced by only 15 percent.5<p><b>THE PENTAGON'S RECOMMENDATIONS ON BASE CLOSURES</b><p>	The Department of Defense forwarded its recommendations for closing and realigning bases to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission on February 28, 1995. The recommendations proposed closing 33 major bases or facilities and realigning (closing a portion of a base or moving one or more of its functions) 26 others. A larger number of smaller facilities would be closed or realigned. As measured in replacement value, the recommendations would have reduced defense infrastructure by about 6 percent. Assuming this is the last round, all the rounds combined would reduce military infrastructure by 21 percent from 1991 levels, as measured in replacement value.6<p>	The recommendations of the Department of Defense do not go far enough. The resulting base structure will be too large for the size of the U.S. armed forces. For example, the Clinton Administration's projected defense budget for the year 2000 wou
ld be 58 percent of the 1985 defense budget in real terms. The number of active duty military personnel in the year 2000 would fall to 67 percent of the number in 1985. Military infrastructure, by contrast, would still be roughly 79 percent of what it was in 1985 under the Pentagon's base closure recommendation. Force structure reductions in the Air Force, Army, and Navy will also be far deeper than the corresponding cutbacks in infrastructure.
<p>
	Political considerations. Given the pressing need to reduce military infrastructure in the United States, the relatively modest recommendations of the Department of Defense were surprising. It was widely expected that in this round of base closures the Department of Defense would propose reducing military infrastructure by as much as the three previous rounds combined.
<p>
	Of course, this did not happen. The likely explanation is political intervention by the White House. President Clinton's aides reportedly attempted in 1994 to put off the entire round of reductions slated for this year because they feared the negative repercussions for President Clinton's reelection effort in affected states.7  White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta reportedly intervened with Secretary of Defense William Perry later last year to have the scope of the reductions trimmed.8<p>	The politicization of the process became apparent when President Clinton boasted in a January 1995 radio interview that the Navy's shipyard near Portsmouth, New Hampshire, would not be included on the list of closed bases. Indeed, the Portsmouth facility was not included in the Secretary's recommended closure list. Thus, the White House knew what the Secretary of Defense was going to recommend more than a month before the Pentagon submitted its recommendations. Nevertheless, the report of the Secretary of Defense to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission asserts that the recommendations for the closure of military bases were objective and nonpolitical.9  This appears not to be the case.<p><b>THE DELIBERATIONS OF THE BASE CLOSURE AND REALIGNMENT COMMISSION</b><p>To its credit, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission apparently recognized and tried to resist the Clinton Administration's attempt to politicize the process. The commission on May 10 announced it had added 31 bases to the list recommended by the Secretary of Defense for either closure or realignment.10  The additional bases included the Portsmouth shipyard. Press reports indicated that the White House was particularly interested in striking bases from the list that were located in California, New Hampshire, and Texas.11  Nevertheless, of the 31 bases added to the list by the commission, 13, or almost 42 percent, are located in or near these three states.<p>	The commission on July 1 announced its list of bases for closure or reali
gnment.12 Despite its earlier action of adding bases to its list for consideration that were not included in the recommendation submitted by the Secretary of Defense, the commission chose not to expand the number of major bases to be closed or realigned. In fact, the  commission ultimately decided to close only 28 major military bases instead of the 33 proposed earlier by the Pentagon. The commission also recommended realigning another 22 major bases. This compares to 26 realignments recommended to the commission by the Department of Defense. The closures and realignments proposed by the commission probably will shrink the military infrastructure by about 6 percent. 
<p>

<b>IMPROVING THE BASE CLOSURE PROCESS</b>
<p>
	To be a complete success, the base closure process needs to be extended and improved. This will require Congress to:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Accept the findings of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission.</b> Moving the base closure process forward first requires implementing the current round of cutbacks. Congress should not force the military to carry the cost of maintaining unneeded bases. Congress can take a step toward preserving the base closure process by accepting the commission's findings.
<br>
<li><b>Extend the base closure process for another two rounds.</b> The additional two rounds will reduce military bases to between 64 percent and 69 percent of what they were during the Cold War. Even after these two additional rounds, the cutback in bases will trail reductions in military budgets, personnel, and forces.     Defense budgets and force structure will be around 60 percent of Cold War levels. These rounds should occur in 1997 and 1999.
<br>
<li><b> Increase its oversight of the process by which the Administration recommends base closures to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission.</b> The political manipulation of the base closure process by the White House, if true, is unacceptable. Preventing such abuses in the future will require rigorous congressional oversight. The first step requires determining whether the charges leveled at the White House by the press are true. The House and Senate Military Construction Appropriations Subcommittees should hold hearings on these charges and require both White House staff and Pentagon officials to testify.
<br>
<li><b>Reduce the cost of closing bases.</b> Savings in the base closure process have been low because the cost of shutting down bases is too high. Closing bases has become an expensive proposition for several reasons. First of all, the procedures for selling off bases and other facilities are being circumvented. Many of the properties are retained by the Department of Defense or given to other federal agencies, or to state and local governments, at no cost.13  Selling these properties to the private sector would help offset the closure costs.
<p>
	The second reason for the high costs is that local governments are successfully pressuring the federal government to provide grants and other assistance to them in order to support the conversion of properties. Such improvements include  building roads and sewer systems, many of which are funded through the defense budget. This has turned the Department of Defense into a community development agency. Funding such social and economic projects is not a proper function of the Department. The federal government needs to exercise discipline in rejecting the demands of local communities for assistance in upgrading and improving the  properties that are being disposed of by the Department of Defense.
<p>
	The third reason is that the cost of environmental cleanup is too high. The Department of Defense is expected to spend over $5 billion on environmental cleanup, much of it for cleaning up closed bases. Some of these costs are caused by unrealistic federal and local environmental requirements; cleaning ground water, for example, is likely to be expensive and in some cases impossible. Some are due to unnecessary environmental policies that put a high priority on cleanup. These policies at times result in the needless cleanup of land that will remain in federal hands and therefore not require cleanup prior to reuse.14  The Pentagon should be relieved of the costs of environmental cleanup altogether. Other federal agencies or departments, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or a new Bureau of Natural Resources, should be given responsibility for these costs.15<li><b>Privatize military depots.</b> The base closure commission has focused on reducing the number of military depots to the level required to meet expected demand for depot service. Many of the depot functions, however, can be privatized and performed by contractors. Not only is it likely that private enterprises can perform these services more efficiently, but the Pentagon will be able to reap a dividend by selling the properties to the private sector.16  This is not to say that all such functions can be privatized. All maintenance duties that require close proximity to combat operations, or that are a part of combat operations, should remain in the hands of the military. Nevertheless, many other functions, and the associated facilities, should be privatized. This would allow the commission to be far more aggressive in closing down depots.
</ul><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
	Base closings must continue if the military is going to maintain its combat capabilities. The excess infrastructure, if not shed, will continue to be a financial drain on the military services. In an era of shrinking defense budgets, this financial drain will weaken America's combat readiness and defense modernization programs. Shedding excess infrastructure requires extending the base closure process by another two rounds. It also entails finding ways to reduce the cost of closing bases. Further, politics must be kept out of the base closure process. Only then can the savings achieved from closing unneeded military bases be used to fund the U.S. armed forces' most important function -- preparing to fight and win the nation's wars.

INTRODUCTION
  <P>   "Our new security strategy will... ensure our defense industry
can supply the weapons and technologies America may need in the
future." So promised then-candidate Bill Clinton in an August 13,
1992, speech before the World Affairs Council of Los Angeles. But just
a few moments later in the speech, Clinton charged that: "There is
today no plan to help our defense workers and military personnel make
a transition to a civilian economy. I have such a plan." Candidate
Clinton thus promised to preserve America's military industrial base
while at the same time converting it to civilian production. Therein
lies a serious contradiction. The weapons and technologies America may
need in the future cannot be made if too many defense industries are
converted to manufacture gas-saving automobiles, for example, instead
of tanks and armored personnel carriers.
<P>
     President Clinton's defense industrial policy has been marked by
two initiatives. On March 11, during a speech outside Baltimore, he
announced a $20 billion defense conversion program. Two weeks later,
he took a step that was tantamount to abandoning the defense
industrial base: he proposed reducing defense budget authority by over
3.5 percent per year over the next five years. (This figure is
calculated in so-called real terms, accounting for the expected rise
in inflation.  Department of Defense, "FY 1994 Defense Budget Begins
New Era," News Release No.  126-93, March 27, 1993.  The news release
is accompanied by a package of supporting materials that provides
total defense budget figures for the period covering fiscal years 1994
through 1998 and detailed information on the fiscal 1994 defense
budget request.) This budget proposal doubles the $60 billion cut
Clinton promised during the campaign. The largest decreases in the
fiscal 1994 defense budget will come in accounts for the procurement
of weapons and equipment. Not having these funds will especially
weaken the defense industrial base because they are the main fuel for
industrial production. The budget authority for procurement spending
will diminish by over $8 billion, or 17 percent in real terms, from
the 1993 level to $45.5 billion in 1994. (Ibid.) Reductions of this
magnitude will make it impossible for the defense industry to produce
an adequate supply of weapons and technologies for America's defense
needs.
<P>
     For Clinton to avoid devastating the military industrial base and
the nation's military posture, he must reverse course. He should:
<P>
     Concentrate his long-range defense planning above all on the
     industrial needs of the armed forces, and not on converting the
     defense industrial base to civilian production.
<P>
     Eliminate the $20 billion defense conversion program. 
<P>
     Focus defense planning on the building and buying of the next
     generation of weapons.
<P>
     Give governmental support to specific defense industries only as
     a last resort. There may be times when the government will have
     to support a particular defense industry -- one which
     manufactures submarines, for example -- which may not appear to
     be needed in the short run, but which may be needed to meet some
     future threat.
<P>
CLINTON'S DEFENSE CONVERSION POLICY
<P>
     The Clinton defense conversion plan was developed during the 1992
presidential campaign and the first months of his Administration. The
policy was announced on March 11 in a speech by the President to the
employees of Westinghouse Electronics Systems, outside Baltimore. The
$20 billion program is based on four principles: 
<P>
Principle #1: America's so-called defense economy needs to be
     converted tocivilian production. 
<P>
     Clinton believes that the Cold War produced a U.S. economy
heavily burdened by defense expenditures. Supposedly all this spending
on defense deprives the economy and the government of funds for
domestic programs. Also it supposedly distorts the economy toward non-
productive purposes.
<P>
Principle #2: The federal government should play a central role in
     managing defense conversion. 
<P>
     Of the $20 billion that the Clinton Administration proposes to
spend over a five-year period on defense conversion, $10 billion will
go to so-called investments in government-selected civilian
technologies. This is predicated on the notion that the government
knows better than the businesses already operating in the market which
civilian technologies will sell. Another $4 billion of Clinton's
program will go to government-sponsored retraining programs for
displaced defense workers. And $1 billion will provide federal
assistance to local communities hurt by defense cutbacks. Only one-
fourth of the funds, about $5 billion, will be spent on programs that
have potential military utility. These funds will go to developing
"dual-use" technologies, meaning those that have both military and
civilian applications.
<P>
Principle #3: The primary purpose of the defense conversion is to
     preserve defense production capabilities for the civilian
     economy. 
<P>
     In making his announcement at the Westinghouse facility, Clinton
extolled the facility's effort to increase civilian production from 16
percent of total output in 1986 to a projected level of 50 percent by
1995. He hopes to encourage this type of conversion around the
country. As the President said in his Westinghouse speech: "What you
have done here [at Westinghouse] is what I wish to do nationally --
take the most talented people in the world who've produced some of the
most sophisticated military technology and put that to work in the
civilian economy."
<P>
Principle #4: The impact of defense conversion on national security
     will be marginal. 
<P>
     Clinton says: "With the dwindling Soviet threat, we can cut
defense spending over a third by 1997." The President clearly believes
that these levels of defense cuts can be made without weakening
national security. By the same token, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin
argues that poor economic performance -- supposedly caused partly by
too much defense spending -- is itself a national security threat.
"The danger here," says Aspin, "is the failure to see our national
security interests in a way that includes our economic success.
Economic well-being is vital to our security." Seen in this way,
spending on domestic programs can be said to have some bearing on
national security.
<P>
CLINTON'S DEFENSE DRAWDOWN IN PERSPECTIVE
<P>
     The defense budget began declining well before the end of the
Persian Gulf War and the election of Bill Clinton. In fact, defense
budget authority in real terms peaked in fiscal 1985, well before the
end of the Cold War. This downturn in defense spending has been
gradual. But critics of the armed forces, including President Clinton,
argue that the American economy is suffering from massive dislocations
because of a rapid "demilitarization" of the economy. While some
communities are suffering severe economic problems as a result of the
defense drawdown, the economy as a whole has not been greatly damaged
as a result of the defense cuts. This is because defense is not a
large segment of the economy and because defense expenditures impose
only a modest burden on the economy.
<P>
     President Clinton, though, is trapped by his belief that he
inherited what he terms a "defense economy." He is wrong. The money
the government will actually spend on defense in 1993 -- so-called
outlays -- will constitute only 4.7 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP). Clinton's budget will reduce that burden to around 3 percent by
1998. By focusing on the marginal improvements to the economy that may
be obtained by "making a transition to a civilian economy," Clinton
ignores the impact of his decision on the U.S. military posture. While
the Clinton defense reductions affect only 1.7 percent of GDP over a
five-year period, they will result in a defense budget reduction of 18
percent and reductions of perhaps 50 percent by 1998 in the amount the
Pentagon spends on weapons and equipment. (The Clinton Administration
has not released defense procurement budget figures for the years
beyond fiscal 1994.) When coupled with budget reductions already
imposed under Ronald Reagan and George Bush, the defense spending
trend under Clinton is even more disturbing. After accounting for
inflation, the fiscal 1993 procurement budget is only 43 percent of
what it was at its peak in 1985. (Department of Defense, National
Defense Budget Estimates for FY 1994 (Washington, D.C.:  Department of
Defense, 1993), p.  80.)
<P>

The Defense Drawdown After World War II 
<P>
     During World War II, the nation truly had a defense economy. In
the war's last year, 1945, over 39 percent of the nation's GDP was
devoted to defense. By 1948, less than 4 percent of GDP was spent on
defense. (Ibid., p.  140.) Defense spending in 1945 was $714 billion
in 1987 dollars; by 1948, it was under $65 billion. Thus, in only
three years, defense spending had fallen by 90 percent. (Ibid., p. 
128.)
<P>
     By contrast, defense accounted for just 6.5 percent of GDP in
1986. Today it is 4.7 percent. (Ibid., p.  141.) Current projections
are that around 3 percent of GDP will go for defense in 1998.
(Department of Defense, National Defense Budget Estimates for FY 1994
(Washington, D.C.:  Department of Defense, 1993), p.  141; and
Department of Defense, "FY 1994 Defense Budget Begins New Era," News
Release No.  126-93, March 27, 1993.) Defense spending peaked in 1989
at $285.9 billion (in 1987 dollars), and under the Clinton budget will
fall to about $185 billion (also in 1987 dollars) in 1998. (The figure
for 1989 was obtained from Department of Defense, National Defense
Budget Estimates for FY 1994 (Washington, D.C.:  Department of
Defense, 1993), p.  129.  The 1998 figure was calculated by taking the
1998 outlay figure for defense provided by the Department of Defense
and deflating it according to the Department's own deflators.) Thus,
the government will spend 35 percent less in 1998 than in 1989.
Compared with the post-World War II drawdown, the current decline in
the defense budget will result in nowhere near the level of the
economic dislocations seen the late 1940s.
<P>

The Impact on the Armed Forces
<P>
     The true measure of whether a defense policy protects national
security adequately is not how much is spent on defense, but rather
whether the armed forces will have the means to fight and win when
conflict arises. From this perspective, Clinton's approach is
alarming. The Bush Administration by February 1992 had already
recommended terminating over 100 weapons programs in fiscal years 1991
and 1992. For fiscal 1993, it identified another seventeen programs
for termination. (Department of Defense, "Complete Set of Briefing
Charts on the FY 1993 Budget," 1992.) While it is impossible to
quantify precisely the combat value that has been lost by ending these
programs, the Navy faces the likelihood of not having an all-weather
attack aircraft to replace the aging A-6 Intruder. The Clinton
Administration has not yet announced a complete hit list of programs
beyond those announced by the Bush Administration, but it will include
the A/F-X fighter, the Multi-Role Fighter (MRF) aircraft and the F-16
Falcon fighter. (Secretary of Defense Aspin announced these program
terminations when he announced the findings of the "Bottom-Up Review"
on September 1, 1993, at the Pentagon.)
<P>

The Macroeconomic Impact 
<P>
     What will be the impact of Clinton's defense cuts on the economy
as a whole? What will be the effect on economic growth and employment?
The short answer to these questions is very little.
<P>
     On the spending side, government social spending is a far greater
burden than defense spending. Social and economic spending has jumped
in recent years and is likely to continue to explode. Federal social
and economic spending in fiscal 1993 will amount to $945.8 billion
(current dollars) and absorb over 15 percent of GDP (see Chart 2 on
following page). (Department of Defense, National Defense Budget
Estimates for FY 1994 (Washington, D.C.:  Department of Defense,
1993), p.  127.) By these standards, the most important conversion
problem the Clinton Administration faces is not from a defense economy
to a civilian economy, but from a public-sector welfare economy to one
based on private-sector production.
<P>
     Reductions in defense-sector jobs are likely to be offset by
growth in those in the civilian economy. A study by the Defense Budget
Project estimates that the defense drawdown could eliminate as many as
1.791 million defense sector jobs, both private and public, during the
period from fiscal 1992 through fiscal 1998. (Richard A.  Bitzinger
and Steven Kosiak, Potential Impact of Defense Spending Reductions on
the Defense Related Labor Force By State (Washington, D.C.:  Defense
Budget Project, 1993), p.  3.) This higher estimate constitutes about
1.5 percent of all the jobs in the U.S. as of 1992. But since some of
this job loss will result from retirement and normal attrition, other
sectors of the economy will not have to absorb all these positions to
avoid higher unemployment throughout the entire economy.
<P>
     In terms of growth, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated
that defense cuts smaller than those envisioned by Clinton could
encourage growth after the turn of the decade. As a result, by 2002
the annual gross national product (GNP) could be only 0.6 percent
higher than it otherwise might be. (Congressional Budget Office, "The
Economic Effects of Reduced Defense Spending," February 1992, pp. 
13-14.) 
<P>
     The upshot is clear: Clinton is wrong to assert that defense is
an unacceptable burden on the U.S. economy. His defense conversion
program thus becomes little more than a thinly veiled attempt to craft
a government industrial policy. 

<P>
The Impact on the Military Industrial Economy 
<P>
     While the curtailment of defense spending will have only a
marginal impact on the economy as a whole, its impact on the defense
industrial sector will be severe. In addition to the procurement cuts,
Clinton plans to lower the research and development account to $38.6
billion in 1994 (1994 dollars) from a 1985 high of $41.5 billion (also
1994 dollars). (Ibid.) In all, procurement and research and
development under the 1994 Clinton budget will be only 45 percent in
real terms of what it was in 1985 (see Chart 3).
<P>
     As a result of these cuts, U.S. defense industries could lose as
many as 1.052 million people in the period 1992 through 1998 because
of the drawdown. (Richard A.  Bitzinger and Steven Kosiak, Potential
Impact of Defense Spending Reductions on the Defense Related Labor
Force By State (Washington, D.C.:  Defense Budget Project, 1993), p. 
3.) In 1992, these industries employed 2.761 million people. (Ibid.)
Thus, employment in defense industries could fall by as much as 48
percent during this period.

<P>
PRESERVING AMERICA'S MILITARY INDUSTRIAL BASE
<P>
     Maintaining America's military strength requires a strong
military industrial base that can produce a sufficient number of
modern weapons to sustain the U.S. armed forces during combat. The
Clinton Administration risks undermining the industrial base through
defense budget reductions that not only are too deep, but too focused
on decreasing the procurement budget for the purchase of weapons and
equipment. America's soldiers, sailors, and airmen will pay a steep
price in future conflicts as result of this policy. A more sensible
policy would be to:
<P>
Concentrate long-range defense planning above all on the industrial
needs of the armed forces and not on converting the defense industrial
base to civilian production. 
<P>
     The best measure of whether the nation is managing its military
industrial base appropriately is whether its armed forces receive the
latest in technology. Reagan's emphasis on the technological
modernization of the armed forces led directly to the quick victory
and low casualties in the Persian Gulf War.
<P>
     The Clinton Administration should focus on producing weapons that
are now in research and development and represent the next generation
of weapons capability. Some of these are the CVN-76 aircraft carrier,
the V-22 Osprey transport aircraft, the F-22 advanced tactical
fighter, the Light-weight Exoatmospheric Projectile (LEAP) anti-
missile interceptor, the Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)
missile system, the Brilliant Eyes sensor satellite, and the dual-use
Single-Stage Rocket Technology (SSRT) space launch system. These
cutting-edge systems may provide the margin of victory needed in
America's next war. Redirecting the funding in this way will help fund
a new generation of weapons to be put in the hands of America's
soldiers, sailors, and airmen, while at the same time maintaining the
military industrial base. 
<P>
Eliminate the $20 billion defense conversion program. 
<P>
     The Clinton defense conversion program offers $20 billion in
financial incentives to individuals, businesses, and local governments
that are adversely affected by defense budget reductions. This
approach will cause inestimable damage to the defense sector of the
economy by encouraging defense firms to abandon defense production.
<P>
     This $20 billion can be put to better use. It can be recycled
into the procurement account of the defense budget to build new
weapons and equipment, thereby improving the combat capability of the
U.S. armed forces.
<P>
     Even on its own terms, the Clinton defense conversion program is
likely to be a failure. Its central goal is to induce defense
contractors to diversify into non-defense fields. But many defense
companies are already diversified. Further diversification is not
always the best solution for defense companies seeking to adjust to a
reduced defense market. Some defense companies are not well positioned
to penetrate an already saturated consumer market. Others have
invested heavily in products that are unique to defense, and if forced
from the defense business, will lose their investments. Defense
companies should seek solutions that best suit their needs. The
government has no way of knowing what these needs are.
<P>
Focus defense planning on the building and buying of the next
generation of weapons. 
<P>
     Implicit in Clinton's defense plan is the assumption that a high
technology force can be maintained through research and development
alone, without actually buying the weapons systems. This is deceptive,
for three reasons:
<P>
1) Not all advances in weapons technology are derived from research
     and development. Many breakthroughs are realized through the
     production and deployment cycles, particularly those related to
     efficient and reliable production. For example, fighter aircraft
     produced at the end of a production run are frequently more
     reliable and cheaper because of what has been learned by the
     manufacturer in the course of production.
<P>
2) Weapons systems that are in the development stage cannot be used
     effectively in combat. For example, a prototype tank may
     represent the cutting edge in armored technology, but it is of
     little use if not enough have been produced for use in combat and
     if it has not been available to troops for training.
<P>
3) A policy that emphasizes research and development at the expense of
     procurement will undermine production capabilities and the
     industrial base. The sustained production capability needed to
     turn out large numbers of a weapons system cannot be maintained
     if the Pentagon has only prototype models. For example, the C-17
     transport aircraft prototype cost over $1 billion to produce. The
     production models will cost about $300 million each, depending on
     the number purchased. Given the unpredictable nature of regional
     crises, which will be the primary concern of the U.S. military in
     the future, weapons that are not already in production cannot be
     manufactured in large enough numbers to support large combat
     operations. 
<P>
     Furthermore, sharp cuts in procurement funding will adversely
affect the production of existing weapons systems. For example, tight
budgets raise the question of whether to upgrade existing weapons,
such as the F-14 Tomcat fighter aircraft, or to build new systems,
such as the AFX aircraft now in development. Moreover, budget
pressures are forcing decisions to curtail the procurement of existing
weapons systems. The Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and the F-16
Falcon fighter jet are two such systems. But ending production
prematurely may result in a gap in military capabilities as older
systems are retired before the new systems are ready. Besides, once a
decision is made to stop the production of a weapon, the capability to
produce it quickly atrophies. Production line employees are laid off,
the tooling is discarded, and managers are assigned to new tasks.
<P>
     The most disturbing problem associated with sharp reductions in
procurement funding, however, is that it may force the Pentagon to
cancel new weapons programs altogether. The Clinton Administration has
not yet announced a complete list of the new programs it plans to
terminate. The casualty list is likely to be long and is certain to
include the A/F-X aircraft and the Multi-Role Fighter (MRF) aircraft
now in development. As assaults on the procurement budget force
decisions to withhold the production of new weapons, the industrial
base is weakened. The effort to maintain a modern military is likewise
weakened. This is why money restored to the defense budget from
defense conversion should be targeted to the procurement account.
<P>
Give governmental support to specific defense industries only as a
last resort.
<P>
     Even if all of the $20 billion Clinton has earmarked for defense
conversion is returned to military modernization programs, some vital
defense sectors -- nuclear shipbuilding, for example -- may be in
danger of disappearing. This result is predictable for areas where the
perceived threat is limited for the near term. But because the near-
term threat is diminished, it does not mean that the military
capability to counter that threat will never again be needed. For
example, the primary mission for Navy attack submarines during the
Cold War was defending against Soviet submarines armed with submarine-
launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). That mission is less important
today. However, as hostile Third World countries capable of
challenging vital American interests obtain their own submarines, the
U.S. will have to retain a submarine force to deal with this new
threat. For example, Iran has taken delivery of two submarines from
Russia and could challenge U.S. access to Middle East oil. Given poor
planning and reduced defense budgets, however, there may be no nuclear
submarine manufacturers in business when the Navy needs to replace its
aging fleet of attack submarines.
<P>
     Thus the Navy should continue building a third Seawolf submarine,
even though there is little near-term military justification for doing
so. The reason: to keep the shipbuilding capability intact until the
Navy is ready to build its new submarine Centurion. 

<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     The nation's military industrial base does not exist to bolster
the nation's economy. Nor does it exist to expand employment
opportunities. Its purpose is to provide the U.S. with the world's
strongest, most well-armed military. 
<P>
     President Clinton should remember these truths when formulating
his defense plans. Clinton's defense conversion plan will decimate the
defense industrial base of this country. A strong military industrial
base is built carefully over a long period of time. While it can be
dismantled quickly, it is not easily rebuilt. Ultimately, the price
will be paid when President Clinton, or more likely a future
President, is required to order the American military into battle
without the most modern technology or without an adequate number of
weapons and equipment. The nation learned a grim lesson when it
disarmed too quickly after World Wars I and II. American forces thus
were unprepared for World War II and the Korean War and as a result,
many American lives were needlessly lost. 
<P>
     This is a lesson that Clinton should remember not only the next
time he visits Arlington Cemetery, but the next time he makes a
decision affecting the industrial base of this country.

<title>The Defense Budget for Defense: Why Nunn-Lugar Money Should Go to the B-2
 -- Heritage </title>

<center><h3><i>THE DEFENSE BUDGET FOR DEFENSE:<br>
WHY NUNN-LUGAR MONEY SHOULD GO TO THE B-2</H3></i>
<P>

By Baker Spring<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
Executive Memorandum No. 424<br>
August 1, 1995<br>
</center><hr size =3 width =30%>
<P>
    Common sense dictates that the money the government provides to the defense account should
be used to improve America's military capabilities. As with many other things in Washington,
however, common sense does not apply. The defense account is riddled with programs that are either
tangential or completely unrelated to improving America's military capabilities. One is the Nunn-Lugar program to fund the dismantling of weapons on the territory of the former Soviet Union.
<P>
    Later this week, the Senate is likely to begin considering the Defense Authorization Bill for
Fiscal Year 1996 (S. 1026). Included in the bill is an additional $365 million for the Nunn-Lugar
program in fiscal 1996. However, the same bill provides no money to preserve the option of buying
additional B-2 Spirit bombers. More of these bombers will be needed to address both conventional
and strategic threats. Why should the Senate spend money on questionable foreign programs while
depriving the military of even the option of buying more of the most capable bombers ever produced? 
<p>
    Nunn-Lugar is a foreign aid program. The Nunn-Lugar program has been useful in
signaling the new regimes in Russia and other former Soviet states that the United States does not
view them as enemies. Further, it has demonstrated that the U.S. is prepared to make material
assistance available in order to ease tensions.
<p>
    Nevertheless, there are several outstanding questions about the program's effectiveness. The
report to accompany the House version of the Department of Defense Authorization Bill states that
the Administration cannot confirm the proper use of assistance already provided to Russian and other
officials. In fact, the General Accounting Office (GAO) alleges that Nunn-Lugar money has been
used by individuals and institutions working to create new weapons of mass destruction. For example,
the U.S. has committed $46 million to the International Science and Technology Center in Moscow.
The center is designed to employ scientists and engineers, formerly working on weapons projects, in
peaceful pursuits. GAO determined that some of these scientists and engineers are continuing their
weapons-related activities, working for the center only part of the time. If this proves true, the money
will have been used to subsidize the salaries of those working to develop new weapons of mass
destruction. 
<p>
    Regardless of the merits of the Nunn-Lugar program, the question arises as to why it should
be funded out of the defense account. Nunn-Lugar is not a defense program; it is a foreign aid
program. The proper manager of foreign aid programs is the Department of State, not the Department
of Defense. Further, the proper pool of funds from which Nunn-Lugar should be financed is the
foreign aid account, not the defense account.
<p>
    The B-2, a major leap forward in capabilities. The Senate defense bill's funding of the
Nunn-Lugar program becomes even more questionable when the same bill denies funds to maintain
the option of buying more B-2 bombers. The B-2 is needed to fulfill both strategic nuclear and
conventional roles. Its conventional capabilities are particularly important. This sophisticated aircraft
will allow the U.S. to penetrate the airspace of a future regional aggressor, similar to Iraq in the
Persian Gulf War, and destroy the command and control centers such a country's leaders need to
direct their military forces.
<p>
    More B-2s also will be essential to maintain a balanced and capable bomber force. In its 1993
Bottom-Up Review and 1994 Nuclear Posture Review, the Clinton Administration claimed that it
needed up to 184 bombers to perform necessary missions. But this estimate is based on the
assumption that during conventional conflicts bombers can be swung from one combat theater, say in
East Asia, to another, such as the Persian Gulf. Many experts question the wisdom of this "swing
strategy."  In reality, there is no guarantee that the requirements for bomber operations in the first
theater will lessen as they become pressing in the second. Another mistaken assumption by the
Administration is that the B-52 bomber force will meet America's long-term bomber requirements.
The B-52s will be approaching 60 years of age by that time and will be far too old to provide an
effective combat capability, even in conventional conflicts.
<p>
    Finally, the B-2 will be needed to deter Russia's nuclear forces. The backbone of Russia's
future strategic arsenal will be the SS-25 Sickle intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), which is
deployed on mobile launchers. While not yet capable of doing so, an upgraded B-2 could be the only
strategic offensive weapon system able to hold the SS-25 at risk.
<p>
    The B-2 bomber is a major leap forward. It can penetrate the most advanced air defenses and
deliver precision-guided munitions against important military targets. It provides global reach and
reduces dramatically the number of men placed in harm's way compared with other aircraft for
similar missions. Given these capabilities, a decision to forgo even the option of buying more B-2
bombers is dangerously short-sighted.
<p>

<b>Modifying the Defense Authorization Bill</b>
<p>
Given the situation it now faces, the Senate needs to modify the Defense Authorization Bill to
preserve America's military capabilities. It could do so by:
<p><ul>
<li> Deleting Nunn-Lugar funds from the bill. The Nunn-Lugar program is a foreign aid program and
does not belong in the defense account, particularly because it robs money from critical defense
programs.

<li> Using the money saved from the Nunn-Lugar program to maintain the option of buying more
B-2 bombers. Eliminating Nunn-Lugar funding from the bill will make $365 million available to
support the B-2 procurement option. The B-2 program requires $553 million. The remaining $188
million can come from other provisions in the bill that have little or nothing to do with defense. These
include the land mine clearing assistance program ($20 million), support for the Atlanta Olympic
Games ($15 million), weather reconnaissance ($20 million), the Defense Business Management
University ($89 million), and counter-drug activities of the Department of Defense ($44 million).

<li> Reserving the option of restoring some or all of the funding for Nunn-Lugar during
consideration of foreign assistance legislation. A strong argument can be made for a well-run
assistance program to dismantle weapons of mass destruction on the territory of the former Soviet
Union. If the Senate considers a foreign assistance authorization bill later this year, this will provide
an ideal vehicle for extending authorization of the Nunn-Lugar program through the foreign assistance
account. But this funding should be provided only after it has been proven that abuses have not been
committed and that the program is functioning as intended.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
    The defense budget should not be used to fund programs that have little or nothing to do with
improving military capabilities, especially when vital defense programs like the B-2 bomber program
go underfunded. The Nunn-Lugar program to assist Russia and other states of the former Soviet
Union with the destruction of weapons is such a non-defense program. There may be a good
argument for continuing the Nunn-Lugar program, but it should be made during consideration of
foreign aid legislation. In the meantime, the dollars from the defense budget the Nunn-Lugar program
would have consumed should be used to preserve the option of procuring more B-2 bombers.

<H3><I> DEFENSE FREEZE WOULD HARM NATIONAL SECURITY </I></H3>

Backgrounder Update #244<br>
March 31, 1995<br>
(Updating Backgrounder Update No.  242, "Clinton's Defense Budget Falls Far Short Again," March 7, 1995)<br>

</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>

     On March 19, the Chairman of the House Budget Committee,
Representative John Kasich of Ohio, appeared on NBC News' Sunday talk
show "Meet the Press."  When asked about defense spending, he suggested
that he might be willing to support a freeze on defense budget outlays over
the next five years.  This would mean that defense spending would not be
adjusted for inflation, which would result in around a 15 percent real
reduction in spending over five years.  Such a freeze, if it were to become
the official proposal of the Budget Committee, would be alarming.  It
would, in fact, harm U.S.  national security.  A defense freeze would not
even fund President Bill Clinton's proposed military force, which most
experts agree will not be able to win two regional wars "nearly
simultaneously" as advertised in the Pentagon's "bottom-up" review.  The
inevitable result of a defense freeze would be the reduction of U.S.  military
commitments overseas and the inability to defend U.S.  national security
interests. 
<P>
      It becomes clear, upon examination of the facts about the defense
budget and national security, that a defense freeze that fails to account for
inflation is based on erroneous assumptions.  Policymakers need to be
apprised of these facts in order to make sound judgments about the level of
defense spending this nation needs.
<P>
     FACT #1:  The currently estimated budget authority for defense
in fiscal year 1995, in real terms, will be 35 percent below what it was
ten years ago.
<P>
     When it comes to contributing toward deficit reduction, the defense
program gave at the office.  No other broad category of spending can make
this claim.  Under proposed Clinton budgets, entitlement spending will
increase by 38 percent and domestic discretionary spending by 12 percent
in real terms, while defense will decline by 35 percent during the 1990s. 
Proponents of a defense freeze apparently think that the Clinton approach
is on target because a defense freeze would result in an outlay level for
defense in fiscal year 2000 that is only one percent higher than the
Administration's.  While advocates of a defense freeze would spend more
than Clinton on defense in the next five years, they may settle for Clinton
levels in the years after the five-year period.  The implication is inescapable: 
If a defense freeze were approved, the Republican majority in Congress will
have settled for a long-range national defense strategy defined by a
Democratic President.
<P>

FACT #2:  The Clinton Administration's defense budget underfunds its
own defense program by over $100 billion.
<P>
     The General Accounting Office (GAO) released a study last year
estimating that the Clinton Administration's defense program for fiscal years
1995-1999 is underfunded by $150 billion in budget authority.  Several
months earlier, The Heritage Foundation estimated the shortfall at roughly
$100 billion.  Estimates for fiscal years 1996-2000 reveal the same general
level of shortfall.  Since a defense freeze would not make up for these
shortfalls, its proponents must accept Clinton's Bottom-Up Review at its
word or admit that the defense freeze is not enough.  But no reputable
defense analyst believes the Bottom-Up Review program is fully funded. 
Therefore, the only available course will be to cut weapons, force structure,
and readiness in the outyears as it becomes clear that there is not enough
money to pay for the force. 
<P>
      What programs are proponents of a defense freeze willing to cut
from the Bottom-Up Review program?  How far down are they willing to
go to accommodate a defense freeze?  Will they reduce the Army to fewer
than the equivalent of 15 divisions the Clinton Administration says is
needed?  Will they reduce the Air Force to fewer than the 20 tactical fighter
wings recommended in the Bottom-Up Review?  Do they favor a Navy with
fewer than the 346 ships recommended by the Bottom-Up Review?  These
are the practical implications of the defense freeze ideal, as they are of the
Clinton Administration's proposal.  Given the Clinton defense budget's $100
billion shortfall, force structure is certain to be scaled back if the budget
remains at current levels.  The defense freeze ultimately will lead a
Republican Congress to accept a smaller and weaker military than even the
Clinton Administration claims it wants.
<P>
FACT #3:  The Department of Defense has cut over one million
personnel in the last ten years.
<P>
     The Pentagon has reduced its personnel by about 25 percent since
1985.  This includes both civilian and military employees.  Active-duty
military personnel alone have been reduced by an average of over 5,000
persons per month over the last ten years.  No other federal government
agency has shed its employees at such a rate.  Often ridiculed as a bloated
bureaucracy, the Pentagon actually has been shrinking rapidly, and this has
led to the very efficiencies Kasich and others charge need to be instituted
at the Department of Defense.  The result:  25 percent fewer people now are
performing national security tasks in a world where the threat has changed
but America's global commitments remain undiminished.
<P>
FACT #4:  By the end of the current fiscal year, the military force
structure will be reduced by 30 percent from 1988 levels.
<P>
     Just as military personnel levels have been reduced, so has the size
of the armed forces.  The Army fielded 28 divisions at the end of fiscal
1988; by the end of fiscal 1995, it will retain only 20 division equivalents. 
Whereas the Air Force possessed almost 38 tactical fighter wings in 1988,
it now is down to around 20 wings.  The Navy had a fleet of 566 ships at
the end of fiscal 1988; by the end of fiscal 1995, it will have only 373
ships. 
<P>
      To be sure, the end of the Cold War required reductions of force
levels, but to go any farther is to deny this nation the ability to win the wars
of the post-Cold War era.  The shrinkage has been so severe that many even
doubt the planned force can fulfill the Clinton Administration's assigned
mission of fighting and winning two overlapping major regional conflicts. 
Lawmakers and Administration officials alike should declare officially that
the post-Cold War demobilization is over and that America needs to think
more seriously about the kinds of military forces it needs to maintain its
strength and military commitments abroad.
<P>
FACT #5:  A defense freeze could result in a 15 percent loss of buying
power by military personnel at the end of the decade.
<P>
     Since a defense freeze would bar adjustments for inflation, the
Pentagon would be faced with a choice:  Either cut military pay, which will
not be adjusted for inflation, or pay for salary increases out of other
accounts, such as readiness or procurement.  If pay were not adjusted for
inflation for five years, the nation's soldiers and sailors would lose 15
percent of their purchasing power.  The Clinton Administration tried to
forego a military pay adjustment in 1994, but Congress refused.  The same
thing would happen again if the Pentagon, trying to accommodate a defense
budget freeze, froze military pay.  Faced with congressional opposition, the
Pentagon simply would raid other accounts for money.
<P>
FACT #6:  Procurement funding has been reduced by over 70 percent
in real terms since 1985.
<P>
     Proponents of a defense freeze may believe that they can increase
military pay by cutting procurement funding.  Indeed, Chairman Kasich
talked about procurement reform in the context of possible savings during
his "Meet the Press" interview.  While the Chairman is correct in asserting
that there is a need for procurement reform, it is not wise to pay for salary
increases by taking funding away from procurement accounts.  Put simply,
the turnip of procurement already has been bled dry.  Procurement funding
has been reduced by 70 percent since 1985; another 10 percent would
sentence the military to continuing to buy new weapons in extremely limited
numbers throughout the next five years.  For example, the Navy procured
29 ships in 1985; in fiscal 1996, it will procure only seven.  A defense
freeze means the Navy will purchase no more than this number of ships
annually.
<P>
FACT #7:  A defense freeze would deny any new defense initiatives.
<P>
     Many in Congress do not consider the Clinton defense program the
last word on national security.  They wish to support new initiatives that the
Clinton Administration either has not proposed or has opposed.  One such
initiative is the development and deployment of a national missile defense
system.  A defense freeze would leave no room for such initiatives.  If the
defense budget were frozen at current levels, the nation would not be able
to build an effective defense against ballistic missile attack.
<P>
Conclusion
<P>
     The Department of Defense should not be criticized for contributing
to the budget crisis.  In fact, it should be hailed as a model for deficit
reduction.  If only the Department of Housing and Urban Development or
the Department of Health and Human Services were reducing its personnel
by 25 percent.  The nation need not spend more than is necessary on
national security, but it must at least spend the minimum.  To do otherwise
is an abdication of the single most important constitutional duty of the
federal government -- to provide for the national defense.

<P>

     President Clinton's 1995 defense budget, which allocates $1.29
trillion for defense from 1995 through 1999, continues his
Administration's systematic dismantling of the nation's defenses so
painstakingly rebuilt by Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. (All figures are
for budget authority, the amount the Pentagon is authorized to spend
for a given period, as opposed to outlays, or the amount actually
spent.) In the Clinton plan, the Department of Defense will fall short
of its funding requirements -- as outlined in the Administration's own
"Bottom-Up Review" -- by nearly $100 billion. The Administration and
Congress must stop looking for "savings" in the defense budget, which
has paid more than its share in cost-cutting efforts by three
Administrations since the Reagan build-up peaked in 1985.
<P>
     To be sure, Clinton slightly raised this year's defense budget by
$1.8 billion. (This quote comes from the transcript of the budget
briefing included in the package of materials accompanying the
Department of Defense News Release No. 043-94, February 7, 1994.)
However, when adjusted for inflation, the 1995 defense budget still
shows a decline of 0.9 percent. This is the tenth straight year of
declining defense budgets. Furthermore, the budget will decline in
inflation-adjusted terms in each of the next four years beyond fiscal
1995. Thus, the Clinton Administration is now committed to fourteen
years of uninterrupted decline in the defense budget. 
<P>
     This year's defense budget will harm national security. In every
category -- force structure, modernization, combat readiness, and
maintaining the quality of military personnel -- the amount to be
spent is based not on how much defense is needed, but on budgetary
considerations. National security policy is not being made based on
threats identified by Clinton's national security advisers, but on
spending caps provided by his budget advisers, most of whom have no
knowledge of America's defense requirements. This approach represents
an abdication by Clinton of his highest constitutional priority: to
provide for the nation's defense. 
<P>
     The Clinton budget will lead to several damaging outcomes. They
are:
<P>
A force that is too small to defend America's interests. The Clinton
     Administration, on September 1, 1993, adopted a blueprint for
     America's future forces. The plan was the result of a
     comprehensive study of defense policy called the "Bottom-Up
     Review." It called for a force in 1999 of 15 Army divisions, 346
     Navy ships, 20 Air Force tactical wings, and 174,000 active-duty
     Marines. But it is now clear that the Clinton Administration has
     no intention of meeting these goals. The Clinton 1995 defense
     budget has nowhere near the money required to support this plan.
     (The assessment that the Clinton Administration's defense budget
     is too small to support its own force structure plan is shared by
     opinion leaders across the political spectrum. Editorialists at
     The New York Times, for example, on January 28, 1994, argued: "As
     Mr. Clinton must know, these [Bottom-Up Review] force levels --
     which Congressional Republicans are sure to support -- will end
     up costing far more than his proposed $260-billion-a-year budgets
     over the next five years.") The Bottom-Up Review Force (BURF)
     will require about $1.39 trillion for the five-year period
     covering fiscal years 1995 through 1999. (For a full assessment
     of the Bottom-Up Review, see Lawrence T. Di Rita, et al., "Thumbs
     Down To The Bottom-Up Review," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder
     No. 957, September 22, 1993.) Since the Clinton 1995 budget
     allocates only $1.29 trillion, the President is $100 billion
     short of his target. 
<P>
     This shortfall cannot be a surprise to the Administration,
because the procedure used to calculate it was used by former Defense
Secretary Les Aspin to criticize George Bush's defense proposals in
1992, when Aspin was Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.
The BURF most closely resembles what then-Congressman Aspin called his
"Option C." Option C provided the foundation for the defense budget
Congress drafted in 1992. Aspin estimated that Option C would cost
$270 billion in current dollar budget authority in fiscal year 1997.
(Les Aspin, "Defense 1997 Alternatives," February 25, 1992.)
<P>
     But the BURF, which Clinton has said will cost just $252 billion
in 1997, is larger than Option C. For example, Option C provides for
only 137,000 active-duty Marines, while the BURF provides for 174,000.
Further, while Option C planned for 18 Air Force fighter wings, the
BURF calls for 20. Taking the cost of the slightly larger BURF into
account, and using Aspin's own cost calculating procedures, the BURF
should cost about $275 billion in 1997. But the Clinton budget
provides only $252 billion in 1997, thus revealing a one-year budget
gap of $23 billion. Over the entire five-year period from 1995 through
1999, the shortfall is close to $100 billion.
<P>
     Since that is the case, the Clinton defense budget will result in
a force that is far smaller than the BURF. This force will resemble
another force described by Aspin called "Option B." Option B calls for
just 12 Army divisions, 290 Navy ships, 14 Air Force tactical wings,
and 134,000 active duty Marines . (Ibid.) A force this small could not
address the two "nearly simultaneous" major regional conflicts that
the Bottom-Up Review states must be addressed to protect the nation's
vital interests in the post-Cold War world.
<P>
A "hollow" military that is not combat ready. The Clinton defense
     budget, when coupled with the force structure decisions made in
     the Bottom-Up Review, will damage the ability of the military to
     stay ready for combat. To meet the austere budget goals, the
     military services will have to cut funding for the operations,
     maintenance, modernization, and training needed to stay ready for
     war.
<P>
     The damage to military readiness caused by the competition for
dollars is already evident. For 1994, the Army estimates that it can
pay for just over half (58 percent) of scheduled equipment overhauls.
(Memorandum from Acting Secretary of the Army John W. Shannon to
Secretary of Defense Les Aspin, June 15, 1993. Reprinted in Inside the
Pentagon, June 24, 1993, pp. 7-8.) Ammunition supplies, a critical
indicator of readiness, are also declining due to budget reductions.
The Army is now consuming ammunition out of its war supply for
training purposes. Only 15 percent of the Army's ammunition is
certified as war-ready, based on shelf-life and other factors.
(Briefing by the Munitions Industrial Base Task Force at The Heritage
Foundation, February 15, 1994.) Finally, the Pentagon's own outside
group assessing military readiness, called the Readiness Task Force,
has determined that the frequency and length of Marine Corps
deployments overseas is preventing Corps units from participating in
required training activities. (Department of Defense, "Defense Science
Board Task Force on Readiness Interim Report," February 14, 1994, p.
6. Also see "Readiness Task Force Releases Interim Report," Department
of Defense News Release No. 081-94, February 18, 1994.)
<P>
     To reverse this disturbing trend in readiness, the Administration
is proposing to increase operations and maintenance funding in fiscal
1995 by $4.9 billion from 1994 levels. But this one-time infusion of
money will prove inadequate to avoid the emerging crisis in readiness.
There are two reasons for this conclusion: 
<P>
Reason #1: Clinton's approach amounts to no more than a budget "shell
     game" in which too little money is moved around between accounts.
     In future years, for example, military pay will demand larger
     percentages of the defense budget. This is because the number of
     troops in Clinton's force structure plan remains relatively high
     compared with the equipment purchases and operating costs
     provided in the budget. If the budget is to remain at the
     inadequate levels proposed by Clinton, then these other accounts
     will have to fall as military pay begins to consume a larger
     share of the total. In short, the reallocation of funds between
     accounts cannot solve the basic problem of an underfunded
     military force.
<P>
Reason #2: This reallocation of funds is also coming at the price of
     further reductions in the procurement budget. Reductions of the
     procurement account mean that the military will be operating
     aging equipment. For example, M-1 Abrams tank production ceased
     in the middle of 1993. As a result, the average age of the M-1
     fleet will go from 5.1 years in 1990 to 9.4 years in 1995, and to
     13.4 years in 1999. This is certain to result in increases in the
     cost of maintaining the fleet during the remaining years of this
     decade and into the next. Thus, the slashing of modernization
     funds also results in greater costs for programs under the
     Operations and Maintenance account.
<P>
     A posture that leaves the United States, its allies, and forces
abroad vulnerable to missile strikes. The Clinton Administration's
assault on the nation's missile defense program continues unabated
with the 1995 budget. The budget request includes only $3.25 billion
for the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) in fiscal 1995.
This compares to $7.6 billion that the Bush Administration planned to
propose for this program. Further, the budget demonstrates that the
Administration is even abandoning its own missile defense plan for the
period from fiscal 1995 through 1999, which was formulated during the
Bottom-Up Review. This longer-term plan already imposed a $22.9
billion, or 56 percent, cut in the program. Now the Administration is
saying that even the $18 billion that remains is too much. Another
$1.1 billion has been eliminated from the five-year budge.
<P>
     The impact of these budget proposals on the program will end the
prospects for effective national missile defense. The territory of the
United States will remain vulnerable to long-range missile strikes. As
former Secretary of Defense Les Aspin stated last year, the so-called
theater missile threat is "here and now." (Secretary Aspin made this
comment during a press briefing on May 13, 1993, at the Pentagon.)
Furthermore, Clinton's budget proposal is too low to field defenses
against short-range (theater) missiles, despite earlier assertions by
Secretary Aspin that such defenses are a priority. (Ibid.) The Clinton
Administration plans to allocate only about $2 billion for theater
missile defense in fiscal 1995. The Bush Administration would have
budgeted almost $3.1 billion for the same period. This will certainly
delay the deployment of effective theater missile defenses and make
the systems that are ultimately deployed less effective. The question
that remains is how vulnerable will U.S. and allied forces be to enemy
missile strikes in places like Korea?
<P>
A technology gap. The Clinton Administration's defense budget
     represents a massive assault on the Pentagon's funding for new
     equipment and systems. The procurement budget will, in fiscal
     1995, fall by $1.2 billion from the year before. This inflation
     adjusted decline of 5.4 percent means that in 1995 the
     procurement budget will be only one-third of what it was in 1985.
     These budget reductions are already having an impact. Whereas the
     Pentagon bought 29 ships, 943 aircraft, and 720 tanks in 1985, it
     will buy only six ships, 127 aircraft, and no tanks in fiscal
     1995 (see chart on following page). The Army alone is planning to
     terminate 57 programs.
<P>
     Another trouble spot is research and development (R&D). The R&D
budget is slated to receive a modest 1 percent real increase (after
inflation) in 1995. Unfortunately, in the previous year's budget, a
similar attempt to protect R&D was rejected by Congress, which voted
to decrease it by about 10 percent. There is no reason to believe that
this pattern will not continue during debate on the fiscal 1995
defense budget. (For a full discussion on relationship between
procurement and research and development, see John F. Luddy, "Stop The
Slide Toward a Hollow Military, Heritage Foundation Backgrounder
Update No. 209, January 14, 1994.)
<P>
     Taken together, the Administration's proposed funding plans for
procurement and research and development will endanger the military's
ability to arm itself with modern, high technology weapons. This will
result in a technology gap because existing military systems -- the
Navy's A-6 Intruder all-weather attack bomber, for example -- will
have to be retired before new systems can be developed and purchased.
This technology gap will certainly result in higher U.S. casualties in
a future conflict.
<P>
A damaged military industrial base. The steep reductions in the
     Administration's budget for defense procurement will not only
     prevent the military from obtaining high technology in the near
     future, it will also result in a depleted industrial base
     incapable of producing adequate numbers of high-tech weapons over
     the longer term. For example, the Clinton budget may result in
     the loss of around one million defense-related jobs in the
     private sector. (Richard A. Bitzinger and Steve Kosiak, Potential
     Impact of Defense Spending Reductions on the Defense Related
     Labor Force By State (Washington, D.C.: Defense Budget Project,
     1993), p. 3.) In addition to lost jobs will be lost capabilities
     in defense production. Large defense contractors are cutting back
     on the number of smaller industries they rely on as suppliers.
     For example, Douglas Aircraft Company's list of suppliers dropped
     by 75 percent from early 1992 to the end of 1993. (Anthony L.
     Velocci, "U.S. Shakeout Tests Suppliers' Flexibility," Aviation
     Week & Space Technology, February 14, 1994, pp. 48-51.) Lockheed
     Corporation's Fort Worth Division has likewise reduced its list
     of suppliers by 68 percent. (Ibid.) Rebuilding this supplier
     network will take considerable time; something that may not be
     available in the event of a crisis.
<P>
     The Clinton Administration is compounding the problems associated
with the weakening of the military industrial base. It is proposing to
allocate $3.3 billion of the defense budget in fiscal 1995 to "defense
conversion." This is part of a $20 billion multi-year, government-wide
program. The defense conversion program is designed to push industrial
enterprises out of the defense sector. This policy is misdirected
because it will not save any money. Instead, it directs that the
Pentagon actually pay for a weakening of the industrial base upon
which it depends. The $3.3 billion in the fiscal year 1995 defense
budget allocated to defense conversion would be better spent on
procurement. (For a full discussion of the defense industrial base and
defense conversion, see Baker Spring, "Supporting The Force: The
Industrial Base and Defense Conversion," Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder No. 964, October 22, 1993.)

<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     Any President's budget is a document that reflects policy
options. President Clinton's fiscal 1995 budget is no exception, and
it shows the low priority he gives to national security issues. In his
budget, defense spending will go down while both entitlement spending
and domestic discretionary spending will increase. It exposes serious
contradictions in the Administration's defense policy, such as the
mismatch between force size and funding and the overemphasis on
reductions in procurement funding. 
<P>
     President Clinton must end this policy of neglect toward national
security. The nation's defenses must be given a higher priority than
the Clinton budget implies. The Administration must acknowledge the
full extent of its defense budget gap -- nearly $100 billion -- and
start working with Congress to find the funds from other budgets to
pay for it.

<title>Teens, big business and the politics of sex</title>
<body>
<p>
<center><h2>Teens, big business and the politics of sex</h2></center>
<p>
<h4>There's a lot at stake in hyped figures about teen's sexual
activity, but millions of virgins are alive and well out there,
too.</h4>
<p>
&quot;Hello, Family Research Council?  I'm a producer
for the noon and 9 <i>News on 10 </i>- network affiliate and all
that - and I'm looking for a virgin.&quot;
<p>
&quot;A virgin?&quot;
<p>
&quot;Yes, we heard that you might know one, if you can believe
this - ah, one that's over 18 and, ah, never had any intercourse.
<p>
&quot;We like to do television on oddities.  You know the format,
satanist accountants and IRS audit trend lines...the missing link
in Manhattan...
<p>
 &quot;And we heard that there were actually people claiming to
be virgins.  We though that went out in 1952 with a woman in Montana
named Ethel.&quot;
<p>
 A lot of people are &quot;discovering&quot; virginity as the
new minority class, thanks to the efforts of people like Rep.
Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., and her associates, who are working hard
to convince Americans that 80% of teens are actively engaged in
sex and pursuing many alternative lifestyles.
<p>
 In mid-April, the committee Schroeder controls in the House called
the federal government's response to rampant teen bed-hopping
a national tragedy. 
<p>
 But the tragedy is that sexual politics is big business in Washington.
<p>
 Schroeder's committee whipped up the 80% figure by adding 20-year-olds
into the mix. 
<p>
 In fact, a study by the Department of Health and Human Services
found that among girls under age 18, almost 65% were virgins.
 In ages 15-19 (a group said to be swarming to the bedroom), almost
50% were still waiting.
<p>
 But while the pro-abortion lobby's numbers are bad, their political
logic is good.  And it will cost taxpayers.  Financial self-interest
is one reason that groups like Planned Parenthood and their patron
saint of federal funding publish inflated numbers.  It's a simple
political formula:
<p>
 A + B = C.
<p>
If most kids have sex - A.<br>
And my programs deal with sexual issues - B.<br>
Then my program needs more tax dollars - C.<br>
<p>
 For all their alleged interest in health, abortion activists
and their business counterparts make hundreds of millions of dollars
annually from the government.
<p>
 Take Planned Parenthood, for example.  According to a 1990 report
in a philanthropic journal, $273 million of the group's $370 million
budget came from public sources.
<p>
 Logic would argue that it's in the abortion lobby's interest
to justify its existence to the governmental overseers who provide
over 70% of their budget.
<p>
 Schroeder's real interests can be clearly seen at budget time.
 In the last cycle, while $150 million went to Title X, the federal
government's contraceptive program, Schroeder fought to kill the
$7.8 million that went to Title XX.  Two-thirds of Title XX goes
to teen parenting and care programs, while the remainder goes
to the only abstinence-based sexual education program in 
the federal budget. 
<p>
 One would think Pat and Planned parenthood would talk constantly
about abstinence - the best way to avoid sexually transmitted
disease and pregnancy.  But if kids really &quot;just said no&quot;
to sex, their golden goose would be cooked.
<p>
 Every day, I talk with people amazed to discover that virgins
are alive and well in North America.  The vast majority of teen-agers
are waiting to have sexual intercourse.  And many others, after
limited experience, choose a lifestyle of abstinence.
<p>
 But don't be surprised that their stories go untold or run as
brief mention under oddities.  The real story behind sexual politics
can be found on an accountant's spread sheet.

<title>Two Cheers For the House Medicare Plan -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3><i>TWO CHEERS FOR THE HOUSE MEDICARE PLAN</i></h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm">Stuart M. Butler</a><br>
Vice President and Director of Domestic and Economic Policy Studies<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 428<br>
September 22, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
	The House Medicare reform plan represents a bold step toward the structural changes needed in the program. With some modifications, legislation based on this plan could create a new Medicare program that moderates the growth in costs while giving America's elderly many new choices and much more control over their own health care.
<P>
	The House plan, like legislation recently sponsored in the Senate by Judd Gregg (R-NH), would take some modest steps to reform traditional Medicare while giving seniors the alternative of taking a specified amount of financial assistance and applying it to the purchase of a private plan. Under this alternative, the elderly would be in the driver's seat:  Plans would have compete to be chosen. If a plan did not give good service and value for money, seniors could switch to another during an annual open season.
<p>
	The House plan would set up a system somewhat like the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The FEHBP covers over 9 million federal workers, including Members of Congress, as well as dependents and retirees. It allows enrollees, once a year, to choose from a wide range of health plans which contain a variety of benefits. These plans compete vigorously to be chosen by enrollees. Since the government pays a percentage of the premiums for FEHBP plans, enrollees save money by picking wisely; and they receive plenty of information from consumer groups, as well as employee and retiree groups, to help them do so. 
<p>
	 The House plan would allow the elderly to remain in traditional Medicare if they wish, but it would make important changes in this part of the program. First, it would maintain Part B premiums at 31.5 percent of total Part B costs, rather than allow them to fall under current law to 25 percent. Second, it would phase out the taxpayer subsidy of Part B premiums entirely for upper income seniors (over $75,000 for singles, $125,000 for couples). Third, it would permit the government to reward seniors who report waste, fraud, and abuse. And fourth, through a "lookback" provision, it would effectively put the traditional program on a fixed budget.
<p>
	<b>Reduced Subsidies.</b> These are welcome changes in the traditional Medicare program, but Congress should go further. Part B of Medicare, which covers principally physician services, is a heavily subsidized voluntary program unconnected to the Part A hospital program financed through payroll taxes. That subsidy should be cut even deeper than the House proposes. The typical enrollee should pay at least 50 percent of the program's cost (the level originally set in 1965), and the threshold for phasing out the subsidy entirely should be lower, perhaps $50,000 for singles and $100,000 for couples. Moreover, the plan would not raise the traditional program's deductibles, which have fallen sharply in real terms over the years. For Part B the deductible is just $100, which encourages excessive use of medical care. This deductible should be at least doubled.
<P>
	<b>Choices for Seniors.</b> The heart of the House plan, however, is a set of provisions that would give seniors the right to pick a private health plan, including a catastrophic plan with a medical savings account (MSA), with the government making a contribution to that plan based on the enrollee's age and other basic risk factors. This option, to be called Medicare Plus, would create a structure much like the FEHBP. Like federal retirees, seniors choosing this option would know that private plans had to meet certain conditions to be permitted to market to the elderly. These conditions would include solvency requirements and consumer protection standards. And these plans could not turn down sicker applicants during the annual open season when plans are selected.
<p>
	Still, some features of Medicare Plus do raise concerns. Examples: <P>

<b>Price Controls.</b> While the lookback provision would set a firm budget for the traditional program, the plan unfortunately would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to use the failed approach of price controls to try to keep within that budget. It would be better to combine payment changes with increases in deductibles and copayments.
<P>
<b>Standardized Benefits.</b> One requirement on private plans is that they must offer a benefit package at least equal to that of the traditional Medicare program. But this means that a senior normally would face higher costs if he wanted a plan with some benefits not now in Medicare, such as a drug benefit, because he could not substitute that new benefit for an existing one of less value to him. Under the FEHBP, federal workers and retirees have a range of alternative benefits beyond a very small core of required benefits. In restructuring Medicare, Congress should adopt a similar approach. Plans under Medicare Plus not only should be required to contain a small core of benefits (including catastrophic protection not now in the Medicare package), but also should be permitted to offer a wide range of optional additional benefits. This would allow the elderly to pick the packages that are best for them.
<P>
<b>Rigid Copayments.</b> The House proposal appears to require Medicare Plus plans to contain deductibles and copayments no higher than the traditional Medicare program's. This would be a serious mistake and would be financially harmful to the elderly. Competing private plans should be allowed to offer different combinations of deductibles, copayments, and premium prices, as well as varieties of MSAs. Seniors, not Congress, should be allowed to decide which combination is the best value.
<p>
<b>No Level Playing Field.</b> Another concern is that the playing field might not be level between private plans and traditional Medicare. If private plans are to be required to provide consumer information and be solvent, the traditional program should be required to meet the same standards and provide the same consumer information. Seniors should have all the information they need to choose wisely between traditional Medicare and Medicare Plus.
<p>
	These and other problems need to be dealt with, but overall, the House plan indicates that Congress is at last prepared to make the changes needed to stabilize Medicare's finances so that it is still there when today's workers reach retirement. Moreover, by giving seniors the right to choose private plans in roughly the same way that federal workers and retirees routinely do, the proposal would introduce into Medicare the dynamics of the FEHBP:  costs kept down by competing private plans that must give the best value for money to the patient.

<a href="/heritage/staff/truluck.htm">PHIL TRULUCK</a>, Executive Vice President of The Heritage Foundation:  
<p>
	Congressman Dan Miller of Florida is one of the stars among conservative legislators here in Washington. He is in his second term now, and he epitomizes a principled politician. It's a good way to highlight our session here today at the Physicians Council.
<p>
	The Congressman had no previous political experience before he won in 1992. He came up here as a businessman and a college professor. Now he serves on the House Appropriations Committee and the House Budget Committee, which puts him in two good positions to do something about the huge federal budget deficit and federal spending. He represents the thirteenth district of Florida, which is the southwestern part of Florida. Most important, he serves on the Speaker's task force on Medicare reform, working with his fellow Congressmen on this key issue.
<p>
	Also joining us is Grace-Marie Arnett, the President of Arnett & Co., a consulting firm here in Washington, D.C. Grace-Marie, who specializes in health care policy, is also a senior associate with the Domestic Policy Issue Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. She is also a founding member of the Consensus Group of Washington health policy experts who advance ideas on a market-based approach to health care reform. Because of her long-standing interest in tax policy, Grace-Marie Arnett was asked to serve as executive director of the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform, recently formed by Senate leader Robert Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich and chaired by Jack Kemp. The 14-member commission expects to issue its recommendation in December 1995. 
<p>
	 And finally, joining us today is John Liu, Health Policy Analyst of The Heritage Foundation. John is a native of California and before coming to Heritage in 1994 served as Legislative Counsel to Congressman Cliff Stearns (R-FL), where he helped to draft the Consumer Choice Health Security Act, the legislative embodiment of The Heritage Foundation's consumer choice health care reform proposal, sponsored by Congressman Stearns and Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma and 24 other Senate cosponsors. John holds a bachelor degree in political science from the University of California at San Diego and a Juris Doctor degree from the Tulane University School of Law in New Orleans, Louisiana.
<p>
	Congressman Miller, please give us your thoughts, and thank you again for joining us.
<p>

<b>THE URGENT NEED TO REFORM MEDICARE</b>
<p>
<a name="dan"></a><b>REPRESENTATIVE DAN MILLER:</b>  Thank you for having me here. My district in Florida has more seniors than any district in the United States:  Sarasota, Sun City, Port Charlotte, Venice. It's a great area to represent.
<P>
	Medicare is really the biggest issue we face this year. It is the biggest issue because of the enormous fiscal pressures if we don't address it. There is one overriding fact:  Medicare is going bankrupt. We have no choice. For health care reasons, it has to be addressed. From a political standpoint, they say this is the third rail of politics:  It will kill you politically. It is a very difficult issue, but we have to do it. Let me share with you some of my thoughts and some of my observations on what we can expect in this process over the next several months.
<p>
	Our House leadership -- Speaker Newt Gingrich and Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas, in particular -- are very aware of the need politically to convince the American people of the critical importance of this issue. The focus right now is to make the American people aware that we have a big problem. As I said, Medicare is going bankrupt. We know that. Everybody here, I think, already knows of the Medicare trustees' report authored by HHS Secretary Shalala, Labor Secretary Reich, and Treasury Secretary Rubin. The trustees tell us that there is no question:  Medicare is going bankrupt in the year 2002. We need to make the American people aware of that massive shortfall and of its implications.
<p>

<b>THE CLIMATE OF OPINION</b>
<p>
	We are making progress. We just got some polling information on this topic, and it is interesting. Two months ago we did a poll, and nobody knew Medicare was a problem. But the polls that were just released yesterday by Linda DiVall say that there is a big change. Before, nobody would believe there was a problem with Medicare. Now when you ask them if there is a problem, 63 percent of the American people believe there is. In fact, 34 percent of the American people now realize there is a problem without the pollster even mentioning it to them. So we have made, I think, tremendous strides in raising the awareness of the American people. You cannot go to the solution until there is an awareness of the problem.
<p>
	We are also making progress in explaining what we are trying to do. We are not cutting Medicare spending. Whenever you hear Speaker Gingrich talking, that it's going bankrupt, he notes that we are going to spend more money on Medicare. What we are doing is reducing the growth of spending on Medicare.
<p>
	We are starting to get that message out, too. Two weeks ago, Tom Brokaw and NBC News came to my district, where we held a town hall meeting. When Brokaw introduced this segment on the national news, he said, "Republicans want to reduce the growth in spending."  The following week, ABC News did something on the same topic, and Peter Jennings introduced a segment about different Members of Congress and about how they are handling Medicare. Jennings introduced it by saying, "Republicans want to reduce the growth in spending on Medicare."  Sunday night, I was watching the NBC News and they even showed a segment with President Clinton, who said, during his talk with Speaker Gingrich, that Republicans want to reduce the growth of spending on Medicare.
<p>
	So we are making great progress. Now we are starting to say, "We're not cutting Medicare; we're slowing the growth of spending."  These are the numbers:  We are going from $4,800 a person to $6,400 a person (see Chart 1). That is not as much as future spending projections would be if we did nothing. Medicare is going bankrupt, but it is a very important program, and we must preserve it; we must save it; we must strengthen it. In doing so, we will still be spending $1,600 more per Medicare beneficiary.
<p>
	Our next task is to explain to everybody why Medicare is going bankrupt. Much of the problem is in the design. Medicare today is designed to increase spending on health care rather than control it. Members of Congress have always tried to ratchet down on the providers; go back and look at projected savings in past budget reconciliation bills. In drafting those bills, Members of Congress said, "We're going to save $50 billion," but they ended up saving very little. The desired savings never did materialize. 
<p>
	 Next year, in 1996, the amount of money going into the Medicare trust fund, which is Part A, is going to be less than the money that is going out, for the first time. The Medicare Part A trust fund is paid for, through payroll taxes, by employers and employees. Next year is the first time they will have had a negative figure for the year (see Chart 2). The Medicare trust fund right now has about $130 billion in surplus; in the year 2002, it crosses the line to zero. So it is very easy to see what happens to the fund. It is not just hypothetical; these are real numbers (see Chart 3).
<p>

<b>TAXES AND PREMIUMS</b>
<p>
	There are ways to strengthen Medicare, but what if we don't?  If we do nothing about reforming Medicare, the most likely choices are to raise taxes on working families or to increase premiums dramatically for seniors. There is no escape. You would have to raise the payroll tax over $1,700 for somebody who makes $40,000 a year or raise the Medicare premiums on senior citizens by 300 percent -- and neither of those options, in my view, can be sold to the American people. You cannot raise premiums on senior citizens by 300 percent, and you just cannot raise payroll taxes by 100 percent. We have to come up with a new solution.
<p>

<b>PRIVATE SECTOR EXPERIENCE</b>
<p>
	 Look at the experience of the private sector. Costs in Medicare are now going up 10.5 percent; the private sector's costs are going up 4.4 percent (see Chart 4). CEOs of large corporations have been telling us about the areas where health care costs are having a negative growth rate. At a House Budget Committee meeting, we had a presentation by IBM, Texas Instruments, and Eastman Kodak. They are all having a negative growth in their cost of health care, while we are having double digit increases in Medicare. So there is a lot to learn from the private sector. We can do a lot better in Medicare than we are doing today.
<P>
	Some, both in and out of Congress, are not only afraid of this issue, but also think that we can just put it off. They are wrong. We have to address the problem expeditiously. The reason:  Medicare's financial crisis is severe today and will only worsen tomorrow as the American population gets older (see Chart 5).

<p>
<b>TECHNICAL ISSUES</b>
<p>
	One of the technical issues that we have is scoring savings for private sector-style market efficiencies. Everybody here in Washington knows what budget scoring is. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the cost of a policy; depending on how the policy is designed, it can be scored by CBO for savings. The question is, what is or is not a scorable saving?  President Clinton had the same problem two years ago with his health care reform bill. 
<p>
	 There are other cases -- for example, medical malpractice. We all agree that malpractice reform will save money, but the Congressional Budget Office says, "We don't know how much it would save, so you don't get any credit for passing malpractice reform."  The same issue arises with managed care:  HMOs do not necessarily save money. As we know, the Mathematica study came out and said you may even end up losing money on managed care. But should we simply let the CBO scoring drive our policy?  That is an issue we have discussed, and it makes it difficult.
<p>

<b>MEDICAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS</b>
<p>
	I like the medical savings account option (MSA) in a reformed Medicare system. It is probably going to be one of the options available. The problem, critics say, with medical savings accounts is adverse selection; that is, the healthier people will want medical savings accounts and will desert conventional insurance. What this means is that in designing a medical savings account, we have to make sure that adverse selection is minimized.
<P>
	Remember that some critics say the very same thing about HMOs. The fear is that younger and healthier people will enroll in HMOs and desert traditional insurance, again causing a severe adverse selection problem. But, again, it depends on how you design the system. This problem is not overwhelming the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), where we have a series of consumer choices. I can go to HMOs, PPOs, or fee-for-service. Our idea is to give people choices like that. I think that the MSA may also be one of our options; we are moving in that direction.
<p>

<b>KEEPING TRADITIONAL MEDICARE</b>
<p>
	Should we treat new enrollees differently than older enrollees?  I think, when you take 85-year-olds, it is much harder to change their health care behavior patterns than it is for 65-year-olds. We have said that we're going to maintain the traditional Medicare program. Some people are afraid of HMOs. New people entering the Medicare system should be treated differently than those over a certain age. Their life experiences are different. This is another practical item to be resolved.

<p>
<b>PRESCRIPTION DRUGS</b>
<p>
	Getting away from all the technical issues, I think it is very important to make it possible for elderly people to buy prescription drugs either by choosing an HMO or another managed care provider or through some other innovative option, including a new fee-for-service option.
<p>
	Again and again, we see that the most important single concern among senior citizens is the cost and availability of prescriptions. Their second concern, after prescriptions, is long-term care. When we talk about a general strategy in health care policy, we should be sensitive to this issue of long-term care and provide greater incentives for people buying long-term care. It is part of our larger health care reform strategy.
<p>
	
<b>SOLID INFORMATION</b>
<p>

	Finally, we should encourage states or private contractors, not the HMOs, to bring solid information to seniors. This addresses a lingering insecurity that seniors feel about making choices.
<p>
	One of our House Budget Committee proposals was to provide that kind of information. As a federal employee or retiree, you can go to a bookstore today and buy a book that explains all the different options we now have. That is perhaps still a little complicated. Federal workers and retirees like their system, but I think we can do it in a better, more simplified way. Under Medicare today, there are some choices, under Medigap, of supplemental insurance. If you want a Volkswagen or if you want a Rolls Royce, it's your choice. You pay for what you get. So choice is not utterly foreign to senior citizens. 
<p>
	 None of this is going to be easy. There are a whole series of challenges. Medicare is a very complex system. You have Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B and supplemental insurance, as well as a host of big private contractors and supervisory roles played by the Health Care Financing Administration, issuing thousands of pages of guidelines. It is a paperwork monster, but it was designed in 1965.
<p>
	It is time to get Medicare ready for the 21st century. It has to be addressed by the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Commerce Committee. It has to go to the House and Senate floors. We want it to be resolved by the time we pass the federal budget. We have made a commitment:  We will come up with a way to reduce the growth in spending to save Medicare and balance the federal budget. It is not only a promise; it is our duty.
<p>

<b>THE CHANGING POLITICAL DEBATE</b>

<p>
<a name="grace"></a><b>GRACE-MARIE ARNETT</b>:  It is a pleasure to be here with you at the Heritage Foundation's Physicians Council meeting.
<p>
	It was a pleasure to join you in hearing the presentation last night by Senator Bill Frist, a heart transplant surgeon and colleague of yours, who has demonstrated the power of one person's commitment to change. As all of you know, Dr. Frist decided to run for the United States Senate last year and won a huge upset victory in November. 
<p>
	 You also make tremendous contributions to your profession, both by your work, day in and day out, treating patients and by your added involvement in the policy process through the Physicians Council. By being part of this organization and by getting the word out about the central importance of the physician-patient relationship, you make a crucial contribution to health policy.
<p>
	I want to make a few preliminary comments as a transition into my remarks about the politics of health care reform. Dr. David Brown, Chairman of the Heritage Physicians Council, mentioned my work with the Consensus Group.1  We have done a great deal of work on market-oriented health care reform, advancing ideas that will help to restore the physician-patient relationship. But making any changes in the health care system is like turning a great battleship. It is so huge, it can only be done by degrees. If you try to spin a battleship too quickly you put the ship at great risk. You must instead set a clear course and begin to make those first few-degree turns carefully.
<p>
	The current employment-based system offers security to tens of millions of people. But it also has serious flaws -- leaving tens of millions of people without coverage and driving up the costs of health insurance and medical services. Yet it must not be changed too quickly, as we learned too well during the health care reform debate.
<p>
	Many of the changes advocated by earlier speakers, including <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Bob Moffit</a> of The Heritage Foundation and Kevin Vigilante of Brown University, are important steps in moving the system in the right direction -- changes like giving individual Americans vouchers and tax credits for the purchase of health insurance. These changes would begin to give individual Americans more control over their health care spending choices as a transition to a more individually based health insurance system. Certainly, many employers will continue to offer health insurance as part of their employee compensation packages. If a person's employment-based plan offers the best option, they could choose that plan. But if their labor union, their professional association, or their school district offers them a better deal, they could choose that, instead. Personal choice is key.
<p>
	Now, I would like to talk about the politics not only of general health care reform, but also of Medicare. And I want to share with you what I believe is driving the debate. But before I do, my basic conviction, and my absolute, solid sense of the medical profession, is that you will prevail. The Bible's <i>Book of Sirach</i> (also known as <i>Ecclesiasticus</i>), Chapter 38, says:  "Hold the physician in honor, for he is essential to you, and God it was who established his profession."  I believe this Biblical passage shows that ultimately the independence and integrity of the medical profession will be preserved. 
<p>
	 The medical profession, as Dr. Brown said, cannot function without physicians. Nurses, physicians' assistants, and other medical professionals may gain more authority to do specific procedures. And that can be good in terms of economic efficiency. But medical care must be coordinated with the physician's supervision.
<p>
	These last few years have been traumatic for your profession. You have been "rolled" politically. But this can't last. The medical profession cannot move forward without physicians. But every single physician must ask himself or herself where he or she can make the most difference. And being part of this organization is a very, very good start.
<p>

<b>THE BATTLE OVER MEDICARE </b>
<p>
	Let us look at the terrain and the environment of this round of the battle over health care reform. If the rhetoric over Medicare spending were to be stripped away, it is clear that the health care issue is once again being used as a battleground for a major political clash over money and power. The debate over funding health care for the elderly is a debate over control of billions of tax dollars. It also represents a pivotal battle over the direction of federal programs. 
<p>
	 Medicare is in serious trouble. The Medicare trustees, including the Clinton Administration's Treasury and Health and Human Services secretaries, have warned that the program will go bankrupt in seven years unless major changes are made. Either taxes will have to be raised further or the program must be restructured. Raising taxes is the old way of doing business in Washington; updating the program to inject more market efficiency is the new way. It is a clear choice. 
<p>
	 Liberals have tried to entwine Medicare with the balanced budget agreement and tax cuts, but Medicare is a separate program with separate problems that must be addressed directly.
<p>
	In this latest incarnation of the health care reform debate, the voters are as alienated as they were last time, confused by the tactics and distortions. During the last phase of the health care debate over the Clinton bill in 1993 and 1994, the public was turned off by talk of health alliances, vast new bureaucracies, and fines, penalties, and jail terms to enforce the plan. None of this connected with them -- well, it connected with them; it scared them. But they didn't believe that the changes were going to help them in any meaningful way. And they were right.
<p>
	This time, the debates on health care have little to do with the health care system again, and everything to do with money and power. In 1993 and 1994, health care reform was to have been the vehicle for Congress and the executive branch to gain a lock on political power by providing health care that's always there for the middle class. The middle class didn't bite; in fact, they bit back.
<p>

<b>SOLID INFORMATION IS KEY </b>
<p>
	The American people had every reason to be afraid of the Clinton Administration's Health Security Act. I don't think anybody did more to give the American people the details of what was in that bill than The Heritage Foundation, particularly Bob Moffit. There were probably, at one point, maybe seven people in this city that had read the whole 1,342 pages, and Bob was one of them. 	
<p>
	 Bob Moffit did a line-by-line analysis, not only of what was in the bill, but what its implications were for the health care system. And he completed his analysis in just a few weeks. The background paper began circulating in policy circles, and people who were not going take the time to read the bill read Bob Moffit's analysis.2  It was a very important contribution to the debate.<p>	Soon after the bill was released, several of us who had read the bill, including Bob, gathered around a table and began exchanging revelations:  "My goodness, did you see what was on page 342?"  one said. "Oh, no, but did you see page 946?"  another answered. We were all aghast at the sweep and intrusiveness of this piece of legislation.
<P>
	The more the American people learned about the details of the bill, the more scared they got. And they learned about it because of that bedrock work by the health policy community.
<p>
	During the debate, the things that were most politically charged came percolating to the surface:  employer mandates, alliances, regulations, fines, penalties, jail terms. Then people started to say, "Wait a minute. This is un-American."  This change in popular opinion begins with the kind of detailed analysis that think tanks like The Heritage Foundation do.
<p>
	The American people got so frightened by what they saw that they said, "We don't want anything to do with that bill, and we don't want anything to do with anybody that cooked up that bill."  So they threw many of the liberals in Congress who supported the bill out of office. 
<p>
	 Fear is a very effective political motivator, and now fear is being used to unnecessarily scare seniors in the Medicare debate. To quote House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas, "The Democratic Party once stood firm on the conviction that Americans have nothing to fear but fear itself. Now the liberals stand firm on the conviction that they have nothing to offer but fear itself." 
<p>
	 There have been some very telling quotes in the health care reform debate. Consider the insights of Judith Feder, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health Policy at the Department of Health and Human Services. In defending the Clinton plan, Judith Feder said, in a quote on the front page of <i>The New York Times</i> on December 5, 1993, "What we're trying to do is replace the ineffective, inefficient bureaucracy of the unfettered marketplace."
<p>
	At a conference in Chicago a couple of weeks ago, Ms. Feder said, "We're going to do to them what they did to us."  So flags are up. Liberals in Congress are now clearly trying to convince Americans that conservatives are gutting Medicare to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy. This is wrong.
<P>

<b>INTERESTS ARE SPECIAL </b>
<p>
	Many special interests are lining up to keep Medicare spending at its current unsustainable level. Medicare spending cannot continue to rise at 10 percent a year without bankrupting the program. The Medicare trustees themselves have acknowledged this. President Clinton has acknowledged this. But for every dollar the federal government spends, there are at least two constituencies:  the person who gets the services that are provided and the person who gets the money who provided those services. Every dollar that is saved by making the program more efficient is a dollar that will not be spent. There are a number of groups with a short-term view that want to keep spending federal tax dollars at the current rate, despite the consequences for the long-term solvency of the Medicare program and the future benefits of seniors and seniors-to-be.
<P>
	And they could win. Medicare is highly subject to political pressure. It illustrates the key reason why government involvement in the health sector is a bad thing:  Decisions are based upon politics, not economics, innovation, or efficiency. Short-term political expediency often prevails over long-term solvency.
<p>
	So now we have the special interests who, last time, lined up to fight government-run health care at all costs this time lining up to save government-run health care -- in the form of Medicare -- at all costs. Washington politics is nothing if not paradoxical. These special-interest groups are a grass-roots army, and they are arming to fight as Congress tries to restructure and save Medicare.
<p>
	Anybody who looks at Medicare's numbers knows that something has to change. Unless Congress is successful in getting to the root of the issue and rethinking the way the program is structured, Medicare's future will continue to be in jeopardy.

<p>
<b>POLITICS AND TAXES</b>
<p>
	Let's turn now, for a moment, to the debate over tax cuts. In 1980, Ronald Reagan swept into the White House and brought a Republican Senate with him on the promise to revive the American economy with across-the-board cuts in income-tax rates. And the largest peacetime expansion in this nation's history ensued. There are a lot of debates about why that happened. There is almost no debate that an extra dollar in the pocket of an American citizen is a better way for that money to be spent than an extra dollar spent by the federal government.
<p>
	President Reagan did what he said he was elected to do:  cut taxes. In 1990, President Bush said, "Read my lips:  No new taxes."  And then he broke his pledge. Pollsters who look for underlying trends say that President Bush's soaring popularity after the Gulf War was really only superficial; underneath, the popular anger at him for breaking his pledge over tax cuts never really went away, and he was defeated in 1992.
<p>
	In 1992, President Clinton ran on a promise:  middle-class tax cuts. Not only has he not delivered on a tax cut, but he won, by one vote, the largest tax increase in history in 1993. And he was proposing yet another tax increase through his health care bill. Look what happened in 1994:  The voters threw out dozens of legislators who supported these policies.
<p>
	Get the message?  If conservatives haven't learned the lesson that voters mean business when they talk about tax cuts, the liberals certainly have. They've learned that if they can stop conservatives from cutting taxes, they have a shot at regaining power.
<p>
	Liberals know they can't win the debate, an open debate, over raising taxes. They know they can't win an open debate over whether or not we should have a balanced budget. Medicare is the liberals' logical battleground, because it obscures what we're really talking about and there is a tremendous, electrifying charge of politics and seniors being frightened about losing their benefits.
<p>
	In 1996, liberals may not have a better idea about what they want to do if they're elected. But they certainly will try to use the politics of Medicare to stop conservatives from fulfilling their promises.
<p>
	Medicare is the battleground. It affects all of you on a very immediate basis, because it affects your ability to get fairly compensated for the services that you provide. That's not what this debate is about. In a more efficient market, you will get fairly compensated and likely will be unshackled from the huge burden of paperwork that Medicare demands. 
<p>
	 Nor is this debate about seniors getting less health care. The market could easily take care of giving seniors a benefit that's worth $4,800 today and $6,400 in seven years and give them the same, if not better, health care more efficiently. But Members of Congress may not have a chance to do that if conservatives get thrown out because the Medicare debate blows up in their face.
<p>
	I urge you to continue to participate in the debate, to continue to stay informed about the real issues that are being decided, and to help in the effort to put both the Medicare program and the whole federal budget on a more sound footing. 
<p>

<b>INFLUENCING THE POLICY PROCESS</b>
<p>

<a name="john"></a><b>JOHN C. LIU</b>:  I'd like to follow up on Senator Bill Frist's comments last night, supplementing what Grace-Marie just said on the politics of health care reform. Congress is the key actor, and we should be clear about what we expect in this Congress, short-term and long-term. As physicians and members of the Heritage Physicians Council, you can be instrumental in playing a key role in the policy debate.
<p>
	Bob Moffit and I attended town hall meetings across the country last year at which different Senators and Congressmen supported our position on where this health care reform should go:  consumer choice and competition.
<p>
	Congress unfortunately does not have the stomach to tackle comprehensive health care reform. This is partly because last year's debate was so grueling, the bills so detailed, and the legislative analysis so time-consuming that Members of Congress, with so much else on their agenda, fashioning budget and tax policy in particular, simply don't have the time in the remainder of this session to deal with the intricacies and complexities of comprehensive health care reform.
<p>
	But the problems remain. You still have a growing uninsured population in this country, mostly middle-class and lower-middle-class and low-income individuals working hard and struggling to put food on the table. At the same time, too many Americans have no practical access to health insurance, because current federal policy, through the tax code, has penalized them, making it significantly less affordable. If their employer, maybe a small business, cannot afford to give them health insurance, even a very scaled-down policy, they are in serious trouble.
<p>
	This same population that is uninsured is currently providing a subsidy to a growing population that is already getting health insurance. Through the tax code, through the HI payroll tax, they are subsidizing, and helping subsidize, the health care of our growing Medicare population, those 65 and over. And that tax burden is getting heavier. That is another reason why we must have Medicare reform this year. The Speaker of the House, the Senators on the Finance Committee, and others have wisely decided to tackle this issue of Medicare reform this year.
<p>
	It will be tough, but it must be done. As the Medicare trustees have stated, if nothing is done now, this system is not going to be around by the year 2002. That's only seven years away.
<p>
	Senator Frist told you last night to go back home and talk to your physician colleagues. As physicians, your views and opinions on health care issues are respected. Friends of mine who are doctors, and in their training and their residencies, are very impressed when they hear a sound idea from a colleague. When doctors hear a politician tell them something, a red flag goes up. But when a colleague offers an educated opinion or shares insights into what's going on, they tend to pay more attention. After all, you are the professionals providing health care to the American people.
<p>
	Visit your Congressman or state legislator back in the districts. It's perhaps more inconvenient to come to Washington, D.C., and meet your Senator or Congressman, but go back home. Call the scheduling office back in the district. Find out when your Congressman will be home in the district office, and be sure to schedule an appointment. Even fifteen minutes of their time, as Senator Frist mentioned, is valuable. You do not need to travel to Washington, D.C.
<p>
	Talk to your specialty organizations. As a colleague of mine last year said, unfortunately, organized medicine seemed "brain dead" when it came to health care reform. Even some of your specialty groups, unfortunately, have had only one obsession:  wanting to be a player at the table. That is not necessary. Groups in Washington, D.C., as you learned during last year's health care debate, do not always represent your philosophy. They often hire former staffers from the Hill who articulate official Washington's point of view. Because Congress has been dominated by liberals for the past forty years, far too many professional organizations have hired top liberal staffers from Capitol Hill to run their Washington offices, allegedly representing your interests back home. As you know, however, that is often not the case.
<p>
	There is no magic solution to influencing public policy. Write to professional organizations' newsletters and make your opinions known; write to your colleagues; go back and visit your alma mater if you can. Try the front door. Several of my friends have visited their med schools back in California and New York and have had maybe an hour's worth of time with their former dean. An even better idea:  You should spend perhaps an hour or so lecturing future med students on the direction of health care policy and its impact on medical practice. 
<p>
	 This Congress, in its first four months, already has achieved more in health care policy than the last Congress achieved in two years. A positive provision passed through the House under the Contract with America is that the self-employed now have access to a 25 percent tax deduction for their health insurance. And that has already been signed into law. Federal savings accounts are going to be introduced this afternoon. Congressman Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, will be introducing an MSA bill.
<p>
	Congressman Bill Thomas of California, the Health Subcommittee chairman, has introduced an insurance bill which takes care of pre-existing conditions and allows individuals who change jobs, and who have been insured, to retain that coverage and not be penalized if they wish to switch insurers. Portability is still a major goal of health care reform, and work along this line is underway in the Senate.
<p>
	Again, this is in the first four months of the new Congress. Incremental changes are likely:  not as broad or sweeping as the government-run Clinton plan or as the free-market Heritage Foundation plan, but we will see advances in the right direction. Unfortunately, a lot of these measures are being advanced simply in the context of the present flawed system:  a tax policy which penalizes individuals for choosing their provider or their health plan outside of the employer's health plan.
<p>
	So there's a lot more to be done.
<p>
	Medicare, as Grace-Marie Arnett mentioned, will be the battleground for this Congress. I was at a conference not too long ago with Congressman Pete Stark, the former chairman of the Health Subcommittee of Ways and Means, a prominent liberal from my home state of California who proudly says that, as the chairman of the House Health Subcommittee, he was privileged to serve as "the CEO," along with eleven members, the "board of directors," of the Medicare program. This is a health insurance company, he said, that provides health care to 38 million Americans.
<p>
	That's a neat way of putting it. But apparently the shareholders didn't like their CEO and board of directors, voted them out, and installed a new CEO and board of directors for Medicare. This new board, I'm pleased to report, has embraced the idea that a free market is the best mechanism for controlling costs when it is allowed to work, and it should work for America's senior citizens.
<p>
	Congressman Dan Miller has been working on a draft proposal to present to the House of Representatives. He and several other members of the House Commerce Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee, which have jurisdiction over Medicare reform, will be working on this proposal.
<p>
	Medicare is in deep financial trouble. But Pete Stark and Congressman Sam Gibbons of Florida, responding to the Trustees' Report, a very nonpartisan report which comes out every year, say, in effect, "It's nothing to get hysterical about. We've been reading these predictions for the past several years, and they're always talking about insolvency. It's nothing to get hysterical about."
<p>
	And I would agree. Let's not get hysterical about it. But let's get concerned about it, because this 30-year-old system was designed to insure the health of those who were elderly and truly needy. While it would be bad form to get hysterical, it is high time to get serious.
<p>
	Medicare can't control costs, except through price controls and shifting costs to the private sector. We've seen the federal government slowly take tighter control of doctors and hospitals and implement more reams of rules and regulations. I don't need to go into the RBRVs, the DRGs, or the PPS. You know better than I do about the impact of these complex systems of fee schedules and price controls. They don't work.3  But unless something is done now, we should be very concerned, not just for our future, but for our parents' future, because this is a system that is designed to insure that we get quality health care in our golden years. And, as a nation, we are getting older.<p>	Liberal special-interest groups have been very vocal already, talking about Draconian cuts. And they know how to play the game. They've placed ads in the <i>Washington Post</i> and <i>New York Times</i> about what this Congress is going to do, or might do. We are being asked to write our Congressmen to make sure that Grandmother isn't going to get cut off from health care.
<p>
	While that is a good short-term scare tactic, the awful negative numbers in Medicare will force a public reckoning. Working Americans could be faced with huge taxes, including additional payroll taxes of 3.5 percent or even 3.9 percent.4  In my opinion, when the American people come to realize this, liberals in Congress will have lost credibility on this whole issue.
<p>
	Think back to the Medicare catastrophic debate in 1988. Liberals lost credibility. They lobbied to add benefit after benefit after benefit to what was, back then, a very lean Medicare catastrophic package. If it had passed as Bob Moffit's colleagues in the Reagan Administration had designed it, it would have been affordable. And it would have been workable.
<p>
	Unfortunately, special interests and liberals in Congress saw it as a great opportunity to lump on more benefits. And Congress back then was not well-known for saying "No."  So they added benefit after benefit, the cost soared, and the bill collapsed, to be repealed only a year later.5<P>	Nevertheless, as far as politics is concerned, Medicare reform is going to be tough. The media like to call any reform proposals Draconian cuts, for example. Heritage has put forward a major Medicare reform proposal that we just finished within the past twenty-four hours. We have drafted a defined contribution proposal that a lot of members on Capitol Hill have shown an interest in advancing.
<p>

<b>A MODEL FOR REFORM</b> 
<P>
	Basically, the Heritage Foundation proposal will allow seniors to apply a defined government contribution towards the health care plan of their choice, just as congressional and federal retirees do today in the popular Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). They can stay in current Medicare, if that's what they want to do. This is a good political measure. Obviously, no Member of Congress wants to go home and say, "I'm taking away your Medicare."  A lot of folks have grown accustomed to it, and anyway, we don't want to take it away.
<p>
	But for Americans about to retire, or those who perhaps are not happy with the current Medicare system, we are now offering choices. Heritage has prepared a paper detailing the specifics of this Medicare proposal.6  We hope that this concept will go far in defining the debate. From our conversations with the Speaker's office, the Majority Leader's office, and other members of the committees of jurisdiction, this basic concept of using the FEHBP as a model for Medicare reform is being very well received.
<p>
	Indeed, one of the Medicare proposals of the House Budget Committee, unveiled at a conference not too long ago in Virginia, was inspired by the Heritage Foundation model. Another one is a variation of this, offered by Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire. It's still a consumer choice proposal, but he has a stronger emphasis on managed care.
<p>
	Of special interest to physicians is that the American Medical Association has gone on record as supporting a Medicare voucher. Heritage has been working with the AMA, outlining common ground between their voucher proposal and our Medicare reform proposal.
<p>
	This is a national debate that we can win. This Congress has promised the American people it would hold back spending, cut back government, and give more choices and freedom to individuals. The average American is not stupid. He can make his own decisions. If active and retired Congressmen and Senators can choose their own health plan from among a variety of options, why can't their constituents?  If it's good enough for Ted Kennedy, if it's good enough for Al Gore, then it's good enough for the rest of us.

<P>

     Mr. Chairman, it has been recognized for years now by nearly
everyone -- from the right, left, and center of the political spectrum -- that
the U.S. foreign aid program is critically flawed. In addition to having too
many goals and too little focus, U.S. development assistance programs have
done little to advance economic growth in the developing world. Far more
important than economic aid in determining whether a developing country
emerges from poverty is that country's own economic policies -- in short,
how free its economy is. This fundamental fact has been overlooked by the
designers of America's foreign aid program. It is time to begin looking at
it. Without question, this Congress has a unique opportunity to reform
foreign aid. This opportunity must be seized. The American people will
support a foreign aid program, but only one that serves American interests
and promotes international economic growth.
<P>
     We at The Heritage Foundation have examined the issue of foreign
aid closely. We have published The Index of Economic Freedom, a study
that measures the comparative economic freedom of 101 countries. The
Index scores countries on ten factors, including taxation levels, trade
barriers, regulations, and openness to foreign investment. The purpose of
this study is to introduce a new understanding of economic development.
Hitherto, most development economists and the U.S. foreign aid bureaucracy
believed that a laundry list of factors ranging from health, education, and
even population controls must be manipulated by governments for economic
development to occur. The Index takes a different approach. It is based on
the premise that economic freedom is the most important factor in economic
development -- or, as we prefer to call it, economic growth. As we
discovered in the Index, how free an economy was, and not the amount of
economic assistance it had received, was the most important and consistent
determining factor in a country's level of economic development and its rate
of economic growth. This being the case, we concluded that the purpose of
economic aid should be to promote economic freedom and to create the
economic growth that will someday make this aid unnecessary. 
<P>
     But The Index of Economic Freedom is more than a study of the
factors contributing to economic development. It also can be instrumental
in evaluating America's development assistance programs. The Index can be
a useful tool with which to decide whether particular countries deserve
development assistance and, if so, what kind of aid is best for them.
  <P>   The assumption behind the Index and indeed our entire approach to
reforming foreign aid is that U.S. foreign assistance programs should serve
three fundamental purposes: 
<P>
 To enhance U.S. national security. 
<P>
 To advance American national interests.
<P>
To promote economic growth around the world, which creates markets for
American goods and contributes to democratization and international
stability.
 <P>
While we believe that U.S. foreign assistance should be used under certain
circumstances for humanitarian purposes and to help friendly foreign
countries in an emergency, we also believe that U.S. foreign aid programs
should be understood primarily as an extension of U.S. foreign policy and
designed to advance its goals. 
<P>
     Thus, some forms of assistance to advance the process of
democratization, if they are effective and given to deserving countries,
would be compatible with the U.S. goal of promoting international stability.
But economic development assistance, which by and large has failed, should
be carefully scrutinized and curtailed. To the extent that current military and
security assistance programs serve the national interest, they, too, should be
continued. Economic support for Israel, Egypt, Russia, and the Newly
Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union by and large should
be retained, although in the cases of Russia and the NIS, some cuts can be
made safely. However, so-called economic support funds for Israel and
Egypt should not be understood as a means to promote economic
development, for they surely do not serve this goal, but rather as a form of
security support assistance and as a political demonstration of U.S. support
for the Middle East peace process.
<P>
     With these assumptions in mind, we have prepared a list of
recommendations for your committee to consider as it reviews the foreign
aid program. I need not remind the members of the committee that the
balanced budget amendment, if it passes the whole Congress, will bring
every federal spending program under close scrutiny. Foreign assistance
programs should be no exception. With that reality in mind, I have
combined the total savings from all the recommendations made in this
testimony into two budgetary options which I hope you will consider. 
  <P>   OPTION A ($2.58 billion savings). This option represents the
minimum amount which should be cut from this year's foreign aid budget.
It includes:
<P>
Reducing bilateral economic development assistance programs by 50 percent
for a total fiscal 1996 savings of $1.8 billion.
<P>
Trimming aid to Russia and the NIS by $200 million.
<P>
Shrinking funding for multilateral development banks by 25 percent for a
total savings of $481 million. 
<P>
 Abolishing the Agency for International Development for a savings of $100
million in administrative costs.
<P>
     OPTION B ($5.67 billion savings). The new budget environment
may require that you consider more drastic reductions than outlined in
Option A. If this turns out to be the case, you can look to our Option B
menu of cuts. This option includes:
<P>
Eliminating nearly all economic development assistance for a total fiscal
1996 savings of $3.6 billion.
<P>
Ending all aid to Russia and the NIS for a savings of $839 million.
Cutting 50 percent of U.S. funding for the World Bank, the International
Monetary Fund, and other multilateral development banks for a savings of
$963 million.
<P>
Cutting economic support funds for all countries except Israel and Egypt by
50 percent for a savings of $167 million.
<P>
Abolishing the Agency for International Development for a savings of $100
million in administrative costs.
<P>
GIVING AID A FREE-MARKET FOCUS: PROPOSALS FOR
REFORMING FOREIGN AID 
<P>     The U.S. foreign aid program must be fundamentally overhauled. In
this new political environment of fiscal restraint, foreign aid must not only
take its fair share of budget reductions, but also be reshaped to give its
remaining programs new life, new meaning, and a new mission. With these
goals in mind, we recommend that:
<P>
Economic Development aid be made contingent upon a recipient country's
commitment to free markets as determined by The Index of Economic
Freedom.
<P>
     There is a stark contrast between the tremendous economic progress
made by such countries as Hong Kong and Singapore that have pursued
free-market development strategies and other poorer countries like Tanzania
and Ethiopia that have pursued a statist approach to economic development.
Indeed, it should come as no surprise that two of the greatest development
success stories of the last few decades, Hong Kong and Singapore, share the
highest Index of Economic Freedom score of 1.25. These are two
outstanding examples of countries that have elected to unleash the
entrepreneurial energies of their peoples by pursuing free-market economic
policies. The results have been spectacular. The per capita GDPs of Hong
Kong and Singapore have grown nearly eightfold since the mid-1960s. Over
the same period the per capita GDPs of Ethiopia, Chad, and Angola grew
hardly at all, primarily because their economies were unfree.
<P>
     No one can argue seriously that economic assistance from the
advanced industrial democracies is the principal reason for the economic
growth rates of Hong Kong, Singapore, or even other "Asian Tigers" like
Taiwan or South Korea. To be sure, some of these countries (like South
Korea) have received massive amounts of military aid, but no reputable
economist would contend that spending money on tanks and guns is an
economic development strategy. No, the reason the economies of these
countries have grown is that they have chosen market economies. 
<P>
     Economic development aid not only does little to advance economic
development, but even can be detrimental to the welfare of the countries
receiving it. Tanzania is a case in point. Once a cause c‚lŠbre of Western
donors, by the early 1970s Tanzania had become one of the most heavily
aided countries in the developing world. The U.S. Agency for International
Development (AID) was heavily involved in Tanzania, providing financial
support and technical assistance for forced rural collectivization, one of
Tanzania's many disastrous socialist schemes. Today, Tanzania is the
world's second poorest country, worse off than it was at the time of its
independence. Foreign aid unquestionably contributed to the destruction of
Tanzania's economy. It encouraged and enabled governments to pursue
harmful statist economic policies that made economic growth next to
impossible to achieve.
 <P>
     Another case in point is Chile, only the outcome has been markedly
different. Over the last several years, Chile has had one of the fastest
growing economies in the world. It is now the leading "Latin Jaguar." Yet
foreign aid had nothing to do with Chile's development success. Indeed, the
seeds of this success were laid only after the government of General
Augusto Pinochet was cut off from virtually all foreign aid following its
1973 coup d'etat.
<P>
     Here is how this success story happened. In 1970, Chile was the
world's second largest per capita recipient of foreign aid. It was also
stagnating economically. In 1973, Salvador Allende's last year as president,
Chile's GDP shrank by 5.6 percent. Around 75 percent of Chile's GDP at
this time was controlled by the government. However, after Pinochet came
to power, most of Chile's foreign aid was cut off. Unable to rely on the
crutch of foreign aid, Pinochet embarked on a privatization and market
reform program that transformed Chile's economy. By 1990 government
control of the economy had dropped to 25 percent. Moreover, Chile's infant
mortality rate was reduced from 78 to 17 per 1,000 births between 1970 and
1991, and its life expectancy rate rose from 64 to 72 years between 1970
and 1990. These improvements occurred because of economic growth, not
because of foreign aid programs.
<P>
     The Index of Economic Freedom is designed to help identify
instances in which development aid is playing the type of destructive role
that it once played in Chile. By helping to determine which countries are
economically free, the Index can help policymakers decide which countries
deserve economic aid -- i.e., those that are making progress toward a free
market -- and which countries do not deserve it -- i.e., those that are unfree
and are not making progress toward a free market. Governments with unfree
economic policies -- those possessing very high taxes, protectionist trade
policies, hostile foreign investment climates, and burdensome economic
regulations, for example -- will only waste economic aid. In fact, economic
aid too frequently is a crutch upon which the governments become
dependent and which prevents them from making the economic reforms
necessary to create economic growth.
<P>
     The Index of Economic Freedom has been recognized by many
concerned with the future of the U.S. foreign aid program as the best means
of identifying those countries with a commitment to free-market-generated
economic growth. George M. Ferris, Jr., Chairman of the 1992 President's
Commission on the Management of AID Programs, urged AID to establish
an Index of Economic Freedom for the purpose of allocating development
aid among countries. Last year, minority members of this committee,
including a few of you here today, encouraged AID to develop and use an
Index of Economic Freedom as a tool for its development aid allocation
decisions. Unfortunately, AID has resisted doing so, despite the fact that it
has the requisite data readily available.
 <P>
     Instead of putting the Index at the heart of America's development
assistance program, AID allocates aid according to a hodgepodge of criteria
that are not nearly as important as economic freedom. Take, for example,
AID's criterion of democracy and lawful governance. To be sure, democracy
is important to economic growth and stability in the long run, but
democracy alone is no guarantee of economic development. Singapore is no
democracy, yet its free economy generates very high rates of economic
growth. By the same token, Russia is slowly developing democratic
institutions, yet its economy is mostly unfree and stagnating. 
<P>
     Economic freedom is far more important to economic development
than democracy. In fact, in most cases, economic freedom is the best
foundation upon which to build democracy. In the long run free economies
produce growth and a middle class that come to demand civil rights,
political representation, and protection for their property. In short, as has
been seen in Taiwan, South Korea, Chile, and many other countries,
economic liberalization creates pressures for political liberalization. Some
countries like Singapore lag behind, but not all countries march in lock-step
toward democracy. While the pace of change may differ, most countries that
are economically free tend over time to become politically free as well. It
is probably only a matter of time before Singapore follows the path of
Chile.
<P>
     Fortunately, Singapore and other authoritarian regimes that pursue
free-market policies do not need or receive U.S. economic aid. Thus, the
moral question of whether we should be aiding an undemocratic free-market
country does not often arise. However, this question could arise if an
undemocratic government making progress toward economic reform were
to ask for aid. They could ask us for assistance to help them in their
transition toward a free-market economy even though they are undemocratic.
We may be facing such a question with respect to Russia sooner than we
think.
<P>
     Should we give economic aid to a government that is abusing the
human rights of its people? The short answer is "No, unless it serves some
higher national interest." This has been a long-standing tradition in U.S.
foreign aid policy. It was practiced widely during the Cold War and, if
national security considerations warrant, should continue in the post-Cold
War era as well. However, there should be fewer instances in which national
security considerations call for dispensing economic assistance. While we
can justify giving economic aid to less-than-savory governments for national
security reasons, our development assistance strategy should not include
aiding countries that are egregiously abusing their citizens. While a case
could be made that supporting economic freedom would lead to political
freedom in the long run, in extreme cases we cannot wait until that day
comes. Unlike private trade, government aid is too direct a symbol of
official and moral support. Discretion will have to be exercised if a recipient
government becomes abusive of its people.
<P>
     Another flawed AID criterion is "need" as determined by social
indicators. If this criterion is applied, all poor countries are more or less
deserving of economic aid. In fact, the poorest countries would be the most
deserving. But what if the recipient country's own economic policies are
mainly responsible for its poverty? If all we are doing is putting a Band-Aid
on misery that it is self-inflicted, how can we say that we are making a
substantial difference?  And if our aid is being used by corrupt governments
to perpetuate the very economic policies that are causing the poverty, how
can we continue in good conscience to dispense aid that amounts to little
more than a subsidy of economic misery? Looked at this way, we are not
satisfying the needs of poor people, but acting as accomplices to
governments that are keeping them poor.
<P>
     To be sure, one can find a U.S.-supported health or education
program abroad that has "done some good" for some people in the
developing world. Just as first aid relieves the pain and suffering of a sick
patient, economic aid can relieve in a limited way the pain and suffering of
people who are economically victimized by their own governments. But
economic first aid is not a development strategy. It is does not produce
economic growth. Free economies not only produce economic growth, but
also produce the wealth needed to improve health and education standards
for the greatest number of people. A free economy does far more to educate
people and raise health standards than U.S. economic assistance. In short,
it does more to meet the "needs" of the people. 
<P>
     Far from being too "narrow" a criterion for dispensing economic aid,
as AID Administrator Brian Atwood charges, the Index of Economic
Freedom encompasses the broadest possible number of factors that
determine economic development. The best way to address social "needs,"
clean up the environment, raise health standards, stabilize population growth,
and promote democratization is to produce economic growth. And the best
way to produce economic growth is to advance economic freedom. This is
a development strategy that is no less sophisticated for its simplicity of
purpose. In fact, it is far more sophisticated than the ahistorical analysis that
passes for economic development theory.
<P>
     Progress toward establishing free markets should be the sole
determinant in allocating development aid among countries. This is the
approach of Senator Mitch McConnell's foreign aid reform proposal
unveiled this past December. The McConnell proposal would condition
development aid on the adoption of free-market policies by recipient
governments as determined, in fact, by many of the factors of the Index of
Economic Freedom. Vice President Al Gore's 1993 "Reinventing
Government" report notes that "AID does not have a single, clearly defined
and articulated strategic mission." A free-market focus is what the U.S.
development aid program desperately needs.
<P>
Cut development aid spending.
 <P>    The conclusions of the Index of Economic Freedom suggest that U.S.
economic development assistance programs should be cut. Even if a case
could be made that all economic assistance were needed to promote
economic development around the world -- a case that cannot be made
seriously -- the new budget environment would argue in favor of reductions
in U.S. development assistance programs. I recommend to you the two
following budgetary options. Our analysis is based on the figures from last
year's foreign operations budget.
 <P>
     OPTION A ($1.8 billion savings). We assume that development aid
should be given under the right conditions -- i.e., directed at countries
moving toward free markets and used by them to assist them in the
transition. Under these conditions, development aid can make a difference,
although not a very large one. If used wisely, primarily to promote private
enterprise, it can encourage an environment in which a free market can
grow. With this assumption in mind, we have prepared a recommendation
that cuts most bilateral assistance programs by 50 percent. We anticipate
from these reductions a savings of $1.8 billion in fiscal 1996. In our range
of options, we consider Option A to be the absolute minimum which should
be reduced from this year's development assistance budget. Under no
circumstances should the Clinton Administration's development assistance
programs be fully funded.
<P>
     To assist you in deciding which countries' aid should be cut in
Option A, we have supplied you with a list of development aid recipients
scoring poorly on the Index of Economic Freedom. These are countries that
received either a "mostly unfree" or "repressed" score on the Index. Our
judgment is that you should scrutinize these countries very closely and
consider them prime candidates for reductions in -- or outright elimination
of -- economic development funds. They should be at the top of the list in
your efforts to meet the 50 percent reduction target.
 <P>
     OPTION B ($3.6 billion savings). The new budget environment may
require that you consider more drastic reductions in the development
assistance accounts. If this turns out to be the case, you can look to our
Option B menu of cuts in these accounts. In this option nearly all
development assistance aid is eliminated. Thus, all funding would be cut for
the African Development Foundation, the Development Assistance Fund, the
Development Fund for Africa, Eastern Europe and Baltic assistance,
population control, and other development programs. Savings from this
option would amount to $3.6 billion for fiscal 1996.
<P>
     As you move to reduce development aid spending, you certainly will
hear examples of development aid programs that "have made a difference"
in the lives of people throughout the developing world. Without question,
there have been "successful" development aid programs. Yet what is the
measure of success? Have these programs really made a difference to
national development, or have they been an oasis of achievement in an
otherwise barren environment? The best designed and executed agricultural
project will mean little in a country that is destroying itself through foolish
economic policies.
<P>
     Whether you choose Option A or Option B, you should be aware that
critics of cuts in development aid will try to portray you as lacking
compassion. They will use the same arguments that some people marshaled
to justify America's failed welfare system -- that "you don't care about
people" or that "some people" have been helped by the aid. You should not
be deterred by such arguments. Economic aid that does not encourage
economic growth or that serves no discernible strategic interest of the
United States is not only a waste; it is downright harmful to the people we
are pretending to help. Like our own welfare recipients, foreign governments
develop a kind of corrupting dependence on U.S. government funding.
Although the programs are different, the results are the same: We encourage
behavior that is self-destructive.
<P>
     Major cuts in development assistance do not amount to neo-
isolationism. Neither Option A or Option B touches military or security
assistance programs. Nor do they affect aid to Egypt and Israel. They affect
only aid that purports to spur economic development. Since it turns out that
most of this aid has been a failure, eliminating it would have no discernible
impact on international stability or international economic development.
America's overseas commitments would be reaffirmed not only by the
continuation of military and security aid, but by the far more important
military alliance and security commitments that the United States has made
to friends and allies overseas.
<P>
     In the end, it must be realized that the only reliable development
strategy is one that recognizes the true power of the market and the private
sector. In his excellent report, Development and the National Interest (1989),
former AID Administrator Alan Woods estimated that the American private
sector invested $12 billion a year in overseas development efforts. However,
the best "aid" any country can give another is free trade. The some $4
billion of bilateral development aid the U.S. provides to the developing
world is a drop in the bucket compared to the trillions of dollars that change
hands every year in private trade. No wonder that one of the most desired
prizes from the U.S. these days is not economic aid, but a free-trade
agreement. Most developing countries have come to realize that their future
rests not with AID or the World Bank, but with NAFTA and other free-
trade agreements.
<P>
Trim and rename Economic Support Funds.
  <P>  The rationale for Economic Support Funds (ESF) differs from that
for development aid. ESF is given to advance U.S. political and security
interests. While ESF, like development aid, does little or nothing to advance
economic development -- in fact, an argument can be made that it actually
retards economic growth -- we recommend continuing ESF for Egypt and
Israel. However, we believe that ESF funds should be renamed to reflect
their purpose more accurately. Since they are intended primarily to support
our security interests, we believe they should be renamed "Security
Supporting Assistance," which is what they were called before the name was
changed to Economic Support Funds in 1978. Israel and Egypt are by far
the biggest recipients of U.S. foreign aid. This year, Israel and Egypt will
receive $1.2 billion and $815 million, respectively, in Economic Support
Funds (ESF). These two countries command the bulk of ESF funding.
<P>
     OPTION A (no savings). No cuts in ESF are recommended in Option
A.
<P>
     OPTION B ($167 million savings). In this option we recommend a
50 percent reduction of economic support funds for all countries except
Israel and Egypt. In 1995, $334 million of ESF was appropriated for such
countries as Cyprus, Turkey, Morocco, Cambodia, and Ecuador. A 50
percent cut would damage our relations with these countries, but it would
not irreparably harm our fundamental national security interests. Such a
reduction would realize a savings of $167 million.
<P>
Revamp and cut aid to Russia and the Newly Independent States (NIS).
<P>     It is axiomatic that the U.S. has a vital stake in Russia's future.
Russia faces momentous challenges. Whether or not foreign aid can improve
Russia's chances of succeeding in developing free-market and democratic
systems is uncertain. I am inclined at this time to give the benefit of the
doubt to continuing a foreign aid program for Russia. I am sufficiently
convinced that, on balance, Western engagement in terms of foreign aid
helps keep the reforming spirit -- however it may flicker -- alive. But this
is a close call. Moreover, the point at which aid to Russia should be ended,
including a drastic reversal on reform, could come overnight. 
<P>
     What is crystal clear is that the case for continued Russian aid has
been weakened by the poor performance of AID. Without taking local
conditions into account, AID applied its Third World experience to Russia,
allocating the bulk of contracts to its "traditional" contractors, as opposed
to organizations and professionals with appropriate regional, industry, and
language experience. These multi-million-dollar nongovernmental
organizations -- including CARE, Save the Children, the Academy for
Educational Development, Experiment in International Living/World Vision,
and the Urban Institute -- had little or no experience in the former Soviet
Union. Unfortunately, their organizational culture, shaped by years of
working in the developing world, has hindered their work in the region.
Meanwhile, Russian nongovernmental organizations, even the most pro-
reform ones, are often excluded from the AID bidding process.
<P>
     Indeed, the AID contracting process is arcane and often understood
only by those with long-term relationships with the Agency. This effectively
screens out worthwhile organizations which lack an inside track. Tom Dine,
AID's Assistant Coordinator for the NIS, has publicly stated that if he could
have one wish fulfilled, it would be the abolition of AID's contracting
office, which has been primarily responsible for perpetuating the cozy
relationship with traditional contractors. 
<P>
     OPTION A ($200 million savings). Two recommendations are made
in Option A. The Congress should:
<P>
Reduce aid to Russia and the NIS from $839 million to $639 million. The
pace of aid delivered to this region so far has been slow, in part because
these countries are incapable of digesting the aid that already has been
appropriated. This region should not escape budget cuts. A good place to
look is the Officer Resettlement Program (ORP) which helps to build
housing for Russian army officers returning from abroad. The idea was to
prevent a restive and angry Russian army from challenging Yeltsin's
democratic regime. However, the Russian military has been mainly
responsible for the debacle in Chechnya. It stands to reason that if aid
should be cut, they should be at the top of the list. Thus, a $100 million
rescission should be imposed on funds already appropriated but not spent on
the Officer Resettlement Program, and another $100 million should be cut
from fiscal 1996's budget, not only for next year's appropriation for the
ORP, but also for other aid programs, such as the Eurasian Foundation,
which have not performed as well as expected.
<P>
Reprogram $75 million from health and environmental programs to other
programs. Health and environmental programs have a relatively low impact
on the development of a free market in Russia. There are difficulties in
identifying worthy projects in Russia and NIS. As a result, these funds are
disbursed at an even slower rate than in other areas. At the same time,
democratic reform, rule of law, and other crucial tasks are underfunded.
Thus, the money could be used better in building democratic institutions in
Russia. This proposal results in no net change in the overall Russian and
NIS assistance budget. 
<P>
 OPTION B ($839 million savings). The best circumstance for choosing this
option would be a determination by you that Russia no longer deserves our
aid or that the aid is not effectively assisting the transition to democracy and
a free market. Indeed, while in our estimation Russia still deserves aid for
now, it is not difficult to imagine circumstances in the near future when it
would not. The war in Chechnya has raised serious doubts about President
Yeltsin's commitment to democracy and reform. It is not even clear that he
is in charge of the country. Moreover, Russian foreign policy has become
less friendly in the past year. Yeltsin is opposing the expansion of NATO
and interfering in his neighbors' affairs.
<P>
     If, based on these facts, you were to decide that aid to Russia should
be eliminated entirely, you would realize a savings of $839 million for fiscal
1996. However, at this time we do not recommend this option. I fear that
cutting off all aid at this point would only drive Russia further into isolation
from the world community. Moreover, our democratic friends inside Russia
tell us that aid is still an important symbol of our commitment to them.
However, I cannot predict where I will stand on the issue of Russian aid
next year. If current trends inside Russia continue, I fear that I would be
hard pressed to recommend a continuation of aid next year.
<P>

Reduce funding to all multilateral development banks (MDBs).
  <P>   The fiscal 1995 House Republican budget would have ended U.S.
support for the International Development Association (IDA), the
concessional loan window of the World Bank. This proposal would have
realized savings in the billions over a five-year period. The Republican
budget alternative also proposed that the U.S. withhold all new capital
contributions to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
Asian Development Bank, International Finance Corporation, European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development, Inter-American Development Bank,
and African Development Fund. This proposal also would have realized
savings in the billions over five years. Whether the U.S. chooses to zero-out
some of these activities or make across-the-board funding cuts, it should
begin stepping away from the MDBs.
<P>
     The MDBs duplicate many private sector activities, particularly
lending. Many of the MDB loans could be secured from private financial
institutions. Indeed, over the last decade, there has been a flood of
investment to the developing world. The fact that many World Bank loans
could easily be privatized makes the point that its lending activities are
redundant.
<P>
     It is argued that there are troubled countries that would not be able
to attract capital without the MDBs. To the extent that this is true, it can be
attributed largely to the economic policies of such countries -- policies for
which the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and other MDBs
bear considerable responsibility. Consider the words of Czech Prime
Minister Vaclav Klaus, who has complained about the statist orientation of
the IMF and World Bank. Klaus has noted that IMF and World Bank aid "is
wrong and counterproductive." This aid, Klaus maintains, "is not taken
seriously, neither by the donors nor recipients. They are misused,
misdirected. They simply disappear. They are very often counterproductive.
They prolong the moment when the necessary domestic changes have to be
implemented." Klaus's insight can explain the deterioration of the World
Bank's project performance, as documented even in the Bank's own 1992
"Wapenhans Report." It also highlights the importance of aiding only those
countries moving rapidly toward the establishment of a free-market
economy, as is the Czech Republic. This imperative has been unappreciated
by the MDBs, and the U.S., frankly, has little chance of changing this.
<P>
     Another problem for the World Bank is the corruption of its
conditionality. The World Bank's structural adjustment programs, which are
foreign aid packages designed to liberalize the economies of developing
countries, have not been effective. It has been estimated that some half of
all economic reform programs endorsed by the IMF and the World Bank
break down. Yet the donors almost always soon return. In other instances,
development aid recipients pretend to comply with economic adjustment
program conditions while donors simply pretend to believe them. This
hypocrisy and lack of responsibility is a fallow field in which to plant the
seeds of economic growth.
<P>
     This game of pretend is not necessary. Even the World Bank
concedes this to be true when it notes in its 1993 World Development
Report that "Some of the most dramatic 'adjustment' reforms took place
without adjustment lending (as in Chile and Vietnam), and some countries
that received adjustment loans did little or nothing to pursue reforms (for
example, Tanzania and Zambia)." The key to developing vibrant free-market
economic growth is not to be found in the MDBs.
<P>
     This committee's report of last year quoted a 1982 Reagan
Administration review of the multilateral development banks and their
contribution to American security: "To the extent that the MDBs encourage
the participation of developing countries in that international system on a
permanent and self-sustaining basis, they are one of the major vehicles
available for pursuing these U.S. economic and political/strategic interests."
In the succeeding 13 years, I have not seen the MDBs achieve these goals
to much of an extent. Rather than make a ritualistic annual appropriation to
these institutions, I encourage the committee to make 1995, the fiftieth
anniversary of the creation of the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank, a time of fundamental reassessment. This would be done best
with a funding cut.
<P>
     OPTION A ($481 million savings). In this option funding for all
MDBs would be reduced by 25 percent. This would result in a savings of
$481 million for fiscal 1996. Reducing the MDBs in this way would send
a signal to the world community that unless the MDBs undertake major
reform, the United States will begin to step away from them and the
approach to multilateral development assistance which they represent.
OPTION B ($963 million savings). In this option funding for all MDBs
would be reduced by 50 percent. This would result in a savings of $963
million for fiscal 1996. This option would be chosen to demonstrate that the
U.S. has chosen to disengage from multilateral development assistance
altogether.
<P>
Eliminate the Agency for International Development.
  <P>   AID has failed at its mission of promoting economic development
overseas. Since its creation in 1961, AID has spent over $144 billion in
development aid. Yet most of the countries that have received U.S.
development aid remain mired in poverty, repression, and dependence. Of
course, a large part of this failure can be attributed to the fact that
development aid has been used to prop up socialist economies; hence, the
urgency of utilizing the Index of Economic Freedom.
<P>
     Before taking charge of AID two years ago, incoming Administrator
Brian Atwood labeled the agency a "disaster." Soon after this, Atwood
volunteered AID as a "reinvention lab" for Vice President Al Gore's task
force to reinvent the federal government. Of course, AID had undergone
four major management reorganizations and had been the subject of fourteen
management studies within the previous eight years.
<P>
     While Vice President Gore's September 1993 Creating a Government
That Works Better and Costs Less: Agency for International Development
found that "Reinvention is not simply an option or a challenge for AID; it
is an imperative," this report rejected "reasonable arguments" for AID's
absorption into the State Department or for its abolition. The President's
Commission on the Management of AID Programs (1992) and numerous
other studies had recommended absorption into State; the Hamilton-Gilman
Task Force Report (1989) had recommended abolition. The Vice President's
report instead concluded that, with reform and strong leadership, AID "could
reclaim its potential to be an effective provider of U.S. development
assistance."
<P>
     I would assume that AID has been implementing the reforms
recommended in the Vice President's report. Yet press reports over the last
few weeks suggest that AID came within a few threads of extinction at the
hands of the "Super State Department" proposal rejected two weeks ago.
What is troubling is what this says about AID's reform progress. It appears
either that the Vice President's report was not the right prescription for
shaping AID into an effective provider of development assistance or that
AID has been rejecting its medicine. Neither answer is encouraging, and the
situation begs the question of where AID goes from here. It should go away.
We have heard too many promises of reform, from both Republican and
Democratic Administrations, to give AID any more chances.
 <P>
     Defenders of AID make the point that another chance is due because
AID has been laboring under hopelessly burdensome and conflicting foreign
aid legislation. Indeed, the Vice President's report concluded that "AID does
not have a single, clearly defined and articulated strategic mission." The
report notes that AID's reinvention can succeed only if the Foreign
Assistance Act of 1961 (as amended) is replaced with comprehensive new
authorizing legislation.
<P>
     Yet AID struck out with its legislative reform effort. The Clinton's
Administration's Peace, Prosperity, and Democracy Act of 1994 was a
bureaucratic catch-all which did nothing to give AID a strong focus, never
mind a free-market development vision. Not surprisingly, it went nowhere
in the last Congress. So AID continues to operate without the reform
foundation everyone, including AID, realizes is desperately needed. Stated
bluntly, how can this committee in good faith continue to fund such an
operation?
<P>
     A trimmed down development aid program aimed at fostering free
markets around the world could be run out of the State Department, utilizing
its worldwide presence and achieving economies of scale. Any ESF could
be administered by such offices as the Under Secretary of State for Arms
Control and International Security Affairs and the State Department's
Bureau of Political and Military Affairs. 
<P>
 OPTION A AND B ($100 million savings). It has been estimated that if
AID were eliminated and its remaining functions folded into the State
Department, $100 million could be saved in overhead and administrative
costs.
<P>
CONCLUSION
  <P>   There should be no doubt that the foreign aid budget will be cut this
year. The only question is by how much. With that reality in mind, I have
combined the total savings from all the recommendations made in this
testimony into two budgetary options which I hope you will consider. They
are:
<P>     OPTION A ($2.58 billion savings). This option represents the
minimum amount which should be cut from this year's foreign aid budget.
Thus, we recommend reducing most bilateral development assistance
programs by 50 percent (for a total of $1.8 billion in savings for fiscal
1996) while trimming aid to Russia and the NIS by $200 million. The
bilateral development assistance reduction should be made in the following
programs: African Development Foundation; Development Assistance Fund;
Development Fund for Africa; Eastern Europe and Baltic programs; the
Inter-American Foundation; International Organizations; population control,
migration, and refugee programs. Moreover, we envision in this option
shrinking funding for multilateral development banks by 25 percent for a
total savings of $481 million. Finally, we propose a savings of $100 million
in administrative costs from abolishing AID.
  <P>  To assist you in deciding which countries should be cut in Option A,
we have supplied you with a list of aid recipients scoring poorly on the
Index of Economic Freedom. These are countries that received either a
"mostly unfree" or "repressed" score on the Index. Our judgment is that you
should scrutinize these countries very closely and consider them prime
candidates for reduction or outright elimination of funds. They should be at
the top of the list in your efforts to meet the 50 percent reduction target. 
<P>
     OPTION B ($5.67 billion savings). The new budget environment
may require that you consider more drastic reductions than outlined in
Option A. If this turns out to be the case, you can look to our Option B
menu of cuts. In this option nearly all development assistance aid is
eliminated ($3.6 billion in savings), including that for Russia and the NIS
($839 million in savings). The bilateral assistance programs affected would
be the African Development Foundation, the Development Assistance Fund,
the Development Fund for Africa, Eastern European and Baltic assistance,
population control, and other development programs. Also in this option is
a 50 percent drop in funding for the World Bank, the International Monetary
Fund, and other multilateral development banks for a total savings of $963
million. Moreover, this option includes a 50 percent reduction of economic
support funds for all countries except for Egypt and Israel ($167 million in
savings). Finally, $100 million would be saved by abolishing AID. Total
savings from this option would amount to $5.4 billion for fiscal 1996. 
<P>
     Whether you choose Option A or Option B, one thing is certain: the
budget for foreign aid should be reduced. At a time when America's
national security could be endangered because of shortfalls in defense
spending, it makes no sense to spend $2 billion to $3 billion a year on
development programs that do not produce economic growth and do not
serve the national interest. This money would be invested far more wisely
in reversing the decline of defense readiness or in funding the estimated
$100 billion shortfall in the Clinton Administration's five-year defense plan.
Why, because of falling pay, should America's servicemen and women have
to live on food stamps while AID funds population control programs in the
Third World? We need to reorder our priorities. We need a foreign aid
program that serves the national interest and promotes economic freedom
and economic growth.

<TITLE>Abolish The Wasteful Agency For International Development  -- Heritage </TITLE>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">

<CENTER><H3><I>ABOLISH THE WASTEFUL AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT </I></H3>
<P>

by Bryan T. Johnson <BR>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum #402<br>
January 27, 1995<P>
</CENTER><HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>
 
It is time to abolish the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID), the 
executive branch agency that administers most American foreign aid 
programs. AID has failed in its mission to promote economic development 
overseas. Despite billions of dollars spent on economic assistance, most of the
countries receiving U.S. development aid remained mired in poverty, 
repression, and dependence. In addition, AID lacks focus and, 
notwithstanding repeated attempts at reform, is poorly managed. Only a 
complete overhaul of America's foreign aid programs will make those 
programs more efficient and effective. 
<P>
To its credit, the Clinton Administration realizes that there is a serious 
problem with AID. Vice President Al Gore's September 1993 report, Creating 
a Government That Works Better and Costs Less, concludes that "AID does 
not have a single, clearly defined and articulated strategic mission." This 
conclusion has been reached by scores of commissions and independent 
studies. After two years and several reform attempts by Administrator J. Brian 
Atwood, including his Peace, Prosperity and Democracy Act of 1994, which 
failed to pass Congress, AID continues to be notable for its fuzzy mission, 
poor management, waste, and fraud. 
<P>
AID's failures cannot be papered over by folding it into the State Department, 
as some in the Clinton Administration were advocating this week. Abolishing 
AID by moving its functions to another bureaucracy offers little chance of 
significant reform in the way the U.S. designs, distributes, and spends nearly 
$14 billion in foreign aid dollars each year. U.S. policymakers should abolish 
the agency altogether, along with most of its functions. 
<P>
The best way to determine which AID functions should be saved and which 
should be abolished is to examine critically the purposes and effectiveness of 
U.S. foreign aid programs rather than the programmatic effectiveness or even 
managerial efficiency of any given bureau. These programs should be cut or 
eliminated based on their own merits. If, after this analysis, a program is 
retained, it should be administered by an existing office within an existing 
agency. Under no circumstances should a new bureaucracy be created inside 
the State Department or any other agency to accommodate programs spun off 
from an abolished AID. 
<P>
Once AID is eliminated, some foreign aid programs will still exist. Military 
and security assistance programs, for example, are administered primarily by 
the Department of Defense and should be retained for national security 
reasons. So, too, should military and security aid to Israel and Egypt. 
Although economic support funds for these two countries do nothing to 
promote economic development -- in fact, they may actually harm their 
economies -- an argument can be made that they should be continued in order 
to demonstrate political support for the Middle East peace process. If 
Congress deems Israeli and Egyptian aid necessary for national security 
reasons, lawmakers should rename it "Security Supporting Assistance," which 
is what it was called before 1978 when it was renamed Economic Support 
Funds (ESF). Once AID is abolished, these programs could be administered 
by such offices as the Under Secretary for Arms Control and International 
Security Affairs and the Bureau of Political and Military Affairs. 
<P>
There are, however, two broad areas of foreign assistance that should be cut 
back drastically or eliminated entirely, as should the AID bureaucracies which 
have administered them. These programs are: 
<P>
Economic Development Assistance. According to AID, Development 
Assistance funds are intended to promote economic growth in less developed 
countries. AID spent nearly $2.1 billion on development assistance projects in 
FY 1994. Since 1946, the U.S. has given nearly $265 billion in development 
assistance to foreign countries. Yet there is scant evidence that this aid has 
propelled many countries into the developed world. The late AID 
Administrator Alan Woods was right when he argued in his 1989 study, 
Development in the National Interest, that "Where development has worked, 
and is working, the key has been economic growth. And this is largely the 
result of individual nations making the right policy choices and making the 
most of their internal human and material resources." 
<P>
The keys to economic development are free markets and free trade. Whether 
aid promotes or fails to promote them should be the fundamental criterion for 
economic assistance. The Index of Economic Freedom published by The 
Heritage Foundation provides such a criterion. The Index uses ten economic 
factors to grade the level of economic freedom in a given country. Countries 
with high levels of freedom have established the necessary economic system 
for achieving sustainable levels of economic growth. Countries with low 
levels of economic freedom still have systems in which government impedes 
economic growth. Sending development assistance to these countries would 
be a waste. The U.S. should adopt the Index as a tool to determine which 
countries are most likely to benefit from foreign aid and which ones are most 
likely to waste it. 
<P>
Once this is done, much U.S. economic assistance would be cut. It would be 
impossible to justify maintaining all of the nearly $4 billion a year in U.S. 
economic aid if the criteria in the Index were applied. As much as $2 billion a
year could be trimmed from AID's budget alone. As these funds were 
eliminated, so, too, could the supporting AID and related overseas offices be 
abolished. This would lead to a substantial reduction in bureaucracy which 
need not be moved to the State Department or any other governmental 
agency. 
<P>
P.L. 480 Food Aid. Given the major agricultural reform bill coming before 
Congress this session, as well as requirements that the U.S. reduce agricultura
subsidies as part of recent free trade agreements, Congress should eliminate 
one of America's largest agricultural subsidy programs: the so-called P.L. 480 
programs aimed at providing food to impoverished countries. All too often, 
by depressing prices, this aid ruins the local food market of the very people i
is intended to help. While some of its functions may be maintained under an 
"emergency food relief program" administered by the State Department or 
other departments, most of the $1 billion spent annually on emergency aid 
and agricultural development could be eliminated. So, too, should the AID 
supporting bureaucracy. 
<P>
AID has failed in its mission to promote economic growth in less developed 
countries. There is little correlation between foreign aid spending and 
economic growth. Rather, the evidence shows that those countries which have 
graduated from the depths of poverty and into the developed world did so by 
creating the economic freedom that is necessary for expanding economies. 
<P>
When he introduced AID in the early 1960s, President John Kennedy said it 
should be seen as a temporary transitional agency. AID never was intended to 
make the developing world dependent on international welfare. It is time for 
Congress to abolish AID and transfer whatever useful functions remain to the 
State Department.

<P>

The February 7 arrest of Ramzi Yousef, suspected mastermind of the
February 1993 World Trade Center bombing, has underscored the global
reach of terrorist networks and the need for stepped-up international
cooperation in combating terrorism. Yousef, who fled the United States only
hours after the most devastating terrorist attack ever perpetrated on
American soil, had been extremely active prior to his arrest. The mysterious
27-year-old was implicated in a terrorist bombing of an airliner in the
Philippines in December, a plot to assassinate Pope John Paul II in January,
and an aborted attempt to bomb an American airliner in Thailand earlier this
month. 
<P>
     Yousef's ability to escape arrest and cross international borders
undetected repeatedly for two years indicates that he had extensive help in
many different countries. His considerable financial resources, large supply
of false documents, and access to safe houses, explosives, local assistance,
and information about his planned targets in far-flung regions of the world
suggest that he enjoyed the backing of a well-organized network, and
possibly a state sponsor. Significantly, the U.S. government now is
reexamining the possibility that a terrorist state was behind the World Trade
Center bombing.
<P>
     President Bill Clinton has hailed Yousef's arrest as an important
victory in the war against terrorism. But the President deserves little credit.
In fact, Yousef's arrest occurred in spite of the efforts of the Clinton
Administration. For example, Yousef's arrest in Pakistan was made possible
by an informant motivated by a $2 million reward offered by the U.S.
government for information leading to Yousef's capture. Yet the
Administration initially refused to offer a reward in the case of the World
Trade Center bombing, arguing that it was an act of domestic terrorism and
therefore not eligible for the International Terrorist Information Reward
program. The Administration eventually relented under considerable
congressional pressure and offered the reward in July 1993, almost five
months after the bombing.
<P>
     Yousef's apprehension and rapid extradition from Pakistan can be
attributed to close coordination among the State Department, Justice
Department, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Central Intelligence
Agency. This coordination and the close cooperation between the U.S. and
Pakistan were mainly a function of the State Department's Office of
Counterterrorism. However, the Clinton Administration had planned to
downgrade this office and fold it into a new Bureau for Narcotics,
Terrorism, and Crime. In addition, the Coordinator for Counterterrorism was
to be reduced in rank from the current equivalent status of an Assistant
Secretary of State to the level of a Deputy Assistant Secretary. Congress
temporarily blocked this reorganization scheme in April 1994 by passing an
amendment to the State Department authorization bill sponsored by
Representative Benjamin Gilman (R-NY). 
<P>
     Trying to reassert leadership on terrorism issues, the Administration
introduced legislation on February 10 to bolster U.S. deterrence of terrorism
and to punish those who aid and abet terrorists. The Omnibus
Counterterrorism Act of 1995 will outlaw fundraising in the United States
in support of terrorist activities overseas, expedite the deportation of alien
terrorists, and make international terrorism committed in the U.S. a federal
crime. This legislation is a long-overdue step in the right direction. But it
focuses primarily on domestic and legal aspects of the war against terrorism.
Ramzi Yousef's arrest is an important reminder that international efforts are
a key ingredient in fighting terrorism.
<P>
     The critical challenge facing U.S. counterterrorism policy is putting
relentless pressure on the states that sponsor terrorism -- Cuba, Iraq, Libya,
North Korea, Syria, Sudan, and particularly Iran, the chief supporter of
international terrorism in the world today. This is an opportune time to
ratchet up the pressure because Iran and other state sponsors of terrorism are
economically weak and diplomatically isolated. But the Administration has
not followed through on its tough rhetoric on terrorism. It has not given up
on plans to downgrade the State Department's Office of Counterterrorism,
for example, and continues to woo Syria despite Syria's continued support
of more than a dozen terrorist groups.
<P>
     Congress has an opportunity to strengthen U.S. counterterrorism
policy above and beyond the legislative proposals the Administration is
pushing. To do so, Congress should:
<P>
Press the Administration to make counterterrorism a higher priority in
American foreign policy. Congress should force the Administration to drop
its short-sighted plan to downgrade the State Department's Office of
Counterterrorism, which spearheads international efforts in combating
terrorism. The Gilman amendment, which bars the Administration from
downgrading the office, expires on April 30, 1995. Representative Gilman
has introduced H.R. 22, a bill to preserve the office on a permanent basis
and elevate the Coordinator of Counterterrorism to the status of an
Ambassador at Large, as was the case in the Reagan Administration. Senator
Alfonse D'Amato (R-NY) introduced a similar bill in the Senate. Congress
also should press the Administration to raise the issue of terrorism in every
appropriate bilateral and multilateral diplomatic contact, including the annual
G-7 summits. A series of congressional hearings on new trends in
international terrorism would help to highlight the threat of terrorism and the
urgency of fighting it. Another vital topic for congressional hearings is
investigating strategies for blocking the efforts of terrorist states such as
Iran, Iraq, and Libya to obtain weapons of mass destruction. A nuclear-
armed Iran or Iraq could pose the ultimate terrorist threat.
<P>
Reform immigration laws to improve internal security. Congress should pass
legislation that enables the U.S. government to deny visas to foreigners
because of their membership in terrorist groups. Right now, would-be
terrorists are denied entry only if the government can prove that they
already have committed terrorist acts or that they intend to commit such
acts. These rules are too lax and should be strengthened. Moreover, tougher
penalties should be imposed on the production or use of fraudulent passports
and visas, including giving the government the power to seize the assets of
criminals convicted of creating or using false documents for terrorism or
drug smuggling. Nine of the original 35 indictable counts in the 1993 New
York bombing plots involved visa or passport offenses.
<P>
Punish states that support terrorism on as many fronts as possible. The U.S.
must work with its allies to raise the diplomatic, economic, political, and
military costs of supporting terrorism so high that they outweigh the
strategic benefits. Although the Administration has singled out Iran as the
world's most dangerous state sponsor of terrorism, it has not succeeded in
persuading its allies, particularly Japan and Germany, to levy economic
sanctions against Tehran. In part, this is because American oil companies
have become Iran's biggest customers, buying about $4.2 billion dollars of
Iranian oil annually to supply their overseas markets. Although imports of
Iranian oil into the U.S. are prohibited, the Clinton Administration has
declined to ban U.S. companies from purchasing Iranian oil for their
overseas markets. This business-as-usual approach undermines American
diplomatic efforts to isolate Iran and to raise the cost of its continued
support of terrorism. Congress should consider passing legislation banning
American oil companies from purchasing Iranian oil and should call upon
U.S. allies to do the same as long as Iran supports Hezbollah, Hamas, and
other terrorist organizations.
 <P>
 Ensure that impending budget cuts do not undermine the war against
terrorism. Congressional appropriations committees must take care to avoid
weakening the organizations crucial to America's defenses against terrorism
-- particularly the counterterrorism efforts of the intelligence community, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, the State Department's Office of
Counterterrorism, and the Defense Department's Special Operations
Command. The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control,
which is responsible for implementing the U.S. government's freeze on the
financial assets of terrorist groups, also should receive a high priority in
budget deliberations. It also is important to reverse the decline in the budget
of the Counterterrorism Research and Development program, which helps
develop new means of detecting explosives, among other things. Cutting
such programs not only would jeopardize the nation's security, but would
be penny-wise and pound-foolish. The World Trade Center bombing, which
resulted in six deaths and over 1,000 casualties, triggered over $600 million
in economic losses. 
<P>
 Assist the governments of Lebanon and Afghanistan to restore order and
expel international terrorists. Civil wars exacerbated by foreign interventions
have enabled terrorist groups to operate with impunity from bases in both
of these countries. Ramzi Yousef and several other terrorists involved in the
World Trade Center bombing had extensive contacts with radical Afghan
Islamic groups. Congress should hold hearings to determine ways in which
the U.S. can assist the weak central governments in both countries to
dismantle and expel terrorist groups.
<P>
     The war against terrorism requires concerted international efforts
which only the U.S. can lead. But the Clinton Administration does not
appear willing or able to exercise the leadership necessary to mobilize the
international community decisively against terrorism. This makes it all the
more important that Congress take steps to combat international terrorism,
which looms as one of the greatest challenges to U.S. security in the 1990s.

<html><title>Clinton Blows Smoke Over Foreign Aid Cuts -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><H3><I>CLINTON BLOWS SMOKE OVER FOREIGN AID CUTS</H3></I>
By Thomas P. Sheehy<br>
Jay Kingham Fellow in International Regulatory Affairs<br>
Executive Memorandum No. 416<br>
June 7, 1995<br>
</center><hr size =3 width = 30%>
<P>
	The U.S. Agency for International Development (AID) and its allies are pulling out all the stops in their fight against congressional foreign aid cuts and the reorganization of the foreign policy bureaucracy. AID Administrator Brian Atwood and other Clinton Administration officials have resorted to tagging as "isolationists" those critical of the status quo, including supporters of the American Overseas Interests Act (H.R. 1561). Yet the U.S. foreign aid program, particularly development aid, is riddled with wasteful projects that benefit only the AID bureaucracy and outside contractors. Administration officials have never explained how failed development aid programs demonstrate foreign policy credibility.
<P>
	Cutting Time. Congress is sure to reject the Administration's request for increased foreign aid spending for 1996. Instead, it will reduce foreign aid from its 1995 level of $13.7 billion. President Clinton, vowing to reject such cuts, threatens to veto H.R. 1561, which trims $2.8 billion from the Administration's proposed $21.6 billion overall foreign affairs budget. H.R. 1561 reduces development aid by some $800 million and abolishes AID, moving its functions into the State Department. 
<p>
	The Administration's response is an orchestrated campaign to "tar" those seeking to cut and revamp foreign aid as isolationists. National Security Adviser Anthony Lake calls supporters of the House bill "back door isolationists," his epithet for critics of the Administration's foreign aid policies. Atwood, whose AID faces long-overdue extinction, says that would-be foreign aid cutters are "playing with fire."
<p>
	Notwithstanding Atwood's alarmist rhetoric, AID has been known for years for its inefficiency and wasteful spending. Indeed, previous administrations, repeatedly but unsuccessfully, have tried to reform AID. Atwood himself once recognized the problem. Upon taking office, he described AID as a "disaster" and quickly volunteered it for "reinvention" under Vice President Al Gore's National Performance Review. Administrator Atwood has made much of his reforms in trying to fend off legislative efforts to abolish AID.
<p>
	Reform efforts have been hamstrung, however. The Vice President's review recognized that AID's reinvention could not succeed if new foreign aid authorization legislation was not secured. The Administration's foreign aid "reinvention legislation" failed in the last Congress. AID's legislative agenda today is different. In the Agency's own words, its bureaucrats seek to "delay, postpone, obfuscate, derail" congressional reform efforts.
<p>
	Delaying reform will result only in a continuation of AID's notorious waste and inefficiency. AID employs over 9,200 full-time employees and contractors at a cost of more than $600 million annually and has 998 foreign service officers stationed overseas at a cost of between $150,000 and $300,000 per employee -- not including salary. By contrast, the German and British development agencies have 27 and 47 overseas staff, respectively. Former Secretary of State James Baker was right when he said that "AID's only useful purpose is to serve as a standard for inefficiency for other agencies to avoid."  But the agency's heaviest burden is defending its work. 
<P>
	AID Pork. There is no evidence that foreign aid is instrumental in promoting economic growth. More often, it is destructive. Sometimes it is simply wasted. Consider the following: 
<P>
<ul><li>A U.S. group called Development Associates, Inc., performed an AID contract to study the Agency's own evaluation studies -- i.e., a study to study AID's studies.
<P>
<li>A U.S. company called Planning & Development Collaborative International contracted with AID to sponsor a 1993 study tour in the U.S. for the Romanian Union of Architects. AID never explained how acquainting Romanians with American architecture helps Romania develop a free-market economy. 
<P>
<li>Four organizations collaborated to perform an AID contract worth over $2 million which culminated in a study of "ecotourism" in Central America that includes a section on "the cultural and socioeconomic impacts of tourism" and a list that ranks "the desirability of native fauna for the tourist industry by marketing value and observation satisfaction."  American tourists are better equipped than AID-contracted experts to determine their level of "observation satisfaction" when touring Central America.
<P>
<li>The Academy for Educational Development of Washington, D.C., in 1993 undertook a study for AID of how Indonesian health workers can improve their interpersonal communication skills. One recommendation of this study: to conduct further study. 
<P>
<LI>Chemonics International of Washington, D.C., has a multiyear contract with AID worth nearly $2 million to spearhead a project "that promotes [throughout the world] public awareness and support for environmental policies and practices by changing individual behavior, institutional activities, and governmental approaches."  AID never explains why it is worth $2 million to the American taxpayer to conduct an environmentalist public relations campaign in the Third World.
<P>
<li>AID is planning to award a $1.3 million contract to supply street lamps to the city of Moscow at the same time the Russian government is spending more than $1 billion to make war on the people of Chechnya.
<P></ul>
	AID has spent hundreds of billions of dollars on junkets for university professors, studies that gather dust, and other efforts that are irrelevant to promoting economic growth. At best, development aid can make a marginal contribution to encouraging the free-market transitions responsible for economic growth. The programs listed above do not pass even this low standard of success.
<P>
	Spreading the Pork. Aware of its weak hand, AID has been playing the pork game. In fighting for survival, it has made a virtue of the fact that it spends the taxpayers' dollars at home. Atwood recently noted, "Now, fully 79 percent of the USAID procurement budget, spent to purchase goods and services essential to USAID development work, is spent here in the U.S."  AID has been rallying its American beneficiaries to lobby against foreign aid cuts.
<P>
	Many of AID's American contractors are only marginally "private," being heavily dependent upon AID for support. In essence, they are quasi-government agencies. Some are havens for former AID employees adept at pulling the procurement strings. And like AID, many contractors suffer from large overhead. For example, the U.S. Ambassador to Chad noted in an April report to the Secretary of State that U.S. development aid to that African country "was spent mainly on overhead, expensive contractors and consultants, and had little impact except to develop the culture of dependency which is part of the problem."  Congress should resist the temptation to look at development aid as serving a domestic constituency.
<P>
	The real isolationists are not those looking to eliminate wasteful foreign aid projects. The real neglect of America's international interests comes from those who engineer reckless defense cuts and trade wars with allies like Japan. These are the great issues of the day upon which isolationist reputations will be made -- not whether Washington spends a couple of billion dollars less on wasteful development aid and abolishes a hopelessly inefficient AID bureaucracy. When it comes to foreign aid, it is the Clinton Administration that not only is "playing with fire" but blowing smoke.

<title> Town Hall Launch</title>

<h2>Town Hall Launch</h2>
June 29, 1995
</center>
<p>
<hr size="3" width="45%">
<p>
<b>Tim Butler</b>: About four years ago <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Ed Feulner</a> had an idea.  Now there is nothing new there, but he understood that a new emerging on-line technology was going to have a tremendous impact on the way America and the world communicates.  He also understood that the conservative movement must embrace
 these new communications opportunities.  The result of that is Town Hall.  Today Town Hall moves into a new dimension, the Internet.  And I'm very pleased to introduce the man behind the dream, Dr. Edwin J. Feulner, Jr., Town Hall's Chairman of the Board.
<p>
<b>Ed Feulner</b>: Thanks very much Tim, for that very nice introduction.  I appreciate it.  I'm very pleased to have with me my colleague from the Town Hall Board of Directors, Ed Capanno whose real job is publisher of <a href="/nationalreview/welcome.html"><i>National Review</i></a>.  Town Hall, from its very beginning, has been a joint project of <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a> and <i>National Review</i>.  And Ed, it's been a great learning curb for us, certainly, and we've been through a lot, but I think today bears witness to the fact that it has been worth working at.
<p>
 We are here today to officially launch Town Hall, the first conservative community on the Internet.  Like most communities, Town Hall has been created to serve people.  To provide an innovative site for political discourse and dialogue -- an international electronic center where new ideas and policies can be debated and studied by anyone who's interested.
<p>
 And Town Hall will use the technology of the Information Age -- the Internet -- to create this community of literally millions of people around the world.
<p>
Two hundred years ago, people concerned about the direction of their government and committed to the ideals of freedom and liberty, joined together to talk and argue, to dream and debate radical new ideas to make their lives and the lives of their families, their children, and their communities better.  In that respect, Town Hall will be no different.
<p>
I am very proud that the Heritage Foundation and National Review, together, created Town Hall as the conservative meeting place on the Internet, and I am equally proud that, through Town Hall, will continue to play a part in the Second Great American Revolution that has swept Washington and the halls of Congress like a great whirlwind.  Today, we have with us, the Revolution's two great generals in this extraordinary battle of ideas.
<p>
 From the Senate, we have Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, who continues to fight for America's families after a lifetime of commitment to his country.  In war and in peace, Bob Dole is and always will be a national leader -- a man of action and a man of accomplishment.
<p>
On the House front, everything <a href="http://www.house.gov/mbr_dir/GA06.html">Newt Gingrich</a> does shows how deeply he cares about his country and the hopes and dreams of its people.  He is a man of endless ideas whose extraordinary leadership has literally changed the course of history.
<p>
 We stand here in the shadow of the Capitol -- at one end of a long continuum -- a continuum that began
 with the goosefeather pen of Thomas Paine and reaches across time to the computers that sit here on this stage.  I can't think of anyone better to launch this historic connection than these two men -- leading the charge to preserve the Founding Fathers' great legacy of freedom.  Please join me in welcoming Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich.
<p>
Gentlemen, thank you both for joining us.  We're honored to have you here.  Before I ask you to take a seat at the controls, I want to bring out another special guest we are privileged to have with us today.  Just to make sure that the Founding Fathers would have approved, we've been able to produce someone who ought to know.  Please welcome in his 290th year, the father of invention and innovation, the Honorable Benjamin Franklin.
<p>
Senator Dole, Mr. Speaker will you each take a seat at the keyboards and Mr. Franklin, will you do the honors, please?
<p>
<b>Benjamin Franklin</b>: Let it be known that on this, the 29th day of June in the year of our Lord one thousand
  nine hundred and ninety-five, we open wide the doors of Town Hall in a spirit of experiment and good
  will; to preserve liberty and prevent tyranny, and to seek change in the principles, opinions, sentiments and affections of the people as we share in the progress of human knowledge.  Gentlemen, on the count of  three.... one ... two ... three ... start your engines.
<p>
<b>Ed Feulner</b>: Alright!  Town Hall is officially launched!
<p>
Thank you very much, Senator Dole, Mr. Speaker and, of course, you too Mr. Franklin.  Thomas Jefferson would be proud.  It is now my happy duty to introduce you to the charter members of Town Hall -- America's leading conservative organizations who vision and creativity have spurred them to join in this innovative effort.  I'm very please to welcome them to the Town Hall Community.
<p>
As I introduce their representatives, we will all get a look at each group's site as it will appear in Town Hall on big screen.
<p>
<ul>
<li>First, please welcome, <a href="/conservative/kbio.html">David Keene</a>, Chairman of the <a href="/conservative/welcome.html">American Conservative Union</a>.
<li>Next, Shades of the Boston Tea Party, is Grover Norquist, President of <a href="/atr/1.html">Americans for Tax Reform</a>.
<li>It is a great pleasure to welcome Charlie Kupperman Executive Director of <a href="/empower/welcome.html ">Empower America</a>.
<li><a href="/townhall/FRC/bauer.html">Gary Bauer</a>, President of the <a href="/townhall/FRC/welcome.html">Family Research Council</a>.  Welcome aboard, Gary.
<li>Representing <a href="/lead-inst/home.html">The Leadership Institute</a>, William Forrest, its Vice President.
<li>The Executive Director of the <a href="/taxcom/welcome.html.cgi">National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform</a>, Grace-Marie Arnett, unfortunately is unable to attend.
<li>We are delighted to also have with us, <a href="/nmp/home.html">National Minority Politics</a> and its distinguished publisher,<a href="/nmp/i-col.html"> Willie Richardson</a>.

<li><a href="/yaf/home.html">The Young America's Foundation's</a>, <a href="/yaf/sharp.html">Michelle Sharp</a>, Director of Lectures, is here.
<li>And Finally, my colleague -- <a href="/heritage/staff/truluck.htm">Phil Truluck</a>, the Executive Vice President of <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>.
</ul>
<p>
As Tim said, it's a great starting line-up, but only the beginning of a conservative community.  We thank  you all for being here today.  I would now like to give you all an opportunity to hear from our two  wonderful leaders here today.  It is truly an honor for me to first introduce to you the great Speaker of the House of Representatives -- the Honorable Newt Gingrich.

<b>Senator Dole</b>: Thank you very much.  It's a privilege for me to be here, and a privilege to see Ben Franklin again.  He was just telling me about his childhood with Senator Thurmond.  But Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, and the rest of our founding fathers probably never imagined the
 technology that produced the computer age, and the Internet.  But one thing they did imagine -- a
 government closer to the people; a government that listened to the people, and a public that took active
 involvement in the issues today, and that is what Town Hall is all about.  Thanks to Town Hall, Americans are into the information age and the super-highway to take a detour around the traditional media road blocks.  And I am just one of countless Americans, who will be taking a right on the information highway, and heading straight for Town Hall.<p><hr>

<img alt="Picture of Speaker Gingrich" src="gingrich.jpg"><p>


<b>Speaker Gingrich</b></a>: I want to say first of all that I am delighted to be here.  I was explaining to Senator Dole that last night we pretended we were the Senate.  And we ran all night, and we're not use to this, we didn't get out till almost ten o'clock this morning.  He's used to these kind of marathons where you have to go all the time, but we're not quite that tough.  I'm a little blurry eyed, but delighted to be here.  I believe this is part of entering the information age, I think that this is a very important commitment to reach out and to allow literally people around the entire planet to be able to interact, have ideas, to have dialogues, to know
what's going on.  And to contribute good ideas.  And I'm just delighted that Ed Feulner brought all of us
together here today, to participate in creating Town Hall, and I can tell you from our stand point we look
forward to having lots of Americans, and frankly lots of people all across the world, to share with us their
ideas and their comments, and then to work with the various groups who will have their pages on this site.  We're very grateful, and I'm delighted to behalf of the House Republicans to be here to help inaugurate this.<p><br>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<img alt="The Classic Kirk " src="kirkclas.gif" align="right">For more than forty years, Russell Kirk was in the thick of the intellectual controversies of our time. Both 
<i>Time</i> and <i>Newsweek</i> have described him as one of America's leading thinkers. He is the author of some 
twenty-nine books and of hundreds of periodical essays; also of many short stories.
<p>
Dr. Kirk wrote and spoke on modern culture, political thought and practice, educational theory, literary 
criticism, ethical questions, and social themes. He addressed audiences on nearly five hundred American 
campuses and also appeared often on television and radio.
<p>
He was editor of the educational quarterly journal <i>The University Bookman</i> and was founder and first 
editor of the quarterly <i>Modern Age.</i> He contributed to numerous serious periodicals on either side of the 
Atlantic. For a quarter of a century he wrote a page on education for <i>National Review,</i> and for thirteen 
years published, through the Los Angeles Times Syndicate, a nationally-syndicated newspaper column. 
Over the years he contributed to more than a hundred serious periodicals in the United States, Britain, 
Canada, Australia, Austria, Germany, Italy, Spain, Bulgaria, and Poland, among them <i>Sewanee Review, 
Yale Review, Fortune, Humanitas, The Contemporary Review, The Journal of the History of Ideas, World 
Review, Crisis, History Today, Policy Review, Commonweal, Kenyon Review, The Review of Politics, </i>
and <i>The World and I.</i>
<p>
Dr. Kirk was president of the Wilbur Foundation; president of The Educational Reviewer, Inc.; 
editor of <i>The Library of Conservative Thought</i> for Transaction Books; and from time to time distinguished 
visiting professor at various universities and liberal-arts colleges in the disciplines of history, political 
thought, humane letters, and journalism.
<p>
He is the only American to hold the highest arts degree (earned) of the senior Scottish university - doctor of 
letters of St. Andrews. He received his bachelor's degree from Michigan State University and his master's 
degree from Duke University. Honorary doctorates were conferred upon him by twelve American 
universities and colleges.
<p>
<img alt="Gothic Kirk" src="kirkgoth.gif" align="left">He was a Guggenheim Fellow, a senior fellow of the American Council of Learned Societies, a 
Constitutional Fellow of the National Endowment for the Humanities, and a Fulbright Lecturer in Scotland. 
The Christopher Award was conferred upon him for his book <i>Eliot and His Age, </i>and he received the Ann 
Radcliffe Award of the Count Dracula Society for his Gothic Fiction; the Third World Fantasy Convention 
gave him its award for the best short fiction. In 1984 he received the Weaver Award of the Ingersoll Prizes 
for his scholarly writing. For several years he has been a Distinguished Scholar of the Heritage Foundation. 
In 1989, President Reagan conferred on him the Presidential Citizens Medal. In 1991, he was awarded the 
Salvatori Prize for historical writing.
<p>
More than a million copies of his books have been sold, and several have been translated into German, 
Spanish, Dutch, Korean, and other languages. His second book, <i>The Conservative Mind </i>(1953), was one of 
the most widely reviewed and discussed studies of political ideas in this century and has gone through 
seven editions. Seventeen of his books are in print at present, and he has written prefaces to many other 
books, contributed essays to them, or edited them.
<p>


Dr. Kirk debated with such well-known speakers as Norman Thomas, Frank Mankiewicz, Carey 
McWilliams, John Roche, Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., Michael Harrington, Max Lerner, Michael Novak, 
Sidney Lens, William Kunstler, Hubert Humphrey, F. A. Hayek, Karl Hess, Clifford Case, Ayn Rand, 
Eugene McCarthy, Leonard Weinglass, Louis Lomax, Harold Taylor, Clark Kerr, Saul Alinsky, Staughton 
Lynd, Malcolm X, Dick Gregory, and Tom Hayden. Several of his public lectures have been broadcast 
nationally on C-Span.
<p>
<img alt="Kirk and Buckley" src="kirkbuck.gif" align="right">Among Kirk's literary and scholarly friends have been T. S. Eliot, Roy Campbell, Wyndham Lewis, 
Donald Davidson, George Scott Moncrieff, Richard Weaver, Max Picard, Ray Bradbury, Bernard Iddings 
Bell, Paul Roche, James McAuley, Thomas Howard, Wilhelm Roepke, Robert Speaight, Anthony 
Kerrigan, Robert Nisbet, Malcolm Muggeridge, Flannery O'Connor, William F. Buckley, Jr., Andrew 
Lytle, Henry Regnery, Robert Graves, and Cleanth Brooks.
<p>
<img alt="Young Kirk" src="kirkyng.gif" align="right">Born near the railroad yards at Plymouth, Michigan, in 1918, Kirk lived at his ancestral place, named Piety 
Hill, in Mecosta, Michigan - a little village in the stump-country. There he converted a toy factory into his 
library and office. His Italianate house is adorned with sculpture and architectural antiques snatched from 
the maws of the urban renewers of western Michigan. At home he was a famous narrator of ghostly tales, 
many of them picked up during his travels (often afoot) in Scotland and Ireland, Mediterranean and Alpine 
lands, and Africa.<p>

<img alt="Kirk and Annette" src="kirkfam.gif" align = "left">
For nearly thirty years he was married to Annette Yvonne Cecile Courtemanche; they have four daughters. 
Their tall house often was crowded with Asiatic, African, and European refugees and exiles; also with 
university students, travellers from antique lands, and a congeries of fugitives from Progress. In 
conjunction with the Intercollegiate Studies Institute and the Wilbur Foundation, Russell and Annette Kirk 
held frequent seminars at their residence and received several literary interns every year. Annette Kirk was 
an active member of the National Commission on Excellence in Education; she organizes the Piety Hill 
Seminars, and is managing editor of <i>The University Bookman.</i>

 
<p>
Additional information about him may be found in <i>Contemporary Authors, Who's Who in the World, 
Who's Who in America, Who's Who in the Midwest, International Scholars Directory, The Directory of 
American Scholars,</i> and other biographical directories. Chapters about his writings and his life may be 
found in Henry Regnery's <i>Memoirs of a Dissident Publisher,</i> John East's <i>The American Conservative 
Movement,</i> and M. E. Bradford's <i>A Better Guide Than Reason.</i>
<p>
The definitive work on Russell Kirk's life can be found in his own autobiography, <i>The Sword of 
Imagination,</i> available now through Eerdsmans Publishing.
<p>
<i>Russell Kirk: a Bibliography,</i> 1981; illustrations. Compiled by Charles Brown, with an essay by Henry 
Regnery. Mount Pleasant, Michigan: Clarke Historical Library, Central Michigan University. Distributed 
by Intercollegiate Studies Institute. $5.00 hardcover.

<P>
Our friend Russell Kirk, &quot;The Wizard of Mecosta,&quot; seemed
an ill-suited visitor to Washington back in 1978. He was accompanied
by his loving wife Annette, and he shared with a packed auditorium
some of the truths that made his published works so powerful and
so influential.
<P>
Then sixty years old, Russell Kirk was not a newcomer to Washington,
and yet he was certainly not a part of this unreal, political
place.
<P>
Despite his visits here in subsequent years, Russell Kirk was
always more comfortable surrounded by his family and his books
in Mecosta. He was at home among inquisitive students on one of
the college campuses where he held visiting appointments or where
he lectured.
<P>
Despite his discomfort, however, he made a real impact on Washington.
In a city of constant change, Kirk reminded opinion leaders, journalists,
legislators and staffers of prudence and of taking the long view.
<P>
It was at an I.S.I.-sponsored seminar, more than thirty years
ago over the Christmas holidays, that I first met Dr. Kirk. He
was already a fixed star in the conservative firmament. Although
he has described himself in those days as &quot;roly-poly and
benign,&quot; all of us students were in awe of him.
<P>
Had we known that he was an occasional eater of beaver and an
habitual smoker of &quot;dark, thick,&quot; Burmese cigars, &quot;looking
and tasting . . . Like torpedoes,&quot; we probably would have
addressed him with even greater trepidation. Yet, as he talked
with a small group of us on that frosty night in Detroit I could
not project that twenty years later Russell Kirk would be a Heritage
Distinguished Fellow and that three of his books would be based
on lectures that he first delivered here.
<P>
Over the years, Russell's Washington lecture themes would include
natural law, the prospects for conservatives, and individual rights.
They are masterpieces of clear thought and eternal truth.
<P>
These volumes and his other works mean that Russell Kirk's influence
in Washington will continue to be far greater than many
of the transient politicians who descend upon this city, cycle
after cycle.
<P>
As a back row observer at his soirees for the last sixteen years,
I never ceased to be amazed by the inevitable overflow crowd of
young people who couldn't get enough of him.
<P>
I asked one of them what his hold was on them. Her reply: &quot;I
had only admired him from afar and, of course, reading his books
at my university was not politically correct.&quot; Or, as a young
Reagan appointee said, &quot;He taught us all why our role was
important beyond ourselves and beyond politics.&quot;
<P>
Russell Kirk's operating guide was prudence and what Patrick Henry
called &quot;the lamp of experience,&quot; which abhorred all
forms of ideology claiming some instant substitute for genuine
tradition, custom, and experience.
<P>
He often described himself as a &quot;Bohemian Tory.&quot; A Bohemian
Tory who adapted to his environment, whether this meant a humble
cellar, a rustic cabin, a city mansion, or one of the great country
houses of Europe.
<P>
From time to time here in Washington, Russell was entertained,
feted, or downright idolized. While he seemed to enjoy this, his
heart belonged to Mecosta.
<P>
Russell Kirk has left an indelible mark on us, on Washington,
and on our nation. Perhaps his words have more meaning for us
today because, as one of his friends, T.S. Eliot puts it:
<P>
&quot;The communication of the dead is tongued with fire beyond
the language of the living.&quot;

<P>
<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Gleaves Whitney<BR>
on behalf of <BR>
The Honorable John Engler, Governor of Michigan</CENTER></b>
<p>
 Russell
Kirk once wrote: &quot;Men are put into this world . . . to struggle,
to suffer, to contend against the evil that is in their neighbors
and in themselves, and to aspire toward the triumph of Love. They
are put into this world to live like men and to die like men.&quot;
<P>
By his own measure, Russell Kirk lived a robust and manly life,
and he died a noble and manly death.
<P>
Let it be said at the outset--without hesitation and without qualification--Russell
Kirk was a great man. His work will stand as one of the most significant
intellectual achievements of our time. That is because he understood
our time. Before his most famous book, <i>The Conservative Mind</i>,
was accepted for publication, Russell Kirk wrote a letter to Henry
Regnery, saying: This work is &quot;my contribution to our endeavor
to conserve the spiritual and intellectual and political tradition
of our civilization; and if we a e to rescue the modem mind we
must do it very soon . . .The struggle will be decided in the
minds of the rising generation.&quot;
<P>
There can be no doubt that Russell Kirk reached many minds-- and
touched many hearts--over the last four decades. His words coursed
over the continents and across the generations. He touched us
not just because of what he said, but how he said it. This &quot;Bohemian
Tory,&quot; this &quot;Canny Scot,&quot; possessed an excellent
ear for the language, and his readers felt all the force of his
personality in his prose.
<P>
And then there were the many personal qualities that endeared
Russell Kirk to us. He was a loyal friend and a faithful correspondent.
Who could forget his keen wit, those fantastic ghost stories,
and that mischievous twinkle in his eyes? He was devoted to his
family--a wonderful family so many of us have come to know: his
lovely wife Annette, their four beautiful daughters, his sons-in-law,
and the larger family. For years they have opened their arms to
us, as today we open our arms to them.
<P>
Russell Kirk had an uncommonly generous spirit--a spirit that
never flagged, but gave tirelessly. It is evident in his letters
and lectures, his books and conversation. Weakened though he was
toward the end of his life, Dr. Kirk's last public gesture was
to sign books from his bed, because he knew how much that would
mean to his readers
and friends. The last book he signed, just a week before his passing,
vas to Governor Engler.
<P>
Russell Kirk was very much a Michigan man--one of us. We can imagine
him as a young boy, reading historical adventures by the train
yards in Plymouth where his father worked. We can think of him
as a gifted teacher at his alma mater, Michigan State. We can
see him walking out of that drafty old library at Piety Hill and
turning down the road which leads to the woods.
<P>
Russell loved Michigan. Recently his heart made its final journey
back to the &quot;stump country&quot; that he called his ancestral
home, to return to the land that shaped him. But his spirit now
knows its true and eternal home. And the wisdom in his writings
will remain to help those of us still on this earthly pilgrimage.
Indeed, for generations to come, his words will find a resting
place wherever there is right reason, and wherever there is a
heart in search of the Permanent Things.
<P>
Today we mourn. We have lost a friend. Michigan has lost its preeminent
man of letter. America has lost one of the men who understood
her best. We mourn, but Russell would not want us to become too
melancholy this day. In the epilogue of his memoirs, which he
recently composed and which will be published next year, Russell
Kirk tells us that he lived a good life. At the age of seventy-five,
he says that what he sought in life had come down to three things.
<P>
First, he had sought to defend the Permanent Things -- truth, justice,
freedom, a tolerable moral order and in so doing he was more successful
than he thought would be possible at the outset of his career.
<P>
Second, he had sought to lead a life of decent independence, living
much as his ancestors had lived, on their land, in circumstances
that would enable him to utter the truth and make his voice heard:
a life uncluttered and unpolluted, not devoted to getting and
spending. This, he tells us, he had achieved as a man of letters
at Piety Hill.
<P>
Third, he had sought to marry for love and to rear children who
would come to know that the service of God is perfect freedom.
Words cannot express how filled with gratitude he was for Annette
and his children, who are endowed with the unbought grace of life.
In this, too, he had been wonderfully blessed.
<P>
To Russell Kirk, the three goals of his life had been reached,
and he was grateful. And we who are here today can be grateful
that we knew him, and that he walked a little distance with us
in our journey to our eternal home.

<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Pat Buchanan<BR>
Founder and Chairman <BR>
The American Cause</CENTER></b><p> We are here today to mourn the passing
of a wonderful friend, and to celebrate a great life, that of
Dr. Russell Kirk, Patriarch of Piety Hill, Sage of Mecosta, gentle
giant of American conservatism. And, I am proud and honored to
add, leader of the Buchanan Brigades in the Michigan primary of
'92.
<P>
In 1953, when Dr. Kirk's seminal work, The Conservative Mind,
appeared In a desert of liberal orthodoxy, it was celebrated,
not only here but across the West. For the wise men of the age
were aware something new had been born, a genuine conservative
movement, and Russell Kirk was its father. His was the spark that
set fire to the minds of so many of my generation.
<P>
For forty years, Dr. Kirk wrote his columns and commentaries,
essays, and stories, books and reviews- a treasure house of work
that now becomes part of the deposit of faith--of the cause in
which we believe. And his books will be read and reread and cherished,
when most of what his contemporaries published is long since forgotten.
Why?
<P>
Because Russell Kirk wrote not only for his time, but for all
time. He was the custodian, the caretaker of &quot;The Permanent
Things&quot;, the eternal truths that do not change. All his life
he wielded his pen to expose the false gods of modernity, and
in particular, the false god of ideology.
<P>
To Dr. Kirk, ideology, whether of Left or Right, was something
that took possession of a soul that was empty. &quot;Ideology,&quot;
he wrote, &quot;provides sham religion . . . comforting in its
way to those who have lost or never have known genuine religious
faith.&quot;
<P>
When Dr. Kirk discovered this heresy in the camp of the saints,
he used a needle to winkle it out. A few years back when the ideology
of democracy was being exalted to the status of high dogma, he
wrote, &quot;A trouble with this civil-religion notion is that
the large majority of Americans think they already have a religion
of their own, not one cobbled up by some department in Washington.&quot;
<P>
When some great minds arose in our midst to declare The End of
History, Dr. Kirk merrily laughed. Because he knew more history
than all of them put together; and because he knew that the seedbed
of conflicts and war lay in the human heart, which is unchanged
and unchanging, save through grace.
<P>
As the presence here today of Russell Kirk's wife and four daughters
so beautifully testifies, Russell Kirk did not simply preach the
values of family and faith, he lived them. He not only wrote of
the search for truth, he persevered all his life; and when he
came upon the truth in the Roman Catholic Church, Russell Kirk
embraced it. This was a man, whole and entire, whose hierarchy
of values were in perfect order and synchronization, as are the
planets in God's heaven that circle the sun. And because his values
were in harmony, Dr. Kirk was one off the most genuinely, visibly
happy men I have ever met.
<P>
I recall the last time we met, in Philadelphia near midnight for
a drink after a speech; Annette and Dr. Kirk invited me out to
Piety Hill, to see the library in which he took such joy.
<P>
And, upon occasion, Dr. Kirk would undertake my instruction.
<P>
After listening to me propound the latest economic nostrum for
America's ills, this gentle teacher sent me a slim book that contained
his own introduction: &quot;I have regarded with some suspicion
many practitioners of the Dismal Science,&quot; Dr. Kirk had written.
&quot;I have found economists a blindered breed, worshipping the
false god, Efficiency.&quot;
<P>
Dr. Kirk believed in a market economy, but all his life he fought
this Cult of Efficiency--because it dehumanized man; and because
he knew there is a higher order of things in God's universe, ruled
by a law higher even than the law of supply and demand.
<P>
If today a man should ask me what is conservatism, I would tell
him: Read Russell Kirk. He endures; he speaks to the ages of what
it means to be one of us.
<P>
If there is an image I will carry with me all my days of Dr. Kirk,
it is the image of the loving father of the Prodigal Son, the
father who; nightly, walks to the edge of his estate to look to
the horizon to see if his wandering boy is ever coming home again.
And when the son appears, disheveled, having squandered his patrimony
chasing after the fads and follies of the age, the gentle father,
never reproachful, rejoices to take his son back home.
<P>
He was that--to us.
<P>
&quot;Men are put into this world . . . to struggle, to suffer,
to contend against the evil that is in their neighbors, and in
themselves, and to aspire toward the triumph of Love,&quot; Russell
Kirk wrote forty years ago. &quot;They are put in this world to
live like men and to die like men.&quot;
<P>
A brave man all his life, Russell Kirk died like a man, passing
away in the arms of the wife and daughters he loved. <i>Ave atque vale</i>,
my friend.

<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Russell Hittinger<BR>
Professor, Department of Philosophy <BR>
The Catholic University of America</b></CENTER><p> In <i>The Roots of American
Order</i>, Russell wrote: &quot;Whatever America's incertitudes today,
it is difficult to find American citizens who can sketch any convincing
ideal new order as an alternative to the one long rooted here.&quot;
This sentence was aimed particularly at the malcontents of the
1960s. But it might just as well have been aimed at all of us;
especially those of us who work in universities, think tanks,
and newspapers. Who among us knows so much as to offer the prospect
of any &quot;convincing&quot; alternative to an order long rooted
in the experience of a people? Our answer to this question will
determine how we understand the word &quot;conservative.&quot;</B>
<P>
We know how Russell Kirk answered the question. To his eternal
credit, he did not impart to this movement the name &quot;Kirkianism.&quot;
When he wrote <i>The Conservative Mind</i>, he certainly did not suggest
that the &quot;mind&quot; was his own. The whole point of the
book was to have the reader draw quite the opposite conclusion.
The permanent things are not known by merely one mind or party;
thanks to the gift of culture, they are known by many minds. Whether
we speak of culture in its moral and religious sense, or culture
in terms of liberty and economic markets, the conservative believes
that the kind of social order worth living in most certainly is
not something vouchsafed exclusively to a privileged class of
theorists.
<P>
Russell Kirk kept a distance, both spiritual and geographical,
from the institutions of the elite. He did most of his thinking
and writing outside of the academy. While it seems at least paradoxical
to say this about a conservative, he needed no institutional credentials
to certify his ideas. It was enough for him to call upon the authority
Cicero, Burke, and John Randolph of Roanoke. He certainly kept
a distance from the imperial institutions of this city. Except
for two terms as Justice of the Peace in Morton Township, Mecosta
County, Michigan, Russell never held public office.
<P>
Nonetheless, he had the chief virtue of a public man: he regarded
cultural order as a gift, even if it had been neglected and despoiled
by the age. One might think that it was a great misfortune for
him to have lived in our time, with its rejection of authority
and its rejection of the vicarious communion of the living with
the dead. Russell was, of course, duly critical of the age.
<P>
But criticism was rarely his first word, and never his last. 1
recall the first time I met him, during one of his annual seminars
at Piety Hill. I never, by the way, met a man of his prominence
who spent such time with young people, especially college undergraduates.
That year he was considering the subject, &quot;Is Virtue Teachable?&quot;
After citing all of the classical authorities, and making every
argument (pro and con) of which we were capable, we retired to
the living room on the final evening, whereupon Russell told ghost
stories. I returned more than once to these annual affairs in
Mecosta, and I can assure you that the ghosts always had the final
word.
<P>
When we consider the life of Russell Kirk, we may ask ourselves:
Can a virtuous man be happy in a decadent time? Aristotle said
of Priam's misfortunes: &quot;A truly good and intelligent person
will bear strokes of fortune suitably, and from his resources
at any time will do the finest actions, just as a . . . good shoemaker
will produce the finest shoe from the leather given him . . .
If this is so, then the happy person could never become miserable.&quot;
<P>
And so it was with Russell Kirk. &quot;Happiness,&quot; he concluded
in <i>The Roots of American Order</i>, is first expressed in &quot;gratitude.&quot;
Gratitude is found neither in sadness nor in protest, but in &quot;restoring
and improving the order of the soul and the order of the republic.&quot;
<P>
For his piety, for his example, for his paternal solicitude for
his students, and above all for his sanity, we will miss him.
But we. are grateful for his extraordinary defense of the ordinary,
civilizing virtues.<p><br><p><center><img alt="_______________________" align="middle"src="divide.gif"></center><p><br><p>

<P>
<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Irving Louis Horowitz<BR>
Professor of Sociology and Political Science<BR>
Rutgers University</b></CENTER><p> It would be futile, not to say frustrating,
to try summarizing Russell Kirk's life and work in a few well
chosen words. Russell him self was wise enough to leave for paradise
ultimate summaries and judgments. He understood that our world
was comprised, if not shrouded, in mystery and paradox; and hence
in need of dispositions not dogmas. He lived his extraordinary
life accordingly.
<P>
He was a huge public presence with a private life that remained
ever intact. He was a man who wrote fiercely, but who yet managed
to speak softly. Russell gave substance to a movement floundering
in search of theory, and yet only episodically participated in
partisan politics. He was as dedicated to what Veblen called the
higher learning with an unmatched ferocity, and yet chose the
life of what Mannheim called the <i>freischwebende Inelligenz</i> -- 
or loosely translated, the free-wheeling intellect. He was a political
philosopher in the strictest, Burkean, sense of the word, and
yet could produce ghost I stories and aphoristic works with equal
aplomb and ease. And yes, he was Catholic in the exacting sense
of that word, and yet fully able to register a catholicity that
knew no boundaries of religion or culture.
<P>
In short, he was one of us: a human being with aspirations no
less than accomplishments. His conservatism was ample enough to
take the measure of man as a complex bundle of twine; touched
by original sin but in search of ultimate redemption, and filled
with such tumult as to make possible an appreciation of order.
But having said this, one must add a qualifier: Russell did not
use paradox as a mechanism for avoiding decisions or skirting
issues. Better than nearly any I person I have ever known, he
took forthright positions on basic ques tions. For Russell, what
ought to be is at least as important as what is in the conduct
of human affairs.
<P>
I take this passion for the political as his secret war against
empiricism and for moralism. He was at heart, an essayist. He
loved preparing introductions to his favorite contemporary authors:
Irving Babbitt, Christopher Dawson, William H. Mallock, John Randolph,
Forrest McDonald, Donald Davidson, Wilhelm Roepke, Victor Kravchenko, Louis deBonald, George Scott-Moncrieff -- to name some of
them. They spoke at levels that provided meaning without fueling
animus.
<P>
I suspect that this opportunity to dialogue with his friends and
mentors of ages past no less than times present was a large part
of Russell's reason for sponsoring the Library of Conservative
Thought a series wthich has brought such distinction to Transaction,
 no less than pleasure to its readers. He shared with Montaigne
the deep belief that the essay form was that most amenable to
give I expression to ethical considerations. If this made him
at times appear I avuncular, it was a small price to pay for giving
intellectual shape to the struggles of our century and our nation.
<P>
Russell's life spanned much of the century: he knew many victories,
and suffered defeats as well. He handled both ends of the public
spectrum with equal equanimity. I suspect that the warmth of his
private life above all, his unabashed love and beaming pride of
his wife and four daughters allowed him to put into perspective
any indignities, and put into practice his belief in the values
of family, tradition, and faith. There was a seamless movement
from the private to the public that gave an informed unity of
purpose to his life.
<P>
In the short few weeks since his death, I have received many encomiums
about the Library of Conservative Thought. Several of them have
spoken of the series as somehow complete, or near completion,
with his passing. While well-intentioned, this is simply not the
case. That rich body of analysis to which Russell both contributed
so mightily and recovered so consistently, is no more near completion
than the planet earth itself. It would be high irony that a person
dedicated to the search for eternal values in a changing polity
would advocate or announce the competition of such a stupendous
task.
<P>
I suspect that these letters are giving expression to a feeling
of deep sorrow at the loss of a spiritual leader in a spiritless
environment. But the need for the comfort of belief, the instinct
for tradition, the impulse to maintain, if not create order, must
ultimately overcome our sorrow at the loss of a human being, however
talented and whatever achievements he may have registered. The
fact is that Russell is now one with the great tradition he helped
to articulate and recover. He is one with Plato, Augustine, Burke,
Brownson, Calhoun, Eliot and countless other names who helped
Russell give definition to western civilization. May his soul
rest in peace. May our souls remain restless in the pursuit of
peace.

<P>
<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Honorable T. Kenneth Cribb,
Jr.<BR>
President<BR>
Intercollegiate Studies Institute</b></CENTER><p> The priceless regalia
of the Scottish kings--the crown, the scepter, the sword of state--are
known as the Honors of Scotland. They are more ancient by far
than the British Crown Jewels, and it is said that the gold circlet
of the richly reworked crown was worn by Robert the Bruce. Despite
their incalculable worth, the Honors of Scotland were put away
following the union of the English and Scottish nations, and then
were lost to memory for 150 years.</B>
<P>
It was none other than Sir Walter Scott who, understanding their
significance, used all the powers of his scholarship and imagination
to deduce their forgotten resting place. After infinite pains,
he himself lifted the Honors of Scotland from the dusty recess
where they had been consigned by an earlier generation careless
of its patrimony.
<P>
In our age, it was Russell Kirk who, with ground-breaking scholarship
and moral imagination, rediscovered what we may call the Honors
of the West. At a time when the American heirs to conservatism
had fallen into forgetfulness of the great tradition, and liberal
intellectuals had proclaimed its demise, Dr. Kirk, like the Walter
Scott he so admired, lifted with his own hands our forgotten patrimony
from dusty oblivion.
<P>
In his early work Dr. Kirk treated modern exemplars of the conservative
tradition from Burke to Eliot, but always with respect to their
insights into timeless truths. Later, he more explicitly traced
these eternal verities to their ancient historical roots, and
to their Source beyond history. All along the way he erected guideposts
for those who would follow--all of us here and so many others--that
we too could travel the path he had marked toward order in the
soul and order in the commonwealth; that we too could discover
the Honors of the West.
<P>
Friend or foe would occasionally address him as Professor Kirk--not
realizing that he had held professorships no longer than he had
to--such was his contempt for Behemoth University. But teacher
he was, all his life. More than a few volumes on his long shelf
of books were written explicitly to instruct the young, not to
F mention hundreds of college lectures from coast to coast, scores
of Wilbur Fellows who served as his research assistants, or the
Piety Hill seminars begun more than twenty years ago. As with
Chaucer's Clerk, gladly would he teach and gladly learn.
<P>
Russell Kirk also taught by the example of his towering integrity.
Here was the man of letters who, without the usual sinecures,
actually lived by his pen. Here was the scourge of the Welfare
State who quietly practiced the arts of private charity. He and
Annette made their house a home to the troubled, to the dispossessed,
to great eccentrics seeking refuge from the commonplace world.
Who has not visited Piety Hill only to find himself dining with
the deposed imperial family of Ethiopia, or a young person with
grave family problems, or an intellectual expatriated from the
totalitarian East. There was even the Burglar Butler who before
finding shelter with the Kirks, made his way by robbing church
poor boxes, taking--as he said--only what was absolutely necessary.
<P>
Yes, Dr. Kirk taught us by the very nature of the household that
he established, graced by Monica, Cecilia, Felicia, and Andrea,
and presided over by Annette with an encompassing love.
<P>
In January of 1993 Russell Kirk learned that he suffered from
congestive heart failure, and realist that he was, understood
that his remaining time was short. He took the news as no more
and no less than an artifact of the human condition, and in his
last year and-a-half neither despaired in his spirit nor flagged
in his Herculean literary feats. After all, this was a man who
measured his intellectual pursuits in millennia and who planted
trees throughout his life as a symbol of our duty to strive for
good that we may not live to see.
<P>
Well into his seventies, Dr. Kirk could canoe on the rivers of
Mecosta County or walk the hills of the Scottish Borders, only
to sit down later at his typewriter and engage in learned disputation.
This past December nineteenth, Dr. Kirk wrote me, &quot;I fear
that my days of canoeing and hill-walking are over,&quot; and
then proceeded to outline a series of literary projects that daunted
even in the reading. Since the onset of his illness in 1993, he
had produced two of his most important works: <i>America's British
Culture</i>, a consummate defense of our common patrimony against
the destructive sallies of the multiculturalists; and <i>The Politics
of Prudence</i>, a series of essays instructing the rising generation
in the essence of conservative thought and exhorting them to nurture
and transmit their precious cultural heritage.
<P>
But perhaps the most significant work of his last days was the
completion of his final literary gift to us, <i>The Sword
of Imagination: Memoirs of a Half-Century of Literary Conflict</i>.
This 874-page treasure of a manuscript is currently being prepared
for publication by Eerdmans Publishing Company and, according
to Dr. Kirk, is a memoir humbly penned in the tradition of Julius
Caesar and Henry T Adams.
<P>
During his final illness, Dr. Kirk would gather his daughters
around him to tell stories of his youth and of their family history--as
well as an occasional gothic tale. He mustered the energy to read
aloud to his family Walter Scott's <i>Tales of a Grandfather</i>,
and, on Easter Sunday, Chesterton's <i>Ballad of the White
Horse</i>;.
<P>
On his last morning, he heard on the radio that the Pope had slipped
and fallen. He asked his family to pin him in prayer for the Holy
Father's recovery. At the end, he sat up in his bed at his beloved
Piety Hill, and sank back with eyes closed. As Annette went for
the nurse, two of his young daughters took his hands and began
to sing the songs he had sung to awaken them from their a slumbers.
He opened his eyes once more to the angelic voices that sang him
to his rest. His life was gentle in the old sense; his death,
in all senses.
<P>
The final works and days of Russell Kirk were at one with his
long life. From across the ages the best minds of the West spoke
to Dr. Kirk of permanent things which eclipsed the paltry preoccupations
of our time, and he made those thinkers our contemporaries. It
is across the ages that Russell Kirk's own voice will be heard
by future voyagers embarked on the reflective journey toward order
in the soul and order in the commonwealth. May they redeem for
their time, as Russell Kirk has done for ours, the Honors of the
West.

Mass of Dr. Russell Kirk<BR>
Reverend Winthrop Brainerd<BR>
St. Matthew's Cathedral, Washington, D.C. </CENTER></B>
<P>
On Sunday we celebrated Pentecost, and on Monday, I was at Yale
graduation. The contrast between them was extreme. Certainly at
Yale I discovered much knowledge. Certainly at Yale, I discovered
much learning. Yet, with all of this knowledge and learning, was
the lack of moral imagination; and in the midst of &quot;political
correctness,&quot; the refusal of the truth; and therefore the
absence of all wisdom.
<P>
Certainly, there was much talk of &quot;freedom from,&quot; and
lamentably little understanding of &quot;freedom to:&quot; a multiplication
of rights; and a convenient amnesia of duty.
<P>
Yet as Pentecost reminds us, the vocation of a Catholic is to
witness to the truth. To this end, God reveals Himself in covenant;
in sacrifice; in flesh and blood; and through the Holy Spirit.
<P>
Poured out upon the Church at Pentecost, and upon us at our baptism,
that Spirit leads us into the truth, and as we discover the truth,
if we are to live our lives with integrity, we must proclaim it.
<P>
For it is in this fearless proclamation of truth, that we ourselves
learn: from each other; from tradition; from grace; and from that
radical transformation of the heart. Truth comes from the entirety
of the human condition and has been refined and forged in the
inner conflicts between truth and lies; between good and evil;
between the world and the kingdom. And from the proclamation of
the truth, we discover wisdom.
<P>
Given the corruption of human nature, it is, perhaps, too much
to expect gratitude from those challenged and exposed by the proclamation
of the truth, but in the midst of persecution, explicit or implicit,
we see &quot;<i>Cor ad Cor loquitur</i>,&quot; heart speaks to heart.
Like the rim of a bell, it does not matter where it is touched,
for it rings clear, out across the earth. Wisdom speaks heart
to heart, because it perceives not only truth, but the purpose
of truth, which is God.
<P>
Wisdom speaks to the human: body, soul, mind, for wisdom both
understands the truth of the human condition, and is the ground
of its healing. It mines the individual he art for the good for
which humanity was made; for the good of which it is capable;
and for that fragile good confronted by the dark destructive selfishness
of which each one of us is daily tempted to succumb.
<P>
Such wisdom comes from God who is wisdom Himself; Himself the
author, the purpose and the end and it is the birthright of every
Catholic.
<P>
Here in the presence of the author of truth and seat of wisdom
we are given a sign: we see the bread and wine; we perceive the
flesh and blood. We see in what we have made, in bread, in wine,
the seeds of our mortality: the bread must rot and the wine spoil.
Yet we see God take what we have made, and by them, give to us
immortality.
<P>
This sign shows us what God will do, not with what we have made,
but with what he has made: ourselves. &quot;Now we see a dim reflection
in a mirror; but then we shall be seeing face to face. The knowledge
that I now have is imperfect; but I shall understand as I am understood.&quot;
(1 Cor. 13:12)
<P>
&quot;To understand as I am understood&quot; is the ultimate wisdom.
It is still the vocation of our brother Russell Kirk; it is the
lesson of his life; and it is the legacy, like Elijah's mantle,
that falls upon us here.<p><br><p><center><img alt="_______________________" align="middle"src="divide.gif"></center>

<P>
Sobering voices tell us nowadays that the civilization in which we participate is not long for this world. Many countries have fallen under the domination of squalid oligarchs; other lands are reduced to anarchy. "Cultural revolution," rejecting our patrimony of learning and manners, has done nearly as much mischief in the West as in the East, if less violently. Religious belief is attenuated at best, for many or else converted, after being secularized, into an instrument for social transformation. Books give way to television and videos; universities, intellectually democratized, are sunk to the condition of centers for job certification. An increasing proportion of the population, in America especially, is dehumanized by addiction to narcotics and insane sexuality.
<p>
These afflictions are only some of the symptoms of social and personal disintegration. One has but to look at our half-ruined American cities, with their ghastly rates of murder and rape, to perceive that we moderns lack the moral imagination and the right reason required to maintain tolerable community. Writers in learned quarterlies or in daily syndicated columns use the terms "post-Christian era" or "post-modern epoch" to imply that we are breaking altogether with our cultural past, and are entering upon some new age of a bewildering character.
<p>
Some people, the militant secular humanists in particular, seem pleased by this prospect; but yesteryear's meliorism is greatly weakened in most quarters. Even Marxist ideologues virtually have ceased to predict the approach of a Golden Age. To most observers, T. S. Eliot among them, it has seemed far more probable that we are stumbling into a new Dark Age, inhumane, merciless, a totalist political domination in which the life of spirit and the inquiring intellect will be denounced, harassed, and propagandized against: Orwell's <I>Nineteen Eight-Four,</I> rather than Huxley's <i>Brave New World</i> of cloying sensuality. Or perhaps Tolkien's blasted and servile land of Mordor may serve as symbol of the human condition in the twenty-first century (which, however, may not be called the twenty-first century, the tag Anno Domini having been abolished as joined to one of the superstitions of the childhood of the race).
<p>
<b>At the End of an Era.</b> Some years ago I was sitting in the parlor of an ancient house in the close of York Minster. My host, Basil Smith, the Minster's Treasurer then, a man of learning and of faith, said to me that we linger at the end of an era; soon the culture we have known will be swept into the dustbin of history. About us, as we talked in that medieval mansion, loomed Canon Smith's tall bookcases lined with handsome volumes; his doxological clock chimed the half-hour musically; flames flared up in his fireplace. Was all this setting of culture, and much more besides, to vanish away as if the Evil Spirit had condemned it? Basil Smith is buried now, and so is much of the society he ornamented and tried to redeem. At the time I thought him too gloomy; but already a great deal that he foresaw has come to pass.
<p>
The final paragraph of Malcolm Muggeridge's essay 'The Great Liberal Death Wish" must suffice, the limits of my time with you considered, as a summing-up of the human predicament at the end of the twentieth century.
<p>
"As the astronauts soar into the vast eternities of space," Muggeridge writes, "on earth the garbage piles higher, as the groves of academe extend their domain, their alumni's arms reach lower, as the phallic cult spreads, so does impotence. In great wealth, great poverty; in health, sickness, in numbers, deception. Gorging, left hungry; sedated, left restless; telling all, hiding all; in flesh united, forever separate. So we press on through the valley of abundance that leads to the wasteland of satiety, passing through the gardens of fantasy; seeking happiness ever more ardently, and finding despair ever more surely."
<p>
Just so. Such recent American ethical writers as Stanley Hauwerwas and Alasdair MacIntyre concur in Muggeridge's verdict on the society of our time, concluding that nothing can be done, except for a remnant to gather in little "communities of character" while society slides toward its ruin. Over the past half-century, many other voices of reflective men and women have been heard to the same effect. Yet let us explore the question of whether a reinvigoration of our culture is conceivable.
<p>
<b>Surprise Turning Points.</b> Is the course of nations inevitable? Is there some fixed destiny for great states? In 1796, a dread year for Britain, old Edmund Burke declared that we cannot foresee the future; often the historical determinists are undone by the coming of events that nobody has predicted. At the very moment when some states "seemed plunged in unfathomable abysses of disgrace and disaster ' Burke wrote in his <i>First Letter on a Regicide Peace,</I> "they have suddenly emerged. They have begun a new course, and opened a new reckoning; and even in the depths of their calamity, and on the very ruins of their country, have laid the foundations of a towering and durable greatness. All this has happened without any apparent previous change in the general circumstances which had brought on their distress. The death of a man at a critical juncture, his disgust, his retreat, his disgrace, have brought innumerable calamities on a whole nation. A common soldier, a child, a girl at the door of an inn, have changed the face of fortune, and almost of Nature."
<p>
The "common soldier" to whom Burke refers is Arnold of Winkelreid, who flung himself upon the Austrian spears to save his country; the child is the young Hannibal, told by his father to wage ruthless war upon Rome; the girl at the door of an inn is Joan of Arc. We do not know why such abrupt reversals or advances occur, Burke remarks; perhaps they are indeed the work of Providence.
<p>
"Nothing is, but thinking makes it so," the old adage runs. If most folk come to believe that our culture must collapse-why, then collapse it will. Yet Burke, after all, was right in that dreadful year of 1796. For despite the overwhelming power of the French revolutionary movement in that year, in the long run Britain defeated her adversaries, and after the year 1812 Britain emerged from her years of adversity to the height of her power. Is it conceivable that American civilization, and in general what we call "Western Civilization," may recover from the Time of Troubles that commenced in 1914 (so Arnold Toynbee instructs us) and in the twenty-first century enter upon an Augustan age of peace and restored order?
<p>
To understand these words "civilization" and "culture," the best book to read is T. S. Eliot's slim volume <i>Notes Towards the Definition of Culture,</I> published forty-four years ago.
<p>
Once upon a time I commended that book to President Nixon, in a private discussion of modern disorders, as the one book which he ought to read for guidance in his high office. Man is the only creature possessing culture, as distinguished from instinct; and if culture is effaced, so is the distinction between man and the brutes that perish. "Art is man's nature," in Edmund Burke's phrase; and if the human arts, or culture, cease to be, then human nature ceases to be.
<p>
From what source did humankind's many cultures arise? Why, from cults. A cult is a joining together for worship-that is, the attempt of people to commune with a transcendent power. It is from association in the cult, the body of worshippers, that human community grows. This basic truth has been expounded in recent decades by such eminent historians as Christopher Dawson, Eric Voegelin, and Arnold Toynbee.
<p>
Once people are joined in a-cult, cooperation in many other things becomes possible. Common defense, irrigation, systematic agriculture, architecture, the visual arts, music, the more intricate crafts, economlc production and distribution, courts and government-all these aspects of a culture arise gradually from the cult, the religious de.
<p>
Out of little knots of worshippers, in Egypt, the Fertile Crescent, India, or China, there grew up simple cultures; for those joined by religion can dwell together and work together in relative peace. Presently such simple cultures may develop into intricate cultures, and those intricate cultures into great civilizations. American civilization of our era is rooted, strange though the fact may seem to us, in tiny knots of worshippers in Palestine, Greece, and Italy, thousands of years ago. The enormous material achievements of our civilization have resulted, if remotely, from the spiritual insights of prophets and seers.
<p>
But suppose that the cult withers, with the elapse of centuries. What then of the culture that is rooted in the cult? What then of the civilization which is the culture's grand manifestation? For an answer to such uneasy questions, we can turn to a twentieth century parable. Here I think of G. K Chesterton's observation that all life being an allegory, we can understand it only in parable.
<p>
<b>Parable of the Future.</b> The author of my parable, however, is not Chesterton, but a quite different writer, the late Robert Graves, whom I once visited in Mallorca I have in mind Graves's romance <i>Seven Days in New Crete</I>-published in America under the title <I>Watch the North Wind Rise.</i>
<p>
In that highly readable romance of a possible future, we are told that by the close of the "Late Christian epoch" the world will have fallen altogether, after a catastrophic war and devastation, under a collectivistic domination, a variant of Communism. Religion, the moral imagination, and nearly everything that makes life worth living have been virtually extirpated by ideology and nuclear war. k system of thought and government called Logicalism, "pantisocratic economics divorced from any religious or national theory," rules the world-for a brief time.
<p>
In Graves's words:
<p><blockquote>
Logicalism, hinged on international science, ushered in a gloomy and anti-poetic age. It lasted only a generation or two and ended with a grand defeatism, a sense of perfect futility, that slowly crept over the directors and managers of the regime. The common man had triumphed over his spiritual betters at last, but what was to follow? To what could he look forward with either hope or fear? By the abolition of sovereign states and the disarming of even the police forces, war had become impossible. No one who cherished any religious beliefs whatever, or was interested in sport, poetry, or the arts, was allowed to hold a position of public responsibility. "Ice-cold logic" was the most valued civic quality, and those who could not pretend to it were held of no account. Science continued laboriously to expand its over-large corpus of information, and the subjects of research grew more and more beautifully remote and abstract; yet the scientific obsession, so strong at the beginning of the third millennium A. D., was on the wane. Logicalist officials who were neither defeatist nor secretly religious and who kept their noses to the grindstone from a sense of duty, fell prey to colobromania, a mental disturbance....
</blockquote><p>
<p>
Rates of abortion and infanticide, of suicide, and other indices of social boredom rise with terrifying speed under this Logicalist regime. Gangs of young people go about robbing, beating, and murdering, for the sake of excitement. It appears that the human race will become extinct if such tendencies continue; for men and women find life not worth living under such a domination. The deeper longings of humanity have been outraged, so that the soul and the state stagger on the verge of final darkness. But in this crisis an Israeli Sophocrat writes a book called <i>A Critique of Utopias,</I> in which he examines seventy Utopian writings, from Plato to Aldous Huxley. "We must retrace our steps," he concludes, "or perish." Only by the resurrection of religious faith, the Sophocrats discover, can mankind be kept from total destruction; and that religion, as Graves describes it in his romance, springs from the primitive soil of myth and symbol.
<p>
Graves really is writing about our own age, not of some remote future: of life in today's United States and today's Soviet Union. He is saying that culture arises from the cult; and that when belief in the cult has been wretchedly enfeebled, the culture will decay swiftly. The material order rests upon the spiritual order.
<p>
So it has come to pass, here in the closing years of the twentieth century. With the weakening of the moral order, "Things fall apart; mere anarchy is loosed upon the world ... " The Hellenic and the Roman cultures went down to dusty death after this fashion. What may be done to achieve reinvigoration?
<p>
<b>No Substitute.</b> Some well-meaning folk talk of a "civil religion," a kind of cult of patriotism, founded upon a myth of national virtue and upon veneration of certain historic documents, together with a utilitarian morality. But such experiments of a secular character never have functioned satisfactorily; and it scarcely is necessary for me to point out the perils of such an artificial creed, bound up with nationalism: the example of the ideology of the National Socialist Party in Germany, half a century ago, may suffice. Worship of the state, or of the national commonwealth, is no healthy substitute for communion with transcendent love and wisdom.
<p>
Nor can attempts at persuading people that religion is "useful" meet with much genuine success. No man sincerely goes down on his knees to the divine because he has been told that such rituals lead to the beneficial consequences of tolerably honest behavior in commerce. People will conform their actions to the precepts of religion only when they earnestly believe the doctrines of that religion to be true.
<p>
Still less can it suffice to assert that the Bible is an infallible authority on everything, literally interpreted, in defiance of the natural sciences and of other learned disciplines; to claim to have received private revelations from Jehovah; or to embrace some self-proclaimed mystic from the gorgeous East, whose teachings are patently absurd.
<p>
In short, the culture can be renewed only if the cult is renewed; and faith in divine power cannot be summoned up merely when that is found expedient. Faith no longer works wonders among us: one has but to glance at the typical church built nowadays, ugly and shoddy, to discern how architecture no longer is nurtured by the religious imagination. It is so in nearly all d e works of twentieth century civilization: the modern mind has been secularized so thoroughly that "culture" is assumed by most people to have no connection with the love of God.
<p>
How are we to account for this widespread decay of the religious impulse? It appears that the principal cause of the loss of the idea of the holy is the attitude called "scientism"-that is, the popular notion that the revelations of natural science, over the past century and a half or two centuries, somehow have proved that men and women are naked apes merely, that the ends of existence are production and consumption merely; that happiness is the gratification of sensual impulses; and that concepts of the resurrection of the flesh and the life everlasting are mere exploded superstitions. Upon these scientistic assumptions, public schooling in America is founded nowadays, implicitly.
<p>
This view of the human condition has been called-by C S. Lewis, in particular-reductionism: it reduces human beings almost to mindlessness; it denies the existence of the soul. Reductionism has become almost an ideology. It is scientistic, but not scientific: for it is a far cry from the understanding of matter and energy that one finds in the addresses of Nobel prize winners in physics, say.
<p>
Popular notions of "what science says" are archaic :, reflecting the assertions of the scientists of the middle of the nineteenth century; such views are a world away from the writings of Stanley Jaki, the cosmologist and historian of science, who was awarded the Templeton Prize for progress in religion last year.
<p>
As Arthur Koestler remarks in his little book <i>The Roots of Coincidence,</I> yesterday's scientific doctrines of materialism and mechanism ought to be buried now with a requiem of electronic music. Once more, in biology as in physics, the scientific disciplines enter upon the realm of mystery.
<p>
Yet the great public always suffers from the affliction called cultural lag. If most people continue to fancy that scientific theory of a century ago is the verdict of serious scientists today, will not the religious understanding of life continue to wither, and civilization continue to crumble?
<p>
<b>Hard Truth.</b> Perhaps; but the future, I venture to remind you, is unknowable. Conceivably we may be given a Sign. Yet such an event being in I he hand of God, if it is to occur at all, meanwhile some reflective people declare that our culture must be reanimated, by a great effort of will.
<p>
More than forty years ago, that remarkable historian Christopher Dawson, in his book <i>Religion and Culture,</I> expressed this hard truth strongly. "The events of the last few years," Dawson wrote, "portend either the end of human history or a turning point in it. They have warned us in letters of fire that our civilization has been tried in the balance and found wanting-that there is an absolute limit to the progress than can be achieved by the perfectionment of scientific techniques detached from spiritual aims and moral values.... The recovery of moral control and the return to spiritual order have become the indispensable conditions of human survival. But they can be achieved only by a profound change in the spirit of modern civilization. This does not mean a new religion or a new culture but a movement of spiritual reintegration which would restore that vital relation between religion and culture which has existed at every age and on every level of human development."
<p>
Amen to that. The alternative to such a successful endeavor, a conservative endeavor, to reinvigorate our culture would be a series of catastrophic events, the sort predicted by Pitirim Sorokin and other sociologists, which eventually might efface our present sensate culture and bring about a new ideational culture, the character of which we cannot even imagine. Such an ideational culture doubtless would have its religion: but it might be the worship of what has been called the Savage God
<p>
Such ruin has occurred repeatedly in history. When the classical religion ceased to move hearts and minds, two millennia ago, thus the Graeco Roman civilization went down to Avernus. As my little daughter Cecilia put it unprompted, some years ago looking at a picture book of Roman history, "And then, at the end of a long summer's day, there came Death, Mud, Crud."
<p>
Great civilizations have ended in slime. Outside the ancient city of York, where York Minster stands upon the site of the Roman praetorium, there lies a racecourse known as the Knavesmire. Here in medieval time were buried the knaves-the felons and paupers. When, a few years ago, the racecourse was being enlarged, the diggers came upon a Roman graveyard beneath, or in part abutting upon, the medieval burial ground. This appeared to have been a cemetery of the poor of Romano-British times. Few valuable artifacts were uncovered, but the bones were of interest. Many of the people there interred, in the closing years of Roman power in Britain, had been severely deformed, apparently suffering from rickets and other afflictions-deformed spines and limbs and skulls. Presumably they had suffered lifelong, and died, from extreme malnutrition. At the end, decadence comes down to that, for nearly everybody.
<p>
It was at York that the dying Septimius Severus, after his last campaign (against the Scots), was asked by his brutal sons, Geta and Caracalla, "Father, when you are gone, how shall we govern the empire?" The hard old emperor had his laconic reply ready: "Pay the soldiers. The rest do not matter." There would come a time when the soldiers could not be paid, and then civilization would fall to pieces. The last Roman army in Italy-it is said to have been composed entirely of cavalry- fought in league with the barbarian general Odoacer against Theodoric, King of the Ostrogoths, in the year 491; on Odoacer's defeat, the Roman soldiers drifted home, nevermore to take arms: the end of an old song Only the earlier stages of social decadence-seem liberating to some people; the last act, as Cecilia Kirk perceived, consists of Death, Mud, Crud.
<p>
In short, it appears to me that our culture labors in an advanced state of decadence; that what many people mistake for the triumph of our civilization actually consists of powers that are disintegrating our culture; that the vaunted "democratic freedom" of liberal society in reality is servitude to appetites and illusions which attack religious belief; which destroy community through excessive centralization and urbanization; which efface life-giving tradition and custom.
<p>
<blockquote>
History has many cunning passages, contrieved corridors <BR>And issues, deceives with whispering ambitions, <BR>Guides us by vanities.
</blockquote>
<p>
So Gerontion instructs us, in T. S. Eliot's famous grim poem. By those and some succeeding lines, Eliot means that human experience lived without the Logos, the Word; lived merely by the asserted knowledge of empirical science-why, history in that sense is a treacherous gypsy witch. Civilizations that reject or abandon the religious imagination must end, as did Gerontion, in fractured atoms.
<p>
<b>Restoring Religious Insights.</b> In conclusion, it is my argument that the elaborate civilization we have known stands in peril; that it may expire of lethargy, or be destroyed by violence, or perish, from a combination of both evils. We who think that life remains worth living ought to address ourselves to means by which a restoration of our culture may be achieved. A prime necessity for us is to restore an apprehension of religious insights in our clumsy apparatus of public instruction, which -bullied by militant secular humanists and presumptuous federal courts-has been left with only ruinous answers to the ultimate questions.
<p>
What ails modern civilization? Fundamentally, our society's affliction is the decay of religious belief If a culture is to survive and flourish, it must not be severed from the religious vision out of which it arose. The high necessity of reflective men and women, then, is to labor for the restoration of religious teachings as a credible body of doctrine.
<p>
"Redeem the time; redeem the dream," T. S. Eliot wrote. It remains possible, given right reason and moral imagination, to confront boldly the age's disorders. The restoration of true learning, humane and scientific; the reform of many public policies; the renewal of our awareness of a transcendent order, and of the presence of an Other, the brightening of the comers where we find ourselves such approaches are open to those among the rising generation who look for a purpose in life. It is just conceivable that we may be given a Sign before the end of the twentieth century; yet Sign or no Sign, Remnant must strive against the follies of the time.

<P>
The literature of natural law is complex, copious, and monthly growing vaster. All I aspire to accomplish in this second lecture on "The Future of Justice" is to offer some general introduction to the subject, together with reflections on the protections and dangers of natural-law doctrines, and observations concerning natural law and constitutional government.
<p>
A great deal of loose talk about natural law has occurred in very recent years. It was objected to Judge Bork' s nomination to the Supreme Court that Bork did not believe in natural law; and when Judge Thomas was interrogated for that bench, the objection was raised that he <i>did</i> believe in natural law. These protestations came mostly from the same group of senators. Clearly a good many public men and women nowadays have only vague notions of what is signified by this term <i>natural law.</i>
<p>
Objectively speaking, <i>natural law,</i> as a term of politics and jurisprudence, may be defined as a loosely knit body of rules of action prescribed by an authority superior to the state. These rules variously (according to the several differing schools of natural-law and natural-rights speculation) are derived from divine commandment; from the nature of humankind; from abstract Reason; or from long experience of mankind in community.
<p>
But natural law does not appertain to states and courts merely. For primarily it is a body of ethical perceptions or rules governing the life of the individual person, quite aside from politics and jurisprudence. When many persons ignore or flout the natural law for human beings, the consequences presently are ruinous-as with the unnatural vices that result in the disease of AIDS, or with the ideological passions, defying the norm of justice, that have ravaged most nations since the First World War.
<p>
The natural law should not be taken for graven Tables of Governance, to be followed to jot and tittle; appealed to in varying circumstances, the law of nature must be applied with high prudence. As Alessandro d'Entreves writes, "The lesson of natural law is in fact nothing but an assertion that law is a part of ethics." And, he concludes "The lesson of natural law [is] simply to remind the jurist of his own limitations.... This point where values and norms coincide, which is the ultimate origin of law and at the same time the beginning of moral life proper, is, I believe, what men for over two thousand years have indicated by the name of natural law."
<p>
On the one hand, natural law must be distinguished from positive or statutory law, decreed by the state; on the other, from the "laws of nature" in a scientific sense-that is, from propositions expressing the regular order of certain natural phenomena Also natural law sometimes is confounded with assertions of "natural rights," which may or may not be founded upon classical and medieval concepts of natural law.
<p>
The most important early treatise on natural law is Cicero's <i>De Re Publica.</i> The Ciceronian understanding of natural law, which still exercises strong influence, was well expressed in the nineteenth century by Froude: "Our human laws are but the copies, more or less imperfect, of the eternal laws so far as we can read them, and either succeed and promote our welfare, or fail and bring confusion and disaster, according as the legislator's insight has detected the true principle, or has been distorted by ignorance or selfishness."
<p>
As interpreted by the Roman jurisconsult, and later by the medieval Schoolmen and Canonists- Thomas Aquinas especially-the legacy of the classical <i>jus naturale</i> endured with little challenge until the seventeenth century. In England during the sixteenth century it was powerfully upheld by Richard Hooker in his <i>Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity.</i> In the Christian world the natural law was received as a body of unwritten rules depending upon universal conscience and common sense, ascertainable by right reason. But with the stirrings of secularism and rationalism during the seventeenth century, a new interpretation of "natural law" began to develop, conspicuous (near the end of the century) in the works of Hugo Grotius and Baron Samuel von Pufendorf. This latter secularized concept of natural law was held by many of the <i>philosophes</i> of the eighteenth century, and took on flesh during the French Revolution, when it was vulgarized by Thomas Paine.
<p>
Nevertheless, the older understanding of natural law was not extinguished. It was ringingly reasserted by Edmund Burke, in his distinction between the "real" and the "pretended" rights of men. Through the disciples of Burke, and through the influence of the Catholic Church, the classical and Christian natural law has experienced a revival in the latter half of the twentieth century.
<p>
During the nineteenth century, natural-law concepts were overshadowed by the powerful Utilitarian system of Jeremy Bentham; by the theories of John Austin and the Analytical Jurists; by legal positivism; and later-particularly in the United States-by legal pragmatism. In the United States, the older and newer schools of natural law have contended against each other since the latter half of the eighteenth century, and both have been hotly assailed by positivistic, utilitarian, and pragmatic interpretations of law. Yet appeals to the "natural law" or "a higher law" have recurred often in American politics and jurisprudence; both conservatives and radicals, from time to time, have invoked this law of nature
<p>
The Catholic Church continues to adhere to the classical and Thomistic understanding of the natural law-to an apprehension of Justice that is rooted in the wisdom of the species. Sir Ernest Barker put thus the idea of natural law: "This justice is conceived as being the higher or ultimate law, proceeding from the nature of the universe from the Being of God and the reason of man. It follows that law-in the sense of the law of the last resort-is somehow above lawmaking."
<p>
The most lucid and popular exposition of natural law it to be found in the Appendix, "Illustrations of the Tao," to C. S. Lewis's little book <i>The Abolition of Man.</i> Therein Lewis distinguishes eight major natural laws of universal recognition and application, together with several illustrations of each, drawn from a wide diversity of cultures, religions, philosophical discourses, and countries. He expounds the Law of General Beneficence; the Law of Special Beneficence; Duties to Parents, Elders, Ancestors; Duties to Children and Posterity; the Law of Justice; the Law of Good Faith and Veracity; the Law of Mercy; the Law of Magnanimity. No code of the laws of nature ever having existed, it is ineffectual to try to enforce that body of ethical principles through courts of law; no judge hands down decisions founded directly upon the admonition, "Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land"-or the Commandment's equivalents in the Babylonian List of Sins, the Egyptian Confession of the Righteous Soul, the Manual of Epictetus, Leviticus, the Analects, or Hindu books of wisdom. Nevertheless, such perpetual precepts lie behind the customs and the statutes that shelter father and mother.
<p>
So much, succinctly, by way of definition. Turn we now to the difficulty of explaining natural law to the average sensual man. Permit me to discourse with you for a little while about natural law and the moral imagination. Incidentally, I am helped here by an unpublished essay by the late Raymond English, who understood and praised the natural law, and understood and despised the claims for "natural right." Let me quote English directly:
<p><blockquote>
The natural law cannot be understood except through the elements of poetry and imagination in the soul. The poetic and the moral imagination are parts of human reason. For the man who does not feel himself in some sense a child of God, who is not possessed by the "desire and pursuit of the whole," and for whom words like honor are meaningless, the notion of natural law must be a Mumbojumbo, a bogle to make children behave tolerably well, a fantasy from the adolescence or the childhood of the race. Poets, James Elroy Flecker says, are those who swear that Beauty lives although lilies die; and the natural law is the poetry of political science, the assurance that Justice lives though states are imperfect and ephemeral. Justice is to politics what beauty is to art; indeed, beauty and justice become almost identical at the highest levels of human aspiration.
</blockquote><p>
Permit me, ladies and gentlemen, to repeat here that the natural law is more than a guide for statesmen and jurists. It is meant primarily for the governance of persons-for you and me, that we may restrain will and appetite in our ordinary walks of life. Natural law is not a harsh code that we thrust upon other people: rather, it is an ethical knowledge, innate perhaps, but made more clearly known to us through -the operation of right reason. And the more imagination with which a person is endowed, the more will he apprehend the essence of the natural law, and understand its necessity. If such a one, despite his power of imagination, offends against the natural law, the greater must be his suffering. So I have discovered in the course of a peregrine life. And over a good many decades I have found that most contemners of the natural law are dull dogs, afflicted by a paucity of imagination. As Adam Mickiewicz instructs us:
<p><blockquote>
Your soul deserves the place to which it came,<br>If having entered Hell, you feel no flame.
</blockquote><p>
Such is the case for the importance of natural law. Permit me to turn now to the case against natural law, as expressed by the legal positivists-most strongly, perhaps, by the German scholar Hans Kelsen. They regard natural law as a body of sentimental fictions; they hold that the state is the only true source of law. The views of John Austin and the Analytical Jurists are similar: all law is decreed by the political sovereign, they hold. Rather than moving abstractly among the several schools of jurisprudence in the twentieth century, I offer you now the contents of a letter I received recently from a German inventor and industrialist who had read in the Bavarian magazine <i>Epoche</i> some remarks of mine on natural law. My correspondent is a very intelligent and indeed talented man, considerable of a naturalist in that he studies flora and fauna. In politics, I suppose he may be classified as a German liberal of the old school. His communication, refreshingly innocent of the jargon of jurisprudence and ethics, suggests the mentality that lies behind the denigration of natural law by positivists and secular humanists, who recognize and deride the Christian and the classical origins of the idea of natural law.
<p>
"Whether the term 'law of nature' is more frequently used nowadays, or whether the <i>jus naturale</i> is an old invention," my German correspondent begins, "I think this term is wrong and misleading. There is no law or legislative system which can be derived from nature. Nature has rules developed during evolution, but there is only a <i>jus hominis</i> and no <i>jus naturale."</I>
<p>
"In other words," my friend goes on, 
<p><blockquote>
all ethical norms are developed and worked out by human beings, in this case mostly by the homo stultus, subspecies sapiens.... The order of nature follows in many respects the right of the stronger, which, in fact, keeps nature with all its plants and animals in excellent shape. But mankind has set up ethical rules, good ones and bad ones, very different from natural rules. Many of these man-made rules are quite bad, sinning against nature....
<P>
The very deplorable situation of the species homo stultus comes from wrong ethical rules, which are against nature. I am not pleading for the right of the stronger between human beings, but for more influence of the rare subspecies sapiens, especially of those individuals who understand nature-which means also the nature of human character. Unfortunately Jesus did not understand the real nature of men; nor do the socialists understand it when they expect that people will work for the state rather than for themselves....
<P>
I offer another example, in which American legislators have chosen the wrong solution. There is a law in the United States, if I am correct, which forbids the killing of foreign heads of state. If I am correct this is concerned with clandestine actions, e.g. by the CIA. This law is unethical. Assuming that no American president or the American government plans to eliminate a foreign dictator just for fun, but rather because he is a danger to the United States or to his own people or both, then removing a dictator as soon as possible would save the lives of many; and is, in consequence, completely justified.
<P>
We should agree that right is an exclusively human creation. What is regarded as rightful by one group of people within a community, can be regarded as wrongful by another group. I seek a terminology where there is a clean and clear distinction between what comes from nature and what comes from human efforts. Human efforts are aimed very often, with the best intentions, in the wrong direction. I mean "wrong" in this sense: against nature, for nature cannot be neglected without harming the human race....
<P>
Failing to realize that often human character is bad must lead to destroying a society through leniency. We have to determine when our ethical laws accord with nature and when they counteract nature. We must not ignore "the rule of the fittest," when we decide to kill a dictator, for instance. We acknowledge the right of every nation to use as much force as possible when fighting another nation to death. The fight between nations follows what could be called natural right, but is better called the rule of nature.
</blockquote><p>
For this German correspondent of mine, you will have noted, "nature" signifies animal nature, Darwinian nature, red in tooth and claw. Therefore he despises appeals to natural law, and believes that not only all positive or traditional law, but all ethical principles, are human creations merely. And these human contrivances, he implies, sometimes may be mistaken; we might be wiser to found our human institutions on the principle of competition, favoring the fitter.
<p>
Here, I suggest, we perceive the mentality that lies back of the jurisprudence of Hans Kelsen and certain other positivists: critics of the whole concept of natural law.
<p>
Yet in one matter my correspondent does turn to the extreme medicine of natural law: his commendation of tyrannicide. This is interesting, as it is related to Germany in this century.
<p>
German jurisprudence demands that the citizen be strictly obedient to the state, for the state is the source of all law? the omniscient keeper of the peace. No law but positive law has been recognized in Germany since the fall of the German monarchy; natural law has no place at all.
<p>
Adolph Hitler, chosen Reichschancellor by lawful means, and confirmed in power by the Reichstag in 1933, was sustained later by national plebiscites. He was the head of the German state, the source of all law, to which all Germans had been taught obedience. Yet certain Germans-army officers, scholars, professional people, chiefly-found his actions evil. By quasi-constitutional means he had subverted the constitution. His popularity had become tremendous, and his military power. Only by death might he be removed.
<p>
Therefore a little knot of brave and conscientious men determined to save Germany and Europe by killing Hitler. They had been reared in the doctrine that all citizens must obey the inerrant state. In this exigency, however, they turned to doctrines of natural law for justification. Was there no remedy against an unnatural master of the state? In the teachings of natural law they discerned a fatal remedy. Fatal to them, at least; for nearly all of the heroic men involved in the several conspiracies against Hitler died frightful deaths. I knew well Dr. Ludwig Freund, a kindly professor of political science, one of the two survivors of the first plot to kill Hitler. By nature Professor Freund was a law-abiding gentleman. And being law-abiding, in defense of true law he was prepared to slay the chief of state, perverter of Germany's laws and the laws of man's nature.
<p>
I repeat that we have recourse to natural law, as opposed to positive law, only as a last resort, ordinarily. My only service as a jurist occurred in Morton Township, Mecosta County, some decades ago, when for two consecutive terms I was elected-unanimously-justice of the peace. When determining a disputed boundary between two farms, a justice of the peace does not repair to theories of natural law and meditate upon which of two claimants is the more worthy of judicial compassion; rather, the justice of the peace turns to statute, common law, possibly to local custom- and to the files of the recorder of deeds at the county seat. And so it is with the ordinary administration of law at every level. Statute, charter, and prescription ordinarily are sufficient to maintain the rule of law-the end of which, we ought not to forget, is to keep the peace.
<p>
Yet to guide the sovereign; the chief of state; the legislator; the public prosecutor; the judge when, in effect, he sits in equity-to guide you and me, indeed-there endures the natural law, which in essence is man's endeavor to maintain a moral order through the operation of a mundane system of justice. Unlike my German correspondent, the sustainer of natural law knows that there is law for man, and law for thing; and that our moral order is not the creation of coffee-house philosophers. Human nature ; not vulpine nature, leonine nature, or serpentine nature. Natural law is bound up with the concept of the dignity of man, and with the experience of humankind ever since the beginnings of social community.
<p>
It will not do to substitute private interpretations of natural law for common law or civil law, any more than it would have been well for England, during the Reformation, to have obeyed the "Geneva Men" by sweeping away common law and the whole inherited apparatus of parliamentary statutes, to substitute the laws of the ancient Jews. Positive law and customary law, in any country, grow out of a people's experience in community; natural law should have its high part in shaping and restraining positive and customary laws, but natural law could not conceivably supplant judicial institutions. Yet were natural-law concepts to be abandoned altogether-why, then, indeed, the world would find itself governed by 
<P><blockquote>
The good old rule, the good old plan, <BR>That they shall take who have the power, <BR>And they shall keep who can.
</blockquote><P>
Turn we now to relationships between the natural law and the American judiciary. Not since Associate Justice Joseph Story adorned the Supreme Court of the United States, early in the nineteenth century, has any member of the Supreme Court had much to say about natural law. Nevertheless, in recent decades a number of Supreme Court decisions seem to have been founded upon natural-law notions of a sort. I think, for instance, of the Warren Court's decision (the opinion written by Chief Justice Warren himself) that congressional districts within the several states must be so drawn in their boundaries as to contain so nearly as possible the same number of persons within the several districts-a matter previously left to the discretion of state legislatures. In part, this intervention was founded upon Jeremy Bentham's principle of one man, one vote; but also there seems to have lurked at the back of the minds of justices the notion that exact political equality, as told by numbers, somehow is "natural," whatever state and federal constitutions might prescribe and whatever the opinions of the Framers may have been. One might cite, too, the Court's decisions in the school desegregation cases. This question having been raised, let us examine how far we should appeal to natural law against statute and Constitution. Here we turn to an historical example and to the judgment of a leading American political and religious writer who endeavored to reconcile the claims of authority and the claims of freedom.
<p>
I refer to the "higher law" controversy of 1850 and to Orestes Brownson, the Catholic scholar and polemicist. In March 1850, on the floor of the United States Senate, William Henry Seward made his famous declaration that there exists "a higher law than the Constitution." He was referring to the Fugitive Slave Law and the Supreme Court. At once a hot controversy arose. In January 1851, Brownson published his review-essay entitled "The Higher Law," in which he refuted the claim of Seward, the Abolitionists, and the Free-Soilers to transcend the Constitution by appealing to a moral "higher law" during debate on the Fugitive Slave Bill.
<p>
Brownson agreed with Seward that 
<p><blockquote>
there is a higher law than the Constitution. The law of God is supreme, and overrides all human enactments, and every human enactment incompatible with it is null and void from the beginning, and cannot be obeyed with a good conscience, for "we must obey God rather than men." This is the great truth statesmen and lawyers are extremely prone to overlook, which the temporal authority not seldom practically denies, and on which the Church never fails to insist....
<P>
But the concession of the fact of a higher law than the Constitution does not of itself justify the appeal to it against the Constitution, either by Mr. Seward or the opponents of the Fugitive Slave Law. Mr. Seward had no right, while holding his seat in the Senate under the Constitution, to appeal to the higher law against the Constitution, because that was to deny the very authority by which he held his seat.... After having taken his oath to support the Constitution, the Senator had, so far as he was concerned, settled the question, and it was no longer for him an open question. In calling God to witness his determination to support the Constitution, he had called God to witness his conviction of the compatibility. If the Constitution with the law of God, and therefore left himself no plea for appealing from it to a higher law.
</blockquote><p>
We cannot be bound, Brownson continued, to obey a law that is in contravention of the law of God.
<p><blockquote>
This is the grand principle held by the old martyrs, and therefore they chose martyrdom rather than obedience to the state commanding them to act contrary to the Divine law. But who is to decide whether a special civil enactment be or be not repugnant to the law of God? Here is a grave and perplexing question for those who have no divinely authorized interpreter of the divine law.
</blockquote><p>
The Abolitionists and Free-Soilers, Brownson remarked, had adopted the Protestant principle of private judgment.
<p><blockquote>
But this places the individual above the state, and is wholly incompatible with the simplest conception of civil government. No civil government can exist, none is conceivable even, when every individual is free to disobey its orders whenever they do not happen to square with his private convictions of what is the law of God.
</blockquote><p>
The Church, Brownson writes, is the authoritative interpreter of the divine law. He reminds his readers that the state is ordained of God; but the state is not the supreme and infallible organ of God's will on earth.
<p><blockquote>
Now it is clear that Mr. Seward and his friends, the Abolitionists and the Free Soilers, have nothing to which they can appeal from the action of government but their private interpretation of the law of God, that is to say, their own private judgment or opinion as individuals; for it is notorious that they are good Protestants, holding the pretended right of private judgment, and rejecting all authoritative interpretation of the Divine law. To appeal from government to private judgment is to place private judgment above public authority, the individual above the state, which, as we have seen, is incompatible with the very existence of government, and therefore, since government is a divine ordinance, absolutely forbidden by the law of God-that very higher law invoked to justify resistance to civil enactments.... No man can ever be justifiable in resisting the civil law under the pretense that it is repugnant to the Divine law, when he has only his private judgment, or, what is the same thing, his private interpretation of the Sacred Scriptures, to tell him what the Divine law is on the point in question, because the principle on which he would act in doing so would be repugnant to the very existence of government, and therefore in contravention of the ordinance, therefore of the law, of God.
</blockquote><p>
Brownson's argument-which we have not time enough to analyze in full today-in substance is this, in his own words: "Mr. Seward and his friends asserted a great and glorious principle, but misapplied it." It was not for them to utter commands in the name of God. Their claims, if carried far enough, would lead to anarchy. The arguments of some of their adversaries would lead to Statolatry, the worship of the state.
<p><blockquote>
The cry for liberty abolishes all loyalty, and destroys the principle and the spirit of obedience, while the usurpations of the state leave to conscience no freedom, to religion no independence. The state tramples on the spiritual prerogatives of the Church, assumes to itself the functions of schoolmaster and director of consciences, and the multitude clap their hands, and call it liberty and progress!
</blockquote><p>
Brownson advocated compliance with the Fugitive Slave Law, which clearly was constitutional; indeed, obligatory under Article IV, Section 2 of the Constitution It was his hope to avert the Civil War which burst out ten years later. "Now there is a right and a wrong way of defending the truth, and it is always easier to defend the truth on sound than on unsound principles," he wrote. "If men were less blind and headstrong, they would see that the higher law can be asserted without any attack upon legitimate civil authority, and legitimate civil authority and the majesty of the law can be vindicated without asserting the absolute supremacy of the civil power, and falling into statolatry- as absurd a species of idolatry as the worship of sticks and stones."
<p>
Very possibly, ladies and gentlemen, you have found in these passages from "The Higher Law" and in Brownson's general argument various considerations highly relevant to our own era.
<p>
As Brownson remarks, the natural law (or law of God) and the American civil law are not ordinarily at swords' points. Large elements of natural law entered into the common law of England- and therefore into the common law of the United States-over the centuries; and the Roman law, so eminent in the science of jurisprudence, expresses the natural law enunciated by the Roman jurisconsults. No civilization ever has attempted to maintain the bed of justice by direct application of natural-law doctrines by magistrates; necessarily, it is by edict, rescript, and statute that any state keeps the peace through a system of courts. It simply will not do to maintain that private interpretation of natural law should be the means by which conflicting claims are settled.
<p>
Rather, natural law ought to help form the judgments of the persons who are lawmakers- whether emperors, kings, ecclesiastics, aristocratic republicans, or representatives of a democracy. The civil law should be shaped in conformity to the natural law-which originated, in Cicero's words, "before any written law existed or any state had been established."
<p>
It does not follow that judges should be permitted to push aside the Constitution, or statutory laws, in order to substitute their private interpretations of what the law of nature declares. To give the judiciary such power would be to establish what might be called an archonocracy, a domination of judges, supplanting the constitutional republic; also it surely would produce some curious and unsettling decisions, sweeping away precedent, which would be found highly distressing by friends to classical and Christian natural law. Only the Catholic Church, Brownson reasoned, has authority to interpret the laws of nature; but the Supreme Court of the United States, and the inferior federal courts, and our state courts, take no cognizance of papal encyclicals. Left to their several private judgments of what is "natural," some judges indubitably would do mischief to the person and the republic. The Supreme Court's majority decision in the case of Roe v. Wade-in which a pretended "right of privacy," previously unknown, was discovered-in actuality amounted to a declaration of the "natural right" of a mother to destroy her offspring.
<p>
Now it seems to me curiously naive to fancy that American courts always would subscribe to Thomistic concepts of the laws of nature, and abjure Jacobin doctrines of natural right. Courts of law must ordinarily accord with the general legislative authority; otherwise the Book of Judges is followed by the Book of Kings.
<p>
In the seventh edition of <i>The Conservative Mind,</i> I have written that the first canon of conservative thought is "Belief in a transcendent order, or body of natural law. Political problems, at bottom, are religious and moral problems. A narrow rationality, which Coleridge called the Understanding, cannot of itself satisfy human needs.... True politics is the art of apprehending and applying the Justice which ought to prevail in a community of souls."
<p>
Now Mr. Robert Bork, whose opinion as to the application of natural-law doctrines by members of the Supreme Court I have just now endorsed with some vigor, has taken notice of this. In an essay entitled "Natural Law and the Constitution," Mr. Bork advises my friend Mr. William Bentley Ball to abjure my exhortation of this sort. "The dictum also is inaccurate," Bork adds, "for it arbitrarily disqualifies as conservatives people who accept and struggle to preserve every conservative value but who do not believe that such values derive from a transcendent order." One might as well say, I suggest, that the Church ought not to emphasize the dogma of the Resurrection because that might alienate some people who are not Christians, but are possible well-wishers.
<p>
I have thought highly of Mr. Bork-although he seems to have no clear understanding of natural law and its function-but he appears to have thought lowly of me. Perhaps we both have been mistaken.
<p>
That federal judges, Mr. Bork included, have not been learned in the natural law is one of the educational misfortunes of our age. When the time is out of joint, we can repair to the teachings of Cicero and Aquinas and Hooker about the law of nature, in the hope that we may diminish man's inhumanity unto man. The natural law lacking, we may become so many Cains, and every man' s hand may be raised against every other man's.

<P>
All present in this room today are aware that the word "federal" does not mean "central." But the Congress of the United States, in recent decades, and frequently the Executive force, too, have been behaving as if unable to discern any distinction between the two terms. That way lies the collapse of the Constitution.
<p>
A simple instance of this occurred on Capitol Hill only nine days ago. We now have a new statute that prohibits servants of the federal government-and they are legion-from lodging in hotels (lodging at public expense, anyway) that do not have sprinklers in the ceilings of bedrooms. A few exemptions are granted, chiefly to hotels that stand less than four stories high. The act's premise is that by excluding non-complying hotels from federal patronage, virtually all innkeepers will find it necessary to install sprinklers (cost about $1,500 per room).The justification for this thoughtful legislation is that over the past six years, more than 400 persons have died in hotel fires in the United States. (Even I can master short division: this statistic, in effect, tells us that the hotel-fire death rate per annum per state has been 1.34 persons. I do not have to add statistics as to age and gender; at any rate, about one and one-third people, averaging the country over, have died in the average state in the average year, 1983-1989.) It is welt of course, to save lives; but a great many more lives might be saved by prohibiting the sale of skis through an act of Congress, or by a federal statute requiring all holders of real property to sprinkle salt on their sidewalks, whether part of the public way or private, after every snowfall.
<p>
My present point, however, is not the prudence or the expense of the act now on the statute books, but rather the political consequences of decreeing that the federal government shall prescribe and regulate all sorts of concerns previously left to the police powers of the several states and local agencies of government, or left to the sensible management of individuals, households, and firms. The Sprinkler Act is a sufficient instance of the continuing conversion of this country from a federal union for specified purposes to a centralized plebiscitary democracy, in which little discretion of choice is left to states and local communities, let alone private citizens.
<p>
<b>"Democratic Despotism."</b> Behold, Behemoth! While Americans are congratulating themselves and Europeans upon the collapse of socialist states beyond the demolished Iron Curtain, there continues to expand here in North America the empire of what Alexis deTocqueville called "democratic despotism." This is a grim tendency toward total centralization of which conservatives have long complained, in somewhat vague terms, but to which they have offered, so far, little effective resistance. Permit me to quote to you a very percipient passage in de Tocqueville's <I>Democracy in America:</I>
<p><blockquote>
I think then, that the species of oppression by which democratic nations are menaced is unlike anything that ever before existed in the world; our contemporaries will find no prototype of it in their memories. I seek in vain for an expression that will accurately convey the whole of the idea I have formed of it; the old words despotism and tyranny are inappropriate; the thing itself is new, and since I cannot name it, I must attempt to define it.
<P>
I seek to trace the novel features under which despotism may appear in the world. The first thing that strikes the observation is an innumerable multitude of men, all equal and all alike incessantly endeavoring to procure the petty and paltry pleasures with which they glut their lives. Each of them, living apart, is as a stranger to the fate of all the rest; his children and his private friends constitute to him the whole of mankind. As for the rest of his fellow citizens, he is close to them, but he does not see them; he touches them, but he does not feel them; he exists only in himself and for himself alone; and if his kindred still remain to him, he may be said at any rate to have lost his country.
<P>
Above this race of men stands an immense and tutelary power, which takes upon itself alone to secure their gratification and watch over their fate. That power is absolute, minute, regular, provident, and mild. It would be like the authority of a parent if, like that authority, its object was to prepare men for manhood; but it seeks, on the contrary, to keep them in perpetual childhood; it is well content that the people should rejoice, provided that they think of nothing but rejoicing. For their happiness such a government willingly labors, but it chooses to be the sole agent and only arbiter of their necessities, facilitates their pleasures, manages their principal concerns, directs their industry, regulates the descent of property, and subdivides their inheritances; what remains, but to spare them all the care of thinking and all the trouble of living?
<P>
Thus it every day renders the exercise of the free agency of man less useful and less frequent; it circumscribes the will within a narrower range and gradually robs the man of all the uses of himself. The principle of equality has prepared men for these things; it has predisposed them to endure them and often to look on them as benefits.
</blockquote><p>
De Tocqueville has in mind here, obviously, a central government the intentions of which are beneficent. But suppose that some intentions are not beneficent? Or that legislation might be intended to harass or to punish a class, a faction, or some minority? Where, under centralized democratic despotism, would the dissidents hide? At the moment, however, let us confine ourselves to acts and decisions of centralized power which, on their face, seem in tended-if perhaps in error-to confer benefits upon the public. Many such examples might be cited; I confine myself to two, both of which occurred during the presidential administration of Lyndon Johnson.
<p>
<b>Accusing Arizona.</b> The first of these had to do with governmental inspection of meat. Some inspectors from the federal Department of Agriculture happened to visit Arizona, and there came into conflict with Arizona's state meat inspectors. The two sets of officials parted in wrath; the gentlemen from Washington menacing the Arizonans that they would be taught their place. Back in the seats of the mighty, these bureaucrats sent word to their departmental superiors, and thence to the President of the United States, that ill-inspected and potentially poisonous meat was being approved for public sale by Arizona's negligent meat inspectors. On learning this dread secret, President Johnson saw opportunity for making the American nation aware of his solicitude for their well being: the Great White Father. On television, he revealed the iniquities of Arizona to a frightened people, crying out emphatically, "Get rid of rotten meat! Get rid of rotten meat!"
<p>
A complaisant Congress very, very promptly passed a new act regarding the inspection of all meat, much extending the jurisdiction and the activities of that branch of the Department of Agriculture, and subjecting all state meat-inspecting bureaus to federal jurisdiction. --How thoughtful for the welfare of the American people, from sea to shining sea!
<p>
But others, not federal employees, looked into this affair, and the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> published in some detail an account of what had occurred. It was discovered, tardily, that in truth standards of meat inspection had been high, not low; that in fact Arizona did not approve rotten meat of any sort; and that all this fuss had arisen out of minor disputations between federal and state officials. This revelation embarrassed and angered President Johnson, who had assumed that the Washington inspectors were honest and not spiteful; but he could scarcely go back on television, this time to cry, "Bring back rotten meat! Bring back rotten meat!" Nor did Congress trouble itself to repeal the statute, so recently enacted, that made state meat inspection standards wholly subordinate to federal regulations. Since then, federal courts have ruled that if a state has higher standards than the federal ones, nevertheless the state must admit within its jurisdiction meats that meet merely the lower federal standard. A mad world, my masters!
<p>
<b>Efficient Lobbyists.</b> Indulge me, ladies and gentlemen, in one more instance of this arrogating of power not merely over state jurisdictions, but over the American bedroom- -nay, the very bed and bedding. A federal agency abruptly ruled that all mattresses manufactured must be of the inner spring type-whether or not customers might prefer a plain cotton mattress or separate springs and mattress. This ukase, promptly enforced, put out of business many small makers of mattresses; it profited, however, big standard manufacturers who charged high prices; it appeared that lobbyists for the big mattress-making corporations had been at work efficiently in Washington. As for the American citizen who might prefer a simpler mattress and a cheaper, or for persons like your servant this lecturer, who possesses several ancestral antique beds that no inner spring mattress will fit-why, says Uncle Sam to such reactionaries, "Be comfortable, damn you, and expect to pay for it!"
<p>
I have not been able to ascertain under what fantastic interpretation of existing statutes the federal agency in question was able to prescribe the sort of mattress Americans must sleep upon. How could this possibly lie within the prescriptive jurisdiction of the general government-or, for that matter, within the police powers of the several states? Yet done the thing was. A related arbitrary regulation employed the pretext of securing the health of children-though of course that protection, too, ordinarily has been exercised by state and local authorities, or by voluntary organizations.
<p>
This latter instance of federal <i>pleonexia</i> had to do with children's nightwear. From on high in Washington it was decreed that all pajamas, nightgowns, and the like must be manufactured of fire-retardant fabrics, if children were to wear them and shops were so to display them. This measure was supposed to prevent infants from being burned alive in bed; much mention was made of the number of persons annually slain or scarred as a result of smoking in bed, though L at least, had been unaware that small children were given to smoking in bed. Enforced for a time, this paternal legislation caused severe loss to makers and retailers of children's standard nightwear who had large stocks in hand; also it conferred large commercial advantages upon those progressive manufacturers who already, doubtless through foresight and humane concern, were producing large qualities of fire retardant nightwear for tots.
<p>
But alas and lackaday! Scientific studies, within a few months, coincidentally revealed that fire-retardant nightwear indubitably has caused skin cancer, respiratory troubles, and other physical afflictions. The federal regulations in question were quietly rescinded, I believe; and I fancy that it is now permitted for us to clothe our infants with mere unadulterated cotton or wool.
<p>
<b>Grave Ills.</b> I have chosen these relatively harmless and mildly amusing instances of the excessive zeal of the Washington bureaucracy to centralize practically everything, ladies and gentlemen, lest I be taken for a dreadful scaremonger. Now and again some well-intentioned elderly lady assures me, benignly, "Uncle Sam knows what's best for us." I decidedly am not of that opinion Thorough political and economical centralization works ills much graver than the quality of meats, the distribution of bedsprings, and the fabric of nighties. For my part, I am of the opinion that deTocqueville, rather than Uncle Sam, knows what's best for us. Let me add that both John Adams, Federalist, and Thomas Jefferson, Democratic Republican, would have been astounded and indignant at the degree of centralization already well established among us, two centuries after the Constitution of the United States commenced to function. I fancy that neither one would have insisted upon a sprinkler being installed in his bedchamber, at the expense of a perversion of the Constitution.
<p>
The pretexts for giving a veneer of seeming Constitutionality to the concentration of power at Washington have been various. Our recent act to install sprinklers in hotel bedrooms is one of the less extravagant apologies-that is, it amounts merely to a refusal to pay the bills of federal employees who lodge at inns that have no sprinklers in bedrooms. (Of course every hotel in this country must be thoroughly inspected to ascertain the number of sprinklers.) Another and somewhat more severe form of compulsion is the refusal to pay any monies from the federal treasury to non-complying persons and institutions, as in the case of colleges and universities coerced into Affirmative Action programs and the like. Yet another method is the withdrawal of tax exemptions from institutions otherwise entitled to such exemptions, as in the case of Bob Jones University. The oldest method is the appeal of some federal department or federal agency to the commerce clause of the Constitution as the ground for justifying some surprising enlargement of the federal government's power; and of course that is the road taken by the Congress ever since the 182Os. The most common method employed to induce states and cities, and various voluntary associations, to submit to federal regulation is the matching grant-in-aid, often on a very large scale. And in a number of instances the Congress and Executive Branch have not troubled themselves to look for excuses in the Constitution: they simply have pushed through a piece of legislation, of national scope, without bothering to enquire whether by any stretch of the imagination such an act could be regarded as authorized by some provision of the Constitution.
<p>
<b>Consolidation By Degrees.</b> In consequence of all of this, the federal character of the United States, this country's chief contribution to the art of governance, has been fading to a shadow of a shade. And where Congress hesitated, the Supreme Court rushed in to nationalize the whole political structure. More mischief of this sort was accomplished during the reign of King Lyndon than during any other period of American history-considerably more, incidentally, than was accomplished during the reign of King Franklin-but in general the leaders of either major political party have made no strong effort to resist consolidation of power; and, after all, it has come about by degrees, not as a result of any announced design. No doubt a well-publicized plan for systematic centralization would have been hotly rejected by the American electorate; and among those opponents of deliberate centralization would have been a good many liberals.
<p>
A decay of historical consciousness among Americans has had its part in reducing resistance to the concentration of decision-making powers in the general government. Here I offer you two paragraphs written by C. Northcote Parkinson, the deviser of Parkinson's Law. Professor Parkinson declares that political centralization is the initial cause of the nation's decadence. She first stage on the downward path is one of over-centralization," Parkinson wrote in 1978.
<p><blockquote>
Everything is done to eliminate or neutralize all but the main and central seat of administration The lesser centers of power are either provincial governments or organizations which can be classified as religious, financial, military, or economic: an arch-bishopric, a national bank, a military command or a major industrial or trading group. The attempt to centralize all power in the one capital city and, indeed, in its administrative quarter, means the assimilation of all possible rival institutions from monasteries to television stations, from harbour authorities to charitable foundations. All these can be eliminated in the name of democracy or efficiency, and the result is the creation of the one government machine into which all problems are fed and from which all wisdom is to emerge. All that is initially lost is the likelihood of the government's having to listen to informed criticism from outside its inner circle of officials. Thereafter the problems centre upon the growing size and complexity of the central administration. As the civil servants multiply there is an ever-increasing distance between the citizen and the nameless people who will ultimately decide upon his application, protest, or appeal. Proceedings are cumbrous and attitudes are hierarchical, all decisions being referred from the periphery to the centre and then from the bottom to the top.
<P>
"If death come from Madrid," said sixteenth-century Spaniards, "we should all live to a very great age."
<P>
Much the same comment must have been made about Babylon, Peking, Persepolis, Delhi, and London. Less frequently noticed are two other results of over-centralisation. The first is that the normal processes of retirement and promotion will bring to the centre the people who have been robbed of all initiative while posted at the circumference. The second is that the capital city is now appallingly vulnerable to internal sedition or external assault. When all roads lead to Rome, all cables to London, the usual channels to Paris, the whole administrative machinery can be knocked out by a single rocket attack there are no centres of authority outside the target area, no alternative capital city to which a government might move. With the capital city gone, there is nothing left.
</blockquote><p>
Parkinson goes on to describe the second stage in the decline and fall of great states: the growth of taxation. But that is just another vast subject on which, conceivably, I may address you another time, ladies and gentlemen. Let me proceed, just now to my peroration. The worst thing about excessive concentration of power, I believe, is that in the long run such Behemoth centralization fails; and then the whole social structure falls apart, as is occurring in the Soviet empire at this moment.
<p>
Reasons exist why a supplanting of the old constitutional order, if completed, would present most serious dangers to American order and justice and freedom. I will mention only four of these perils.
<p>
<b>Too Much Work.</b> The first is the problem of efficiency. The general government is designed to carry out certain responsibilities, fairly well defined: most notably, the conduct of foreign relations, the defense of the country, and the management of undertakings too widespread for any one state in the Union to manage. But already the government here in Washington is dismayingly oppressed by too much work and too many servants. By endeavoring to do everything, the Washington government might end in doing nothing successfully.
<p>
The second problem is of scale. Measures which the provincial governors at Graz or Innsbruck would refuse to entrust to Vienna are proposed in America as if the governing of two hundred and fifty million people were little more difficult than the conduct of a town meeting-and quite as democratic-as long as President and Congress are still elected. I have heard American advocates of social-welfare measures, for instance, seriously advance the example of social-democratic legislation in Denmark as a precedent for American policy -though some American counties, not to mention states, are larger than Denmark, and other counties have more people than there are Danes.
<p>
Appeals against imprudent or unjust administration become immensely difficult when they are only the faint voices of individuals or local groups opposed to the prestige and influence of administrators at the capital; indeed, the chief administrators themselves cannot possibly look deeply into such complaints. Detailed administration on such a scale would require from civil servants a wisdom and a goodness never experienced in human history. "Well, appeal to your Congressman," centralizers say, perhaps ingenuously. But Congressmen already do not have time enough to answer the mail from their more important constituents, let alone act as so many Don Quixotes of the mass state.
<p>
<b>Habit of Command.</b> The third difficulty I raise here is the problem of leadership. Centralized political power functions smoothly only in nations accustomed to defer to the measures and opinions of a governing class-that is, in aristocratic or autocratic lands. Soviet centralization would have failed altogether, and almost at once, had it not been for the long-established powers of the Old Regime at Moscow and St. Petersburg. And such a body of decision makers, of governors, of aristocrats, must possess a high degree of self-confidence and the habit of command. They must be accustomed to dealing with deferential populations.
<p>
But these United States, accustomed to territorial democracy, have no class of leaders and administrators competent to undertake the consolidated direction which the centralizers propose. I do not discern a class of men here competent to rule wisely this immense nation, once territorial democracy and the federal framework-both principal schools of national leadership-should be undone.
<p>
Fourth, even had we a class of Winchester old-school-tie administrators, I do not know how we could expect the most expert of statists to direct paternally and justly the concerns of this nation, once local volition and private self-reliance had been seriously weakened. A man has but twenty-four hours in his day, and can read only a limited number of papers. Such centralization defeats its own object, in persons as in departments. The man-killing job of the presidency-to which centralizers will add numerous fresh responsibilities-may be sufficient illustration of my meaning.
<p>
<b>Unmanageable People.</b> To destroy, or let atrophy, territorial democracy and the federal system in America is quite possible; but it is less easy to provide some alternative satisfactory scheme of politics. Once the principle of volition, with the sense of participation and local decision, vanishes from American life, Americans are liable to become an unmanageable people. On a grander and more catastrophic scale, we might see again the resistance to authority and resort to violence which were provoked by the Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act. Both the Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act were "democratically" adopted; but somehow national positive democracy is not the same thing as territorial prescriptive democracy. Indeed, already we see great American cities in anarchy from time to time-the anarchists those people, black or white, who feel they have been excluded from full participation in society. What would occur when the majority should fell excluded from decision making?
<p>
Within a few years, if not immediately, any "guided democracy" or "plebiscitary democracy" would meet with evasion and hostility everywhere, and among the results of this could come a diminishing of the really effectual and popular authority of the general government. The energies and loyalties of volition would have been supplanted by the compulsions of a latter-day Jacobism, or of the Directory. And a great big Federal Bureau of Investigation would not be able to enforce the decrees of such a regime; for though a new broom sweeps clean, and an elite federal detective force aiding the local police is one thing, a permanent national secret police would be quite another-and possibly disagreeable to some of the "liberal" advocates of centralization. For that matter, a garrison of federal troops in every city might not suffice to keep order.
<p>
Yet life still rises in the tree of American federalism, and territorial democracy's powers of resistance and reaction ought not to be disregarded. It is true, as deTocqueville remarked, that men in power generally feel impelled to augment central power, while the opponents of centralization are either stupid or powerless. Notwithstanding this, attachment to the doctrines of division of authority and of state and local powers remains so popular in the United States that an intelligent plan for preserving the old system would obtain a hearing, and stand some chance of enactment.
<p>
<b>Buttressing the Structure.</b> An enormous, unitary omnicompetent nation-state cannot abide the American political tradition of cake and custom. If the federal system is obsolete, then we ought to prepare to train the leaders of a new order, and to define the character of that domination, novel to us. If territorial democracy deserves to live, if the federal system has virtue still, then the constitutional structure ought to be buttressed and helped to function. At present, most of the Americans qualified to think about such matters decline to take either of these courses. They are willing to let the norms of politics shift for themselves -which is not according to nature.
<p>
Such is another huge prospect for conservatives. Let us hope that the rising generation of conservatives may have the courage and the imagination required to avert the triumph of the centralizers; for that triumph would be followed swiftly enough by the decay of the American Republic.

<P>
Let me commence with two aphorisms, widely separated in time and substance.
<P>
The first is the observation of Aristotle that it is unjust to treat unequal things equally.
<P>
The second is the declaration of Marx that to establish equality, first we must establish inequality.
<P>
These two assumptions have been at war one with the other during the twentieth century.

What did Aristotle mean by writing that to treat unequal things equally is unjust? He meant that not all human beings are worthy of the same deserts, that not all actions are equally honorable and commendable, that not all works are of equally enduring value; so to confer equal rewards upon excellence and mediocrity would be profoundly unjust to the more deserving of praise. "To each his own."
<p>
What did Marx mean by asserting that inequality must be established before equality might be attained? He meant that the mighty must be pulled down from their seats, the alleged exploiters expropriated, whole classes destroyed-presumably by a general blood-letting-before the earthly paradise of communism might be realized. The bourgeois and all other opponents of socialist progress must be thoroughly discriminated against by the revolutionary proletariat. The bourgeois should be indulged no equality with the son of toil.
<p>
The Marxist regime in the Soviet Union fell at last after seven decades of terror and suffering; but the notion that "social justice" means equality of condition still works among us. In the connection, I commend you to three books: F. A. Hayek's <i>The Mirage of Social Justice;</i> Helmut Schoeck's <i>Envy: A Theory of Social Behavior;</i> and Gonzalo Fernandex de la Mora's <i>Egalitarian Envy: The Political Foundations of Social Justice.</i> The second book is by a German, the third by a Spaniard; it is a sign of the surviving domination of socialist assumptions about justice in America that these latter books scarcely were reviewed at all in the United States, though editions of both were published here. They deny the notion that there can exist a perfect social justice, attainable by positive law and social engineering; and their authors are agreed that the perfectly egalitarian society would be an unjust society. Let me suggest, also, that those present today would find a keen analysis of socialist errors about justice in a book of yesteryear of which I brought out a new edition some three years ago: W. H. Mallock's <i>A Critical Examination of Socialism.</i>
<p>
"All the four authors I mentioned a moment ago touch upon the vice of envy and its ruinous personal and social consequences. To that vice the Marxists appealed successfully in much of the world. "Why shouldst thou sit, and I stand?" cries incarnate Envy, in Marlowe' s play <i>Dr. Faustus.</i> "Come away!" Social justice will be attained, the poor are told, when they have unseated the affluent and supplanted them in their possessions. Such doctrines have devastated most of Asia and Africa ever since the Second World War, causing the massacre of the old leading classes, most hideously in the Congo-now Zaire-Portugese Timor, Portuguese Guinea, Chad, Viet Nam, Cambodia, and China. Yet the earthly paradise of social justice did not result from this slaughter: instead, squalid oligarchs and men of blood succeeded to power, and general impoverishment has been experienced. Perhaps we see today the beginning of such a progress toward social justice in the Republic of South Africa. Such is the justice of "the good old rule, the good old plan, that they shall take who have the power, and they shall keep who can."
<p>
Until recent decades, nevertheless, socially ruinous envy of this sort was not really powerful in the United States, and did not provoke a powerful political movement for such a restructuring of the economy as would even the scores. During several years of the Great Depression, my parents and my little sister and I lived in an old dwelling near the railway yards at Plymouth, Michigan, my father being a railroad engineman. Our house had no bathroom; its <i>necessarium</i> was an outdoor privy, inconvenient under snow. (We had thought we were buying the house on land contract, but it turned out that the man who pretended to sell the dwelling to us had no proper title to it himself, and so my parents lost their investment and went back to renting; they never did succeed in owning any house, lifelong.) Weekly there arrived in our house the newspaper of the Railway Brotherhoods, entitled <i>Labor.</i> In almost every issue there appeared a cartoon of a literally bloated Capitalist, in evening dress, smoking a bloated cigar; and such exploiters of the working poor were denounced in editorials.
<p>
But these circumstances and publications did not wake envy in my parents. They took it for granted that some people, whether by talent or by inheritance or by mere chance, prosper materially in life, while other people do not; this, they knew, was in the nature of things. They had a subsistence, and kinfolk, and love. The caricatures of the Bloated Capitalist did not rouse my father's wrath; my father did indeed think that the railroads were ill-managed, and that increasing centralization of the economy was to be regretted, and that pride would have a fall on Wall Street, as indeed came to pass; but I never heard my parents utter a word of envy. Things will be as they will be, they took it.
<p>
Blessed are those children reared in a household innocent of the deadly sin of envy. Their lives will not be tormented by a grinding resentment that they are not beautiful, or famous, or favored with the gifts of fortune. They will not demand as a natural right or an entitlement a presumptuous personal equality with everybody under the sun; nor maintain that their opinions are as good as anybody else' s. They will not covet a neighbor's goods. And thus they may come to know peace of soul. They will perceive the wisdom in these lines of a very early poem in Scots vernacular:
<p><i><blockquote>
I saw this written on a wall: <br>In what estate, man, that thou fall <br>Accept thy lot, and thank thy God of all.
</blockquote></i><p>
But I do not mean to imply that every form of equality is the work of envy. The Christian doctrine of equality has worked much moral good. This is the teaching that all souls are equal in the ultimate judgment of God; that God is no respecter of persons. Yet God separates the goats from the sheep; in my Father's house are many mansions, but they are not all on the same floor. God's ultimate judgment is not affected by rank and station, wealth or power, here below. All that matters, in the end, is goodness of heart; so sometimes the last, at the judgment seat, shall be first.
<p>
And the jurisprudential principle of equal justice under law, too, has worked much social good. The law also is no respecter of persons: the king himself is under the law, as Bracton put it in medieval times. Neither in civil nor in criminal cases, declares the system of law which Americans have inherited from Britain, does any class of persons enjoy privileges or immunities. This doctrine keeps the peace; and to keep the peace is the object of all law.
<p>
Whether political equality has worked much good is another matter. In most of the world, attempts at enduring and peaceful democracy have failed. Constitutional democracy of the successful sort has been confined chiefly to English-speaking countries, which have inherited the British historical experience. And even in such countries, who can doubt that democracy, political equality, is in grave trouble nowadays? Is not the United States being converted into a "plebiscitary democracy," with an election of the temporary dictator every four years, actually governed by a centralized bureaucracy nominally under the supervision of a body of squabbling politicians. How much genuine democracy of the sort discerned in America by Tocqueville, what Brownson called "territorial democracy," will remain by the middle of the twenty-first century?-Even today, indeed, how much political equality remains in elections determined chiefly by what candidates have the most money to spend on television broadcasts?
<p>
But political equality is too large and complex a subject for me to discuss today. I turn, therefore to the subject of equality of condition-that is, equality of incomes and other material rewards, equality in education, equality of mores, manners, lodgings, and tastes. It is this envious passion for equality of condition against which Tocqueville warned his time and ours. The total triumph of the doctrine of equality of condition would be a triumph of injustice. Unthinking demands for an equality allegedly just notwithstanding, a society in which everybody should be precisely in the condition of everybody else would be a thoroughly unjust society.
<p>
Zealots throughout the centuries have endeavored to establish communities totally egalitarian; all those endeavors have failed after much suffering. Utopians in the Greek and Roman eras, the Levellers and Diggers of England in the seventeenth century, Babeuf and his fellow conspirators of 1791, and the communist ideologues who held power in the Russian system for seven decades-these are only some of the enthusiasts for equality who for a time established a domination of equality in misery, collapsing soon or late because contrary to human nature. Yet, as Hegel wrote, we learn from history that we learn nothing from history. What failed disastrously in the late Soviet Union, a good many Americans now seek to enact in these United States.
<p>
The instrument of the doctrinaire egalitarian in America is not violent revolution, but employment of taxation-which, as John Marshall declared in the Dartmouth College case, is the power to destroy. A leveller pulls down the more prosperous classes in society through crushing taxation, levied to pay for "entitlements" for an abstraction called The Poor-in effect, to maintain a growing proletariat that contribute nothing much to society except their offspring. Rostovtzeff and other writers on Roman times have drawn the analogy between bread and circuses and the modern dole or "welfare" measures: in the Empire, the emperor with his soldiery united with the Roman mob to extort revenue from the propertied classes-until at last the ancient economy collapsed, and the frontiers could not be defended. Clinton Caesar, eager to placate the Welfare Lobby, proposes to establish new overwhelming "entitlements," particularly medical ones, to be paid for by employers-for of course the wealth of employers is assumed to be inexhaustible. As in the age of Diocletian men fled from public offices, lest they be taxed and regulated to extinction, so by the approaching end of this century employers may be inclined to flee to some other condition of life-but to what?
<p>
The mentality of the American leveller nowadays may be sufficiently suggested by a proposal advanced by some of Clinton's inner circle but not presented to the Congress. This was a new tax: a levy upon persons dwelling in large houses. If the residence should contain rooms which might have been rented, had the owner desired, to paying lodgers (or perhaps non-paying homeless persons)-why, the owner of the dwelling would be taxed for the rooms that might have been occupied by other people. This tax would have been a federal levy, not a local real-property assessment. It is just the sort of tax to have been devised by some former hippie, now a bureaucrat, spiritually akin to President Clinton, former hippie himself. The real purpose of this strange proposal clearly was punitive, meant to punish those wicked rich who possessed spare bedrooms. Make them pay through the nose for such undemocratic private possession of domestic amenities! An Englishman's home once upon a time may have been his castle; but now an American' s home should be his own only upon the sufferance of the Washington bureaucracy. If such a one should lodge homeless persons in his dining room, say, he might be indulged in a partial remission of taxes. One is reminded of housing in Moscow about the year 1919, when the communist regime requisitioned even the lavatories of private residences as night lodging for the underprivileged. Envious egalitarianism as implemented by Clintonian zealots might not be satisfied until the whole population of this land should be lodged in immobilized "mobile homes"-a universal rookery of trailer camps. Why should anybody be indulged in domestic comforts not readily available to all citizens?
<p>
Have I carried to absurdity my argument against equality of condition? Nay, not so; for the enthusiasts for total equality are not to be satisfied with small concessions. I commend to you a dystopia, -a longish short story, by Jacquetta Hawkes, that brilliant Englishwoman of diverse talents, published in her collection <i>Fables</i>-which volume appeared in 1952, during Britain's disagreeable experience with a socialist regime.
<p>
This fable is entitled "The Unites." God, having sensed no impulses from the planet Earth for a long while, dispatches a humble angel to investigate and report to Him. This emissary, who had visited Earth once long, long before, discovers on this later expedition that humankind has suffered a startling change for the worse. No longer, indeed, do men and women call themselves humans: they style themselves "Unites," for all are united in a kind of sub-human state, everybody precisely like everybody else. These degenerate beings live in some 500,000 Life Units dispersed about the globe, and subsist by primitive agriculture. Private property has been abolished altogether. Every Life Unit consists of four standard tenements: the Pink Block for the young, the Green Block for the cultivators, the Red Block for the industrial workers, the Black Block for the administrators and the governments. Kinship and family life have been swept away, as disruptive of social unity. If equality is the whole aim of existence, why should one person outlive another? There must be equality in death as in life. So on attaining the age of sixty-six, the older Unites are herded into the Finis Chamber of the Black Block, suffocated there, and their bodies incinerated. The only amusement in these Life Unit communes is a colossal sort of motor-drome in which some of the performers bloodily perish, to the crowd's satisfaction.
<p>
In short, through the doctrine of equality of condition what once was the human race has transformed itself into a moral condition scarcely distinguishable from that of the beasts which perish. And yet a few true human beings, eager to subvert this life-in-death, have survived somehow in Life Unit 1457. The visiting angel learns that this handful of young people are contriving to bring down the dreary system of equality. Indeed their slogan "Equality must be destroyed" prevails; the stupidity of the egalitarian administrators cannot resist the innovators; and in one Life Unit, at least, inequality is happily triumphant. But even so, the angel detects some ideologue of equality plotting already to bring back equal misery; thus the struggle between the forces of individual achievement and the forces of equality runs on in human societies. There are no lost causes because there are no gained causes.
<p>
Jacquetta Hawkes's fable or parable is set in a distant future; but in the closing decade of this century we move in that egalitarian direction. Equality is demanded in politics and in monetary incomes; more, it is demanded in formal education. My wife, Annette, ten years ago was a member of the Commission on Excellence in Education appointed by President Reagan. She promptly found that many folks in the federal Department of Education, and many educationists in teachers' colleges and teachers' unions, were concerned chiefly for what they called "equity"-that is, equality, sameness, at every level of schooling. Some insisted that American education must have both excellence and equity, a manifest absurdity: for the word "excellence" means to exceed, of course, to do better than others; while "equity," or uniformity, necessarily implies mediocrity. The more equality in schooling, the lower the achievement; and the greater the injustice toward students possessed of some talents. Forty years ago, I resigned a university post in disgust at a deliberate policy of lowering standards in the interest of "equity"-that is accommodating more students who, from stupidity or indolence, ought not to have been admitted to a university at all. In general, American standards for an education allegedly "higher" have declined still more since I departed from the Ivory Tower.
<p>
Egalitarian pressures are exerted in virtually every country to push into the universities most of the rising generation, however dull, bored, or feckless a young person may be. The consequence of this movement is to make the higher learning lower. Avoiding the dullness of most graduate studies in the United States, in 1948 I went abroad for my higher learning-to St. Andrews University, still -somewhat medieval in appearance, the oldest of Scottish universities, situated in a charming medieval town. Nowadays St. Andrews is under political pressure to change its character by admitting many more students, which would destroy the tradition of learning there by the North Sea. For what reason? Why, to "give everybody his chance." Perhaps we ought to confer the doctorate upon every infant at birth, and reserve the universities for people really interested in right reason and imagination, so eliminating degree-snobbery and degree-envy. The present disorders of the intellect on most campuses result from the combination of ideologue egalitarians among the professors with ignorant -and bored students.
<p>
Permit me to suggest some probable long-run consequences of national infatuation with equality of condition.
<p>
First, great injury to the leading class that every society requires for its success. This leading class is not identical with sociological "elites"; to ascertain the distinction, read T. S. Eliot's slim book <i>Notes Towards the Definition of Culture.</i> This leading class, even in the American democracy, is made up of public-spirited men and women of property; well-educated professional folk, lawyers among them; honest politicians who take long views; publishers and writers who help to shape public opinion on a diversity of matters; the clergy; persons experienced in military affairs, foreign affairs, and the arts of political administration; local leaders in charitable and civic concerns; those people of industry and commerce who know that there is more to life than getting and spending. I am even willing to acknowledge among this leading class some of the better professors of arts and sciences-although Nietzsche reminds us that in politics the professor always plays the comic role.
<p>
The authority of this class of persons in America has been declining in recent decades, from a variety of causes; and the decay in public and private morality, the decadence of education, the shallow populist tone of our politics, and a number of other afflictions result in considerable part from that decline of authority. Now a renewed demand for levelling assails this leading class. For one thing, it was possible for members of this leading class to take part in public and charitable concerns, and to set the whole tone of life in their communities, because most of them possessed some private means; they were not daily money-grubbing. Increasingly this class is being pushed to the wall by heavy-nay, savage-taxation. Most people here will have noticed how in the past few years various deductions and exemptions have been eliminated from income-tax returns, particularly for persons with incomes exceeding $100,000; for such folk, medical deductions from income are a thing of the past. Now the Clinton Administration imposes new burdens, falling principally upon the class I have just been describing. Many will pay more than half their incomes in taxes- federal and state income taxes, real-property taxes, sales taxes, and the rest. What margin will remain for such people to exercise the functions of voluntary leadership?
<p>
The late Michael Harrington, a few years past, was addressing a crowd of poor people. He said that too many affluent people were paying less than half their incomes in income tax. He was surprised by the reaction of his audience. They were indignant at Harrington's proposal that the state should take more than half a man's income, however large that income. "That's just not fair." some of them cried. His audience was right and Harrington wrong. And perhaps some in his audience perceived, better than did Harrington, what would happen to a society-including persons of very modest incomes-in which the Leviathan state should kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.
<p>
Already many of you here today, and for that matter your servant, are paying more than half their incomes in taxation. Our time occupied in trying to make ends meet, how much leadership shall we be able to offer? More and more, in such circumstances, the remnant of authority and the power of decision-making are usurped by a centralized bureaucracy-and in the name of "democracy."
<p>
Second, an obsession with equality commonly results in general impoverishment, by diminishing saving and capital accumulation, and by "humanitarian" welfare measures that diminish the incentive to work for one's own subsistence. Egalitarian "entitlements" already have so increased the national debt that, as matters are drifting, the amount of interest on the national debt, annually, will come to exceed the total federal revenues collected by the present tax structure!
<p>
Decreased economic productivity, caused by a virtual oppression of industry and commerce, will afflict the poor worst of all-even though the mistaken policies of government were undertaken in the name of equality of condition for the alleged poor.
<p>
A third consequence of deliberate levelling in society would be grave intellectual damage, already in progress. Over the centuries there was developed in all civilized countries an elaborate edifice of schooling, originally religious in character, meant to impart some measure of wisdom and virtue to the rising generation. Aristotle instructs us that the process of learning cannot be made easy. The higher learning is concerned necessarily with abstractions, in large part; but the common man tends to dislike abstractions. As T. S. Eliot said once, there ought to be many different kinds of education for many different kinds of people; but the egalitarian zealot would enforce uniformity of schooling, perhaps of the "outcomes education" sort to produce conditioned responses, now being pushed in Virginia, Michigan, and other states.
<p>
The black-militant outcry against the study of the works of "dead white males" suggests what a thoroughly egalitarian system of schooling would discard. Thought always is painful; so let us get on with the rap sessions.
<p>
Those intellectual disciplines that nurture right reason and moral imagination, requiring real thought, are unpopular with the egalitarian, who regards them as archaic and snobbish. The egalitarian much prefers utilitarian schooling and vague "social studies." But both private wisdom and public order require that a substantial number of people be well acquainted with genuine works of the mind. The natural sciences, humane studies, and the philosophical habit of mind neglected, the person and the republic sink into ignorance and apathy; but the egalitarian zealot does not perceive these ruinous consequences until the decline no longer can be arrested. The condition of most of our public schools today, and the inferior performance of most colleges and universities by contrast with their work half a century ago, ought to suggest to us how far, as a people, we already have slipped down the slope toward intellectual failure. What I say of American education is quite as true of British education nowadays, and, with few exceptions of Europe generally. But the educational egalitarian is not deterred-not quite yet: so long as "everybody has equal opportunity" to spend four or five years in an educational establishment professedly higher, social justice has been achieved, he fancies.
<p>
In short, ladies and gentlemen, I have been arguing that it is profoundly unjust to endeavor to transform society into a tableland of equality. It would be unjust to the energetic, reduced to equality with the slack and indolent; it would be unjust to the imaginative, compelled to share the schooling and the tastes of the dull; it would be unjust to the thrifty, compelled to make up for the losses of the profligate; it would be unjust to those who take long views, forced to submit to the domination of a majority interested chiefly in short-run results.
<p>
But I shall not labor this point, already made forcefully by Alexis de Tocqueville and other writers whose talents exceed my. own. The egalitarian society, far from satisfying desires for "social justice," would be unjust to the very people who made possible a tolerably orderly and prosperous society. Eric Voegelin remarks that the tolerably just society is one in which the more aspiring natures are free to exercise their talents, but the large majority of people, who desire merely a quiet life,-are secured against oppression by the aspiring natures. Mediocre necessarily, the egalitarian society would discourage or suppress enterprising talents-which would result in social stagnation. Life in a social tableland of equality would be infinitely boring.
<p>
Yet don't I believe in equality of <i>opportunity?</i> No, friends, I do not. The thing is not possible. First of all, genetic differences cannot be surmounted between individual and individual; Thomas Jefferson and the whole school of "created free and equal" knew nothing whatsoever of human genetics, a science of the late nineteenth and the twentieth centuries. Second, opportunity depends greatly upon family background and nurturing; and unless it is proposed to sweep away the family altogether, as in Jacquetta Hawkes's fable, the rising generation of one stock will differ greatly in opportunity from the rising generation of a different family. For instance, I read every evening to my four little daughters, or told them stories; while my neighbors did not so instruct and converse with their children; accordingly, my children have enjoyed superior opportunities in life. It would be outrageously unjust to try somehow to wipe out these advantages of genetic inheritance or familial instruction.
<p>
Inequality is the natural condition of human beings; charity may assist those not favored by nature; but attempts to impose an artificial equality of condition and intellect, although in the long run they fail, meanwhile can work great mischief in any society, and-still worse-damage human nature itself.

Leviathan is a Hebrew word signifying "that which gathers itself in folds." In the Old Testament, Leviathan is the great sea-beast: "Canst thou draw out leviathan with a hook?" In the 17th century, Thomas Hobbes-whom T.S. Eliot calls "that presumptuous little upstart"- made Leviathan the symbol of the state, or rather of mass-society, composed of innumerable little atomic individual human beings.
<p>
Today I am concerned not with Hobbes, but with Donald Davidson and his book <i>The Attack on Leviathan</i>. In 1938, long before the administration of Lyndon Johnson popularized the slogan "The Great Society," Davidson wrote that his Leviathan is "the idea of the Great Society, organized under a single, complex, but strong and highly centralized national government, motivated ultimately by men's desire for economic welfare of a specific kind rather than their desire for personal liberty." Four decades later, Leviathan looms larger than ever.
<p>
The southern states that once formed the Confederacy have been the most conservative region of America, it is generally agreed. Once upon a time, Richard Weaver told me that Middle Tennessee is the most southern part of the South. There in Middle Tennessee, near the town of Pulaski, in 1893, Donald Davidson was born. Surely Davidson was the most redoubtably conservative of those able American men of letters who have been called the Southern Agrarians. As poet, as critic, as historian, and as political thinker, Davidson was a stalwart defender of America's permanent things during an era of radical change.
<p>
<b>Scourging the Centralizers.</b> I propose to discuss with you Donald Davidson as the latter-day champion of the South's political and social inheritance. Ever since the forming of the Union in 1787, the dominant political tendency in the southern states has been resistance to the centralizing of power. Far more than any other region, the South has set its face against Leviathan-that is, against the swelling omnipotent nation-state, what Tocqueville called "democratic despotism," the political collectivity that reduces men and women to social atoms. In his strong book <i>The Attack on Leviathan</i>, published in 1938, Davidson scourged the centralizers- and that at a time when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was doing much as he liked with the United States of America.
<p>
Permit me first to say something about Davidson and his writings; and then to discuss the social principles for which the Southern Agrarians and their allies stood.
<p>
Browsing in the library at Michigan State College, in 1938, an earnest sophomore, I happened upon a new book, published by the University of North Carolina Press, entitled <i>The Attack on Leviathan,</I> subtitled <i>Regionalism and Nationalism in the United States.</i> It was written eloquently, and for me it made coherent the misgivings I had felt concerning the political notions popular in the 1930s. The book was so good that I assumed all intelligent
<p>
Americans, or almost all, were reading it. Actually, as I learned years later, the University of North Carolina Press pulped the book's sheets after only a few hundred copies had been sold: clearly an act of discrimination against conservative views. I had a hand in the reprinting of the book by another firm in 1963; and now I aspire to bring out a third printing in the Library of Conservative Thought, which I edit for Transaction Books.
<p>
Opinion Shapers. Professor Davidson rowed against the tide of opinion among America's intellectuals in 1938. Centralizing nationalism, he argued, is of necessity tyrannical and enslaving. For a specimen of his method and style, take this passage from his chapter on American literature. He has been criticizing Emerson, and he finds that the opinion shapers of New York and Boston during the 1930s are Emerson's heirs:
<p><blockquote>
In our own time, the metropolitan critics are making national prescriptions that are equally partial, though somewhat more confused. In one sentence they assure us that the industrial unification of America is desirable and inevitable; but in the next sentence they declare that the civilization thus produced puts upon us an intolerable spiritual bondage from which the artist cannot escape save through the shibboleths of Marxism and Freudianism. Wearily, they proclaim that America is standardized; but angrily they scorn the rural backwardness of regions that prove to be, after all, less urban than New York. Confidently they announce that America must be industrialized; but they sneer at Mr. Babbitt of the Middle West, the creature of industrialism. They urge the provinces to adopt the intellectual sophistication of the Eastern metropolis; but among themselves they bewail the poverty of the modern temper, which in its sophistication has left them nothing to enjoy.
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>Now could one write, in this year of 1989, a better description of the mentality of such American intellectuals? One might substitute, of course, the phrase "the industrial unification of the world" for that of America; for nowadays the whole of the world must be subjected to those environmental mischiefs and social discontents that already have worked immense harm in the "developed countries."
<p>
<b>Sword of Imagination.</b> Davidson was bold enough to defend the agricultural economy against industrial aggrandizement. (Parenthetically, it seems worth remarking that in recent years the dollar volume of agricultural produce in the industrial state of Michigan has exceeded the dollar volume of manufactured products.) Bolder still, he took up the cause of his own region, the South, against the nationalizers of New York and Washington. He appreciated, too, other American regions: New England, the Great Plains, the Lake States, the Pacific coast. But it was the South which required the service of Davidson's sword of imagination.
<p>
"Can principles enunciated as Southern principles, of whatever cast, get a hearing?" he inquired in <i>The Attack on Leviathan.</I>
<p><blockquote>
...It seems to be a rule that the more special the program and the more remote it is from Southern principles, the greater the likelihood of its being discussed and promulgated. Southerners who wish to engage in public discussion in terms that do not happen to be of common report in the New York newspapers are likely to be met, at the levels where one would least expect it, with the tactics of distortion, abuse, polite tut-tutting, angry discrimination and so on down to the baser devices of journalistic lynching which compose the modern propagandist's stock in trade. This is an easy and comparatively certain means of discrediting an opponent and of thus denying him a hearing. It is also a fatal means. For if such approaches to public questions are encouraged and condoned, then confusion has done its work well, the days of free and open discussion of ideas is over in the South, only matters of crass expediency can come into the public forum at all, and we face the miserable prospect of becoming the most inert and passive section of the United States, or else of falling into blind and violent divisions whose pent-up forces will hurl us at each other's throats. Then will Jefferson's prophetic vision come true. We shall take to eating one another, as they do in Europe.
</blockquote>
<p>
Such matters have not much improved since Davidson wrote those sentences, half a century past: the South continues to be treated by Congress as if it were a subject province (in voter registration especially), and the New York newspapers remain ungenerous.
<p>
<b>Urban Symbol.</b> New York City was to Donald Davidson the abomination of desolation. He and his wife spent their summers at Middlebury College in Vermont; and Davidson took extraordinary pains to avoid passing through New York City en route. For that matter, he detested sprawling modern cities generally, Nashville included, though he found it necessary to reside most of his life in the neighborhood of Vanderbilt University. To his volume of poems <i>The Tall Men</i> (published in 1927) Davidson had a prologue, She Long Street," the antithesis of the rural Tennessee of yesteryear, that land of heroes. That Long Street-I think of devastated Woodward Avenue in Detroit- is the symbol of a dehumanized urban industrial culture:
<p><blockquote>

The grass cannot remember; trees cannot <br>
Remember what once was here. But even so, <br>
They too are here no longer. Where is the grass? <br>
Only the blind stone roots of the dull street <br>
And the steel thews of houses flourish here <br>
And the baked curve of asphalt, smooth, trodden <br>
Covers dead earth that once was quick with grass, <br>
Snuffing the ground with acrid breath the motors <br>
Fret the long street. Steel answers steel. Dust whirls. <br>
Skulls hurry past with the pale flesh yet clinging <br>
And a little hair. <br>

</blockquote>
<p>
Thirty-five years later, Davidson published another volume of verse, to which he transferred the title <i>The Long Street.</i> In his poem "Old Sailor's Choice" he describes Ulysses's voyage to hell and beyond. Contrary to the counsels of a modern Circe, Ulysses chooses Charybdis over Scylla, though modern men lust for Scylla's deadly embrace, "the monstrous lips, the darting neck of their love-death." Davidson describes the ensnaring monster Scylla, a very modern horror:
<p><blockquote>
Within her cliffs of sheer synthetic rock<br>
She glides on steely pathways. Plastic walls<br>
Checkered in pseudo-marble cavern her lair.<br>
These throw you off guard. "How," you ask,<br>
 Can anything go wrong where all is right- <br>
Rectangular, side-ruled, and functional? <br>
Mercy, pity, peace can be manufactured. <br>
Scylla can end your pain <br>
Now that the State decrees a tax increase <br>
And no one can complain. <br>
The neat-cut stencil echoes the brisk type. <br>
Machines do the rest. The postage is metered. <br>
And there is your release: <br>
Well-packaged, mercy, pity, peace. <br>
And I saw the stretching neck and the grinning teeth <br>
In the soundproof room where artificial daylight <br>
Blacks out the scudding clouds and the churning storm-wrack <br>
And the secretary with half-naked breasts <br>
Extends the telephone on a crimson claw <br>
And murmurs Washington is calling! <br>
</blockquote>
<p>
Washington did not call Donald Davidson, who was a guardian of the permanent things, which perish on the pavements of the Long Street. The Scylla of "Old Sailor's Choice" is the enormous welfare state, which devours the spirit.
<p>
Poetic Works of Politics. We return to Davidson's prose. Politics, I never tire of repeating, is the art of the possible-and the preoccupation of the quarter-educated. That is, politics ranks low in order of precedence of the works of the mind, if one refers simply to defecated political theory and practice, cut off from revelation and right reason and imagination. But Professor Davidson never divorced politics from religion or imaginative literature or tradition. He knew that the greatest works of politics are poetic. In his later collection of essays entitled <i>Still Rebels, Still Yankees</i> (1957), he writes about the dissociation of the poet from society, now
<p><blockquote>

...painfully apparent as society has accepted the dominance of science and consequently has become indisposed to accept poetry as truth.... In this phase of operations the poet may well become an outright traditionalist in religion, politics, and economics. He examines the defects of modern civilization. He develops a sense of catastrophe. With an insight far more accurate than the forecasts of professional social philosophers, he begins to plot the lines of stress and strain along which disaster will erupt. He predicts the ruin of modern secularized society and makes offers of salvation. These are unheard of or unheeded. Then upon the deaf ears and faceless bodies of modern society he invokes the poet's curse.
</blockquote>
<p>
Eliot's poetic curse was that famous fatal dismissal, "This is the way the world ends/ Not with a bang but a whimper." Davidson, fiercely though he reproached a sensate age, was not quite ready to pronounce a curse upon his time . Tradition still might reassert its old power. Take this passage from his essay "Futurism and Archaism in Toynbee and Hardy" contained in <i>Still Rebels, Still Yankees:</i>
<p><blockquote>

'You cannot turn the clock back!' is the commonest taunt of our day. It always emerges as the clinching argument that any modernist offers any traditionalist when the question is: 'What shall we do now?' But it
 is not really an argument. It is a taunt intended to discredit the traditionalist by stigmatizing him a traitor to an idea of progress that is assumed as utterly valid and generally accepted. The aim is, furthermore, to poison the traditionalist's own mind and disturb his self-confidence by the insinuation that he is a laggard in the world's great procession. His faith in an established good is made to seem nostalgic devotion to a mere phantom of the buried past. His opposition to the new-no matter how ill-advised, inartistic, destructive, or immoral that new may be-is defined as a quixotic defiance of the Inevitable. To use a term invented by Arnold J. Toynbee, he is an Archaist. By definition, he is therefore doomed.
</blockquote>
<p>
To abide by Tradition is not to fall into Archaism, Davidson told the rising generation. As for turning back the clock-why, as Davidson puts it, "Neither can you turn the clock forward, for Time is beyond human control." When a Futurist uses this clock metaphor, we perceive an unconscious revelation of his weakness. He wishes to imply that his design, and his only, is perfectly in step with some scientific master cloak of cause and effect that deter nines the progress of human events. This implication has no basis in reality, since the Futurist actually means to break off all connection with the historical process of cause and effect and to substitute for it an imagined, ideal process of quasi-scientific future development which is nothing more than a sociological version of Darwinism.
<p>
<b>Gifted and Versatile.</b> Such was the conservative mind of Donald Davidson. If I have made him seem somewhat abstract-why, that has been my blunder. He was remarkably versatile: a collector of folk ballads, a gifted lecturer, a writer of librettos, an historian, even from time to time active in the troubled politics of Tennessee. He was all too well aware of the huge blunders in public policy during the 20th century. If one turns to the second volume of his history of the Tennessee River, one finds three chapters accurately exposing the failures of that enormous undertaking, so ardently commended by the liberal press and most Tennessee politicians-yet so founded upon economic and social fallacies.
<p>
In person, Davidson was a lean and austere gentleman who smiled rarely; his conversation, nevertheless, was lively, and he was a kindly host. He had been a courageous soldier. To the end he lived with dignity, lamenting the destruction of dignity within universities. Once I walked with him on the campus at Vanderbilt; he told me of how most of the trees there had been felled not long before to make space for more automobiles. This was bad enough; but to make his indignation perfect, grim rows of parking meters had been installed. A militant survivor from what he called "the old regime," Davidson spoke contemptuously of his university's administrators. Students venerated him. He wrote to me on August 31,1954: "Living in Nashville and teaching at Vanderbilt University is very hard on a Southern Agrarian, I can assure you. It is, in fact, nothing but warfare, and we can't survive very long without some place to lick our wounds for a while." (He wrote this from Ripton, Vermont, where the Davidsons spent their summers at the Breadloaf School.)
<p>
<b>Neglected Agrarians. </b>Vanderbilt's administration disparaged the Agrarians and, in effect, would not accept Davidson's or AllenTate's papers as gifts. For that matter, the literate South generally neglected those Agrarians, the most illustrious of southern sons, in their own time. Only when New York paid attention to Tate, Warren, Ransom, Lytle, and others did the South prick up its ears. As that 17th-century "Person of No Quality" put it,
<p><blockquote>

Seven cities now contend for Homer dead,<br>
Through which the living Homer begged his bread.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
I fear I have given you, ladies and gentlemen, only a fragmentary summary of Donald Davidson's social thought. But now I pass to some remarks on the Southern Agrarians generally-one of them, Mr. Andrew Lytle, will spend some days at a seminar in my house, next month, so the breed is still quick-and to the pressing question of what to do about Leviathan.
<p>
Nearly sixty years ago, when I was a fourth-grader in the very northern town of Plymouth, Michigan, twelve southerners published a book entitled <i>I'll Take My Stand: The South and the Agrarian Tradition. </I> That slim volume, a heartfelt defense of the permanent things in the South's culture, has been discussed ever since; a literature of assent or of disapproval has developed about it. Young men and women who come to study with me in my northern fastness discover this literature-even without my having commented on any of it-and read-the books, night upon night, even to the witching hour of three.
<p>
Christian humanism, stern criticism of the industrial mass society, detestation of communism and other forms of collectivism, attachment to the ways of the Old South, in valor and in manners- these were the principles joining the twelve Southern Agrarians who took their stand in Dixieland in 1930. Their twelve essays were approved by T.S. Eliot and some other reflective people at the time the book was published; yet for the most part the Agrarians met with hostility and ridicule. Today their book sometimes meets with understanding, for we are farther down the track to Avernus.
<p>
<b>Reminder and Challenge.</b> As Louis Rubin says of the Twelve Southerners, <i>In Take My Stand</i> "is the rebuke to materialism, a corrective to the worship of Progress, and a reaffirmation of man's aesthetic and spiritual needs. And because the South has come so late into the industrial world, it appeals to the hungering memory within the Southerner's mind of the tranquil and leisurely Southern life that existed before the machines and superhighways came. As such the book constitutes both a reminder and a challenge. What are you losing that you once possessed? Are you sure that you want to discard it entirely?"
<p>
Despite the considerable attention paid nationally to these Agrarian writers, it was not easy for them to find publishers; or, if their writings should be published, to keep them in print. Yet they persisted; and in the long run their high talents as men of letters gave them for some years, about the period of my college days, ascendancy over the realm of letters, even in Manhattan-a mild domination that endured until recent years, when it was overthrown by the squalid oligarchs of the <i>New York Review of Books.</i> (Even here the South has made a successful counterattack, most conspicuously in the homage paid to Flannery O'Connor and Walker Percy.) As a group, the Agrarians illustrated well the remark made by Lionel Trilling in 1950 that the 20th century writers possessing imagination were not liberals-distinctly not.
<p>
<b>Demolished and Uglifiled.</b> The Twelve Southerners, Donald Davidson among them, knew that the South would change. As Stark Young put it in his essay "Not in Memoriam, But in Defense," which concluded their book "That a change is now in course all over the South is plain; and it is as plain that the South changing must be the South still, remembering that for no thing can there be any completeness that is outside its own nature, and no thing for which there is any advance save in its own kind. If this were not so, all nature by now would have dissolved in chaos and folly, nothing in it...."
<p>
Yet the South's pace of change has been more rapid, these six decades past, and more overwhelming, than even the gloomiest of the Twelve Southerners expected. Old Nashville, the domicile of the Fugitives and the Agrarians, has been thoroughly demolished and uglified, Strickland's capitol on its hill besieged by the haughty office towers of state and federal bureaucracies and of teachers' unions. Much else, in Nashville and nearly all the South, has gone by the board-among those losses, the disappearance of Southern architectural styles.
<p>
Along with the dwindling of a distinctive Dixie has come relative economic prosperity. It is factory-town prosperity. The rural pattern of existence, which the Agrarians praised, still endures here and there south of Mason's and Dixon's Line, but it has been brutally buffeted during the past sixty years.
<p>
Of the Twelve Southerners, two-Andrew Lytle and Robert Penn Warren-still are here in the land of the living. Modernity has been doing its worst to wipe out Southerners of their sort, in part by sweeping away-in the South and elsewhere-the sort of schooling that men like Davidson and Lytle and Warren profited by. And the welfare state has striven to efface, as impoverished and culturally deprived, the old rural pattern of the South-or, for that matter, of Northern rural counties like that I inhabit-which endured little altered until the building of the "good roads."
<p>
Tide what may betide, the Southern Agrarians will loom large in histories of American thought and -letters. With liberalism in America now nearly mindless, some of the rising generation in this land are finding in Donald Davidson's prose and verse, and in the writings of other Agrarians, an understanding of personal and social order far removed from desiccated liberal attitudes.
<p>
Six decades after Donald Davidson, Andrew Lytle, Lyle Lanier, Allen Tate, John Crowe Ransom, Frank Owsley, John Gould Fletcher, H.C. Nixon, Robert Penn Warren, John Donald Wade, Henry Blue Kline, and Stark Young took up arms against Leviathan, how goes the fight?
<p>
Like the Celts of the Twilight, it seems, the Agrarians have gone forth often to battle, but never to victory. America's farmers now total perhaps 5 percent of the national population. The South has been subjugated a second time by the federal government, and endures a second political Reconstruction-although this time the southern economy is far from ruined. Centralization of power in Washington was carried much farther by Lyndon Johnson than ever it had been by Franklin Roosevelt; states still nominally sovereign are reduced to a condition little better than that of provinces. The nationwide television broadcasters are rapidly effacing any remnants of regional cultures. The public educational establishment exhorts its teachers and its charges to sing "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" rather than "Dixie." In many other ways, Leviathan looms far vaster than the monster was in 1930.
<p>
<b>Swallowed by Leviathan.</b> And yet the predictions of the Twelve Southerners like those of Cassandra, are being fulfilled. Our great cities, a hundred Long Streets, are nearly ruined, ravaged by crime, their population corrupted or endangered by deadly narcotics, all community destroyed. Our boasted affluence is given the lie by the swift and sinister growth of a genuine proletariat, voracious and unruly, subsisting at public expense. Our layers of governmental bureaucracy are increasingly inefficient and vexatious. Our legislatures, national and state, seem willing to yield to every demand of a pressure group, regardless of the true public interest. Our judges, or many of them, have turned demagogues. Our air is polluted badly, our countryside uglified, public taste corrupted. Our children are brought up indulgently on images of terrible violence and gross sexuality. Schooling at every level is reduced to child care, adolescent sitting, and collegiate mating: humane letters and history are contemned. While we talk windily still of free enterprise, the industrial and commercial conglomerates move toward oligopoly on a tremendous scale. Religious belief and observance have been first reduced to the ethos of sociability, and then to ignorant discourses on revolution. Leviathan, the monstrous society, has swallowed his myriads. What hope for the person and the republic?
<p>
Certain sanguine neoconservatives inform us that America in this year of our Lord 1989 is virtually an earthly paradise of democratic capitalism. This sensate, materialistic, bored, trivial, and often perverse culture of ours today, the summit of human striving? What an absurd contention! But then, most neoconservatives are liberals thinly veiled. Leviathan does not need to pursue such people: they swim eagerly into his maw. The patronage empire of the great "charitable" foundations, by the way, is yet another manifestation of Leviathan.
<p>
<b>Salute to the Southerners.</b> So I do commend to you, ladies and gentlemen, the genuine conservatism of the Twelve Southerners. It is not the only mode of conservative thought, but it is an important mode. The authors of I'll Take My Stand did not propound a rigorous ideology or display a model of Utopia: their principal purpose it was to open our eyes to the illusions of Modernism. The Southern Agrarians proclaimed when I was a child that the southern culture is worth defending; that society is something more than the gross national product; that the country lane is healthier than the Long Street; that more wisdom lies in Tradition than in Scientism; that Leviathan is a devourer, not a savior. Your servant, a northerner of northerners, salutes those Twelve Southerners, some quick, some dead. Study what they have written, and you will discover that they are no mere Archaists.
<p>
"Worn out with abstraction and novelty, plagued with divided counsels, some Americans have said: I will believe the old folks at home, who have kept alive through many treacherous outmodings some good secret of life." So Donald Davidson writes in his chapter "The Diversity of America." He continues, "Such moderns prefer to grasp the particular. They want something to engage both their reason and their love. They distrust the advice of John Dewey to 'use the foresight of the future to refine and expand present activities.' The future is not yet; it is unknowable, intangible. But the past was, the present is; of that much they can be sure. So they attach themselves-or re-attach themselves-to a home-section, one of the sections, great or small, defined in the long conquest of our continental area. They seek spiritual and cultural autonomy....They are learning how to meet the subtlest and most dangerous foe of humanity-the tyranny that wears the mask of humanitarianism and benevolence. They are attacking Leviathan."
<p>
Amen to that, Donald Davidson, my old friend, now passed into eternity. Ladies and gentlemen, go forth and do likewise: strike a blow against Leviathan, the monster of the mass-age.

<P>
With some trepidation I commence my remarks on this large subject, the lot of educational reformers being hard. In 1953, Professor Arthur Bestor published a book entitled <i>Educational Wastelands: The Retreat from Learning in Our Public Schools.</i> There survives a Jewish tradition that all the Prophets were stoned to death or otherwise slain by the People. From 1953 onward, the Educationists belabored Dr. Bestor with epithets, until he departed from this world. And the Educationists' retreat from learning has continued with few impediments.
<p>
In my preceding lecture of this series about Prospects for Conservatives, entitled "Prospects Abroad," I ventured to suggest the possibility of an Augustan Age for the United States and for the twenty-first-century world-supposing we Americans do not endeavor to impose our ways upon all the peoples of the earth. But in discussing American education, I cannot be so sanguine.
<p>
Marxist educational notions and methods have been exposed as grim fallacies-except in these United States, perhaps. Yet what are we to say of present American educational notions and methods? Ever since the publishing of the report of the National Commission on Excellence in Education, "A Nation at Risk," seven years ago, a great deal of talk about education, and scribbling about it, have occurred. As for any evidences of general improvement, however-why, one does not discover them easily.
<p>
The United States now is the great power in the world. Nevertheless, who can praise an educational system that turns out young people marvelously ignorant-except for a very small minority-of history, geography, and foreign languages, and so, unfitted to have much of anything to do with concerns larger than those of their own neighborhood? Worse still, what future have a people whose schooling has enabled them, at best, to ascertain the price of everything-but the value of nothing? We Americans stand today politically dominant, intellectually enfeebled. Conservatives have before them a complex work of intellectual restoration.
<p>
<b>Plight and Possibilities.</b> Nowadays nearly everybody-except for the National Education Association's bosses and affiliates, and the professors at most schools of education- confesses that something is badly wrong with learning in America. While we linger in a mood of remorse and recrimination, opportunity exists for genuine reform. Permit me to address you first, and basically, on the plight and possibilities of the higher learning.
<p>
For half a century, our higher education has been sinking lower. Nobody is more painfully aware of this decay than is the conscientious professor of some experience, and nobody suffers more from it than does the perceptive undergraduate. America's higher learning lies in a state of decadence. But eras of decadence sometimes are succeeded by eras of renewal. It is all a matter of will, reason, and imagination. As Samuel Johnson put it, "Why, sir, we <i>know</i> the will is free; and there's an end to it."
<p>
<b>Higher Education's Mission.</b> Conceivably we Americans, after decades of blundering and incertitude, may be entering upon an American Augustan Age. For successful healing, candid diagnosis is required. The people of the United States now spend annually upon higher education more money, probably, than did all the nations of the world combined, probably, from the foundation of the ancient universities down to the beginning of World War II. Yet there prevails a widespread discontent at the results produced by this costly endeavor. Surely it is time for us conservatives to examine afresh the mission of the higher education.
<p>
The primary end of the higher learning, in all lands and all times, has been what John Henry Newman called the training of the intellect to form a philosophical habit of mind. College and university were founded to develop right reason and imagination, for the sake of the person and of the republic. By its nature, the higher education is concerned with abstractions-rather difficult abstractions, both in the sciences and in humane studies. In any age, most people are not fond of abstractions. In this democratic milieu, therefore, higher education stands in danger everywhere from leveling pressures.
<p>
In Britain, a very few years ago, the member of the opposition party who had been designated minister of education in a prospective Labour government denounced Oxford and Cambridge universities as "cancers." Presumably he would have converted those ancient institutions, if given his way, into something like the Swedish "people's universities" -that is, lax institutions at which every lad and lass can succeed, because all standards for entrance or graduation have been swept away. Every man and woman an intellectual king or queen, with an Oxbridge degree. The trouble with this aspiration is that those kings and queens would be intellectually impoverished-and presumably Britain generally would be impoverished in more ways than one.
<p>
Recently we have heard similar voices in the graduate schools of Harvard. Why discriminate against indolence and stupidity? Why not let everybody graduate, regardless of performance in studies? Would not that be the democratic way? If young people do not care for abstractions, and manifest a positive aversion to developing a philosophical habit of mind, why not give them what they think they would like: that is, the superficial counter-culture?
<p>
<b>Lowering of Standards.</b> The educational degradation of the democratic dogma already has prevailed, with few exceptions, throughout the western world: it has gone far in France and Italy. In the United States, ever since World War II, the lowering of standards for admission and for graduation, the notorious disgrace of "grade inflation," and the loss of order and integration in curricula, are too widely known and regretted for me to need to labor these afflictions here. Some cold comfort may be found in the fact that we have not sinned more greatly than have other nations of the West-somewhat less, indeed.
<p>
Here and there, some signs of renewal in higher education may be discerned; certainly we hear much pother about it. But it remains to be determined whether it is possible to restore or improve the true higher learning, what with powerful political and economic pressures against improvement. Being somewhat gloomy by conviction, yet sanguine by temperament, I may mutter to myself, "Say not the struggle naught availeth!"
<p>
Why are this lowering of standards and this loss of intellectual coherence ruinous to higher education? Because the higher learning is intended to develop, primarily, a philosophical habit of mind. The genuine higher education is not meant, really, to "create jobs" or to train technicians. Incidentally, the higher education does tend to have such results, too; but only as by-products. We stand in danger of forgetting, during our pursuit of the incidentals, the fundamental aims of learning.
<p>
Why were colleges and universities established, and what remains their most valuable function? To discipline the mind; to give men and women long views and to instill in them the virtue of prudence; to present a coherent body of ordered knowledge, in several great fields; to pursue that knowledge for its own sake; to help the rising generation to make its way toward wisdom and virtue. The college is an instrument to teach that truth is better than falsehood, and wisdom better than ignorance. Of course the college has done other things as well, some of them mildly baneful-such as serving as an instrument of social snobbery. But I am speaking still of the college's fundamental mission.
<p>
The college is intended to confer two sorts of  benefits. The first sort of benefit is the improvement of the human person, for the individual's own sake: opening the way to some wisdom to young men and women, that there may be something in their lives besides getting and spending.
<p>
<b>Essential to Society.</b> The second kind of benefit is the preservation and advancement of society, by developing a body or class of young people who will be leaders in many walks of life: scientists, clergymen, political officials or representative officers, physicians, lawyers, teachers, industrialists, managers, and all the re! t. The college is a means to help to form intellects, assure their competence, and (a point often forgotten today) to help to form their characters. Here I am not speaking of an elite, for I share T.S. Eliot's conviction that a deliberately-cultivated series of elites would tend toward narrowness and arrogance. Rather, I refer to a fairly broad and numerous class of tolerably educated men and women who would leaven the lump of society in a wide variety of ways. Most of them never would be famous, or powerful on a large scale; but they form that body of well-schooled people essential to any modern society, and especially important to a democratic society.
<p>
Now a higher schooling merely technological and skill-oriented-what once would have been called a mechanical education, as opposed to a liberal education-can neither impart wisdom to the person nor supply intellectual and moral leadership to the republic. I do not object to learning a trade-far from it. But a trade is best learnt through apprenticeship, internship, on-the-job training, or technical schools. Except for the learned professions, learning a trade is ill suited to a college campus. If we convert higher education into technical training merely, we may find ourselves living in what Irving Babbitt called "a devil's sabbath of whirling machinery." For if the philosophical habit of mind is developed nowhere, "the center cannot hold; mere anarchy is loosed upon the world."
<p>
Let me descend to particulars. The biggest fad in education today is the movement styled the Information Revolution. An extensive jargon is developing to serve this revolution's uses. The revolution is supposed to usher in an Informational Society; we even are told that this Informational Society will supplant the Knowledge Society. One of the grave faults of American schooling at every level is the eagerness to embrace the newest gadget- mechanical or intellectual-at the expense of the tested tools of learning. The apologists for television used to tell us that their darling has molded the minds of "the best informed generation in the history of America." Also, if we are to believe the report "A Nation at Risk," it has molded the minds of the most ignorant generation in America. For information is not knowledge; and knowledge is not wisdom. This is movingly expressed by T.S. Eliot in some lines of his choruses for <i>The Rock:</i>
<p><blockquote>
The endless cycle of idea and action,<br> Endless invention, endless experiment,<br> Brings knowledge of motion, but not of stillness; <br>Knowledge of speech, but not of silence; <br>Knowledge of words, and ignorance of the Word. <br>All our knowledge brings us nearer to our ignorance, <br>All our ignorance brings us nearer to death, <br>But nearness to death no nearer to God. <br>Where is the Life we have lost in living? <br>Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? <br>Where is the knowledge we have lost in information? <br>The cycles of Heaven in twenty centuries <br>Bring us farther from God and nearer to the Dust.<br>
</blockquote><p>
Aye, where is the knowledge we have lost in information, not to mention the wisdom? What college and university used to endeavor to impart was not miscellaneous information, a random accumulation of facts, but instead an integrated and ordered body of knowledge that would develop the philosophical habit of mind-from which cast of mind one might find the way to wisdom of many sorts.
<p>
Doubtless the prevalence of computers may confer upon us various material benefits. But so far as genuine education goes, the computer and its Informational Society may amount to a blight. They seem calculated to enfeeble the individual reason and to make most of us dependent upon an elite of computer programmers-at the higher lever of the Informational Society, I mean; they may develop into vigorous enemies of the philosophical habit of mind.
<p>
<b>Technological Flotsam.</b> One thing to remember, then, in discussing what higher education should do for people in the dawning years, is that waves of technological! innovation commonly carry on their crests a mass of flotsam. Such a disagreeable mass was flung upon the beaches of academe by the ideological tempests of the 1960s and 1970s. At university and college we are only beginning to recover from the damage done to the philosophical habit of mind by that storm. The gentlefolk and scholars of the Academy would be highly imprudent if they should assist in fresh devastation by setting gadgetry above intellectual discipline.
<p>
I am arguing that educational neoterism does mischief often. Nor do I believe it to be the primary function of university and college to create a kind of tapioca-pudding society in which everybody would be just like everybody else-every young man and woman, ideally, possessed of a doctoral degree, if innocent of philosophy.
<p>
Instead, the primary mission of university and college is to point the way toward some measure of wisdom and virtue, through developing the philosophical habit of mind. I am saying that universities and colleges were founded in the hope that those institutions might help the rising generation toward two forms of order: one, order in the soul of the person, the direction of will and appetite by reason; the other, order in the commonwealth, through the understanding of justice and freedom and the public good. I am arguing that our basic reform of the higher learning must be the restoration of these venerable aims-a task for conservatives.
<p>
Is it absurd to imagine that our vast factory-like campuses might be humanized? Is it ridiculous to argue that the American obsession with getting and spending could be chastened sufficiently to permit American higher learning to be sought for its own sake? Perhaps; but perhaps not, too.
<p>
I lack time to offer you a detailed program of educational reformation. But I venture now to suggest the essential measure that must be undertaken if we are to move from intellectual decadence toward intellectual renewal.
<p>
First, the quality of American primary and secondary schooling must be mightily improved before there can be any very marked increase of intelligence and imagination among college and university students. This improvement must have two aspects: the teaching of true intellectual disciplines, and the rousing of the moral imagination. Despite endeavors of the federal Department of Education to entice schools into improving themselves, little has occurred as yet in the way of practical reform.
<p>
I find it highly doubtful that any marked reformation of the public schools can occur until the several states, and perhaps the federal government too, adopt some form of the "voucher plan," which would provide for much greater diversity and choice in schooling. Here I commend to you, ladies and gentlemen, the new book by John E. Chubb and Terry M. Moe, <i>Politics, Markets, and America's Schools</I> (Brookings Institution). As Mr. Chubb puts it, "The public education system functions naturally and routinely, despite everybody's best intentions, to burden schools with excessive bureaucracy, to discourage effective school organization, and to stifle student achievement."
<p>
Second, the American appetite for requiring vocational certification must be curbed. A very great part of the student body on nearly all campuses is enrolled mostly because "you have to get a degree to get a job." Thus universities and colleges are crowded with young people who would prefer to be somewhere else, earning money or at least active and emancipated from abstractions. It needs to be remembered that universities and colleges are centers for the study of abstractions; and most people's interest in abstractions is distinctly limited. Many of the skills in business, industry, technology, and governmental service are best acquired by internship or apprenticeship; being compelled to linger in college is little better than marking time for many undergraduates. Were universities and colleges relieved of the responsibility for turning out half-finished candidates for routine employment, they could undertake their primary duties so much the better; and the whole atmosphere of the typical campus would grow far more cheerful.
<p>
Third, the humane scale in learning should be regained by creating no more mass campuses with many thousands of undergraduates in a lonely crowd, and decentralizing so far as possible the existing Behemoth campuses. The old collegiate structure of the academic community should become the model once more. Institutes for technical training, as distinct from the abstractions with which higher education is supposed to be concerned, should be situated elsewhere than on the same campus with college or university.
<p>
Fourth, curricula at nearly all universities and colleges should be greatly revised, rigorously, so as to provide students with a genuine intellectual discipline, purged of the intellectual boondoggles that have disgraced college programs to some extent ever since the beginning of this century, but especially since the late Sixties. At the majority of American establishments of a learning allegedly higher, theoretical sciences and imaginative humane studies have been pushed into a dusty corner of the curriculum; that folly must be undone. Reading through directories of colleges recently, with a view to finding a good college for our third daughter, I discovered that at the typical college nowadays only some five percent of the undergraduates are enrolled in "letters," which once upon a time was the American college's principal discipline. If the rising generation's more intelligent members have acquired little knowledge of great literature, history, languages, and the natural sciences- why, the person and the republic will fall into disorder, soon or late.
<p>
Fifth, we must emphasize through the whole of higher education the ancient principle that the ends of all education are wisdom and virtue. I do <i>not</i> mean that the purpose of the higher learning is to "impart values." The whole notion of teaching "values" is mistaken, although held often by sincere people who mean well.
<p>
For what true education attempts to impart is <i>meaning,</i> not value. This sly employment of the word <i>value</i> as a substitute for such words as "norm," "standard," "principle," and "truth" is the deliberate work of the doctrinaire positivists, who deny that there exists any moral significance of a transcendent or an abiding character. In America, the notion of educational "values" has been advanced by sociologists and educationists of the Instrumentalist school: it is intended as a substitute for the religious assumptions about human existence that formerly were taken for granted in schools. A "value," as educationists employ the word, is a personal preference, gratifying perhaps to the person who holds it, but of no binding moral effect upon others. "Other things being equal, pushpin is as good as poetry," in Bentham's famous phrase. Choose what values you will, or ignore them all: it's a matter of what gives you, the individual, the most pleasure and the least pain.
<p>
Etienne Gilson points out that positivists deliberately advance the concept of "values" because they deny that words, or the concepts represented by words, have real meaning. Thus the word "honor" may hold value for some, but may be repellent to other people: in the view of the positivist, the word "honor" is meaningless, for there is no honor, nor yet dishonor: all really is physical sensation, pleasurable or painful. But if "honor" has an illusory value for you, employ it; if you dislike "honor," discard it.
<p>
<b>Imparting A Moral Heritage. </b>Time was when every school child used to be familiar with the catalogue of the seven cardinal virtues and the seven deadly sins. The positivists and a good many other folk today deny the existence of those seven deadly sins, or of any other sin. As for the virtues-why, they would like to convert those back into "value preferences," with no moral imperative to back them. But justice, fortitude, prudence, and temperance are not "values" merely; nor are faith, hope, and charity. It is not for the individual, bound up in self-conceit, to determine whether he prefers justice or injustice; it is not for him to decide whether prudence or imprudence suits him better. True, the individual may so decide and act, to others' harm or his own. But it is the function of education to impart a moral heritage: to teach that the virtues and the vices are real, and that the individual is not free to toy with the sins as he may choose.
<p>
What true education transmits is not values, but instead a body of truth: that is, a pattern of meanings, perceived through certain disciplines of the intellect. The sort of education that prevailed in Europe and America until about 1930, say, was an endeavor to instruct the rising generation in the nature of reality. It traced a pattern of order: order in the soul, order in the commonwealth. That old system of education began with information; it passed from information to knowledge; it moved from knowledge to wisdom. Its aim, I repeat, was not value, but truth.
<p>
The Benthamite and Deweyite educational structure of our day, little concerned with meaning, aims confusedly at personal advancement, technical training, sociability, socialization, custodial functions, and certification-not to mention fun and games. The very possibility of ascertaining the meaning of anything is denied by many a department of philosophy. What does this twentieth-century educational system transmit to the rising generation? Chiefly certain technical and commercial skills, together with that training in the learned professions that is indispensable to our civilization. Modern schooling, at any level, offers little toward the ordering of the soul and the ordering of the commonwealth.
<p>
We Americans possess the riches and the power that could give us an American Augustan Age. Do we possess mind and heart requisite for an Augustan era? It has been said that the Americans of our time know the price of everything and the value of nothing; it might better be said that they know the price of everything, the value of some things-and the meaning of next to nothing. We have not schooled ourselves, this past half-century and more, for Augustan responsibilities.
<p>
<b>Fading Heritage.</b> So far as we remembered our heritage of culture at all, most of us Americans assumed that somehow it would endure automatically, unregarded and unrenewed-a form of perpetual motion. But that heritage has been fading among us for several decades. In educational fad and foible, in arid specialization, in mere processes of certification for potential employment, we have laid waste our inheritance of reason and imagination.
<p>
Having failed to apprehend meanings, we are forced back upon a rude pragmatism in private life and in public a groping for "what works"-or seems to work. In private existence, such servility to the evanescent moment leads to the alienist's couch and the divorce court; in the affairs of nations, such naive improvisations may end in ruinous blunders, not to be undone.
<p>
The education of yesteryear was founded upon certain postulates. One of these was that much truth is ascertainable; another, that religious truth is the source of all good; a third, that we may profit by the wisdom of our ancestors; a fourth, that the individual is foolish, but the species is wise; a fifth, that wisdom is sought for its own sake; a sixth, that for the sake of the commonwealth, schooling should quicken the moral imagination.
<p>
These postulates have not ceased to be true; it is only that they have been forgotten in our century's obsession with power and money, and our century's illusion that ideology is a ready and satisfactory substitute for thought. Some eyes have been opened to the mischief done by that obsession and that illusion. Here and there, some attempts at recovery of the true ends of education are being made.
<p>
<b>Winning Back the Inheritance. </b>Many in America and throughout the world have been disinherited of their cultural patrimony. Yet they may win back that inheritance, if they have fortitude and tenacity sufficient. "The dead alone give us energy," we are told by Gustave Le Bon. In the long run, the man and the state that have rejected the legacy from many centuries will be found nerveless. And the man or woman who has sought out that intellectual legacy will be emboldened to defend the Permanent Things Against Chaos and Old Night. 
<p>
My old comrade in arms Arthur Bestor found the schools of America in 1953 educational wastelands; they are no less arid today. Yet say not, ladies and gentlemen, that the struggle naught availeth. Some conservative irrigation conceivably may cause the desert to bloom. If nothing is done-why, hand in hand with the Hollow Men, we go round and round the prickly pear at five o'clock in the morning.
<p><blockquote>
This is the dead land <BR>This is cactus land <BR>Here the stone images <BR>Are raised, here they receive <BR>The supplication of a dead man's hand <BR>Under the twinkle of a fading star.
</blockquote><p>
Unless conservatives act intellectually and vigorously to renew right reason and imagination among us, by the conclusion of the twentieth century America may be an egalitarian wasteland of mind and spirit, with everybody compulsorily schooled, and everybody equal in ignorance.

<P>
This year's series of Heritage Lectures is concerned with the somewhat pressing question of whether our American culture will survive the tribulations of our age. In the two previous lectures, I have discussed the ideology called "multiculturalism" as a menace; and whether a civilization that lacks belief in a religion can endure. In my final lecture, in December, I mean to talk about means for combating cultural decay. Today I have chosen for my subject the degradation of the democratic dogma.
<p>
I take my title from the writings of Henry and Brooks Adams. They found American democracy in process of degradation more than a century ago. The decay of the American Presidency from George Washington to Ulysses S. Grant, Henry Adams remarked, refuted altogether Darwin's theory of evolution. To a similar thesis I shall return presently.
<p>
But first, indulge me in some observations concerning the present condition of what is called "democracy" near the close of the 20th century. We are informed by certain voices that soon all the world will be democratic. But whether or not, the American mode of democratic government prevails, the abstract ideology called <i>democratism</i> that any government which has obtained a majority of votes be received as "democratic." Enthusiasts for unrestricted democracy presumably forget that Adolph Hitler, too, was democratically elected and sustained by popular plebiscites. Alexis de Tocqueville warned his contemporaries against "democratic despotism," 20th century writers discuss "totalist democracy."
<p>
I am suggesting, ladies and gentlemen, that <i>democracy</i>-literally, "the rule of the crowd"-is a term so broad and vague as to signify everything or nothing. The American democracy, a unique growth although an offshoot from British culture, innocent of ideology's fury-functioned fairly well in the past because of peculiar beliefs and conditions: a patrimony of ordered freedom, and especially, as Tocqueville pointed out, Americans' <i>mores,</i> or moral habits. What is called "democracy" today in most of the world-and nearly every regime represents itself as democratic-bears much resemblance to America's political and social pattern as the oar of the boat does to the ore of the mine. All that these regimes maintain in common is a claim that they rule with the assent of the majority of the people. The tyranny of the majority can be more oppressive, and more effectual, than the tyranny of a single person.
<p>
<b>Not Readily Transplanted.</b> Neoconservatives' demands nowadays that all the world be thoroughly democratized overnight remind me strongly of a similar enthusiasm not long after the end of the Second World War. Gentlemen such as Chester Bowles then proclaimed that Africa, liberated from European domination, promptly would rejoice in an array of democracies on the American model. The United States took measures, then and later, to accelerate this happy progress economic restraints upon trade of one sort or another with Portugal, Rhodesia, and latterly the Republic of South Africa. We all know, of course, how blissfully democratic Angola, Mozambique, Guinea, and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) are today; while South Africa's peoples, thanks to the beneficence of American and European liberals, enjoy the prospect of civil war in emulation of what occurred in the Congo three decades ago. America's democracy is not readily transplanted overseas. If anybody emerges alive from the present agony in Somalia, will a peaceful democracy, told by the nose, soon come to pass there? Was the ejection, after the Second World War, of the Italian government from part of Somaliland, and the withdrawal of the British administrators from another portion of that territory, a victory for democracy in Africa? Ask the Somali dead.
<p>
My point is this: Merely to shout the word <i>democracy</i> is not to bring into being a society endowed with order, justice, and freedom. Those blessings grow but slowly, and by good nurture. The roots of the American democratic republic run back through hundreds of years of American, British, and European experience. While we prate about exporting American democracy to Eastern Europe, Africa, and Asia-although, as Daniel Boorstin has written, "the American Constitution is not for export"-our own political institutions seem to be crumbling. We may sink into the Latin American brand of democracy, class against class, the economy periodically ruined by inflation, with a semblance of order restored from time to time by the military.
<p>
<b>Recalling 1929. </b>Sinclair Lewis, late in life, wrote an implausible novel <i>It Can' t Happen Here</i>-a fictional affirmation that a fascist regime might be established in the United States; the book was published in 1935. The novel was more comical than convincing; but it does not follow that the American democratic republic will endure for eternity, as Rome was supposed to last. I may be one of the very few persons present today who remembers clearly the events of the American experience between, and including, the years 1929 and 1933. I find America's social and economic and political circumstances today markedly similar to those of that tumultuous era. Changes still larger than those worked by Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal may come to pass during the next four years, say. Economically, the position of the United States is more precarious than it was in 1929: our national debt is astronomical in quantity; personal (family) debt, on the average, is more than four-fifths of a family's annual income; the apparatus of credit is vastly overexpanded; and taxes begin to be crushing. In certain of our cities, ferocious riots far exceed in magnitude the disorders of 1929- 1933, and after: those riots really are proletarian risings. This is a time in which, in Yeats's lines, "The best lack all conviction, while the worst / Are full of passionate intensity."
<p>
In 1957, at Bruges, during a conference on Atlandc community, I met Amaury de Riencourt, the author of a book entitled <i>The Coming Caesars,</i> published that year, the book was very widely discussed then, but now is forgotten. Unless measures of restraint should be taken, Riencourt wrote-and taken promptly-the United States would fall under the domination of 20th century Caesars. Riencourt argued:
<p><blockquote>
Caesarism is not dictatorship, not the result of one man's overriding ambition; not a brutal seizure of power through revolution. It is not based on a specific doctrine or philosophy. It is essentially pragmatic and untheoretical. It is a slow, often century-old, unconscious development that ends in a voluntary surrender of a free people escaping from freedom to one autocratic master....
<P>
Political power in the Western world has become increasingly concentrated in the United States, and in the office of the President within America. The power and prestige of the President have grown with the growth of America and of democracy within America, with the multiplication of economic, political, and military emergencies, with the necessity of ruling what is virtually becoming an American empire-the universal state of a Western civilization at bay....
<P>
Caesarism can come to America constitutionally, without having to alter or break down any existing institution. The White House is already the seat of the most powerful tribunician authority ever known to history. All it needs is amplification and extension. Caesarism in America does not have to challenge the Constitution as in Rome or engage in civil warfare and cross any fateful Rubicon. It can slip in quite naturally, discreetly, through constitutional channels.
</blockquote><p>
Just so. Caesarism slipped into the White House constitutionally, if not naturally, with the murder of President Kennedy in 1963. The plebiscitary democracy would elect Lyndon Johnson President in 1964; but Johnson's military failure would undo him, despite his panem et circenses; and a rebellious senator would strip him of the purple. If Caesars do not win their battles, they fall. In this, although not in much else, perhaps it was as well that the war in Vietnam was lost.
<p>
On a wall of my library hangs a photograph of myself with President Johnson; both of us are smiling; it is well to be civil to Caesar. It might be thought that Russell Kirk would not have been eager to visit Caesar in the Oval office of the Imperial Mansion; indeed I was not. But, in collaboration with James McClellan, I had written not long before a biography of Robert Taft; Johnson, as a senatorial colleague, had delivered a funeral eulogy of the famous Republican; and so I was induced by the patroness of the Robert A. Taft Institute of Government to present the President with a copy of the book, at a little White House ceremony.
<p>
<b>A Visit to Caesar.</b> Present for that occasion in the Oval Office were two Democratic Senators who had been on good terms with Senator Taft-Byrd of Virginia and Tydings of Maryland. Lyndon Johnson towered tall and masterful, clearly a bad man to have for an adversary. The Taft book was presented, and the President exchanged some brief remarks with me; photographs were taken while my irrepressible wife strolled behind the presidential desk, examining photographs of Lady Bird, Lynda Bird, and other folk at the ranch.
<p>
True to his reputation if to naught else, President Johnson wheeled and dealt with Senator Byrd and Senator Tydings the while. He knew me for a syndicated columnist, but surely never had opened any of my books. "Stay in school! Stay in school!" Johnson had shouted, over television, to the rising generation. Yet this Caesar had no need of books; he had been the vainglorious disciple of Experience, that famous master of fools.
<p>
No, Johnson did not open books: with Septimius Severus, he might have said, "Pay the soldiers; the rest do not matter." Had he not Robert McNamara, creator of the Edsel, to counsel him? Power was all, and surely the power of the United States, under Johnson's hand, was infinite. All the way with LBJ! There came into my head, in the Oval Office, a passage from Amaury de Riencourt:
<p><blockquote>
With Caesarism and Civilization, the great struggles between political parties are no longer concerned with principles, programs and ideologies, but with men. Marius, Sulla, Cato, Brutus still fought for principles. But now, everything became personalized. Under Augustus, parties still existed, but there were no more Optimates or Populares. No more conservatives or democrats. Men campaigned for or against Tiberius or Drusus or Caius Caesar. No one believed any more in the efficacy of ideas, political panaceas, doctrines, or systems, just as the Greeks had given up building great philosophic systems generations before. Abstractions, ideas, and philosophies were rejected to the periphery of their lives and of the empire, to the East where Jews, agnostics, Christians, and Mithraists attempted to conquer the world of souls and minds while the Caesars ruled their material existence.
</blockquote><p>

All the way with LBJ! <i>Ave atque vale!</i>
<p>
<b>Consequences of Hubris.</b> Every inch a Caesar LBJ looked; he might have sat for Michelangelo for the carving of a statue of a barracks emperor. Experience, nevertheless, had not taught this imperator how to fight a war. To fancy that hundreds of thousands of fanatic guerrillas and North Vietnamese regulars, supplied by Russia and China, might be defeated by military operations merely defensive-plus a great deal of bombing from the air, destroying civilians chiefly, that bombing pinpointed by Johnson himself in the White House! The American troops in Vietnam fought admirably well-how well, my old friend General S. L. A. Marshall described unforgettably in his books-but their situation was untenable. "Imagination rules mankind," Bonaparte had said-Napoleon, master of the big battalions. Had Johnson possessed any imagination, he would have sealed Haiphong, as Nixon did later. Only so might the war have been won.
<p>
Afflicted by <i>hubris,</i> Johnson Caesar piled the tremendous cost of the war-a small item was the immense quantity of milk flown daily from San Francisco to Vietnam, American troops not campaigning on handfuls of rice-upon the staggering cost of his enlargement of the welfare state at home. One might have thought he could not do sums. He ruined the dollar and bequeathed to the nation an incomprehensible national debt. Both guns and butter! It had been swords and liturgies with earlier emperors.
<p>
It is with variations that history repeats itself. Ignoring history, LBJ was condemned to repeat it.
<p>
Morally, he was the worst man ever to make himself master of the White House. The corrupt antics of Bobby Baker and Billie Sol Estes did not bring him down, although he had been intimately connected with both.
<p>
In June 1961, an agent of the Department of Agriculture, Henry Marshall, had been found shot to death in Texas. Marshall had been about to expose the criminal wheeling and dealing of Billie Sol Estes, and in that wheeling and dealing Lyndon Johnson, then Vice-President, had participated. A justice of the peace declared the murder of Marshall to have been suicide.
<p>
But in March 1984, a grand jury in Robertson County would look into the mystery. A federal marshal and Billie Sol Estes would certify before that jury. Estes, under immunity, swore that the killing had been decided upon at a meeting at Vice-President Johnson's Washington residence; Johnson had given the order and directed a hanger-on of his, Malcolm Wallace, to execute it. The grand jury believed Estes, it appears, and concluded that Marshall's death had been a homicide. No one was indicted, for the grand jury presumed that the murderers already were dead.
<p>
Such frequently is the way of Caesars. Like some other Caesars, Johnson, from small beginnings, accumulated while in public office a large fortune. No one ever accused him of the vice of scrupulosity. An ill man to deal with, Lyndon Baines Johnson.
<p>
Yet Eugene the Poet, Eugene the Giant-Killer, would fetch Caesar down. I do not think that Eugene McCarthy would have converted himself into a Caesar; nay, American conservatives might have been better content with President McCarthy than they would become with President Bush or will be with President Clinton.
<p>
<b>Politics of the Absurd.</b> For the past several months, the American people endured the least edifying of presidential campaigns. No one of the three gentlemen who aspired to the presidential office commanded much respect, and their debates were more concerned with trivia and intemperate accusations than with the great and most difficult public decisions that must be made very soon. The feeblest of the three candidates proposed to refer all of those decisions to the electorate at large, by electronic means of polling-as if every American voter were able and eager to express a considered judgment on what courses should be undertaken in the conduct of foreign policy, on how the national debt should be reduced, on how civil disorders should be averted, on what to do about the American proletariat, on the improvement of public schooling, on the allocation of priorities in public expenditure, on the afflictions of centralization and bureaucracy, on the question of immigration, on the modes of averting an economic collapse on the scale of what occurred in 1929-on these and innumerable other public issues, it is proposed that we take a hasty popular poll! That way lies democratic madness. Why bother with statesmen? Surely the typical American voter is omniscient. We have entered upon the politics of the absurd.
<p>
This year's three presidential aspirants seemed absurd to a great multitude of citizens. How had they been selected for candidacy? Mr. Perot selected himself, soon withdrew (but not from modesty), and then selected himself afresh. Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton were selected chiefly by primary campaigns, the results of which were determined chiefly by the amount of money they were able to spend, respectively, on television advertising. In the case of President Bush, his being an incumbent of the office, with large benefactions to bestow, saved the day for him. I was general chairman of the Buchanan campaign in Michigan. We Buchanan backers had only ten thousand dollars to spend; while the Bush people spent half a million dollars in Michigan. <i>Sic transit gloria mundi;</i> to them that hath shall be given. Certain Roman Caesars bought the imperial purple. Increasingly, our presidential candidates win by purchasing time on the boob-tube.
<p>
<b>Not As Framers Intended.</b> The Framers of the Constitution gravely distrusted democratic appetites, as such had been demonstrated by Shays' Rebellion. Also they distrusted arbitrary power in a chief executive. So they endeavored-unsuccessfully, as matters have turned out-to devise a prudent method of selecting presidents, far removed from popular vote. This was the Electoral College. It was assumed by the Framers that within each of the several states there would be chosen (through divers modes) able and conscientious presidential electors, free agents, "men of superior discernment, virtue, and information" (in Senator Thomas Hart Benton's phrases), who would select a strong and good President "according to their own will," regardless of popular sentiment of the hour. This upright intended Electoral College never has functioned as the Framers intended, nevertheless, because with the rise of great coherent political parties came the pledging in advance of electors to the candidacy of some particular individual- Adams, or Jefferson, or Burr, say-and therefore the reduction of the Electoral College to insignificance, except so far as the College preserved the idea of a nation of sovereign states, the presidential electoral vote being cast by the several states according to their representation in the Congress-and not according to the popular vote, nationally regarded.
<p>
The Framers of the Constitution conceivably might have revised a different move for the Electoral College that could have survived the rise of great political parties. One such arrangement might have been to make the sitting governors of the several states, if chosen long before the presidential election, the independent choosers of the President, so removing the selection from the ephemeral preferences of the great mass of ill-informed voters nationally. But "the saddest words of tongue or pen are simply these: 'It might have been."' Now we expect presidential candidates to exhaust themselves, and their supporters' fund, by <i>two</i> overwhelming national campaigns-one the primaries and conventions held in every state, the other the frantic struggle on the eve of the November election, every four years. This method is supposed to ascertain the popular will; but in effect it blurs distinctions between parties, the candidates promising to be all things, to all men-and women; and commonly this method gives us demagogues or else bladders of vanity as party candidates. All too possibly it may give us more Caesar-presidents; President Bush endeavored to be one such, causing the deaths of a quarter of a million people in Iraq; but the popularity of that exploit rapidly evaporated. The more we behave as if the President were the embodiment of the American democracy, and do little about the Congress except to revile senators and representatives, the less genuinely democratic this nation must become.
<p>
Electronic technology becomes a tool of plebiscitary democracy. As Mr. James M. Perry put it in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> on November 4, hereafter, having upheld the presidential contest of 1992, "Candidates will build on what they saw this year-800-telephone number satellite hookups, soft Larry King-style interviews, televised town meetings." It's a brave new world, with words like "teledemocracy" and "interactive communications" being used by the scholars to describe it. Notions like Mr. Perot's "electronic town hall," should they come to pass, would concentrate the national public' s attention upon the presidential candidates merely, sweeping aside the mechanism of parties and in effect reducing the Congress (or, on the level of the several states, the state legislatures) to little more than ratifying bodies, pledged to whatever programs the victorious presidential candidate might advocate and decree. The peril to true representative government, and to America's old territorial democracy, is too obvious for me to labor this point. The presidential candidates, in such a novel system, necessarily would have to raise enormous quantities of money from such special interests, pressure groups, and ethnic blocs as might expect to profit from the ascendancy of some vigorous demagogue or some persuasive instrument of oligarchy.
<p>
Yet a good many Americans fancy that these developments founded upon television and telephone will bring about "government of the people, by the people, and for the people." At our county Republican convention in my state of Michigan, an amiable young candidate for the office of representative in the Michigan legislature-a person who thought himself conservative- declared himself delighted at the prospect of serving the people "in the new direct democracy." Now direct democracy did not function well in ancient Athens, when the whole electorate-a few thousand men-could assemble in the agora; it would function disastrously, if at all, in the United States of the 20th century, with a population of some two hundred and fifty million people. In any event, the People possessing no unanimous collective will on any question, this virtual abolition of representative government would come down to skillful manipulation of the moment's public opinion by a circle of electronic-media specialists in the service of the President: an extreme form of plebiscitary democracy. In effect, the Presidency would become a dictatorship achieved without violence and checked only by the necessity of an election every four years. How very democratic!
<p>
<b>Plurality President.</b> I speak thus alarmingly only of future possibilities, not of the swiftly approaching reign of Clinton Caesar. For Mr. Clinton achieved a majority of the popular vote merely in his own state of Arkansas; he is a plurality President merely, no popular hero empowered by the Demos to shape the world nearer to his heart's desire. Moreover, he has promised all things to all men-free medical care; free college education, or virtually free, for all comers; emancipation from the tiresome restraints of bourgeois morality; more lavish entitlements for such minorities as can turn out the vote; Lord knows what all benefits. These promises cannot be fulfilled; therefore the reproaches which were heaped upon President Bush these past four years will descend upon President Clinton twofold, not long after his inauguration; and he lacks the rhetorical skill and cunning with which Franklin Roosevelt, in highly similar circumstances, deflected or repelled such criticisms. So feebleness, rather than militancy, is liable to predominate during the Clinton years. And if President Clinton presumes to increase income taxes, as he has said he will do-why, the new Congress, mindful of the fate of the late Bush Administration, may turn rebellious. <i>In fine,</i> Mr. Clinton will not be crowned with laurel.
<p>
Clinton's successors, nevertheless, may have more happy opportunities for the concentration of power in their hands. Increasing military involvement in the European continent, or the collapse of the world economy in a fashion more ruinous than what occurred from 1929 to 1992, might whet presidential candidates' eagerness for power, and public willingness to entrust all to the Great White Father.
<p>
Circumstances from Siberia to San Francisco strongly resemble political and social and economic circumstances in most of the world between the two World Wars. The coming of immense inflation of currencies-now quite conceivable-might cause such immense public resentment and distress that executive forces and legislative bodies might be swept out of power, in country after country, and by plebiscites might usher in persons not at all scrupulous in their attainment -of power. Such radical changes would be accomplished in the name of Democracy, of course, but what would result would be plebiscitary democracy, ruthless enough.
<p>
In the name of Democracy, America' s representative government, under the Constitution, might be swept aside, and politics might be debased to contests between hypocritical ideologues, every one of them claiming to be more democratic than the others. What's in a name? In Haiti, "democracy" signifies the arbitrary power of deposed President Aristide to have rubber tires slung round the necks of his opponents, and they set afire. In South Africa, the apotheosis of democracy, one man one vote on Benthamite principles would end in civil war and general impoverishment. In the United States, the demand for more democracy might lead to the legalized plundering of the hardworking by those who prefer not to work at all. And a line of American Caesars might be required to preserve any sort of order.
<p>
<b>Recovering True Representative Government.</b> I am arguing, ladies and gentlemen, that these United States would be only degraded by a submission to an ideological democracy, in either domestic or foreign policy, a Rousseauistic democracy restyled "teledemocracy." What we require is a vigorous recovery of true representative government, one of the principal achievements of our culture, a legacy from centuries of British and colonial experience and from the practical wisdom of the Framers of the Constitution of the United States. Say not the struggle naught availeth, friends. In my concluding lecture of this series, I will endeavor to let some cheerfulness break in, suggesting means for cultural restoration in a diversity of aspects.

<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	Come November, hundreds of thousands of immigrants are likely to cast their first votes in a presidential election. That's because record levels of foreigners have filed applications for citizenship with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). Last year, 1.2 million of them formally sought citizenship, up from an annual average of only 230,000 in the 1980s. To handle these numbers, the INS has pumped an extra $80 million into its naturalization budget. But the waiting list continues to grow.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; This rush to citizenship offers us both opportunity and danger. We have the opportunity to help more immigrants become Americans, and thus protect our country from the dangers of Bosnia-style multiculturalism or Quebec-style separatism. The danger is that, to cope with the volume of applications, the INS will lower its naturalization standards and devalue citizenship like a worthless peso.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;  Preparation for the tests and ceremony of citizenship has long been a powerful instrument of unity, an engine of assimilation that turns newcomers into U.S. citizens who understand our political traditions and are proud to be Americans. A citizenship ceremony is among the most moving events in American public life. Patriotic songs and colorful speeches about freedom and opportunity fill the program. The event concludes with a duty-bound oath in which immigrants forsake foreign political allegiances and pledge themselves wholly to their new country. As new citizens pick up their official citizenship papers, they also receive small American flags and voting information. Friends and family greet them outside. The day will be remembered the way most Americans remember graduations, weddings, and the birth of children.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; All of the difficult moments leading up to citizenship reinforce its meaning for the participants. In order to naturalize, immigrants must  live in the United States for five years. They must pass an FBI criminal background check. Ultimately, they will have to be interviewed by an INS officer and demonstrate the ability to speak, read, and write in English (with some exceptions for elderly applicants) and pass a test on U.S. history and government. Only those who really want citizenship will get it. And when they do, they enjoy a satisfaction that most other Americans can never experience. "Citizenship makes me feel at home in America, like I really belong here," said Mohsen Borhani, an immigrant from Iran, shortly before he became a citizen last fall.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; This process of naturalization, and the accumulation of enough cultural capital to acquire citizenship, ultimately yields more than a set of political entitlements. It infuses new citizens with a sense of duty and loyalty to their new home. "I am no longer a Canadian and it is long past time to assume the responsibility that comes with American citizenship," said Adele Hardwick, a Canadian immigrant, right before she naturalized last November. "The right to vote is a great privilege," added the German-born Erling Hans Ulstein. "I would like to take part in the democratic process and know that I didn't just live and work here, but did my part as an American citizen," he said.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; With so many new applications for citizenship, however, the INS is threatening to lower its standards to the point where naturalization is no longer a meaningful experience. Naturalization receives little sustained attention from academics, politicians, and the media. Perhaps as a consequence, our notion of citizenship has cheapened since the turn of the century. Like a school that advances failing students to the next grade, the INS now pressures its examiners to push potential citizens through the system quickly, even if they are questionable candidates. Agents hint that their superiors are more concerned about meeting a quota than making sure everybody does a good, thorough job.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"We have about 15 minutes for each interview," says Dan Childs, an INS officer based in Arlington, Virginia. "If I want to take a little extra time to check something, it really backs things up. We're always behind, even if things go smoothly. I usually skip my lunch hour just to catch up. You can guess what you want about the INS giving us so many appointments and so little time." What's more, the tests on U.S. history and government are hardly demanding. In the Arlington office, successful applicants need to score only seven out of 12, or 58 percent. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The INS is now considering lowering its standards even further. The agency is reviewing proposals to water down the language requirements and exempt entire classes of immigrants from the test on U.S. history and government. INS Commissioner Doris Meissner has even suggested eliminating altogether the mandatory personal interviews in order to save time, and a battery of civil-rights organizations have egged her on. Hispanic activist Harry Pachon says that the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, which he used to head, promotes naturalization because citizenship "is the missing ingredient to Latino empowerment strategies."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; For activists like Pachon, naturalization is not an important aspect of the complicated assimilation process, but a political power grab. The easier, the better. Leticia Quezada of the Los Angeles School Board wants to break down the distinction between citizens and noncitizens entirely by giving the vote to people who have not naturalized. "At one time only white males could vote," she says. "My position is that it's time we cross the line in terms of citizenship." Illegal aliens are already counted as constituents in congressional apportionment under the rules of the 1982 Voting Rights Act, even though they can't vote. California, for example, may have as many as three extra seats in Congress because of its illegal immigrant population.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Statements and policies like these won't calm Americans' jitters about immigrants. In one recent poll, 66 percent said that the United States is no longer a melting pot. Around the globe, they see cultural differences tearing countries apart. Many Americans are beginning to wonder: If immigrants in all of their racial, ethnic, and linguistic diversity fuel the "balkanization" of America, then what good are they? Naturalization is the only legal instrument that allows the United States--a "nation of immigrants"--to decide who is an American and who is not. Without it, the cohesive United States resembles the fractured United Nations.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Americans once expected immigrants to naturalize--and to do it for the right reasons. In the early part of this century, a broad social movement set its sights on the "Americanization" of the U.S. foreign-born population. The Americanization Movement was in essence an educational drive to promote the assimilation of the millions of immigrants from eastern and southern Europe who swarmed to the United States on the eve of the First World War. The Americanizers, according to historian Edward George Hartmann, encouraged a barrage of "special classes, lectures, and mass meetings, where [immigrants] might be instructed in the language, the ideals, and outlook on life which had come to be accepted as the traditional American point of view." They made naturalization central to their efforts, since it would help transform foreign nationals into patriotic Americans.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; This was the vision of the Founding Fathers for their new republic. Their main concern regarding immigration was whether newcomers would rid themselves of any undemocratic principles that they might have learned in unfree lands. Would America's openness ultimately usher in people with opposing values?	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"To admit foreigners indiscriminately to the rights of citizens, the moment they put foot in our country," wrote Alexander Hamilton, "would be nothing less than to admit the Grecian horse into the citadel of our liberty and sovereignty." The solution, according to Hamilton, was to draw immigrants gradually into civil society, "to enable aliens to get rid of foreign and acquire American attachments; to learn the principles and imbibe the spirit of our government; and to admit of a philosophy at least, of their feeling a real interest in our affairs."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Americanization Movement drew from these principles. When President William McKinley fell in 1901 to the bullet of anarchist Leon Czolgosz--an American by birth but of obvious foreign parentage--people looked to naturalization, not restriction, as an answer to their so-called immigrant problem. After McKinley's death, the Sons of the American Revolution rushed to print a small leaflet entitled <i>A Welcome to Immigrants and Some Good Advice.</i> It urged immigrants to become citizens as soon as possible. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Since 1907, more than 13 million immigrants have become citizens. According to the 1990 Census, more than half of all adult immigrants who had arrived before 1985 were citizens in 1989. Even so, few immigrants come to the United States because they want to be Americanized. The vast majority migrate to improve their economic status. Assimilation, however, starts to work on newcomers immediately as they pick up a few words of English and become familiar with American customs and mores. Any decision to naturalize comes gradually. The choice is very difficult, because it involves thorny questions of loyalty, identity, and family. Naturalization may lead to full membership in American society, but it can also seem like a betrayal of one's heritage.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; But as the years go by, immigrants form families, buy homes, and sink roots in the community. They begin to understand how citizenship can improve their quality of life. Like any characteristic of assimilation, the rate of naturalization increases over time. By the end of 1993, about 38 percent of immigrants who arrived in 1982 had naturalized, as had about 41 percent of those who came in 1977. Immigrants who naturalize typically do so after living in the United States for about 10 years. Asians and Africans tend to naturalize more quickly than other groups. Canadians and Mexicans tend to wait the longest.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The bureaucratic inefficiencies of the INS--which has a reputation for being one of the worst-run federal agencies--stand in the way of many applicants. One study estimates that a third of all applicants abandon their quest for citizenship before any formal resolution. In some INS districts, the wait between the first application and the actual citizenship ceremony can be two years. With dozens of forms, questions, and interviews to navigate, it is easy to give up.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; For those who persevere, the formal citizenship interview is the cornerstone of the process. The one-on-one encounter with an INS officer lasts for about 15 minutes. Nobody but a lawyer may accompany the naturalization applicant. The INS examiner's first priority is to make sure that every form in the citizenship application is complete and that the FBI criminal background check has not turned up anything unsavory. His second task is to determine a candidate's English-speaking ability.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The test on U.S. history and government is next. The exams all draw their content from a series of short books published by the INS. Their actual administration, however, can vary considerably among the INS districts, which are allowed to develop their own testing procedures. They may be conducted orally or in written form. Applicants who pass a fill-in-the blank test generally are assumed to have met the English-language reading and writing requirements. The questions are simple enough: "Who was the first president of the United States?" "Why do we have a holiday on the 4th of July?" "Who makes the laws in the United States?" They also may ask applicants to name their governor or one of their senators. Some questions have several possible answers. If a test asks "Who was Abraham Lincoln?", an INS examiner will accept any of these responses: the 16th president, author of the Emancipation Proclamation, deliverer of the Gettysburg Address, president during the Civil War, the president who freed the slaves, and so on. Some of the questions are a little tricky. If asked "Who elects the president?", most Americans will say, "the people." The correct answer, however, is the electoral college.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Passing the exam does not require a perfect score. The INS office in Seattle, for example, uses an oral test with 16 questions--eight in history and eight in government. Four correct in each category earns a passing grade. In truth, the majority of test-takers do not squeak by--they do quite well. Most score in the 80 to 90 percent range. Scores of 100 percent are common.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Americanization Movement of the early 20th century viewed the classroom as an important tool, both to teach newcomers how to speak English and to instill them with the value of citizenship. Immigrant-aid organizations, community colleges, and adult education programs continue to offer citizenship training courses today, but their impact on the foreign-born population is probably not as great as it was 80 years ago. Part of the problem is that public agencies like the INS do not encourage immigrants to enroll in citizenship education. Cost is not the reason, since civics instruction is cheap. Rather, they generally have not engaged in the types of innovative partnerships with local groups that can boost interest in naturalization, streamline the INS, and ultimately Americanize people who might otherwise be left out of the system. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; One exception, however, can be found in Seattle, Washington. A program there could serve as a model for the whole country and allow a new spirit of Americanization to regain a foothold in the naturalization process.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Students who enroll in one of the 21 citizenship classes offered by community colleges, churches, and immigrant-aid organizations in the region receive special consideration from the INS. They are screened for English fluency and pay a tuition of $60 to $120, depending on where they learn, in addition to standard INS application fees. But instead of waiting half a year for their INS interview, as is common in Seattle, students wait just 10 weeks. During this period, they attend citizenship class and prepare for the INS exam, which they take in the 10th week. The waiting list for the initiative has hundreds of immigrants on it.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; For three hours a night, four nights a week, Greg Gourley serves as an an instructor in the program. He tells his students what they will need to know in order to pass the INS naturalization exam--plus a lot more. Like test-takers everywhere, many naturalization applicants simply want to earn a passing grade. Gourley teaches to the test, but includes a lot of information that probably will not be on it. "Being a citizen is about more than just passing an exam," he says. For example, he instructs the class in the Pledge of Allegiance. By the third or fourth week, everyone has memorized it. They recite it at the start of each class, even though none will be asked anything about the pledge during their naturalization interview. "Just about every kid in the United States knows that pledge," says Gourley. "It's important for these people who are going to be citizens to know it, too."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Students take the classes because they have some learning to do. "The Soviets didn't teach us anything about America--nothing true, anyway," says Viktor Bozhko, a Ukrainian in a citizenship course at Lake Hills Baptist Church, in Bellevue. "This is the best way for me to learn about my new home." Says the Cuban-born Ramon Negrin, one of Gourley's students at Bellevue Community College: "This is a good refresher course. It's making me proud to be an American."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; These citizenship courses deepen immigrants' understanding of U.S. history and government. They turn borderline cases into applicants who ace their exams. They also can bring new people into the system by instilling those who otherwise would hesitate to apply with the knowledge and confidence they need to pass. Receiving 20 to 30 hours of citizenship instruction over 10 weeks' time would teach something to just about anybody, from a thoroughly assimilated immigrant to a well-educated native. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Immigration and Naturalization Service doesn't have the resources to provide this education itself. What is needed is a modern-day Americanization Movement of private and local public institutions that would revive the old-fashioned ideal of civics instruction for immigrant adults, at a time when millions of them suddenly want to naturalize.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; This mission is doubly important for immigrants, most of whom cannot fall back on childhood stories about patriot Nathan Hale's regret that he had "but one life to give" for his country, or President Lincoln's determination that government "of the people, by the people and for the people shall not perish from the earth." Yet they must learn such stories, for this is the stuff of which citizens--citizens of a nation dedicated to a proposition--are made. Ben Franklin once remarked that our Constitution offers Americans "a republic--if you can keep it." Turning immigrants into citizens, into Americans who cherish both their freedoms and their responsibilities, may be the surest way to keep this republic safe through the ages.

<P>
<h2>ASIAN STUDIES CENTER</h2>
<P>
Not surprisingly, four of the ten countries with the best ratings
on Heritage's <a href="/townhall/econ_index/toc.html.cgi"><I>Index of Economic Freedom</a></I> - and eight of
the top 20 - were from the Asia-Pacific region. When the United
States, Canada, and Chile are included - all of which belong to
the 18-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) --
the more broadly defined region boasts 11 of the top 20 freest
economies in the world. The APEC nations also now account for
40 percent of all global trade.
<P>
In recognition of the growing importance of the Asia-Pacific community,
The Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center was established
in 1983. Today, the Center is recognized on both sides of the
Pacific as one of the most important research and policy centers
on diplomatic, economic, and security issues affecting the United
States and Asia. 
<P>
While trade and security issues dominated the calendar, Director
<a href="/heritage/staff/przystup.htm">James Przystup</a> and the Asian Studies Center staff made a strong
case in 1994 for significantly upgrading U.S. relations with the
Republic of China on Taiwan, a booming country of more than 20
million people that continues to be treated as a second-class
world citizen by the United States. Visiting Fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/plunk.htm">Daryl Plunk</a>
and <a href="/heritage/staff/allen.htm">Richard V. Allen</a>, National Security Advisor to President
Reagan and Chairman of the Asian Studies Center's Advisory Council,
provided Washington with much-needed guidance on defusing the
growing crisis over North Korea's nuclear-weapons program. And
Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/oquinn.htm">Robert O'Quinn</a> offered the White House an agenda
for the mid-November APEC summit, proposing that leaders of the
18 member countries set a &quot;time certain&quot; for establishing
a trans-Pacific free-trade area, the topic of an Oct. 27 Asian
Studies Center conference featuring Nancy Adams, U.S. Trade Representative
for APEC Affairs, and Paula Stern, former Chairwoman of the U.S.
International Trade Commission. 
<P>
The Heritage-sponsored Washington Roundtable for the Asia-Pacific
Press (WRAPP) hosted several &quot;newsmaker&quot; breakfasts
during the year. Rep. Floyd Spence (R-SC), then ranking Republican
on the House Armed Services Committee, discussed the North Korean
nuclear threat. Political analysts Victor Kamber, a liberal Democrat,
and Bradley O'Leary a conservative Republican, discussed the congressional
elections. And Heritage' <a href="/heritage/staff/holmes.htm">Kim Holmes</a> discussed <a href="/townhall/econ_index/toc.html.cgi"><I>The Index
of Economic Freedom</a></I> and proposed changes in U.S. foreign
aid policy. 
<P>
Important financial support for many of the Asian Studies Center's
programs continues to be provided by the Korea Foundation Endowment
for Korean Studies.

<h2>WHAT AMERICANS WILL PAY IF CONGRESS FAILS TO REFORM MEDICARE: THE STATE AND CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT IMPACT</h2>

<b>By Robert E. Moffit, John C. Liu, and David H. Winston</b><sup>1</sup><br><a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
<hr><a href="wel-62mp.html">Index-Map of Supporting Data by Congressional District</a><br><a href="fyi62cmp.html">Data Table: Cost of a 3.52% Medicare Tax by State</a></center><hr><P>Medicare's increasingly dangerous financial plight leaves Congress with only two options if the program is to continue providing health care to seniors:  either restructure and reform the program or significantly increase payroll taxes on America's businesses and working families. While payroll taxes technically are shared between employers and employees, in reality most taxes on business are shifted to workers in the form of reduced wages or compensation -- in some cases, even job loss. Thus, any new payroll tax to shore up the financially failing Medicare system will be another tax on America's working families.
<P>
Medicare's seven-member Board of Trustees, which includes President Clinton's Secretaries of Health and Human Services, Treasury, and Labor, has determined that the Medicare Hospitalization (HI, or Part A) Trust Fund, which finances hospital services to the nation's elderly, will be insolvent in the year 2002. It urges "prompt, effective and decisive action" to address Medicare's financial condition. In the words of David Walker and Stanford Ross, the Board's two "public trustees" (private citizens), Medicare "is clearly unsustainable in its present form," and its reform "needs to be addressed urgently as a distinct legislative initiative."2<P>Several proposals have been advanced to restructure Medicare. Using a well-tested model for congressional reform, Heritage Foundation analysts have proposed transforming the current Medicare system into one that would look like the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), the popular 35-year-old consumer-driven program that covers retired congressional and federal workers. The FEHBP, unlike Medicare, is based on the market principles of consumer choice and competition.3  This would allow Medicare enrollees to pick government-certified private insurance plans and, like retirees in the FEHBP, receive a government contribution toward the purchase of those plans. Similar legislation is being considered on Capitol Hill.
<P>
Americans are beginning to understand that unless Congress restructures Medicare to preserve high quality medical services but at lower cost, Congress will have to cut the supply of medical services available to enrollees or significantly increase the HI payroll tax to avoid the bankruptcy of the HI Trust Fund.4  With the notable exception of the 1989 repeal of the costly Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988,5 Congress has expanded, not deleted, Medicare's benefits and services. Its failure to reform the program means that Congress will likely resort to higher taxes on working families to cover Medicare's soaring costs. But given the gravity of Medicare's financial condition, particularly the threatened bankruptcy of the HI Trust Fund, the level of taxation on workers and businesses that would be needed just to finance the program in its current form would be enormous, dwarfing even the Clinton Administration's tax hike of 1993, the largest single tax increase in U.S. history.
<P>
Taxpayers also should realize that in addition to any HI payroll tax, they will pay general taxes to maintain the solvency of Medicare Part B, which covers doctors' fees and other services. Taxpayers already subsidize 71 percent of the cost of Part B's premiums. Unless Congress implements changes, the taxpayer's share will increase automatically to 75 percent on January 1, 1996. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the taxes required to fund Part B will jump from an estimated $57.5 billion in 1996 to $93.5 billion by the year 2000.6<p><b>Medicare's Payroll Tax.</b> Middle-class American families with children today surrender well over one-third of their income to federal, state, and local taxation. Federal taxation alone takes approximately 25 percent of this average family income.7  And among many families, federal payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare even exceed the federal income tax.8<p>Medicare's hospital insurance program currently is funded through a 2.9 percent federal payroll tax, divided equally between employers and employees with each paying 1.45 percent, except for the self-employed, who pay the full 2.9 percent. The imposition of an even higher Medicare payroll tax, like the imposition of a mandate on an employer to purchase health insurance for employees, is an additional labor cost on business.9  But business labor costs are largely passed on to workers in reduced wages, benefits, or even employment. Standard economic analysis confirms this well-known "pass through" effect of business labor costs on the wages of employees. A survey of the economic literature by Lewin-VHI, one of the nation's leading econometrics firms, indicates that for every additional $100 in mandated benefits an employer must provide for an employee, an average of $88 will be paid for in reduced wages.10<P>Today, the Medicare HI tax is still a relatively modest payroll tax. But over the years it has grown steadily to finance the hospitalization program, and it will get bigger if Congress cannot refor
m Medicare in a cost-efficient fashion. When the HI tax was first imposed in 1966, it was limited to the first $6,600 of taxable income per year. In the years since the enactment of the Medicare program, the maximum taxable amount has been raised 23 times.11  Through the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-66), Congress, upon the recommendation of the Clinton Administration, repealed the legal limitation on taxable income as part of its major 1993 tax initiative This means that all earnings today are subject to the HI payroll tax.
<p>

<b>FINANCIAL INSTABILITY AND FUTURE TAX INCREASES</b>
<P>
As explained in the Medicare Trustees' Report, the "adequacy of the HI program's scheduled financing to support program costs in the future is examined under three alternative sets of assumptions:  low cost, intermediate, and high cost. The low cost alternative is a more optimistic set of assumptions from the standpoint of HI financing and the high cost alternative is a more pessimistic set of assumptions."12  Further, continues the Report, "[the] intermediate set of assumptions represents the Trustees' best estimate of the expected future economic and demographic trends that will affect the financial status of the program."  The analysis used in this study uses the intermediate assumption. The reality is that under any of the three assumptions, the HI Trust Fund will face insolvency in from six to eleven years. Because the current political environment has focused the debate in terms of "preserving the solvency" of the HI Trust Fund, long-term solutions are necessary. 
<P>
The Medicare trustees have outlined three possible scenarios for Congress should it choose not to reform the Medicare program and decide simply to raise the HI payroll tax. The options range from taking immediate action to various stages of delay. Naturally, if Congress fails to take immediate steps as suggested by the trustees, the required increase in the HI payroll tax will be higher in the future than it would be if they raised the HI tax immediately. Because the trustees believe that "prompt, effective, and decisive action is necessary,"13 the analysis in this study centers around their estimate that the increase required to achieve long-term actuarial balance is 3.52 percent of taxable payroll.14<P>In order to achieve a long-term actuarial balance in the HI trust fund (permanent fiscal solvency),15 the Medicare trustees have stated that HI payroll taxes could be increased immediately or by a higher amount at some future time. If Congress opts to place the HI Trust Fund on a course towards permanent fiscal solvency through an additional increase in the percentage of taxable income, this will mean 3.52 percent in additional taxation, bringing the total HI payroll tax to 6.4 percent, divided equally between employers and employees.
<P>

<b>THE TAX CONSEQUENCES IF CONGRESS FAILS TO REFORM MEDICARE</b>
<P>
Using the Heritage Foundation health care simulation model (see appendix for technical specifications), Heritage analysts have computed both the magnitude and the wage effects, by state and congressional district, of an additional 3.52 percent HI payroll tax on workers throughout the country. This analysis represents a "snapshot" of the impact of the payroll tax based on 1993 earnings data, the most recent data generally available. It indicates the impact if the tax had been in effect in 1993. Given the general growth of earnings, total costs would be even greater if the new tax were levied in 1996 or thereafter. Assuming that such a tax increase went into effect, households would face serious financial consequences.
<P><ul>
<li>CONSEQUENCE #1:  A 3.52 percent increase in the HI payroll tax would result in a total of $123.03 billion in new taxes levied on employers and employees in its first year of implementation.  Had the increase been in effect in 1993, the aggregate increase in taxes would range from $101.2 million on wage earners in Wyoming to a high of $7.74 billion on wage earners in California during the first year. Businesses in those states would face a similar levy. Other high tax states would include New York ($9 billion, split between employers and employees), Texas ($8 billion), and Florida ($5.9 billion). As earnings and payroll costs increase in future years, tax revenues also would increase.
<p>
Earners in different congressional districts in some cases would face heavy new tax burdens. In aggregate, the 14th district of New York would be hardest hit ($362,000 each on workers and employers), followed by the 29th district of California ($303,000).
<p>
<li>CONSEQUENCE #2:  A 3.52 percent increase in the HI payroll tax would have a significant impact on employees' earnings, equal to a $115.6 billion loss in earnings if its effect had been felt fully in 1993. Since most of the payroll tax on employers in practice is passed through to employees in reduced earnings, the total impact on workers is larger than the increase in direct payroll taxes. On average, using an 88 percent "pass through," and had the tax increase been fully in effect in 1993, the combined tax and wage loss to employees would range from $656 in Arkansas to $1,081 in New Jersey. To put this in perspective, average wage earnings ranged in 1993 from $19,840 in Arkansas to $32,659 in New Jersey. Thus, the loss would not be insignificant for the average wage earner. Workers, on average, would experience a negative impact on their earnings exceeding $1,000 per year in both the District of Columbia ($1,052) and Alaska ($1,002). Other states in which the negative impact on workers' earnings would be substantial include Connecticut ($996), Massachusetts ($992), Maryland ($980), and New York ($954). This is based on 1993 earnings. In future years, the size of this cost to employees would increase proportionately with the increase in employee earnings compared with 1993.
<P>
<li>CONSEQUENCE #3:  A 3.52 percent increase in the HI payroll tax would be larger than the tax increase of 1993. Enacted as part of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993, the Clinton Administration's tax recommendations amounted to $262.5 billion over five years, the largest single tax increase in American history. But if Congress fails in its efforts to reform and restructure Medicare, and resorts to a 3.52 percent additional payroll tax to shore up the financially troubled hospitalization program, the HI tax increase could exceed it. According to the analysis conducted by the Medicare trustees, the revenues of such a payroll tax could reach $711.0 billion over just five years,16 almost tripling the huge 1993 Clinton tax increase.
</ul><p>

<b>WHY THE CONSEQUENCES COULD BE EVEN WORSE</b>
<p>
If Congress fails to reform Medicare and resorts instead to a heavy new payroll tax to rescue the Part A Trust Fund from bankruptcy, even an increase as high as 3.52 percent, that new level of taxation on America's working families will still be insufficient to maintain the program in its current form. The reason is that the other part of Medicare, the Supplemental Medical Insurance Program (SMI, or Part B), will require an alarming increase in general tax support to continue paying for physician and outpatient services. While Medicare Part B, because of its design, is not threatened with financial insolvency, its costs are exploding. Over 70 percent of these costs today are borne by taxpayers. Under current law, the Congressional Budget Office projects that taxpayers already will be spending $370.5 billion in taxes over the next five years, subsidizing 75 percent of the Supplementary Medical Insurance program.

<h2>APPENDIX</h2><br>
<b>COST CALCULATION ASSUMPTIONS<br>
<p>

State-Level Analysis Assumptions</b>
<p><a href="fyi62cmp.html">Data Table: Cost of a 3.52% Medicare Tax by State</a><br>
<p>
The national aggregate of employee earnings was derived from the March 1994 <i>Current Population Survey</i>. These earnings are for 1993. The cost calculations assume the payroll tax increase had been in effect that year:  the normal growth in earnings means that the payroll tax and its associated costs would be higher in 1996 and subsequent years.
<p>
Due to the nature of self-reported income surveys, the CPS generally underestimates earnings. In order to compensate for this, we compared the CPS total with the national employee and proprietor earnings reported in the <i>Statistical Abstract of the United States</i>  table on national income in 1993 (as determined by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, <i>Survey of Current Business</i>, April 1994) in order to develop a multiplier to adjust the CPS reported earnings.
<p>
After April 1986, all state and local employees were required to pay Medicare taxes. In 1991, however, the law was amended to allow those hired prior to that date to opt out. The Congressional Research Service has estimated that as of March 1994, 1.7 million workers were not covered by Medicare. Using the 1.7 million figure we removed those workers and their earnings from our totals based on the state-by-state distribution of state and local employees and their earnings in the March 1994 <i>Current Population Survey</i>.
<p>
Based on a survey of economic literature estimating the "pass-through" wage effect of employer mandates by health care econometrics firm Lewin-VHI, we assumed 88 percent of the cost of the additional tax to be passed to employee in reduced compensation.17  We also assumed that the pass-through had fully occurred. Therefore, we assumed the total cost of the additional Medicare tax to employees to be 88 percent of the business's share of the Medicare tax (about 1.56 percent) in addition to the 1.76 percent tax on wages paid directly by the employee. 
<p>
 Total cost to employees (direct and indirect pass through) was divided by the total number of wage earners who did not opt out to determine the average cost per wage earner by state.
<p>

<b>Congressional District Analysis Assumptions</b>
<p><a href="wel-62mp.html">Map-Index of Supporting Data</a><p>
To calculate the cost of the Medicare HI tax at the congressional district level, we used the 1990 U.S. Census STF-3D file in addition to our state-level findings, calculated using the 1994 <i>Current Population Survey</i> . The 1990 STF-3D file contains congressional district data, while the <i>Current Population Survey</i> data can be analyzed at the individual and state levels.
<p>
In order to account for increases in earnings that occurred 1990-1993, we compared the 1990 STF-3D numbers with the earnings for each state, calculated using the 1994 <i>Current Population Survey</i>. We assumed that for each state, increases in wages were normally distributed within the state.
<p>
It also was necessary to remove from our analysis the earnings of those state and local employees exempt from Medicare taxes. To do so we again compared the distribution of state and local employees in congressional districts, calculated using the 1990 STF-3D numbers, with the 1994 CPS state-level distribution of earnings of the exempt 1.7 million state and local employees. As in the case of earnings, we assumed those state and local employees were normally distributed throughout the state's congressional districts. In addition, we did not account for state and local employee wage differentials between congressional districts.
<p>
The total number of households per congressional district also has changed since 1990, so we compared the total households from the STF-3D file with total households in the 1994 <i>Current Population Survey</i> to calculate the number of households per CD in 1993. We determined the cost per household in our analysis; however, because this includes households with no income, the actual cost to households with income will be higher.

<p>
Dear fellow conservative,
<p>
The Leadership Institute (LI) educates conservatives like you for participation in the public policy process.<p>
In 1995 2,426 people enrolled for LI schools all across the country. <p>
Most young men and women who come to my schools are already philosophically committed to the conservative values which keep America free and strong.  The staff and faculty of my schools reinforce that committment.<p>
But it is not sufficient to have the right ideas if you do not implement them.  As a conservative, you owe it to your philosophy to study how to win.<p>
Over the years I have learned that victory in a public policy contest is largely determined by the number and effectiveness of the activists on the respective sides.<p>
That's what the Leadership Institute is all about -- building responsible conservative leadership today, for the challenges of tomorrow.<p>
You should prepare yourself now to be effective in the public policy process.<p>
You could be one of the new leaders I train in 1996.<p>
You're welcome to attend any program listed on this Web site.  You may decide to attend more than one.  Many of the schools and services build on each other.<p>
<!--
If you are a high school or college student I urge you to start with my <a href="sc-yl.html">Youth Leadership School</a>.  This school, which I have conducted in various forms since 1968, provides the "nuts and bolts" technology needed to succeed in politics at all levels.<p>
-->
Many of today's leaders, including Senator Mitch McConnell, Governor Terry Branstad, Congressmen Jack Fields, Steve Stockman, Mark Souder, David McIntosh, and Virginia Attorney General Jim Gilmore, used the leadership Institute to launch their careers.<p>
Now it's your turn.<p>
The <a href="school.html">Student Publications School</a>, trains conservative students to start and run successful campus publications.  Attending this school will allow you to provide a forum for conservative views on your campus and gain valuable journalism experience as you fight the liberal monopoly of the college media.<p>
If you're graduating or have already begun a public policy career, I have several other programs that will interest you.  This Web site, will introduce you to  my <a href="sc-brj.html">Broadcast Journalism School</a>, <a href="sc-ch.html>Capitol Hill Staff Training School</a>, Foreign Service Opportunity School, <a href="sc-cd.html>Candidate Development School</a> and <a href="sc-pr.html">Public Relations School</a>.<p>
Your interest in public policy may take you far.  Please let me help you as you invest your time and effort in America's future.<p>
Thank you for considering what the Leadership Institute can offer you.  Listed below are brief descriptions of many of the Institute's programs.<p>
These programs are all made possibe by the generous support of the LI's donors.  The revenue from school tuition accounts for a tiny percentage of the total cost of the Institute's efforts.<p>
If you would like to help advance the work of the Institute via a <a href="donate.html.cgi">contribution,</a> you can do this on-line with your credit card or by mail to: The Leadership Institute, Steven P.J. Wood Building, 1101 Highland Street, Arlington, VA 22201.<p>
Please mark "Town Hall" in the memo field of your check.<p>
I look forward to hearing from you soon.<p>
Cordially,<p>
<img alt="mortsig" src="mortsig.gif">
<br>Morton C. Blackwell<br>
President<p>
<p>

P.S.  I've also put on-line here some of <a href="speeches.html">my speeches and writings</a> which I hope you find interesting.

<h3>Morton C. Blackwell's<br>
Speeches and Writings</center></h3>
<p>

	From being the youngest Goldwater delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1964 to serving on the White House Staff for President Reagan, I have been involved in many aspects of the conservative movement.
<p>
	Over the years, I have written down many of my thoughts concerning conservative politics.
<P>
	I have compiled them and published them here so you may read them.  Feel free to read them on-line or even download them to read later.
<P>
	I would appreciate any <a href="mailto:mcb@townhall.com">comments</a> you have.  And if you would like to <a href="donate.html.cgi">support</a> the work of the Leadership Institute, thank you for your tax-deductible contribution.<p>

	Spend a little time in virtually any city in America and you'll see them -- in doorways, under bridges, poking through trash cans, begging for loose change. They are America's homeless. They no longer wear the face of the 55-year-old alcoholic man; they look more and more like young crack addicts, battered women and children, prostitutes, gamblers, and AIDS sufferers. On any given day, about 600,000 people are living either on the streets or in shelters trying to stay alive.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Americans are a compassionate people. But traditional approaches to the problem--promoted through government initiatives and many private charities -- have been so ineffective at treating the fundamental causes of homelessness that we must reconsider what it means to help our neighbors in need.
<p>
<table cellpadding="5">
<tr width=80>
<td><hr width=75><h3><font size="+3">M</font>ost homeless programs fail because they protect lifestyles that produce homelessness and neglect the moral and spiritual means to overcome it. </h3><hr width=75></td>
<td hspace=5>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Many government programs assume that homelessness is simply the absence of four walls and a roof. Usually it is not: The lack of affordable housing, though a problem, is not why most of these people have no permanent address. Most people in trouble economically have friends and families whose homes they could share temporarily if they choose to. The level of government spending on the problem likewise leaves deeper issues untouched. There are more than 60 separate federal programs that provide some form of help. The federal <a href="http://www.hud.gov/">Department of Housing and Urban Development</a> (HUD) now operates homeless shelters and drug rehabilitation programs in every major city in the United States. But the rates at which the able-bodied homeless graduate to independence from these programs rarely rise above single digits. </td></tr></table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	America need not settle for this level of failure. If anyone can testify to that, we can.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The <a href="http://www.iugm.org">International Union of Gospel Missions</a> -- whose staff members often emerge from the ranks of the formerly homeless -- has been helping the destitute break the cycle of dependence since 1913. Last year, our emergency services and long-term rehabilitation programs helped 14,000 homeless men and women achieve self-sufficiency. These were not "easy" cases. Thousands walked into our doors addicted to alcohol, heroin, crack cocaine, and other drugs. Many have been prostitutes, or veterans who couldn't adjust to civilian life. Many have committed crimes, served time in prison, and failed other rehabilitation programs.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Our experience teaches us that America needs nothing less than a reformation in the way we think about homelessness. Many traditional and government-funded approaches fail not for lack of money but for a deficit of vision: They do not treat the whole person. They neglect the familial and moral aspects of a person's life. They refuse to challenge the homeless person's fundamental way of thinking. Says Rev. Mickey Kalman, the executive director of City Rescue Mission in Oklahoma City: "The philosophy of government homeless programs is to respect and protect lifestyles that produce homelessness."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Most significantly, these programs ignore the central dimension of the problem -- the spiritual. After more than 35 years of trying to help homeless people with every imaginable problem, I cannot escape this fact: Men and women who walk away from their jobs, their families, and their homes do so because, fundamentally, they are turning away God and His claim on their lives. But government-funded policies, by definition, must exclude this vital dynamic from the discussion. It is a prescription predestined for failure.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Not only are government approaches not working, but government regulations continue to impede or thwart the most innovative programs. Labor laws, zoning issues, licensing requirements are all getting in the way of private, religiously based efforts to deliver effective care. Authorizing block grants and returning power to the states will not by themselves make much of a difference, because it's state and local governments that throw up some of the most egregious obstacles to our faith-based shelter programs. Moreover, much of government's regulatory itch is aggravated by blindness to the moral and spiritual causes of homelessness.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What follows are some of the dynamics of change: We make sure that these elements are present in all of our 245 rescue missions in the 210 cities in which we operate nationwide. Though our missions offer various educational, job-training, relational, and other skills, these three principles establish an ethical and religious foundation without which all our other efforts would amount to nothing. <p><center><b>The Faith Factor</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It is very difficult to overstate the importance of the spiritual aspect of this problem. <i>Spiritual renewal is the fountainhead for personal transformation</i>.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Enoch Walker was married and had a child he loved, a job he enjoyed, and a house in Washington, D.C. Then he began abusing alcohol and drugs, what he calls "the great removers" in his life, because they became more important to him than his family and friends. Soon his wife left him, taking their child. He became so abusive that even his dog left him. He lost his job, smashed his car, and started living on the streets.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Walker went through several rehabilitation programs. He doesn't know the precise number because he doesn't even remember some of them. Yet each time, he slipped back into addiction. "When I was functional, I would put on a nice three-piece suit and go and get the good jobs," he says. "But it was like putting a three-piece suit on a fish. Nothing would happen on the inside."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Then he checked himself into the Gospel Rescue Ministries of Washington, D.C. There, he received not only mental and physical counseling, but something else -- spiritual guidance. As he says, "They reached my heart and . . . gave me an awakening." He has now been clean for three years, and is a self-employed carpenter with two other men working for him.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Walker's story is important because his background is so typical of America's homeless population. Homeless advocates are quick to point out that many of the homeless suffer serious or acute mental illness. They are correct. There are no easy answers for how to help heal these people and restore balance and normality to their lives. Many of them may never leave an institutionalized or group-home setting. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The mentally ill, however, do not make up the majority of the people who walk into our centers. About 80 percent of the homeless who enter the City Mission in Cleveland, for example, show symptoms of substance abuse. At our Mel Trotter Ministries in Grand Rapids, Michigan, perhaps 90 percent struggle with addictions that have helped spawn and sustain a whole set of destructive attitudes and behaviors. There is simply no way to get at those behaviors without first helping the addict break his or her addiction for good. Most government and traditional shelter rehabilitation programs are notoriously poor in curing addictions. Many do not even try.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But those that do suffer from a crucial flaw. Although grounded in the best of intentions, federal programs by law can only administer to mental and physical maladies, not the spiritual. Any homeless programs that receive federal funds "must provide shelter and other eligible activities in a manner free from religious influence," writes Michael Stover, HUD's assistant general counsel for the Rocky Mountain region, in a 1995 legal brief. "It may not provide religiously oriented services to persons using the homeless shelter and must not hire only persons from a particular religious persuasion." There it is: an explicit rejection of faith as the crucial component of change. This is why the overwhelming majority of our mission directors steer clear of government funding.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We've seen countless people wander into our shelters with a mind-wrenching addiction to crack cocaine, for example, and it's obvious to us that it takes more than physical and mental counseling to break that grip. Simply telling that addict to eat his vegetables and study the multiplication tables just isn't enough. Ask any of our mission directors, many of whom have 20 to 30 years experience helping the homeless: The spectrum of addictions and difficulties from which the homeless suffer have no long-term cure outside of a heartfelt commitment of faith. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Skid Row is not a geographical location," says Kalman, a former drug addict. "It's a heart condition. Unless you change a homeless individual's heart -- not just his mind and body -- he will remain homeless."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For this reason, all of our missions instill in homeless people the reality of a God who loves them, cares for them, and wants to help change them. In our view, based not only on our theology but on our experience, it is Jesus Christ, not any program, who transforms a man's or woman's life, who gives them the strength to summon the courage to break their destructive habits.<p><center><b>A Moral Incubator</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Hand in hand with faith commitment is the sustained determination -- both from shelter staff and the homeless themselves -- to stay clean, hold down a job, or save a marriage. <i>The homeless need an environment in which they are challenged to acknowledge and consistently renounce unhealthy behaviors; otherwise, they won't acquire the practical or emotional skills they need to succeed</i>.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Mouthing a religious commitment is not enough; there must be actions to match. Our shelters insist not on perfection, but on repeated, good-faith efforts to change. And with God's grace, and a disciplined environment, they do. "We not only place responsibility on our clients," says Rev. Carl Resener, the executive director of the Nashville Union Rescue Mission, "we demand that, as a condition of living at the mission and participating in its programs, these men and women change their destructive habits."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This is one reason our shelter programs span several months. It gives the homeless time not only to rid themselves of their addictions, but also to build a foundation of faith, education, and social skills necessary to succeed in life. Consider our Regeneration Program at our Miami Rescue Mission. Rev. Frank Jacobs, the executive director, oversees an eight-month recovery program for 130 men. Bible study is mandatory. The men commit to memory biblical passages--they call them "arsenal verses"--that address behavioral problems such as drunkenness, laziness, and theft. The mission also offers a three- to four-month period of daily instruction on coping and social skills, with a heavy emphasis on relapse prevention.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Listen to Raymond Nastu, a drug addict arrested more than 80 times for offenses ranging from drug possession to brawling. He checked into the Bridgeport Rescue Mission in Connecticut. "I should have been dead so many times I can't keep track of them," he says. But the mission's strict regimen and climate of tough love turned him around. "I never had people care about me the way they do here, and that gave me the hope and courage to believe I could change." Today, Nastu is drug free and works as a carpenter. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Now compare that to some of the larger shelters in the country that place virtually no conditions on their residents. The results have not been pretty. Take the Mitch Snyder Shelter, in Washington, D.C. It is named after the homeless activist whose 1983 hunger strike prompted the Reagan administration to renovate a federal building so that it could be used as a homeless shelter. As documented by a <i>60 Minutes</i> expose, this shelter has been a haven for the selling of crack cocaine and liquor, as well as misuse of charitable funds and general corruption.<P><center><b>Friends and Family</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Our missions place a heavy emphasis on rebuilding relationships -- to one's family, friends, and religious community. <i>Positive relationships are a vital link between the homeless and lasting rehabilitation</i>.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"We don't always want to put our clients back with their old friends because sometimes the old friends are the problem," says Rev. George Verley of the Union Gospel Mission in St. Paul. "However, the worst thing in the world is for them to be alone, so we teach them to establish relationships. It's vital that they have this support structure when they leave us."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This is probably one of the most overlooked elements of most traditional and government-funded shelter programs. The homeless typically are treated in utter isolation; little attempt is made to reconnect them to family members. Yet when caregivers don't know a person's family background, it often becomes much more difficult to discern the most effective ways to help. <p><table>
<tr width=80>
<td hspace=5>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Many shelters, fearful of crossing church-state lines, do not even introduce the homeless to religious communities that could offer support. The Salvation Army shelters are a noteworthy exception here, but the majority of shelters have no process for helping a recovering addict plant roots in his or her community.</td><td><hr width=75><h3><font size="+3">T</font>he Department of  Housing and Urban Development says any shelter receiving federal funds must operate "free from religious influence." </h3><hr width=75></td> </td></tr></table>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	There may be no more important step for a formerly homeless person, however, than to be grounded in a community of caring, committed individuals. Listen to Enoch Walker again: "If you do not have people surrounding you who care about you and give you unconditional love and give you the time that it takes to work yourself through it and work with you, I do not really see too many people who can make it." The pressures of life, the temptations of the street, the siren call of old habits -- all can easily prove to be too much for the men and women struggling to get back on their feet.<p><center><b>The Government Albatross</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We know that these and other principles are crucial to effectively helping the homeless help themselves. Though we don't expect the people we serve to pay us a dime -- most couldn't -- that doesn't mean we have no expectations of them. "There are two root causes of homelessness," says Rev. Mike Edwards from the Los Angeles Mission. "Lack of relationships and lack of responsibility. Re-establishing a sense of both is key to our long-term success."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Success for us means much more than feeding people and keeping them safe, as important as those objectives are. Our aim is to help people break their addictions, learn basic life skills, and become honest, productive members of their communities. Over the last few years, we've conducted internal studies of our programs and the results are truly encouraging: The vast majority of our missions achieve success rates of more than 50 percent, with many achieving success rates of 70 or 80 percent. That means that most of the people who graduate from one of our programs become independent; a few slip back into old habits, but most remain addiction free, employed, and connected to family and friends.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Our success is also reflected in support from our communities. Eight years ago, the cumulative budgets of the 210 U.S.-based member missions in the International Union of Gospel Missions totaled $50 million. Today, IUGM counts 245 missions as members, and their cumulative budgets add up to more than $300 million. The overwhelming majority of our programs are funded privately, through individual donors, churches, and corporate sponsors. We don't require or expect government to lend a hand -- and it hasn't.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Nor do we expect government to get in the way of our efforts -- but it has. There are several areas where government bureaucrats have been unsupportive or downright hostile to rescue ministries' efforts. These include labor laws, zoning issues, licensing, surplus food distribution, and disaster relief. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;v	Most of their objections stem from their reading (misreading, actually) of the First Amendment's religion clauses, designed to ensure citizens' basic religious freedoms. To which we respond: If we want a person to be truly free, that person must first be free of drugs. This is the promise rescue ministry fulfills.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Consider the following trouble areas:<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Labor.</b> For years, rescue missions have struggled with the issue of whether homeless men and women who do work in the missions as part of rehabilitation qualify as employees under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/206.html">Fair Labor Standards Act</a>. In September 1990, the Labor Department determined that the <a href="http://w3.salvationarmy.org/saweb/home.htm">Salvation Army</a> had to pay the minimum wage to clients performing work as part of rehabilitation, unless the Army's location registered as a "sheltered workshop." (Sheltered workshops historically have been places handicapped people went for training, not live-in facilities.)<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	After much political and legal wrangling, the Labor Department suspended enforcement pending further study. The policy remains in suspension, but has not been formally revoked.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Zoning.</b> City and county boards have stopped or interfered with mission programs across the nation. The Denver Rescue Mission is located in an area known as Lower Downtown or "LoDo." This was formerly Denver's Skid Row, an area where the destitute congregated. In recent years, however, the area has been redeveloped and now supports a burgeoning night life.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	That welcome development has had a most unwelcome side effect: City officials have ratcheted up their efforts to curb the mission's work. For example, on cold nights, the 110-bed mission used to set up about 40 cots in the chapel to meet the increased need. City officials never raised any objection because it took people off the street. Today, city officials flatly prohibit this practice.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;City officials in Daytona Beach, Florida, have not allowed the Daytona Rescue Mission to locate within the city. The mission has gone to federal court. In Albany, New York, the Capital City Rescue Mission has been trying to relocate in order to expand its services. Recently, the city rejected the mission's request to move to a previously agreed-upon property. Other missions that have encountered significant roadblocks include the Union Gospel Missions of Dallas, Spokane, and Yakima, Washington.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Licensing.</b> The licensing of faith-based programs, beyond issues of health and safety, has become a major impediment to many missions' spiritual integrity. Licensing has brought regulations such as a "client's bill of rights" in Tennessee, which originally included the right not to be presented with religious teaching. (That's somewhat like organizing a football team and including the right not to be touched!) <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Then there is the case of the City Mission in Schenectady, New York. It was cited by New York's Department of Social Services because it prohibited pornographic materials from its facilities. Only after three months of negotiation did the mission and state authorities reach agreement that the mission was within its rights to prohibit pornography. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"We determined that on health and safety issues, we would submit to government regulations," says Eivion Williams, the mission's executive director. "But this was an issue of morality -- what was right and what was wrong -- and we stood firm. And in the end, we wound up getting what we asked for."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Food Distribution.</b> For many years, rescue missions accepted federal surplus food and distributed it to the needy without excessive oversight or regulation. In December 1993, however, the U.S. Department of Agriculture mailed a memo to missions in its Western region that stated that USDA commodities were not to be used in meals where individuals were required to attend religious services. This caused confusion among many mission directors who were uncertain how to interpret the new rules. On advice of counsel, some missions have turned down USDA commodities because they believe accepting the food would subject them to federal regulations that compromise religious teachings.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Indeed, one of the interesting contradictions of federal policy is that schools, day-care programs, and early childhood development classes operated by churches may serve surplus food -- even though their programs are grounded in religious beliefs. The government seems to believe that children in religious programs need good food, but homeless in religious programs do not.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Tonight 27,000 people in America are staying in rescue missions. Each is being fed, sheltered, and assisted. Last year, rescue missions served more than 28 million meals to the poor and homeless. That's enough to provide a meal to every resident in the state of California. Yet each person is also being challenged with hope and opportunity. Our rehabilitation programs involve over 11,500 men, women, and children. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Rescue missions are poised to continue their dramatic growth and success. Drug rehabilitation programs are expanding to meet the increasing need. Computer training and educational programs are now staples at many missions, providing GED preparation, core curriculum classes, drivers education, and job training. Missions are also setting up joint ventures with local businesses to give reformed addicts on-the-job training. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Unfortunately, our optimism at the progress of our missions is tempered by the cold realities of the street. The face of homelessness in America is changing. It is getting younger and more female. Children, once a rarity at shelters, are showing up with increasing frequency -- and this cannot bode well for American society.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	There are other problems. As Rev. Tom Laymon, the executive director of Mel Trotter Ministries in Grand Rapids, observes, "There is an aging population in our prisons that will eventually be given back to society. Many will have spent decades in prison. This means a whole new generation of 'older homeless' will be out on the streets and in need of our services."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Amidst this trend, federal and state homeless and anti-poverty programs -- devoid of moral, spiritual, or religious counseling -- will continue to fail. The answer is not for government to get into the religion business, but, at the very least, to get out of the way of religiously based groups that are making a decisive difference in people's lives.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We have identified more than 100 American cities with populations of over 40,000 that are without a rescue mission. In 10 years, IUGM wants to have programs in each of these. Our hope and prayer is that missions around the country will demonstrate the power of a well-rounded program that nourishes mind and body, spirit and soul.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Rev. Stephen Burger</b> is the executive director of the <a href="http://www.iugm.org">International Union of Gospel Missions</a>. Also contributing to this article were Rev. Mike Edwards of the Los Angeles Mission, Rev. Del Maxfield of the Denver Rescue Mission, and Rev. Lee Schmookler of Goodwill Home and Missions in Newark, New Jersey.

<center><b>"Hey -- I'm Hungry."</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Those involved with rescue missions know the difficulties and dangers of inner-city life. Many, like Mickey Kalman, spent years on the street -- drifting, stealing, begging, and doing drugs -- until they reached out for help. Kalman, now the executive director of City Rescue Mission in Oklahoma City, was invited to speak at the 1996 Republican National Convention, in San Diego.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Mickey Kalman's young life centered around alcohol. "I grew up with drunks and learned to drink," he says. He joined a gang. When he wasn't travelling and getting into mischief, he found trouble locally. At one point he pulled a gun on his teacher, threatening to "blow his brains out." By the age of 12, he was on probation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Later Kalman got involved with drugs. "Once I ran away with a shipment of dope, sold it, and hid out in Wyoming," he remembers. "When I didn't have money for gas, I siphoned it out of construction trucks."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	One day he found himself in Stockton, California, alone and hungry. He'd been living on the streets for the better part of two years. He walked up to the door of a rescue mission and said, "Hey -- I'm hungry." The man at the mission offered Kalman some food and some work. He didn't usually get offers for work, but he agreed. Kalman decided to enter the rehabilitation program, where he found faith in God and the power to turn his life around.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Today, Rev. Mickey Kalman oversees a mission budget of $1.4 million, with a staff of 21. Thousands are helped by his mission every year. "Rescue mission work isn't easy," he says. "It's hard to love some of the people who come to us . . . [but] when they knock, I say, 'Come on in. My name is Mickey Kalman. How would you like to stick around and do a little work?'"

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>The Fresh Start Program (Los Angeles Mission).</b> Fresh Start has become a beacon of hope for addicts on L.A.'s Skid Row. Designed at the Los Angeles Mission, this 12- to 18-month program offers personal counseling, work therapy, a computerized learning center, physical education, and Bible study. Approximately 200 men are enrolled. Graduates of Fresh Start have set up an Alumni Association to assist with the transition back into the community. Over the last four years, 68 percent of graduates have left the streets, have established a residence and gotten involved in a local church, and have gained employment and stayed with that job for at least one year. Cost: $35 per person per day.

<b>Habitat for Conservative Values<br>by Harris Wofford & Steven Waldman</b> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Let's conduct what Charles Murray might call "a thought experiment." Imagine it's 1993 and Newt Gingrich has been sworn in as president. In his Inaugural Address, he pledges to "dismantle the welfare state and replace it with an Opportunity Society." He appoints a task force of the party's most creative conservatives to ensure that citizen action will fill the void left by the withdrawal of government. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	There is, by no means, unanimity. The Cato Institute's Doug Bandow argues that as government recedes, charities and volunteer groups will naturally fill the gap. Arianna Huffington says that the nonprofit sector must become more effective and less bureaucratic. Gingrich agrees and advises the task force to look at <a href="http://www.habitat.org/">Habitat for Humanity</a> as a model for truly effective compassion -- inexpensive, nongovernmental, and faith-based. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	From Switzerland, William F. Buckley Jr. faxes in a chapter from his book <I>Gratitude</I> calling for a national-service program to engage young people in solving problems outside of government bureaucracies. Jim Pinkerton urges the re-creation of the Civilian Conservation Corps on a massive scale. Colin Powell reminds the group that the most successful race- and class-mixing program has not been busing or quotas but service in the U.S. Army. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William Bennett</a> argues that all government benefits ought to require something of the beneficiaries in turn, shattering the entitlement mentality created by years of Democrat-created welfare programs. Senator Dan Coats suggests that government's role should be confined to helping local community-based institutions solve their own problems. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The task force decides unanimously that there should be no big federal program, with armies of Washington bureaucrats telling communities what to do. Instead, Washington would give money to states to help local community groups help themselves. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	And, inspired by Buckley, the members of the task force hit on an innovative idea. Instead of just giving grants to nonprofit groups, thereby creating nonprofit bureaucracies, they could model it after programs like the Jesuit Volunteer Corps, to which committed young people devote themselves for a year or two of service. The federal government would in turn provide that young person with a "service scholarship." This would, someone points out, establish a principle that the "educrats" in the higher-education lobby have always opposed: financial aid awarded not on need but merit, merit in this case defined as a willingness to serve one's country. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Pollster Frank Luntz tells Gingrich that even though it's a decentralized, community-based program, the young people it engages should be linked together with a national spirit -- and name. Haley Barbour suggests "RepubliCorps" but Gingrich believes that might deprive it of bipartisan support. He asks his advisors to come up with a better name and gives them one bit of advice, "Don't be afraid to make it sound patriotic. Unlike the other party, we are not embarrassed to be Americans." So Luntz has a brainstorm: Let's call it "AmeriCorps." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The reality, of course, is that Bill Clinton thought of <a href="http://www.cns.gov/americorps.html">AmeriCorps</a> first, and most Washington Republicans ended up opposing it as typical Big-Government liberalism. Republicans in Congress are now on the wrong side not only of the politics -- AmeriCorps is popular with voters -- but of their own ideology. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There is, however, a striking difference between the comments of Beltway Republicans and those in the rest of the country. New Hampshire governor Steve Merrill has called AmeriCorps "a great success in the state of New Hampshire." Michigan governor John Engler has said AmeriCorps "captures the promise found in all citizens." Arizona governor Fife Symington said he was "enthusiastic and impressed with the work of AmeriCorps." And Massachusetts governor William Weld called it "one of the most intelligent uses of taxpayer money ever." Let us explain why we think these Republican governors are right. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Readers of <i>Policy Review</i> will not need much persuading that government cannot solve many of our problems. But just as liberals have to be more realistic about the limits of government, conservatives need to be more realistic about the limits of the volunteer sector. One of the most common criticisms of AmeriCorps is that it is not needed in a nation in which 90 million people are volunteering. That is a weak argument. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	First, one-third of the volunteering done by those 90 million Americans consists of serving on committees, baby-sitting, singing in the church choir, or other activities that are beneficial but hardly a substitute for the welfare state. Second, while the potential power of the volunteer sector is awesome, the trend is in the wrong direction. Just as a social consensus against government solutions has begun to emerge, Americans have been volunteering less, according to estimates by the Independent Sector.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As women have moved into the labor market, the composition of the volunteer force has changed. Most people now are free only on weekends or evenings. That limits the types of volunteer work they can perform. Most important, harnessing the power of volunteers is not easy. Volunteers need to be trained, supervised, and deployed well to be effective. As former Michigan governor George Romney said, "There is no free lunch when it comes to volunteering." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Some conservatives argue that even if the charitable sector has limits, governmental solutions will only make matters worse. "Paying" AmeriCorps members, the argument goes, subverts the idea of volunteerism -- labor given for love, not money. In an <a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/walt.html">article</a> for the January-February 1996 issue of <i>Policy Review</i>, John Walters of the New Citizenship Project argued that AmeriCorps's "very premise -- using federal resources to promote voluntarism -- contradicts the principle of self government that lies at the heart of citizenship." Paid volunteerism, he wrote, would sap the strength of the nonprofit sector at precisely the moment when it most needs to flourish.
 <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This argument ignores the experience of the past two years. Many of America's most respected nonprofits, from Big Brothers/Big Sisters to the YMCA to the American Red Cross, participate in and staunchly support AmeriCorps. A year ago, leaders of 24 volunteer groups wrote that AmeriCorps is an "enormously beneficial addition to the traditional voluntary sector. This program has not undermined our position, rather it has enhanced our efforts and strengthened our institutions."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To understand why, consider the case of Habitat for Humanity, one of the most successful faith-based volunteer groups. The founder, Millard Fuller, was wary of any involvement with AmeriCorps precisely because he feared a government program would distort the religious nature of his effort. But on the urging of his board, Habitat brought in some AmeriCorps members.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Fuller used AmeriCorps to solve a particular problem. Habitat was flooded with good people who wanted to help build houses but didn't have enough full-time crew leaders to organize the volunteers. They selected AmeriCorps applicants who they thought might help. These full-time AmeriCorps members dramatically increased the number and effectiveness of the unpaid volunteers. In Miami, for instance, two dozen Habitat-AmeriCorps members coordinated, organized, trained, and worked alongside about 5,000 unpaid volunteers, who together built 50 homes in a little more than a year.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Now Fuller is a fan. "As AmeriCorps members gain in construction skill," he says, "our affiliates are able to expand the number of occasional volunteers through increased capacity to supervise and manage volunteers. We at Habitat for Humanity feel privileged and honored to have AmeriCorps people with us, and we want more of them."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Habitat's experience is instructive, not only because it is Newt Gingrich's favorite charity, but because it is a faith-based organization that did not have to alter its spiritual mission to make use of AmeriCorps members. This has been the experience of all the religious groups -- from the nuns of the Notre Dame de Namur mission to the Greater Dallas Community Churches -- that have brought on AmeriCorps members. The reason for their confidence is simple: they choose the AmeriCorps members, they train them, and if they're not working out, they send them home.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Habitat story is not unusual. One independent study has found that each AmeriCorps member has "leveraged" 12 unstipended volunteers. It was a recognition that volunteer groups need a cadre of full-time people to organize volunteers that led George Romney to refer to full-time stipended service and unpaid volunteers as the "twin engines of service."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Even if one accepts the idea that volunteers need to be organized, why not just give the money to the nonprofit to hire its own full-time staff person? Because charities are quite capable of becoming bureaucratic. We need an infusion of people who plan to work only a year or two and have not, therefore, developed a careerist mindset. Besides, AmeriCorps members are much cheaper than full-time staff.<p>

<tr width=80>
<td><hr width=75><h3><font size="+3">N</font>onprofits that use AmeriCorps members can provide services more efficiently, humanely, and cost-effectively than government. </h3><hr width=75></td>
<td hspace=5> 
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Service programs also provide a nonbureaucratic alternative to traditional government. One of the reasons the Peace Corps has enjoyed bipartisan support is that the money funds volunteers directly. Someday conservatives will view domestic national service as the antidote to bureaucracy. </td></tr></table>	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider what AmeriCorps members have accomplished in rural, impoverished Simpson County, Kentucky. Over nine months of service in 1995, 122 second-graders served by 25 AmeriCorps members saw their reading comprehension scores improve by more than three grade levels. Thirty-seven percent improved by four or more grade levels. The reasons for success are quite simple. AmeriCorps volunteers can develop intense, one-on-one tutoring relationships and become familiar with the academic and emotional problems of the child. Just as important, AmeriCorps members visit each student's home every other week to show parents their child's classroom materials and suggest ways for them to help. Parental involvement has increased dramatically. Would this have happened if the federal government had given the grant to the state education agency?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Simply put, the nonprofits that use AmeriCorps members can provide services more efficiently, humanely, and cost-effectively than government can.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There has been a great deal of confusion about the costs of AmeriCorps. The standard AmeriCorps living allowance is $7,945 -- about $160 a week -- of which $6,700 comes from the federal government. Those members with no health insurance also get a health plan valued at $1,200. So direct compensation is just more than $9,000. If they finish a year of service, they get a $4,725 scholarship.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	On top of that, the Corporation for National Service gives grants to local programs to help manage the AmeriCorps members. If the program builds low-income housing, that might include the cost of supplies. If the program establishes crew-based corps, that might include the cost of supervising them. If the corps helps a disaster-struck area, this would include travel costs. Then there are the administrative costs, which are distributed between the headquarters staff and the governor-appointed state commissions that distribute much of the money. The total cost to the Corporation per AmeriCorps member averages $18,800.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Programs are encouraged to raise outside money to supplement that provided by the federal government. Indeed, they can choose to add extra training, supplies, or supervision if they feel that enriches the quality--but only if they raise the money from somewhere else.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	At first blush, $18,000 "per corps member" sounds like a lot of money. But think about it. This is direct compensation plus all the other costs associated with the program. If you used the same calculus for Microsoft Corp. -- the total budget divided by the number of employees -- the average "cost per employee" would be about $150,000.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It's easy to see that this methodology has limited value, for it doesn't tell what you are getting for your money. We know what "benefit" or "product" the Microsoft investment produces. The truth is $18,000 could be a lousy deal -- or a real bargain -- depending on what the AmeriCorps members do.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>AmeriCorps members help solve problems.</b> According to partial results from a study by Aguirre Associates, an independent consulting firm, 1,353 AmeriCorps members in 12 states restored 24 beaches, enhanced 338 miles of river banks, planted 200,000 trees, constructed 440 dams, and cleaned up 139 neighborhoods. In all, they estimated these Corps members working on environmental issues in those states "affected the lives" of 469,000 people.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Three separate independent evaluations of the cost-benefit ratio of the program predict measurable returns between $1.54 and $2.60 for every AmeriCorps dollar invested. Each study concluded that AmeriCorps's full value is understated because the benefits of safer streets, better schools, stronger communities, and more active citizens are difficult to quantify and not seen immediately. The high return is part of the reason that more than 600 companies -- from Microsoft to G.E. to local grocers -- have supported local AmeriCorps programs. Stanley Litow, an officer of the IBM International Foundation, summed up his company's satisfaction by stating, "IBM expects a return on investment, and it bases its funding decisions on demonstrable results. . . . This program works."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Consider a program called L.A. Vets, which helps homeless Vietnam veterans become sober and independent. This nonprofit, established with the help of groups like the Disabled American Veterans, runs a 210-bed transitional home that provides 24-hour-a-day support, counseling, and job placement. Program managers conduct drug-testing regularly and expel those who flunk, a tough-love policy beyond the capacity of government bureaucracies. They require the veterans to maintain Westside Residence and pay $235 in rent, a demand that is both cost-effective and therapeutic. AmeriCorps didn't create this program but the 11 corps members at the Westside Residence, according to L.A. Vets' founders, have enabled them to start small businesses staffed by the veterans, stock a library, and make effective use of outside volunteers--including employees of a local computer business who teach the veterans how to repair computers. AmeriCorps members, in other words, have helped veterans become independent of government aid. As of this spring, only about one-quarter of the vets who moved in a year ago were back on the street. One-quarter were in treatment programs and half remained in transitional or independent housing, more sober and hopeful than they've been in years. And it's a good deal for taxpayers. The program has helped move more than 200 veterans out of veterans hospitals, where they would have cost the government $20,000 per year each.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
About two-thirds of AmeriCorps projects address the problems of the young. AmeriCorps members tutor, operate after-school programs, work with gangs to reduce violence, create safe havens and safe corridors, and organize students to volunteer. Our record in these areas is one reason Governor Pete Wilson turned to the California Commission on Community Service to help reach his goal of providing at-risk youth in California with 250,000 mentors by the year 2000.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>AmeriCorps changes those who perform the service.</b> Full-time service, whether in AmeriCorps or in the armed forces, is a rite of passage that helps create well-rounded adults and citizens. They are expected to be resourceful and show leadership. On a more mundane level, they might learn practical skills -- how to build a floor level, how to calm a crowd in an emergency, how to lead a team, or even how to show up on time.<p>
<table>
<tr width=80>
<td hspace=5> 
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	For low-income youth, service provides a different experience than traditional government make-work jobs or training programs. AmeriCorps implicitly accepts conservative arguments against indiscriminate aid to the poor. All major religions teach that it is more blessed to give than receive. This is not only a moral instruction but a statement about human psychology: If you treat someone as a dependent, they will view themselves as such. Low-income citizens, who make up about a quarter of AmeriCorps volunteers, are earning a government benefit by serving, instead of being served. The principle was illustrated by a young high-school dropout, who left a street gang to join the Philadelphia Youth Service Corps. "Look, all my life people had been coming to help me," he said. "For the first time, this Corps asked me to do some good." <td><hr width=75><h3><font size="+3">H</font>abitat for Humanity did not have to alter its spiritual mission to make use of AmeriCorps members. </h3><hr width=75></td> </td></tr></table>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>AmeriCorps teaches the right values.</b> AmeriCorps challenges young people to give something to their community and country. It teaches them, in the words of William Buckley, to have "gratitude" for being given so much. It instills core values of hard work, discipline, and teamwork that make young people not only more productive workers but also better citizens.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>AmeriCorps combats balkanization.</b> By bringing people of different backgrounds together, AmeriCorps can combat ethnic and social fragmentation. Members who come to AmeriCorps from college quickly realize that the separatism they learned on campus has to be replaced by teamwork. Here again, the goal is to replicate some of the successes of the military. The World War II draft was the nation's most effective class-mixing institution. The modern army is the most effective race-mixing institution. Because they are so focused on staying alive or achieving a military objective, soldiers inevitably have to focus on individual characteristics rather than group traits. National service can be the most effective means we have for dealing with our nation's racial problems. National service may ultimately replace affirmative action as the primary means for bridging the racial divide.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>AmeriCorps expands educational opportunity.</b> This is often cited as the main benefit of AmeriCorps, but it really doesn't make sense to spend $18,000 per member if the only benefit is extra college aid. However, the education award is proving to be an effective way of drawing people into service. And the AmeriCorps experience expands educational opportunity in a more subtle way -- by raising the aspirations of those who serve. We have seen many individuals who decided to go to college because their service convinced them that they were capable of greater things. Many of them in turn impart this sense of broad horizons to elementary or high-school students they tutor.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Some conservatives have argued that even if AmeriCorps does worthwhile things now, it will inevitably evolve into a bloated bureaucracy that smothers local initiative. This is the strongest argument against AmeriCorps. Many an enterprise, public and private, that started out lean and flexible eventually became ossified.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	AmeriCorps, though, will likely improve, not worsen, because of its basic structure. It is locally based and relies on a competitive grantmaking process. Two-thirds of the money goes directly to state commissions, which choose among competitive proposals from local nonprofit groups.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	AmeriCorps is nonpartisan. By law, the state commissions comprise an equal number of Democrats and Republicans, appointed by governors -- three-fifths of whom are currently Republicans. AmeriCorps supporters must acknowledge that the success of this program stems in no small part from the leadership of some Republican governors. And those who dislike this program must also recognize that "Bill Clinton's pet project," as it is so often called, is being shaped in large part by Republicans.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We at the Corporation have been willing to learn. The traditional government posture -- cover up problems as quickly as possible -- may work for a while, but it does not make for good programs. Among our mistakes:<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We have taken too long to switch from an old-style government accounting system to a more rigorous, private-sector model. As a result, our books were recently found "unauditable" using the new accounting standards. We are now bringing in outside financial experts to make the Corporation a model of government financial accountability.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We funded a grant to Acorn Housing Corp., which is closely associated with an advocacy agenda. When we found out that Acorn had crossed the line into political advocacy, we pulled the plug. (Among our 400 programs and 1,200 sites we have found only a handful that have engaged in political advocacy.)<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We saw that some of our programs were spending too much money on management and overhead. So, we have told AmeriCorps's national and state grantees with above average costs that they must cut costs by 10 percent. And as part of our cost-cutting agreement with <a href="http://www.senate.gov/senator/grassley.html">Senator Charles Grassley</a> of Iowa, we've committed to specific average cost targets -- $17,000 per member next year, $16,000 the next, and $15,000 in 1999.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In our first years, the programs raised $41 million from the private sector -- $9 million more than the authorizing legislation required from all nonfederal sources -- but some programs were relying too heavily on school districts, police departments, and other units of local government. So this year, we have required all of our programs to raise some money from the private sector.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Despite our efforts to make all our programs models of excellence, some did not succeed. So the Corporation for National Service or the state commissions stopped funding them. Fifty of the first-year AmeriCorps programs were not renewed -- 15 percent of the total. We realize that such a statistic can be used against us by our opponents. However, since the difference between business and government is the willingness to correct mistakes, this is probably the most businesslike thing we have done.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Having argued the substance of national service, I would like to close on a political note. House Republicans last year put themselves in an awkward position on AmeriCorps. They placed themselves on the wrong side of their own ideology, and played right into the old Democratic argument that Republicans are heartless and uninterested in solving social problems.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Republicans need not compound the error by giving this issue to Democrats. Voters do not automatically associate civilian service with Democrats. If Republicans embrace it, and put on their own imprint, people will look back 10 years from now and say AmeriCorps was a program that Democrats created and Republicans improved. Republicans could then be known as tough <i>and</i> compassionate, skeptical <i>and</i> wise. And along the way, Republicans will have truly helped transform the country from one that relies on government to solve problems to one that relies on citizen service.<P><i><b>Harris Wofford</b>, a former Democratic senator from Pennsylvania, is the CEO of the Corporation for National Service. <b>Steven Waldman</b> is his senior advisor for policy, planning, and evaluation.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Service has a long and venerable history in the U.S., and it remains strong today. Three-quarters of American households give to charity. About 90 million adults volunteer; the value of their time has been estimated by the Independent Sector at nearly $200 billion.<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Impressive as this is, it isn't enough to meet all of the pressing human needs that face our society. For example, Harris Wofford and Steven Waldman worry that the entry of women into the work force will reduce the number of volunteers. Hence, in their view, the need for a government program like the Corporation for National Service. </td></tr></table><p>
 
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The desire to give Uncle Sam a senior management position in the service business goes back at least a century, to <i>Looking Backward</i>, a novel by lawyer and journalist Edward Bellamy. He envisioned compulsory service for all men and women between the ages of 21 and 45, resulting in a peaceful and prosperous utopia. <i>Looking Backward</i> was the best-selling book of its time and inspired the establishment of some 165 Bellamy clubs to push his egalitarian social system. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Two decades later, William James advocated the "moral equivalent of war," in which all young men would be required to work for the community. He argued that "the martial virtues, although originally gained by the race through war, are absolute and permanent human goods," and that national service could instill those same values in peacetime.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Most national service advocates today eschew such far-reaching utopian visions of social transformation. Nevertheless, the desire to create the good society through service lives on. Some advocates have seen national service as a means to provide training and employment, to encourage social equality, to promote civic-mindedness, or to expand access to college. Margaret Mead even saw it as a way to help liberate children from their parents. The legislative process always shrank such grandiose proposals into much more limited programs, such as the Peace Corps and, in 1993, the National and Community Service Trust Act, which established the Corporation for National and Community Service. But many of the grander goals remain -- and are expressed by Wofford and Waldman: transforming participants, teaching values, combating balkanization, and expanding educational opportunity.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 	Thus, the heritage of national service -- this desire for government to promote ends other than service -- is critical to understanding today's program and recognizing the pitfalls of government involvement. When we evaluate the Corporation and the thousands of AmeriCorps members, we must ask: service to whom and organized by whom?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Americans have worked in their communities since the nation's founding. Businesses, churches, and schools all actively help organize their members' efforts. Service in America is so vital because it is decentralized and privately organized, addresses perceived needs, and grows out of people's sense of duty and compassion. Any federal service program must be judged by whether it is consistent with this vision of volunteer service. Wofford and Waldman think yes. I'm less sanguine.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The mandatory variants of service obviously do not share this vision. In fact, the explicit goal of advocates of mandatory service programs was (and remains) to create a duty to the state rather than to the supposed beneficiaries of service. Moreover, service is to fit into a larger social plan implemented and enforced by government.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Of course, AmeriCorps is not mandatory, and Wofford and Waldman amass an impressive list of testimonials from private groups that welcome the Corporation's support. But, no one should be surprised that volunteer organizations might welcome financial assistance and "free" help. Washington's funds, however, could prove almost as powerful as its mandates in reshaping the independent sector. Some voluntary organizations recognize the danger. David King of the Ohio-West Virginia YMCA has warned: "The national service movement and the National Corporation are not about encouraging volunteering or community service. The national service movement is about institutionalizing federal funding for national and community service. It is about changing the language and understanding of service to eliminate the words 'volunteer' and 'community service' and in their place implant the idea that service is something paid for by the government."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	King's fears are well founded. The history of the welfare state is the history of public enterprise pushing out private organization. The impact was largely unintentional, but natural and inevitable. Higher taxes left individuals with less money to give; government's assumption of responsibility for providing welfare shriveled the perceived duty of individuals to respond to their neighbors' needs; and the availability of public programs gave recipients an alternative to private assistance, one which did not challenge recipients to reform their destructive behavior. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Corporation, despite the good intentions of people like Wofford and Waldman, risks doing the same thing to philanthropy. A federal "service" program risks teaching Americans that the duty of giving, and the job of deciding who is worthy to receive charity, belongs to government and not average people throughout society. At some point service to society could become widely equated with work for government.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Glimmerings of this problem have already surfaced. For instance, the Corporation treats "public" service as inherently better than private service. Service, however, comes in many forms. Being paid by the government to shelve books in a library, whether as an employee or as an AmeriCorps member, is no more laudable or valuable than being paid by Crown Books to stock bookshelves in a bookstore. A host of private-sector jobs provide enormous public benefits -- consider health-care professionals, medical and scientific researchers, entrepreneurs, inventors, and artists. Many of these people earn less than they could in alternative work; they have chosen to serve in their own way. Yet government programs that equate public employment with service to society effectively denigrate service through private employment.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This public-sector bias is reflected in the fact that 2,800 of the first 20,000 AmeriCorps participants were assigned to federal agencies. For instance, the Department of the Interior used AmeriCorps workers to "update geological and hydrological information for the U.S. Geological Survey" and restore wetlands and wildlife habitat. Jobs like these are respectable, but they resemble traditional government employment rather than "service." While AmeriCorps participants may do good work as government employees, such activities are not likely to promote volunteerism around the country.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A more subtle problem is the likely long-term effect of federal funding on the volunteer groups and those who normally support volunteer groups. It is, in the abstract, hard to criticize grants to organizations like Habitat for Humanity (which until now refused to accept government funding), Big Brothers/Big Sisters, and the Red Cross. These groups do good work and money given to them is likely to be well spent.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Who, however, should do the giving? It is certainly simpler for the IRS to empty pockets nationwide and hand a bit of the tax haul to the Corporation, which, in turn, gives it to charity. But the right way is for individuals to send their money directly to deserving groups. That Habitat for Humanity could use more full-time employees to supervise its ample private volunteers is understandable; that it should turn to the government for the resources to hire those volunteers is not.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Indeed, at its most basic level, real charity doesn't mean giving away someone else's money. As Marvin Olasky has pointed out, compassion once meant to "suffer with." Over time it came to mean writing a check. Now it seems to be equated with making someone else write a check. At least public welfare programs are theoretically accountable to taxpayers for their activities. But collecting taxes for private charities, especially those with philosophical or theological viewpoints that may conflict with those of many taxpayers, is especially dubious.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Nor is dependence on government healthy for private philanthropic groups. Although they get to choose and train volunteers funded by the Corporation, it seems inevitable that government will end up favoring some activities and disfavoring others. Such preferences may not be nefarious, but groups will be tempted to adjust their mission to become eligible for federal funding. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Even if the Corporation eschews the natural temptation to meddle, the behavior of recipients is likely to change. Groups will be tempted to shift their fundraising from private appeals to "public education" and formal lobbying. After all, government checks tend to be much larger and cheaper to obtain than private donations.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Wofford and Waldman contend that government funding will prevent private groups from becoming bureaucratic by furnishing them with short-term volunteers, who won't develop "a careerist mindset." It's not clear why career volunteers would be a problem. In fact, some problems are better met by experienced volunteers. Surely volunteer groups, if they found careerism to be a problem, could, if adequately funded, hire precisely the sort of people who now join AmeriCorps. Money does not have to be funneled through government to ensure that private groups receive "new energy," as Wofford and Waldman put it.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Moreover, government's growing role in funding private groups, however worthy, is likely to encourage people to further abdicate their civic responsibilities. If we are serious about strengthening civil society and reviving a sense of individual duty to help those in need, we must emphasize contributing as well as volunteering. People will feel less pressure to volunteer time and money if the government not only provides public welfare programs but funds charitable groups. Wofford and Waldman cite private support for local AmeriCorps programs as evidence of their value. But AmeriCorps isn't necessary for IBM, G.E., Microsoft, and local grocers to support service programs. Private-sector funding should preempt, not follow, government involvement.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Boosting contributions will address one of the problems that Wofford and Waldman mention: the increase in women who have entered the work force and therefore have less time to volunteer. If they are working, they should have more money to contribute, and they should be encouraged to do so, thereby helping to fund full-time volunteers.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In fact, thoughtfully choosing which charities to support, and monitoring their activities are themselves important forms of volunteerism. Sending money off to Washington for distribution to private groups benefits the recipients, but no one else. By contrast, the sinews of community grow stronger when people stay informed, give voluntarily, and get involved. As we attempt to shrink the welfare state, getting more people to give more and to take more time considering where to give should be one of our highest priorities.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Finally, AmeriCorps may have undesirable consequences on volunteers. Undoubtedly, many volunteers paid by the government really believe in what they are doing. But the Corporation has turned service into a job, one that, counting the tax-free voucher, pays more than other entry-level employment. Some participants have privately admitted that they see national service as a remunerative job option, not a unique opportunity to help the community. Indeed, much of the president's pitch during the campaign was framed in terms of naked self-interest: earning credit toward college tuition. There's nothing wrong with joining AmeriCorps to do so, of course. But doing so really isn't more noble than, say, pumping gas for the same reason.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Indeed, government-funded service plays into what some national-service proponents have denounced as an entitlement mentality -- the idea that, for instance, students have a right to a taxpayer-paid education. Some advocates of national service have rightly asked: Why should middle-class young people be able to force poor taxpayers to help put them through school? But public "service" jobs sweetened with a salary and an educational grant are no solution: they merely transform the kind of employment that a young person seeks to help cover his educational expenses. Some AmeriCorps volunteers do sacrifice, but there is no real sacrifice involved in, say, informing people about the availability of Federal Emergency Management Agency service centers, maintaining vehicles, surveying residents about recreational interests, cutting vegetation, and changing light bulbs in dilapidated schools -- all activities funded by the Corporation. In contrast, consider the sort of tasks envisioned by William James: young laborers would be sent off "to coal and iron mines, to freight trains, to fishing fleets in December."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	 The real solution to the entitlement mentality is not to say that students are entitled to taxpayer aid as long as they work for the government for a year or two, but to rethink who deserves the subsidy. We also need to explore how federal educational assistance may have actually made it harder for students to afford college by fueling tuition hikes (the schools, of course, are the ultimate beneficiaries of most student aid). And we have to address the host of other "entitlements" that riddle the federal budget and sap people's independence.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Finally, there is the more practical question as to whether taxpayers are likely to get their money's worth from the service provided by AmeriCorps members. Wofford and Waldman cite impressive statistics about trees planted and beaches restored, and there's no doubt that much good work has and will be done by AmeriCorps volunteers. But there is no guarantee that taxpayer-funded "service" will be worth its cost.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Consider the opportunity costs of national service. "Public service" has a nice ring to it, but a dollar going to national service will not necessarily yield more benefits than an additional dollar spent on medical research, technological innovation, business investment, or any number of other private and public purposes. Nor is hiring, say, a potential doctor to spend a year surveying residents, handling paperwork, or replacing light bulbs necessarily a good deal -- in terms of economics or service.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Unfortunately, some waste is almost inevitable. Local organizations are not likely to use essentially "free" labor from the federal government as efficiently as if they had to cover the costs themselves, because staff members will be tempted to assign work they prefer not to do themselves to the subsidized outsiders. For example, in Orange County, California, the Civic Center Barrio Housing Corp. used AmeriCorps personnel to solicit donations and handle paperwork. Corporation critics have, in fact, generated their own roll of waste to counter Wofford and Waldman's list of successes.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another potentially important opportunity cost is the diversion of bright men and women from the military. The end of the Cold War has sharply cut recruiting requirements, but it has also reduced the perceived national need. As a result, the armed forces have had greater difficulty in attracting quality recruits. Yet various programs of educational benefits have always been an important vehicle for drawing college-capable youth into the military. Providing similar benefits for civilian service is likely to hinder recruiting for what remains the most fundamental form of national service -- defending the nation. Surveys have found that a majority of potential recruits would consider joining AmeriCorps rather than the armed forces because they see it as a better way to gain educational assistance.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	If AmeriCorps is not the answer, what is? First, government barriers in the way of private individuals and groups who want to help should be torn down. Minimum-wage laws effectively forbid the hiring of dedicated but unskilled people; every increase makes this problem worse. Restrictions on paratransit operations limit private transportation for the disabled. Regulations also hinder other forms of volunteerism. Unnecessary health department restrictions prevent restaurants in Los Angeles and elsewhere from donating food to the hungry, for instance. In short, in many cases important needs are unmet precisely because of perverse government policy.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Second, leaders throughout society, from lawmakers to clerics to philanthropists to corporate presidents, need to emphasize that the ultimate responsibility to help those in need lies with individuals, families, and communities, not government. They need to create a more traditional sense of compassion, the idea that charity requires personal commitment -- both in volunteering time and exercising careful stewardship over charitable contributions. This requires highlighting the needs of the disadvantaged and groups seeking to help the disadvantaged, and emphasizing that people can no longer act as if they "gave at the office" through government.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Third, policymakers need to consider tax incentives, particularly tax credits for charitable donations, to encourage people to volunteer their money. A goal of $500 million in new contributions--a mere $2 a person and more than now spent by the Corporation -- might be a reasonable start.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Finally, to the extent that serious social problems remain, government should use narrowly targeted responses to meet the most serious problems. That is, it would be better to find a way to attract several thousand people to help care for the terminally ill than to lump that task in with teaching, planting trees, changing light bulbs, administrative work, and scores of other jobs to be solved by a force of tens or hundreds of thousands. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	AmeriCorps was created with the best of intentions. But the Corporation for National  Service cannot escape its statist heritage: it promotes service, but shifts the center of gravity in the volunteer community from civil to political society. What we need instead is a renewed commitment to individual service. People, in community with one another, need to help meet the many serious social problems that beset us. But private activism needs neither oversight nor subsidy from Uncle Sam. Some of the volunteerism can be part-time and some full-time; some can take place within the family, some within churches, and some within civic and community groups. Some may occur through profit-making ventures.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The point is, there is no predetermined definition of service, pattern of appropriate involvement, set of "needs" to be met or tasks to be fulfilled. America's strength is its combination of humanitarian impulses, private association, and diversity. We need service, not "national service."<p><i><b>Doug Bandow</b> is a senior fellow at the <a href="http://www.cato.org">Cato Institute</a> and the author of several books, including</i> The Politics of Envy: Statism as Theology <i>(Transaction)</i>.

<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Of all the passions that distort one's view of politics, the greatest, I think, is the desire for closure, the yearning for some golden moment at which it can be said, "Well, that's the end of that." The jury announcing its verdict, the emissaries of a defeated power signing the papers of unconditional surrender, the poker player beating a full house with four of a kind -- decisive and final.<p>
<table>
<tr width=80>
<td><hr width=75><h3><font size="+3">T</font>he 104th Congress has learned that in politics there are no permanent victories - that the fat lady never sings</h3><hr width=75></td>
<td hspace=5>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Perhaps it's understandable. Our politics does have built-in cycles with closure of a sort, namely, elections. Every four years, we have an opportunity to elect a new president or affirm the tenure of the one we have; every two years, we have a new Congress. And the outcome of these elections is rarely ambiguous. Candidate A wins or loses. The <a href="http://www.house.gov">House</a> has this many Republicans and that many Democrats. Moreover, the legislative process itself has various endpoints: the moments after the committee report and the floor vote and the conference and the bill-signing ceremony in the Rose Garden, just as the civics textbooks say.</td></tr></table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But even here, closure in politics is overblown. In politics, little is ever settled once and for all. The day after the election is the first day of the next election cycle. So you got a bill passed? Fine. Now an army of bureaucrats will begin writing the regulations and other means of enforcing it; the courts will begin pondering its meaning; the lawmakers themselves, aided by an army of lobbyists and other interested parties, will prepare for the next go-round. Politics ebbs and flows. Victory and defeat are never permanent. "Endism"--the yearning for closure--often amounts to substituting one's political fantasies for reality.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The essential fact of the 104th Congress is that, as the first GOP Congress in 40 years, it did not live up to the expectations it helped create. Many of its members rode into town two years ago promising nothing less than "revolution." But the budget is not balanced, nor is there a constitutional amendment requiring that it be balanced. There has been no tax relief for families with children, no cut in the capital-gains tax rate, no expanded Individual Retirement Accounts. Nor have we seen fundamental reform in Medicaid for the poor and Medicare for the elderly: Most of the vast entitlement apparatus stands untouched. Broad regulatory relief remains elusive.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Was the 104th Congress, then, a failure? The position of the Democratic Party sounds like this: The Republicans vastly misinterpreted the results of the 1994 elections that brought them to power. They claimed a broad mandate for change where none existed. Moreover, they were never candid about the specifics of the changes they intended to make. Once the details began to emerge, in the Democratic view, the American people recoiled from the Republicans' extremist positions. Popular opinion turned against this new Congress and its living embodiment, House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Republican expectations that their party would sweep the 1995 off-year elections turned out to be wrong. President Clinton stood up to the GOP legislative blackmail represented by two shutdowns of the federal government. The people responded by supporting him in opinion polls. The Republicans, reeling and desperate, finally gave up. Democrats prepared to take their case to the people in the fall elections, with an excellent chance, they say, of retaining the White House and regaining the Congress, as people think more about what GOP bombthrowers have been trying to do to American society and government.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This telling is also the version offered by the establishment media. I will leave it to future historians to determine whether the Democratic line and the establishment media's analysis coincide so well because they simply reflect the truth of the situation, or for some other reason. You can also hear this interpretation in certain Republican circles, such as when Al D'Amato launched his celebrated screed against Gingrich, his Contract, and GOP extremism in the spring of 1996. Boiled down, the theme of this argument is: game over. Republicans had their chance, they blew it, and that's the end of that.<p><table>
<tr width=80>
<td hspace=5>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But, in fact, it's not the end of that. Before too long, Democrats will likely be reminded of the fallacy of endism. Even if Republicans lose  this November, they are not going to fold their tent and go away. Novels may have a beginning, a middle, and an end, but politics is a perpetual middle.</td><td><hr width=75><h3><font size="+3">T</font>he essential fact of the 104th Congress is that it did not live up to the expectations it helped create</h3><hr width=75></td>
</td></tr></table>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Republicans recently suffered their own brutal lesson in the fallacy of endism. Weren't the Democrats finished, kaput, toast, less than two years ago? Wasn't the Democratic president trying to persuade everybody (including, it seemed, himself) of his own relevance? Wasn't the juggernaut of popular opinion that swept the GOP in and the Democrats out going to overpower whatever feeble resistance might be offered by a weak, rudderless, scandal-plagued administration? And wasn't this all merely prologue to the completion of the, well, Revolution--in 1996, when Americans would surely elect a Republican to the White House and all good things would be in legislative reach? And doesn't that all seem a bit naive just now?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Surely it was unrealistic to expect a true revolution as long as President Clinton occupied the White House, Senate Democrats wielded the power of the filibuster, and House Republicans held only a slim majority. But judged by more modest standards, Republicans in the 104th Congress actually achieved a great deal. And the chief obstacle to the rest of their agenda was Bill Clinton and his veto pen. Didn't get your tax cut? Talk to Clinton. Budget not balanced? Clinton didn't want to balance it. Federal regulators and a legal system still out of control? Clinton vetoed changes. Medicare careening toward insolvency? Been there, vetoed that.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Republicans can also muster a fairly decent <a href="/heritage/congress">list of things</a> they did manage to get through. The biggest one was surely a welfare overhaul in the form of a broad "devolution" of responsibility to the states. This was, in fact, transforming legislation, an end to a federal entitlement program that was for 30 years <i>the</i> symbol of the promise and failure of the War on Poverty.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In addition, the president now has a line-item veto, which Democratic Congresses repeatedly refused to give Ronald Reagan. The candidate elected in November will be the first president with the power to use it. Congress also completed a massive revision of telecommunications law, which ought to open up some promising technological vistas and provide more competition in cable, broadcasting, telephone, and information services.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	To everyone's surprise, the vast, centralized apparatus of American agricultural policy was significantly reformed in the Freedom to Farm Act. In lieu of the complicated formulas and procedures that determine how much wheat, corn, rice, and cotton -- the four major "program crops" -- farmers can plant and sell, growers will get a declining subsidy over five years (based on the level of their previous payments from Washington) and freedom to plant crops as they see fit.<p>
<table>
<tr width=80>
<td><hr width=75><h3><font size="+3">W</font>as it realistic to expect a true revolution with Bill Clinton in the White House, Democrats filibustering in the Senate, and the GOP holding a slim majority in the House? </h3><hr width=75></td>
<td hspace=5>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Congress overrode a presidential veto of securities-litigation reform designed to protect companies from unreasonable class-action lawsuits when their stock price declines. The antiterrorism bill provided a vehicle for streamlining the use of habeas corpus in federal death penalty appeals. And, of course, the national speed limit is history.</td></tr></table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	At this writing, there are a couple of other possibilities for significant legislation. Passage of an immigration-reform bill containing sharp restrictions on illegal immigration -- but surprisingly unnativist on legal immigrants -- seems imminent, and the president is widely expected to sign it. There is also a possibility of legislation designed to make health insurance more portable, including a provision for a small experiment with Medical Savings Accounts. And, ahem, how about that minimum-wage increase?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	No, this record doesn't add up to a revolution. It hasn't transformed the policy landscape to resemble maps designed by Republicans. On the other hand, the 104th Congress has nothing to be ashamed of. This is a solid record of legislative achievement. And Republicans are right to say that the achievement would have been much greater had it not been for the president's rather sudden display of backbone, starting in the late fall of 1995. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	That resolve may have been precisely the quality Americans wanted to see in a president whose fecklessness had become something of a national joke, and they rewarded him with higher approval ratings. On the other hand, the president did pass up at least one historic opportunity. As Senator John Ashcroft, the freshman Republican from Missouri, has observed, every president goes to bed at night praying that Congress will announce some major entitlement reform the next day. Even modest changes in entitlement programs usually require blue-ribbon commissions to provide political cover. But this Congress offered two -- not only welfare reform, which Clinton would go along with only the third time a bill landed on his desk, but also a much more politically tricky Medicare fix. The president walked away from Medicare, even though he and his advisers knew the insolvency of the program is certain in the absence of program changes. The White House shamelessly protested the horrific Republican "cuts" in Medicare -- make that "gutting," "slashing," and "destroying" Medicare. The opinion polls favored the president. But they would likely have continued to do so even if he had actually chosen to behave constructively. Clinton could have split the rather small difference with Republicans and anointed himself the savior of Medicare--not only from bankruptcy, but also from heartless Republicans eager to slash it to pay for tax cuts for the rich. For the White House, though, relentless counterattack was the order of the day. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Besides welfare reform, the Republican Congress got the president to agree to something truly extraordinary in one other area: discretionary (that is, nonentitlement) spending. This is the part of government determined each year through the appropriations process--the 11 big bills that fund the operations of the government itself, and without which (or some other mechanism agreeable to Congress and the president) we get a shutdown. Clinton vetoed a number of these bills and signed only a couple, but the shutdowns led to the other spending mechanism, the "continuing resolution" that set spending levels for all programs where appropriations bills had gone unsigned. To that measure Clinton attached his signature.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Every year since 1969, spending in the domestic (that is, nonmilitary) discretionary category has increased. (Military spending has had its ups and downs and is now in a sharp decline that has been partially ameliorated by the GOP). That changed in fiscal 1996. The Republican Congress actually did cut spending--not reductions in the rate of increase, not "cuts" against a rising baseline, not "cuts" after adjusting for inflation, but genuine reductions. Domestic discretionary spending was $246 billion in fiscal 1995 and $223 billion in fiscal 1996.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; By contrast, the Clinton administration wanted to spend $30 billion more in 1996 than 1995, instead of $17 billion less. The proposed Clinton budget for the year would have yielded a deficit of $211 billion. Current projections from the Congressional Budget Office show a fiscal 1996 deficit of $117 billion. Economic growth that exceeded projections account for some of this difference. But more than half is the result of cuts in domestic discretionary spending.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As <a href="/heritage/staff/utt.html">Ronald D. Utt</a> of The Heritage Foundation has noted, appropriators achieved these savings in part by eliminating some 200 government programs and scaling back many others. The cynical conventional view of Washington has long held that the closest thing to eternal life in this world is a federal government program. Well, good riddance to the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation (to say nothing of the welfare entitlement).<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The discouraging thing is that this $23 billion in savings came out of a federal budget totaling $1.57 trillion, up (thanks to entitlements) from $1.52 trillion last year. In short, the cuts amounted to less than 1.5 percent of total spending.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	And yet this truly was a reversal of a course that had been followed for 26 years. Surely it means something when a Democratic president declares in his State of the Union address that "the era of Big Government is over." Surely, as well, it means something when that same president tacks sharply to the right as he takes his case for re-election to the voters.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This has been the real Republican solace in the face of frustration during the 104th Congress. The terms of the debate have changed, Republicans tell themselves. America is, undeniably, a conservative country now. Democrats recognize that the old-fashioned, liberal, Big Government agenda is now a loser, and they know that to survive politically, they must run as conservatives. They may, for a time, be able to get away with running right and governing left, as Clinton is trying to do. But eventually their own record will catch up with them, and voters will select the real thing rather than the ersatz version.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I think there is much truth to this analysis, but there is something about it that bothers me, and that is its endism. William F. Buckley Jr. once wrote, famously, that the conservative mission is "to stand athwart history, shouting 'Stop!'" I have long thought that the problem with this formulation is that history isn't listening. And now conservatives are erring in the other direction, rushing to the conclusion that they represent the future. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The spending cuts of fiscal 1996 and the advertised end of the era of Big Government are remarkable achievements. But there is nothing permanent about them, and Republicans are deluding themselves if they think otherwise. It is pleasant, in some sense, to think that large forces are at one's back -- certainly more pleasant than the experience of swimming upstream, with which conservatives are plenty familiar. And if public-opinion polls mean anything, the electorate is clearly more responsive to conservative proposals for solving problems than to huge new government bureaucracies. Yet this does not spare Republicans the responsibility and drudgery of fighting, fighting, fighting the daily battles of practical politics, against those who would like government to assume even more control over the lives of the American people. The measure of victory is not just the passage of vast, transforming legislation but also the extinguishing of the lights at the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The most compelling problem of practical politics for Republicans is that they are not as popular right now as they imagined they would be. Whether this decline in popularity threatens their hold on Congress, whether the Democrats have really gained at their expense, whether the electorate in 1994 saw its choices for Congress as a choice between national policies, and whether 1996 will also be such an election--these are all questions that will be "settled" in November. In other words, we will argue about them for years.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The question for Republicans is how to rebuild their popularity. To answer that question, Republicans must first understand why their popularity rose and fell in the first place. Republicans often claim that by the end of last year, their message had gotten lost--lost in the obsessive focus on balancing the federal budget within seven years. Republicans took popular support for granted and lost sight of the need to explain why the budget had to be balanced. Some add that the message got lost in a media culture that has never understood the Republican agenda and remains hostile to it. In addition, the Clinton administration lied about what Republicans were actually proposing. The solution, in this analysis, is to figure out better ways of both framing the message and communicating it to the people.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Others have argued that the message was fundamentally flawed from the outset. The supply-side faction of the party, for example, has excoriated the Contract With America for failing to articulate a Reagan-Forbes-Kemp message of hope, growth, and opportunity--and never mind the budget deficit. Still others have said that the message was wrong because it is, as Democrats charged, too extreme. Why make sweeping changes in regulatory policy in areas where most people have come to trust the government -- clean water, clean air, and safe food and drugs?<p>

<td hspace=5>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But I think the biggest problem came from the heady sense of victory following the 1994 elections: We win, they lose; the people are with us, the people are against them. And that's the way it is. Republicans in the House worked very hard on a plan for governing if they should find themselves in power. They studied the House's Democratic masters with care, fashioned a strategy for seizing a majority, and crafted a legislative agenda that they believed reflected the wishes of most Americans. When they finally won, they did what they had set out to do. The Senate is a very different place, less a stranger to Republican control but at the same time less susceptible to control altogether. Yet the Republican Senate went along, too.</td></tr></table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	And then . . . they didn't win it all. They did not get everything or even most of the things they wanted. They faced an opposition that did not always fight fair. And the American electorate, whom they thought they had squarely behind them, turned out not to be. Republicans retreated, they regrouped, they recriminated, they refought the battles they had won and the battles they had lost to try to figure out why. And they returned to fight another day, with this change in strategy and that change in tactics, and they recognized that the pursuit of total victory is dangerous when it comes unmoored from the daily business of democratic politics, which is to keep things moving your way while pleasing people.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Republicans learned that there is always another day, that this is not a game of chess or a mystery novel, but rather politics, in which nothing is ever settled once and for all and in which the illusion that things are can be your undoing. And that was the greatest accomplishment of the Republicans of the 104th Congress. They learned that in politics there are no permanent victories, that the fat lady never sings. And whether they hang on to Congress in 1996 or return to power in 1998 or later, this wisdom will be essential if they are to govern.<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;What

can government do, if anything, to make sure that the overwhelming majority of American children grow up with a mother and father?" <i>Policy Review</i> asked a number of family experts across the political spectrum to address this question, considering state and local government as well as the federal government. <p><hr><p>

<b><i> Encourage Parental Involvement </i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	In the classic movie <i>King Kong</i>, the giant ape lifts the tiny heroine into his hairy hands with a puzzled look on his face, as if to say, "She's small and cute, but now what do I do with her?" Similarly, what can or should that giant leviathan known as "government" do to provide children with parental guidance? My first thought is the same one I had when I saw the massive Kong delicately hold the fragile heroine: "I hope he doesn't hurt her."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	 Government should always keep in mind that no one loves children more than their parents. There are many in Washington who believe otherwise, and think that <i>they</i> know what's best for your children. The best thing that government can do to ensure children grow up with a mother and father is to recognize that parents -- both a mother <i>and</i> a father -- are fundamental to a child's upbringing in the first place.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	 Government needs to encourage and solicit -- not frustrate -- parental involvement in the education of children. In the early 1930s, there were more than 130,000 school boards in the United States. Today, there are fewer than 15,000. We need to encourage parental participation by restoring local school boards for each and every school and empowering them -- together with faculty and administrators -- to determine educational policies and curricula. We must also enact school choice and voucher plans to give parents more control over their children's education.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Finally, we must stem the tide of divorce, including so-called "no-fault divorce." Nothing harms children more than losing the support and involvement of either parent, a frequent result of divorce. We should give the institution of marriage greater respect and protection. A marriage ought to be difficult to enter and even more difficult to leave. How about requiring a waiting period before every wedding?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	We need to acknowledge that government -- in any form -- can never provide what children need most: love. Only two people are qualified for that -- Mom and Dad.

<b><i> Revive the "Marriage Culture"</i></b>
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; A distressing number of children in this nation will go to bed tonight without the participation of both a mother <i>and</i> father in an important family ritual: reading a bedtime story, saying nighttime prayers, and being tucked in with reassuring goodnight kisses. This experience is more and more often a solo act for one reason: the slow death of a marriage culture. It is being replaced by a culture of divorce and illegitimacy, each of which now exists, for the first time in our nation's history, in equal proportion to their opposites. It is paramount that we re-establish an appreciation of the value and virtue of marriage, both for the individual and society. As recent history shows, this work cannot rest on the ever-expanding shoulders of government (also known to some as "the village").	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; When Daniel Patrick Moynihan wrote his report on the declining health of the black family in America, few authorities took his warning seriously -- except his boss, President Lyndon Johnson. Largely influenced by Moynihan's work, Johnson's "Great Society" swelled a small government bureaucracy of 45 domestic social programs to a leviathan of 435 by the end of his administration. Yet for all this "help," things have only gotten worse since then. What can be done?

-- James Dobson</h3><hr width=75></td>
<td hspace=5>



&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; There are four obvious imperatives for government. First, it should clearly define marriage as a lifelong commitment between a man and woman. Second, states should reform no-fault divorce laws. Third, government should end our confiscatory tax structure, which undermines the financial stability of families. Our tax policy ought not merely level the playing field for married couples; we should actually <i>tilt it in their favor</i>. Fourth, the federal and state governments should reform welfare in order to end current incentives for conceiving children outside of marriage.
</td></tr></table>


	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; But the real recovery of a marriage culture requires tools that the government doesn't possess or even recognize. Our nation needs both a vision for the purpose of marriage and the personal and spiritual resources to build strong unions. These can only be provided by our faith-based institutions, which are divinely commissioned and uniquely gifted to undertake this work. Without this vital contribution, many children will never enjoy the irreplaceable benefits of a home with a mother and a father. Consequently, society will suffer.<p><i>James Dobson, a psychologist, is the founder of Focus on the Family, in Colorado Springs, Colorado.</i><p> 
<a name="engler"><b>Gov. John Engler</b></a><br>
<b><i> Acknowledge the Limits of Government</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Government policy should follow the Hippocratic Oath. Government policies should in no way discourage the formation and preservation of families, nor add momentum to the powerful centrifugal forces breaking our families apart. Here are three reforms at the top of my list:<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Tax reform. Government must reduce the tax burden on families and eliminate the marriage penalty in the tax code. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, real average weekly wages are 5.5 percent lower today than during the Reagan years. As a result, many families are in debt. Spouses are entering the work force to help make ends meet, and they raise total family income by about one-third. Yet these families must also pay almost 28 percent of their income to the federal government. In effect, mothers are having to work just to pay off Washington.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	It is useful to put the burden on our families in historical perspective. In 1954, the last year Republicans controlled the White House and both houses of Congress, federal taxes amounted to less than the tithe to your local church -- 8 percent of total family income. Often one parent chose not to work. Today, however, few families are free to make that choice, and government tax policy has burdened them unnecessarily.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Welfare Reform. Remember the stories about couples splitting up so welfare benefits would keep coming in? That was due to the "100-hour rule," which kept intact couples from working more than 100 hours per month. Unfortunately, it's still federal law. Michigan was one of the first states to apply for and receive a waiver from the federal government to exempt two-parent families from this destructive policy. The 100-hour rule is just one example of where federal welfare policy is wrong. Until states are free to undertake far-reaching reform, the system will continue to fail families.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Divorce reform. Because of the terrible impact of easy divorce on women and children, state lawmakers are taking a second look at their no-fault laws. In Michigan, Iowa, Pennsylvania, and a half-dozen other states, Republicans and Democrats alike are seeking to make the decision to get divorced a more considered one.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	A national leader in turning back no-fault divorce has been Jessie Dalman, a Michigan state legislator. She has sponsored 12 bills that would deny a divorce if only one spouse wants it -- unless that spouse could prove infidelity, desertion, alcoholism, physical or mental abuse, or other serious problems. Her legislation would also require participation in a pre-divorce program for all parties in an uncontested divorce where young children are involved.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	In addition, Dalman's legislation seeks to reduce the number of impulsive marriages by requiring a 30-day waiting period and encouraging every couple to receive counseling before their wedding day. A state marriage license would cost $20 for those who get counseling, $100 for those who do not.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	It is essential that our society rethink the no-fault revolution. Over the past quarter-century, easy divorce laws have helped tear apart American families. As a society, it is time to refocus more on the needs of children and less on the desires of parents. We must make it harder for children to be victimized by a no-fault system that gives all the legal clout to the party that wants to break the marriage.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	It is essential that Washington acknowledge the limits of government. It never has been, nor will it ever be, a substitute for the family. Family renewal must, in the end, come from within the family. Despite well-publicized divorce statistics, I am hopeful that our nation can slow down the forces of disintegration. The brisk sales of works like <i>The Book of Virtues</i>, the recognition that "Dan Quayle was right," the growing impact of groups like Focus on the Family and Promise Keepers -- all these signs give me encouragement.

<b><i> Praise the Two-Parent Family </i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Government's first and most immediate task is to stop undermining the two-parent family. Whatever government subsidizes, it will be inundated with. In the 1930s, when government subsidized pigs, the Midwest was up to its hips in pigs. Today, we are subsidizing illegitimate children, and the result is a social catastrophe.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Government ought to dismantle every welfare program that promotes single-parent families. The litmus test is simple: Any program that encourages out-of-wedlock births and supplants fathers should be eliminated. Next, government should aggressively <i>promote</i> two-parent families. The Bible says that rulers have been established "for the praise of those who do good" (1 Peter 2:14, NKJV). Here are a few ways government can "praise" the two-parent family:<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Make divorce more difficult to obtain. Reduce the tax burden on the family. Defend traditional (one man, one woman) marriage. Uphold parental authority over children. Empower parents with educational choice.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	A century ago, the Supreme Court called the traditional two-parent family "the sure foundation of all that is stable and noble in our civilization; the best guaranty of that reverent morality which is the source of all beneficent progress in social and political improvement" (<i>Murphy v. Ramsey</i> [1885]). I pray for leaders at all levels to have the wisdom -- and the courage -- to stand on such principles today.

<b><i> Remove Perverse Incentives </i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Government must encourage families to come together and stay together through cultural, not governmental, pressures. The most important role for government is to remove the perverse incentives of the welfare state.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Current policy encourages parents to abdicate financial and moral responsibility for their children to the government. Our entitlement system induces some irresponsible fathers to abandon their families, cavalierly confident that government will step in. If we resist the temptation to cure every societal ill with more government programs, I believe parental influence and responsibility will fill the void. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	We must weed out invasive government policies, so that our culture can recuperate. Our current welfare system penalizes marriage and work and fosters dependency, and it must be reformed. We should also eliminate the marriage penalty in the tax code. In addition, we should modernize 60-year-old labor laws to grant working parents the opportunity for flexible work schedules, so that families can spend more time with their children.

<b><i> A Modest Role</i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	We should be appropriately modest about the role of government in promoting family stability. Current rates of divorce and out-of-wedlock birth reflect deep cultural changes over which law and public policy have limited influence. Still, there are some responsible steps government at various levels should take.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Reducing out-of-wedlock birth. In the past decade, several promising programs to reduce pregnancy among unmarried young people have been developed at the local level. The federal government should create -- or help the nonprofit sector create -- a clearinghouse to inventory these programs, evaluate them rigorously, and provide reliable information to states, localities, and community-based organizations. Since recent research suggests a connection between the welfare system and out-of-wedlock birth, welfare reform should permit states to adopt new policies that reduce perverse incentives.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Making marriage pay. The federal tax code tilts against families. To correct this, we should dramatically increase the dependent exemption for young children and do what we can to eliminate the marriage penalty. In addition, tax credits for education and training should be made available to parents who leave the paid work force for extended periods to care for young children and then seek to return.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Restricting divorce. States should reshape their laws of divorce to make divorce more difficult when minor children are involved. I favor the elimination of unilateral no-fault in such cases, with the alternative of a five-year waiting period. In addition, as Maggie Gallagher, Elizabeth Scott, and others have suggested, states should stand behind the premarital agreements of couples who wish to make their own marriages harder to dissolve than state law requires.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Can government do anything to reverse the trend of fatherlessness? Yes. Reform no-fault divorce laws, eliminating the right to unilateral divorce on demand. Lengthen waiting periods for divorce. Create financial and other incentives for engaged couples to participate in marriage preparation and for couples with troubled marriages to get counseling.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Reform school curricula that trivialize or denigrate marriage. Stop the practice of mainstreaming pregnant girls and teen mothers through the school system. Prohibit boys who impregnate girls from participating in sports and other extracurricular school programs. Enforce statutory rape laws. Put the current welfare system out of its misery and replace it with public and private efforts, including faith-based initiatives, that embody effective compassion and promote marriage.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Eliminate the antimarriage bias in the Earned Income Tax Credit. Increase the value of the marriage deduction in the tax code. Calculate child-oriented tax exemptions and credits on a per-parent basis -- that is, permit households with two parents twice the exemption and credit value of one-parent households.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Give priority to married couples in public housing. Reform adoption laws and procedures so that more children will be adopted, sooner, by married couples. Appoint and hire people who will publicly insist that unwed childbearing is wrong, that our divorce rate is far too high, and that our society should dedicate itself to increasing the proportion of our children who grow up with their two married parents.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	The real question is not whether we know what would work, but whether we want to do what would work.<p><i>David Blankenhorn is the president of the Institute for American Values and the author of </i>Fatherless America<i> (<a href="http://www.harpercollins.com">HarperCollins</a>).</i><p><a name="quayle"><b> Dan Quayle </b></a><br>
<b><i> Preserve, Protect, Defend the Family </i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	There is no question government has a role, albeit a minor one, to play in strengthening families. In recent years, the real problem in our society hasn't been so much that families have failed but that government has failed to act in the best interest of families. Some common-sense reforms would do much to correct the government's anti-family bias.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Taxes. The government could and should immediately repeal the marriage penalty, increase the tax exemption for children and index it for inflation, and repeal regulations prohibiting employers from paying "family wages." As a long-term solution, I support a modified flat tax that maintains the deductions for home mortgages and charitable giving.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Divorce. States should reassess their "no-fault" divorce laws, and make children's interests paramount in divorce proceedings.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Welfare. We should scrap our current system, which encourages illegitimacy and discourages work, in favor of new ways to help those truly in need. Senator Dan Coats's "Project for American Renewal" is a good place to start.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Adoption. The House of Representatives has passed reforms removing barriers to interracial adoption and making adoption easier in general. The Senate should pass this bill and send it to the president.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	We also desperately need help from nongovernment institutions like the media and the entertainment community. They have a tremendous influence on our culture and they should join in when it comes to strengthening families. <p><i>Dan Quayle, the 44th vice president of the United States, is the chairman of Campaign America.</i><p><a name="weyrich"><b> Paul M.

<b><i> Reverse an Anti-Marriage Bias </i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	In 1987, the Free Congress Foundation pioneered the development of cultural conservatism with a book called <i>Cultural Conservatism: Toward a New National Agenda</i>, by William S. Lind and William H. Marshner. This book suggests that, to strengthen American families, government could:<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Raise the personal exemption (for dependents only) to its original, 1948 value, which in today's dollars would be more than $6,000. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Make the child-care credit universal, so parents who care for their own children receive the same benefits as those who send their kids to day care.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Permit employers to offer a "family wage," that is, a higher wage to heads of families. The family wage was a major Victorian reform that was made illegal by a Department of Labor regulation issued in 1966.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Eliminate "no-fault" divorce.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Assign children their own guardian <i>ad litem</i> in any divorce proceeding. The guardian would represent the children's interest in having the parents stay together.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Limit cash welfare benefits to intact families and offer "matching grants" to heads of intact families with full-time jobs whose income is insufficient to support a family.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Fund programs in which volunteers build homes for sale (not rent) to the poor, with the proviso that these homes may only be sold to intact families.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Current government policies reflect a consistent bias against traditional families. The proposals above depend upon the willingness of those who make government policy to favor such families and regard them as essential to the nation's future. In the face of the influence of "political correctness" (which is to say, cultural Marxism) in both political parties, that most basic change will be the most difficult to bring about.

<b><i> Do No Harm </i></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Government's first obligation is to do no harm. For 60 years, Big Government has engaged in massive intrusion into the family -- with disastrous consequences. It is time to get out of the way. <p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	What the government should not do has been obvious to conservatives for many years. It should not maintain a tax system that punishes two-parent families and forces both parents to work; it should not grant "no-fault" divorces more readily than drivers' licenses; and it should not maintain a welfare system that rewards illegitimacy and punishes women who get married.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Ronald Reagan used to say that "government does not solve problems; it subsidizes them." Social engineering, whether done by liberals or conservatives, is still social engineering. Imagine the horrific programs the federal bureaucracy would create to "help" the family. First, it would redefine "family," then "mothers," then "fathers." Could they really even settle on a definition of a child? <p><i>Kay James is the dean of the Robertson School of Government at <a href="http://www.regent.edu/">Regent University</a>, in Virginia Beach, Virginia.</i><p>

<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Judy Hooper has two passions in life: doughnuts and the <a href="http://www.osha.gov/">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> (OSHA).Hooper loves doughnuts. That's one of the reasons she opened a bakery in Evanston, Illinois. It's a small shop, bringing in about $50,000 in profits annually. That's not enough to make her rich, but the challenge of running a small business and her talent for baking keep this 35-year-old Chicago native busy.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Ask Hooper about OSHA, however, and her face glazes over with disdain. A 1994 inspection of her 30-person bakery by OSHA officials left Hooper with $13,000 in frivolous fines. Her infractions included a failure to warn employees of the hazards of household dishwashing liquid. To recoup the cost of the fines, she would have to sell 260,000 doughnuts, or 10,400 cakes, or 1,040,000 cookies.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The national news media picked up her story, but OSHA refused to back down. So has Hooper. Though she paid the fine, she hopes to file a class-action suit against the federal agency, and is trying to enlist other OSHA victims to help her cause. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
She will find plenty of recruits. The bakery owner joins millions of women entrepreneurs across the country who are finding out just how intrusive Big Government can be. Indeed, one of the most overlooked issues in this campaign season is how the rising number of women business owners -- a third of all U.S. firms -- are being beaten down by Washington's overbearing laws, inflexible regulations, and arcane tax policies.<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	If they mobilized, these women could be a potent force. The National Foundation for Women Business Owners (NFWBO) reports that the number of women-owned businesses in the United States will reach 8 million this year, employing more than 18.5 million people and generating more than $2.28 trillion in gross sales. Over the last nine years, NFWBO estimates, the number of women-owned firms has increased 78 percent. "The growth in the number of women-owned businesses continues to be dramatic across the nation," says Julie R. Weeks, NFWBO's director of research. But <a href="http://www.house.gov/myrick/">Sue Myrick</a>, a first-term Republican congresswoman from North Carolina and a former small-business owner, knows first-hand how Big Government threatens this growth: "Most government-imposed regulations are duplicative, expensive, and time-consuming," she says. "If not checked, regulations can cripple a small-business owner's ability to compete in the marketplace."

<p><b>Attack on Nurses</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Consider Arlene Kaplan's Heart to Home, Inc., a New York company that provides skilled nurses for patients needing home health care. To accommodate their unpredictable hours, Heart to Home hires nurses as independent contractors. That means the nurses pay their own state, federal, and Social Security taxes.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	For the 70 nurses working for Kaplan -- and the thousands of others who labor as independent contractors in health care -- their employment status buys them flexibility. They are free to schedule their work around their families and other commitments, working anywhere from 5-hour to 60-hour weeks as needed. For the home health-care industry, independent contractors deliver affordable, quality care on demand.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	But to the <a href="http://www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/">IRS</a>, the independent contractors who find jobs through Kaplan's company aren't independent enough. Based on a 20-point litmus test, IRS officials determined in a 1990 audit that Heart to Home's nurses legally were not independent contractors, but employees. Kaplan's business was assessed $250,000 in back taxes and fines for misrepresenting her workers to the IRS.
<p>
<table>
<tr width=80>
<td><hr width=75><h3>In the last seven years, the IRS reclassified 439,000 independent contractors as employees and collected more than $750 million in fines</h3><hr width=75></td>
<td hspace=5>
 
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	According to Sandra Abalos, a CPA, the test is "so vague and so subjective" that even tax law practitioners cannot determine who is an employee and who is an independent contractor. Heart to Home's lawyer Barry Frank believes the IRS is "targeting small businesses" by frequently auditing those who hire independent contractors. In the last seven years, the IRS reclassified 439,000 independent contractors as employees and collected more than $750 million in fines.
</td></tr></table><p>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	So far Kaplan's business has accrued $20,000 in legal fees and expects another $40,000 in court costs when she goes up against the IRS later this year. Unlike most people engaged in legal jousting with this federal agency, however, Kaplan is the plaintiff: Through a complicated financial maneuver, she managed to sue the IRS.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"If the government wins, they put me out of business," Kaplan says. "I don't own enough things in this entire world to pay off what they want from me." Even if Kaplan is successful, there is little hope she'll be reimbursed by the IRS for her legal fees. But forcing the agency to retreat would be a moral victory for her, and might make IRS agents a little less eager the next time around. Says Kaplan, "Maybe they will get off someone else's back in this business."<p><b>Tripping up Toddlers</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The IRS, of course, retains no monopoly on crippling regulation. A few years ago, Virginia resident Tanya Wallace started a small business called Toddlin' Time, a playgroup for stay-at-home moms and their kids. When she decided to franchise her idea, however, she ran up against <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) regulations intended for larger companies.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The FTC's "franchise rule" requires all companies, regardless of their size, to meet the same franchising requirements. So Toddlin' Time, which simply brings mothers and children together at dance studios and karate centers to play games, must meet the same auditing requirements as McDonald's, a company with billions of dollars in sales and operating costs, expensive equipment, and trained staff. 
<p>
<table>
<tr width=80>
<td><hr width=75><h3>It's just easier to walk away from the business, says Tanya Wallace, than to deal with all the government regulations</h3><hr width=75></td>
<td hspace=5>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	With just a few hours a week in administrative work, Toddlin' Time franchise owners can earn around $14,000 per year by enrolling 50 kids for six-week sessions at $36 per child. Wallace sees her idea as an excellent opportunity to combine family and business in a way that "feels comfortable to home-based women." The business gives kids a regular time and place to play together while stay-at-home moms get to know each other. </td></tr></table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	It's an easy concept to market. But FTC franchising rules have stopped Wallace cold. To comply, she had to expend $15,000 in auditing and lawyers' fees just to become a licensed franchiser. But Wallace couldn't pass these high start-up costs along to the moms interested in Toddlin' Time, so she marketed her franchise below cost. That meant selling four franchising chains just to break even. Yet the fees did not end when her start-up was complete. The FTC requires franchise operators to update their financial statements every year and demands yearly audits to verify the changes.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"We're not a big company," Wallace explains. "We can't afford the two or three or four thousand dollars each year to [prepare] FTC financial statements."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	After six years and 10 successful Toddlin' Time franchises, Wallace is putting the brakes on further expansion. She says she simply can't afford the fees and regulations. Despite these setbacks, Wallace has not totally given up on the idea of Toddlin' Time. She is pursuing a consulting practice to spread her idea, though not her logo, to moms around the nation.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"There is little that you can do when you're up against Big Government and government regulations," she says. "It's easier to walk away, unfortunately, than to deal with all the regulations and expectations they have for you."<p><b>The Disablers</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	When it comes to federal regulations like the Americans with Disabilities Act, however, walking away is not an option. Ask Karla Hauk. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	She and her husband and business partner, Richard Hauk, opened a 32-room Days Inn franchise in Wall, South Dakota. That was on July 1, 1993, about six months after the ADA went into effect. They thought they were ready: Following their franchiser-approved plans, they made two of their 32 rooms accessible to handicapped patrons and made the entrance of their motel accessible to wheelchairs. When they opened their doors, they became the first motel in Wall to provide rooms with accommodations for the handicapped.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Their reward? Karla, Richard, their architect, their contractor, and their franchiser all are being sued by the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">U.S. Justice Department</a> for failure to comply with ADA regulations. They are charged with "unlawful discrimination" toward individuals with disabilities.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	It all started with a whirlpool. According to the Justice Department's suit, the Hauks' two-story motel became a three-story facility when they installed a whirlpool in the basement. ADA regulations require that their motel have an elevator so that handicapped customers can reach every floor, as well as a ramp leading to the whirlpool. According to Karla Hauk, installing the elevator alone would cost more than $100,000, not including the increase in property taxes. Even if the owners removed the whirlpool and left the basement empty, they would still be required to build an elevator for handicapped access, because the Justice Department has declared the basement "occupiable space."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	In addition to the elevator, the ADA requires the Hauks to widen all of the bathroom doors in the nonhandicapped rooms. "If someone who uses a wheelchair . . . visits another guest in a non-accessible guest room, he or she will not be able even to enter the bathroom in that room," according to the suit.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Changing the building's design after the fact looks nearly impossible. "Structurally we don't know how you can do it," says Hauks' lawyer Kim Ruckdaschel-Haley. "What do you do, just knock the place down and start over?"<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Karla Hauk says she believes there should be provisions for the handicapped, but that "a lot of this is unreasonable." She says if they had known then what they know now, they never would have built the motel. "We wish to God we never had. They will bankrupt us."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Because the Hauks' business is dependent upon the seasonal tourist traffic at nearby Badlands National Park, they bring in profits of only $20,000 to $25,000 a year. "If Karla and Richard have to fight this, they'll have to go out of business," says their lawyer. In addition to substantial costs to comply with the ADA regulations, the co-owners could each be fined $50,000 by the Justice Department. When the ADA went into effect, it was unclear how the law would be implemented, says Ruckdaschel-Haley. "Karla and Richard in good faith thought they were doing everything they could."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	For ADA bureaucrats, it seems, everything is not enough. So says Debbie Shaffer, owner of an interior design firm in Walla Walla, Washington. Shaffer wanted to move her eight-year-old company, DGS Interiors, out of her home and into a downtown storefront to expand her business. The proposed Main Street site consisted of a 1,500 square-foot main floor for retail sales, with a raised mezzanine to serve as both a design studio and an administrative office.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The problem? Contractors familiar with ADA regulations informed Shaffer that she had two options in bringing the bi-level facility up to code: either build an elevator to make the second floor accessible to the handicapped, or illogically and wastefully duplicate the design studio on the showroom floor.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	If a handicapped client wanted a design consultation, Shaffer says, she could easily accommodate their needs by bringing her portable decorating samples down to the lower level. But this was not good enough: According to the ADA, this special treatment would unfairly discriminate against the handicapped.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	To comply with the ADA codes, Shaffer would have to spend $150,000 to install an elevator, build handicapped bathrooms, and widen all of the building entrances and doorways. These costs were in addition to her other remodeling expenses. "I have a great amount of support for people with any kind of disability," she says, having grown up with a sister who is deaf. "But the government steps in and takes it too far."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The results? "As a small business owner, it was black and white," Shaffer explains. "I couldn't afford it." Shaffer believes the downtown location could have increased her business by 50 percent, but because the regulations were "too overwhelming, with too many hoops to jump through," she was forced to scrap her plans to expand.<p><b>Doughnut Holes</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	If the ADA's regulatory reach can be breathtakingly broad and intrusive, its rival in the universe of federal agencies is <a href="http://www.osha.gov/">OSHA</a>. Over the last two fiscal years, OSHA has recorded 234,409 violations and assessed over $158 million in fines.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Responding to complaints by a disgruntled employee, OSHA held a three-hour inspection of Judy's Bakery, the Illinois mom-and-pop operation cited above. Nothing could have prepared Judy Hooper for OSHA's report, which cited her for, among other things:<ol>	<p><li>Failing to have a written "Material Safety Data Sheet" for "hazardous" chemicals used at the bakery. The only chemicals used at Judy's Bakery are household bleach and the sort of pink dishwashing liquid used in many homes. Both "chemicals" have clearly marked warning labels. OSHA was unmoved. Fine: $2,500.	<p><li>Failing to have a written plan for emergencies such as a fire. Hooper's shop, which is on the first floor and has four clearly marked exits, is inspected twice a year by the Evanston fire department. Local fire officials had never found any potential safety problems. Fine: $2,500.	<p><li>Failing to have an accident log on the shop's wall. At the time, her company had never had an accident requiring a workmen's compensation claim. The officials said this was irrelevant and argued that even if the log contained all zeroes (one for each day without accidents), it must still be hung on the wall. Fine: $500.	</ol><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
At her informal settlement hearing with OSHA officials, Hooper was able to negotiate the fines down from $13,000 to $5,450. The catch was that Hooper was required to spend the balance of the fines due--approximately $7,500--on safety and health programs for her employees and to present proof that she had complied. Ironically, none of the citations was related to the employee's complaints, which were found to be baseless.<p><b>The Gentle Scrub Jay</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	It was not the safety of employees that concerned the government officials who intruded into Anita Cragg's business, but the safety of the Florida scrub jay.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	 Cragg, the owner and president of Space Coast Management Services, Inc., bought an existing subdivision in Country Cove, Florida, in 1992, with plans to expand and build new homes adjacent the previously developed site. Cragg's permits were in order and some buyers were waiting to build and settle in.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Enter the scrub jay. While surveying for waterline extensions in 1993, officials from the <a href="http://www.fws.gov/">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</a> (USFWS) noted two jays flying onto Cragg's lots. Under the Endangered Species Act, the scrub jay, a 12-inch-long, blue and gray crested jay, is listed as threatened. The officials claimed that Cragg's planned development posed a potential hazard to land "suitable for occupation by scrub jays" and suspended construction on the site.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	According to Cragg, neither the USFWS, nor an independent environmental engineer hired by Cragg, could locate any scrub jay nests on her property. Her four-person company fought with officials from the USFWS for 18 months. Construction was frozen in the meantime, while Cragg's buyers had to continue paying real-estate taxes on the land.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The Fish and Wildlife Service pushed Cragg into a corner. The agency forced her firm to purchase four acres off-site for every one on-site to compensate for the loss of potential scrub jay habitat. That little bargain cost her more than $100,000. It "didn't really help the scrub jay," she says, "because we really weren't hurting it in the first place."<p><b>An Irresistible Offer</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	From 1964 until 1979, most of the commercial garbage in Seattle was hauled to one landfill located on the Tulalip Indian reservation. The site was closed and cleaned up in 1979, getting a clean bill of health from the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a>. For the next 16 years, there wasn't a whiff of trouble from Seattle's former commercial dump.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	And then the EPA started talkin' trash: In 1995, the agency placed the Tulalip Landfill on the Superfund's National Priority List, a list reserved for the country's most serious hazardous waste sites. EPA Project Manager Cindy Colgate admitted that "sometimes we think a problem is taken care of when it's not."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Apparently, this was one of those times. Superfund legislation allows the EPA to retroactively assess liability for environmental clean-ups. So the agency is asking Seattle's commercial businesses for approximately $40 million to clean up the landfill a second time.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The EPA has made what it calls "settlement offers" to 208 Seattle companies, each of which hauled more than 200 tons of waste to the site. These offers allow companies the chance to "resolve their liability" by making payments of $11,070 to $185,497 to the EPA, according to Colgate. The official insists this "is not a fine," but instead an "agreement between the EPA and the parties which says we won't sue them regarding the site." It also protects the firms from third-party suits. Many attorneys are advising firms to pay the EPA and move on. So far, 187 parties have decided to settle rather than face EPA lawsuits.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	For some women-owned firms, the experience has been a primer on the power of federal agencies to impose their will. One such firm in Seattle, an import-export company whose owners asked not to be identified, agreed to pay their  $11,070 fine. In total, Seattle's business owners are forking over $8,130,610 to the EPA--at least $30 million short of its goal. Suzanne Burke, the president of the Fremont Dock Co., which was not named in the settlement, says she believes the 208 letters are "just the beginning," and fears her company may be next on the list. She says the $40 million Superfund cleanup is "an absolute horror for small businesses."

<p><b>Fighting Back</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	There may be some legislative help on the way for business owners. Congress is seeking to clarify the ambiguity over the tax status of independent contractors versus employees, which bedeviled business owner Arlene Kaplan. Congressman <a href="http://www.house.gov/christensen/welcome.html">Jon Christensen</a>, a Nebraska Republican, is sponsoring a bill to simplify IRS rules for independent contractors. A spokesman for Christensen says the bipartisan bill could pass this year. Oklahoma Republican <a href="http://www.senate.gov/member/ok/nickles/general/">Don Nickles</a> has introduced similar legislation in the Senate because, according to his spokesman, "hassle from the IRS" is the principal complaint from his constituents. 	<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	But as more women start their own businesses, they are becoming more cynical about government's helping hand. Forty-seven percent of the women business owners surveyed in 1995 by the United States Trust Company believed that government policies had made things "a little worse or much worse" for their businesses. When asked to rate specific government policies, almost all of the female respondents (91 percent) said they feel most threatened by government-required paperwork, while 90 percent feel threatened by taxes on businesses, raw materials, final products, or services.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The bureaucrats contend they're changing the system. Several officials separately claimed OSHA's new and improved agency has purged archaic enforcement procedures, yet all cited the same case to prove their reform: "Instead of fining someone for not hanging one of our posters about workers' rights," they say, "we offer them a poster to hang." While this may be a first step in dismantling the adversarial relationship between employers and OSHA, it demonstrates how federal agencies are not getting the message from business owners across the country. What happens, one might ask, if they don't hang the poster?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Women business owners are bumping against a ceiling all right. But it isn't made of glass -- it's made of red tape.<p><i>Sheila A.

<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	California's Yuba County is getting ready to spend $12,000 this November on election materials that nobody will use. That's because the federal government forces local officials to print voting information in Spanish for every election.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Bilingual ballots are an enormous waste of county resources," says Frances Fairey, Yuba County's registrar of voters. In last March's primary election, this county north of Sacramento was forced to spend $17,411 on Spanish-language election materials. But, according to Fairey, "In my 16 years on this job, I have received only one request for Spanish literature from any of my constituents."

<td hspace=5>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The biggest problem with bilingual ballots, however, is not that they go unused in Yuba County, but that they are used in so many other places. Thousands of Americans are voting in foreign languages, even though naturalized citizens are required to know English. The National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium estimates, for instance, that 31 percent of Chinese-American voters in New York City and 14 percent in San Francisco used some form of bilingual assistance in the November 1994 elections. Though these figures may be overstated, proportions anywhere near this magnitude are devastating to democracy. As Boston University president John Silber noted in congressional testimony last April, bilingual ballots "impose an unacceptable cost by degrading the very concept of the citizen to that of someone lost in a country whose public discourse is incomprehensible to him."</td></tr></table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	A nation noted for its diversity needs certain instruments of unity to keep the <I>pluribus</I> from overrunning the <I>unum</I>. Our common citizenship is one such tool. Another, equally important, is the English language. It binds our multiethnic, multiracial, and multireligious society together. Not everyone need speak English all of the time, but it must be the <I>lingua franca</I> of civic life. Since the voting booth is one of the vital places in which citizens directly participate in democracy, it must be the official language of the election process.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It is not, however, and political jurisdictions ranging from Yuba County to New York City can pin this mess on the perversion of voting-rights legislation. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 guaranteed blacks the right to vote in places, particularly the South, where they had been systematically blocked from electoral participation, often through the use of bogus "literacy tests." But as Manhattan Institute scholar Abigail Thernstrom has shown in her comprehensive book <I>Whose Votes Count?</I>, it did not take long for this important piece of civil rights legislation to expand in dangerous ways.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	After the Act's passage in 1965, civil rights groups toiled to expand its authority. When the law came up for reauthorization in 1975, Hispanic organizations argued that English-language ballots were the equivalent of literacy tests. People whose first language was Spanish needed special protections in order to vote, they claimed, citing low turnout among Hispanics. This was sheer quackery. Literacy tests in the South were used for the fraudulent purpose of keeping blacks away from elections. Low Hispanic turnout was mainly due to the fact that so many Hispanics were not citizens and therefore ineligible to vote.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Nevertheless, Congress sided with the activists. It required bilingual ballots in any political district where "language minorities" made up at least 5 percent of the total population and less than half of the district's citizens were either registered to vote or had voted in the 1972 presidential election. It also required that bilingual election materials be made available to voters in every county in which the language-minority population had an "illiteracy rate" -- meaning "failure to complete the 5th grade," a trait that includes many immigrants--above the national average. Interestingly, "language minorities" were not defined by language (a cultural characteristic), but by ancestry (a genetic one). The category included only "persons who are American Indian, Asian American, Alaskan Natives, or of Spanish heritage." French Canadians living in Maine, the inhabitants of Little Italy in New York City, and the Pennsylvania Dutch received no special assistance. By the early 1990s, the foreign-language ballot provisions of federal voting-rights law applied to 68 jurisdictions in the United States.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The bilingual-ballot mandate bloated even further in 1992, when Congress said that counties with more than 10,000 residents who speak the same language and who are not proficient in English must provide bilingual voting ballots, even if their potential users make up less than 5 percent of the overall population. This applied to heavily populated areas with large numbers of non-English-speaking residents, such as Chicago, New York City, and San Francisco. To comply, New York City had to purchase new voting machinery because its old equipment did not have enough space for all the Chinese characters that the law said it must provide. Los Angeles County now offers ballots in Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Tagalog, and Vietnamese. In the three elections between November 1993 and November 1994, the county spent more than $1.2 million to print voting materials in these foreign tongues. The Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund has called this "a particularly small price to pay." This "small price" could have paid for a year's tuition at UCLA for 308 Los Angeles residents.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Ballot initiatives are often worded very precisely. Will translations always convey the exact English-language meaning of every initiative? In a deliberative democracy, they must. On a 1993 New York ballot question, translators printed the Chinese character for "no" where it should have said "yes." More important, immigrant voters should not even need bilingual ballots. We have required naturalization applicants since 1907 to demonstrate English-language proficiency. In order to become citizens -- and thus gain the right to vote -- the foreign-born have to demonstrate the ability to speak, read, and write simple English. A handful of them are granted exemptions. Naturalization applicants who are over the age of 50 and have lived in the United States for 20 years do not have to meet the English requirement. But they only make up about 7 percent of all citizenship applicants. The other 93 percent have to pass the test. So why do we assume they lose their English skills on Election Day? Meanwhile, foreign-language voting sends one more message to immigrants that assimilation is not an important part of civil society.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A popular antidote to bilingual ballots is declaring English the official language of the United States. But that is like declaring the bald eagle its official bird -- it's essentially symbolic. Many self-proclaimed official-English advocates in Congress have no intention of repealing foreign-language ballot laws or federal funding of bilingual education. When Senator <a href="http://www.senate.gov/~stevens/">Ted Stevens</a> of Alaska opened hearings on an official-English bill last December, he proudly announced that "the bill does not affect existing laws which provide bilingual and native language instruction. Those statutes are integral parts of our national language policy." Message to civil rights activists: We're not going to change a thing.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In a speech to the 1995 American Legion convention in Indianapolis, Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole announced that "English must be recognized as America's official language." But he said nothing about bilingual ballots. As a senator in 1992, Dole voted to expand their use.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In August, the House of Representatives passed a bill that would repeal the federal government's unfunded bilingual ballot mandate by amending the Voting Rights Act. It would not deny local communities the right to print non-English voting materials, should they choose to pay for it themselves. Nor would it stop voters from taking punch cards into the election booth. No companion bill, however, has been introduced in the Senate. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is a long tradition in the United States of ethnic newspapers -- often printed in languages other than English -- providing political guidance to their readers in the form of sample ballots and visual aids that explain how to vote. In the absence of bilingual ballots, this practice could continue and expand. Perhaps we should also allow voters to bring a friend or relative into the booth, just as blind voters can do. The polling place would remain open to people who have trouble with English, but it also would remind them that English -- or even broken English -- is the common language of American democracy.

<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	A year ago, a 16-year-old constituent of mine, Jeff Gardner, died from a lethal combination of "huffing" gasoline and smoking marijuana. After Jeff's death, his mother, who was aware of a much larger drug problem in the community, called a parent's meeting at the local high school. No one came. She told me her story and asked how her representative in Congress was going to help address the growing drug problem. It was a fair question, but I was not satisfied with the response I could give her. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Members of Congress take seriously their responsibility to represent their constituents in Washington -- by legislating, by voting, and when appropriate, by securing federal funding for state and local concerns. Despite spending $13 billion annually on drug-control programs, however, drug abuse is rising dramatically among our youth.
<p>
<table width="160" align="left" cellpadding="4">

<hr width=75><Font FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva" COLOR="blue"><h3>We'll continue to lose the war on drugs until national politicians show local leadership</h3></font>
<hr width=75></td>
</tr>
</table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A big part of the problem has been the president's failure to show any leadership on this issue (until his wise appointment of General Barry McCaffrey as the new drug czar). In fact, President Clinton hurt the antidrug effort by cutting the Office of National Drug Control Policy from 147 to 25 full-time positions, by hiring a surgeon general who advocated legalization of drugs, by cutting funding for interdiction efforts, and by sending confusing messages about the stigma of illegal drug use. It is no surprise, then, that after dramatic reductions in drug use during the decade before Clinton took office, drug use has nearly doubled among teenagers during his administration. The evidence shows that <i>national leadership</i> is critical in reducing drug abuse.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Jeff's mother wanted that leadership, but in a manner that would help her in Goshen, Ohio. Spending more federal dollars on drug-control programs was unlikely to directly touch this mother's life. Neither would it encourage other parents in her community to address the drug problem. How could I really help? By rolling up my sleeves and providing leadership where it matters most--at the local community level.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Members of Congress are in a unique position to mobilize people in their own communities. By the nature of our jobs, we deal with every sector of the districts we represent. We can also bring statewide and nationwide expertise and resources to bear on a problem. And we can draw the attention of news media that is so critical to educating and mobilizing neighborhoods to solve their toughest social problems. What I've initiated -- and what I'm challenging my colleagues in Congress to embrace -- is a new model of governance that recognizes the limitations of Washington-based solutions, while drawing on the resources of citizens locally.
<p>
<b>Cause for Alarm</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	If there is any public-policy area that demands a new, more effective approach, it is drug abuse. Recent Gallup polls show that crime and drugs are Americans' top concerns. When you ask parents and children what is the most serious issue facing youth today, both groups cite drug abuse.
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
National statistics show there is indeed cause for alarm. After a decade of progress in the war on drugs, the number of young people using drugs began to increase in 1992; use among young kids showed the sharpest increase. LSD use is now at its highest level since 1975, when it was first measured. Since 1992, the number of children between 12 and 17 using marijuana has nearly doubled. To put the problem in perspective, in the average class of 25 eighth-graders (13- and 14-year-olds), five are now using marijuana. And drug abuse is implicated in other social problems -- violent crime, dropout rates, and domestic violence, to name a few. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Greater Cincinnati has a drug problem that mirrors the startling national statistics. This region of the country experienced a similar decline in drug use in the 1980s. But by the early 1990s, it began to skyrocket. Why?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I'm convinced that the resurgence stems in part from the disappearance both of effective national leadership in the fight against drug use and of the media attention that usually follows such leadership. This attention is vital to teaching children that drug abuse is both dangerous and wrong.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	No one makes this point more authoritatively than Jim Burke, the chairman of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America. It was Burke's group in the 1980s that launched the most extensive and successful public-service campaign in the country. Burke also believes strongly that, while the message must emanate from our national leaders and engage the opinion shapers at every level, this issue is best addressed at the community level.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I decided we could not afford to wait for another tragedy to prompt us to action. Over the last year and a half, I have spearheaded an effort to establish the Coalition for a Drug-Free Greater Cincinnati. This effort is not about flashy press conferences and slick brochures. It's a serious, long-term initiative that brings together for the first time community activists already involved in the antidrug effort, key business figures, religious leaders, the media, parents, young people, law enforcement officials, and others. Our aim is to develop and implement a comprehensive, community-based strategy to reduce drug abuse in our region.
<p>
<b>Mobilizing Citizens</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	How do you start a coalition? First, you do a lot of listening at all levels -- to kids and parents, grass-roots activists, and state and national leaders in the field. Over an 18-month period, we led or helped organize countless meetings in all sorts of settings, from living rooms to classrooms, and from boardrooms to community centers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We made it clear through the amount of time we devoted to the effort--more than 1,000 man-hours over 18 months -- and through our inclusive, nonpartisan approach that this was not about re-election campaigns or shallow publicity. The reaction from the community to this new kind of leadership has so far been very positive. Every television station, every major radio station, the two daily newspapers, and our largest outdoor advertising company are all running antidrug public service announcements and ads. Some of the radio spots are from a popular local rock band. We know that such messages help reduce drug abuse, and Greater Cincinnati now has one of the most aggressive antidrug media campaigns in the country.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Such messages, however, are not enough. The data shows that most people who use drugs go to work every day. Also, work is a good place to find parents who need counsel on dealing with teenage drug use. So we had to engage businesses. We took an idea proposed by one of our national prevention experts and brought it to our coalition in Greater Cincinnati. The result? One of our largest health-care providers and the Ohio Bureau of Workers Compensation will offer, for the first time ever, financial discounts to businesses that adopt certified drug-free workplace programs. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The program makes sense. Businesses like it because health-care and workers' compensation coverage costs less. Health-care providers and the bureau like it because drug-free workplace programs do result in a healthier work force and fewer medical and workers' compensation claims. Communities like it because it helps keep workers drug free, encourages drug abusers to seek treatment, and educates people about the dangers of drug abuse. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We also brought PRIDE, a premier national parents' group, to one of our school districts to train more than 600 parents in taking practical steps to keep their kids drug free. This training will be replicated in every school district in the region. Parents are signing up in droves.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We mobilized our local clergy to incorporate an antidrug message in their sermons every six months and to follow up with an educational slide presentation that we developed. We have established a speakers' bureau to supplement the D.A.R.E. program in the schools, and to help get the message out in community centers and student clubs. The list of initiatives proposed by the local community, brought to the coalition by state and national leaders, and facilitated by congressional leadership, goes on and on.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In addition, I have brought to Greater Cincinnati national and state prevention experts to bolster the local effort, including the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, and Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education. I have also brought the president's drug czar, Senator Bob Dole, and Speaker Newt Gingrich to Cincinnati to see the coalition's work firsthand.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The public rightly expects the federal government to do something about drug abuse, which diminishes and threatens the lives of so many of our young people. And the federal government clearly has an important role in combating drug abuse: protecting our borders and interdicting drugs from other countries, strengthening our federal criminal-justice system, and providing federal assistance for the best prevention and treatment programs.	
	Despite a significant federal effort, however, our country is still seeing dramatic increases in drug use among our teenagers. In the last t<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
wo years alone, use of illegal drugs has increased 50 percent. We need a new approach.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Many of my colleagues are beginning to agree. At least 15 other members of Congress are establishing, or supporting, similar community coalition efforts in their regions. The entire House of Representatives -- in an unusual show of election-year bipartisanship -- recently endorsed this community-based initiative.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	That's a much more significant step than cynics imagine. Although the public has become disenchanted with the federal government's ability to address our worst social problems, there's still an abiding faith in a community's ability to fashion solutions close to the needs of ordinary people. And members of Congress can still be a catalyst. Although the public seems to distrust Congress as a whole, individual members are generally well respected in their districts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The point is that members of Congress <i>can</i> and <i>should</i> inspire citizens to action. We've heard about the need to revitalize civil society. Well, here's a concrete example of how members of Congress can do that in a way that actually touches people's lives -- not by passing more laws in Washington, but by using their bully pulpits to engage their communities back home. This is how we as national leaders can best exert--and sustain -- national leadership over the long haul. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	And for the sake of the Jeff Gardners in our communities, we'd better get started.

<h2>A Morningstar for Human Services</h2>

</center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
        <font size="+1">E</font>very now and then an idea comes along that is so breathtakingly sensible, one wonders why no one ever thought of it before.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The National Results Council, a new nonprofit organization based in St. Paul, Minnesota, plans to give users of human services the same kind of comparative performance measures available to buyers of cars and CD players.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It will begin by measuring the effectiveness of vocational rehabilitation programs that try to find jobs for people with disabilities. With some 15,000 programs nationwide serving 500,000 people, this is a $3-4 billion industry, funded mostly by federal and state taxpayers. Despite all this money, roughly two-thirds of people with disabilities remain unemployed. Yet, astonishingly, there are no industry-wide measures for judging how well individual programs are doing.

<hr width=75></td>

</table>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"When you're choosing between different mutual funds, you can compare their performance in Morningstar," says Terry Etling, the CEO of the National Results Council (NRC). "But if you have a disability and want a job, you don't know which rehab programs have the best track record. And if you're a legislator trying to get the most bang from the taxpayers' buck, you don't know which programs to expand or scale down." Etling ought to know. As a former top official at the Ohio Rehabilitation Services Commission, he used to hand out money to service providers.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	To fill this void, the NRC will compare every vocational rehabilitation program in the country according to two measures of performance:<ul><p><li>	Four months after graduation, what percentage of participants have been employed for at least 30 days earning at least $180 per week? (For some kinds of programs, the earnings threshold will be lower.)<li>	How much does the program cost per beneficiary?</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The NRC will then rank the programs according to the benefits delivered and the cost per beneficiary. Rank order will be adjusted according to labor market conditions and barriers to employment, so that programs are rewarded for serving consumers with the greatest difficulty finding jobs. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The NRC will test its methodology in a pilot study of 90 rehab programs at Goodwill Industries International. Kenneth Shaw, Goodwill's research director, says his organization has conducted internal studies of its programs, "but we think an independent third-party evaluation will have more credibility."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Shaw thinks the NRC study will help Goodwill do its job better. "We want to know if some of our programs aren't achieving industry standards, and then figure out why," he says. "We also want to identify which of our programs work best, so that we can learn from our own success, and transfer those lessons to our other operations." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	That's exactly what the NRC hopes will happen throughout the rehab industry. Robert Walker, the organization's president, is a program-evaluation specialist who used to run a Minneapolis rehab center. He estimates that the industry could improve its cost-effectiveness by 20 to 25 percent, simply by bringing low performers up to the standards of the best in the business. "For the same amount of money, we could help 25 percent more people get jobs."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The big question is how consumer information will transform the industry. "Simply pointing to models of excellence isn't enough," says Chris Olander, an NRC board member. "We have to change incentives." Olander is the executive director of New York City's JM Foundation, which conducted a seven-year search in the 1980s to identify the nation's most effective vocational rehab programs. "Guess what? The winners were exemplary but nobody cared. Government and private funders didn't reward the best performers, or punish the worst ones. That's because we don't pay for outcomes in this industry, we pay for quantity of services. We have to start paying for results."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	After vocational rehab, the NRC's next target for evaluation will be the larger world of employment and training--a $20 billion industry. It is also considering programs for alcohol and drug treatment, mental health, and teen-pregnancy prevention. One issue the NRC may be able to resolve is whether faith-based alcohol and drug addiction programs have much higher success rates than medical therapies or secular counseling programs. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The NRC hopes it can reach five audiences with its information: consumers who can make more informed decisions; service providers who can compare their results with similar programs; government officials who can better direct tax dollars for maximum benefit; researchers and trainers who can help improve programs; and private funders who can invest their charitable contributions for greater impact.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Our mission," says president Robert Walker, "is to help human services achieve higher success rates while reducing costs and serving more people."<p>

<b>Targeting Teen Pregnancy</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	In his 1995 State of the Union address, Bill Clinton challenged parents and leaders "from all over the country . . . [to] join together in a national campaign against teen pregnancy." A new private, nonpartisan group has emerged to accept that challenge. The National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy notes that more than 40 percent of American girls become pregnant by age 20, the highest teen pregnancy rate in the industrialized world. Eighty-five percent of these pregnancies, according to the group, are unintended. The premise of the Campaign is that teenage pregnancy contributes mightily to many social problems, that national leaders shy away from declaring that it is wrong, and that initiatives to reduce teen pregnancies are disjointed, little noticed, and poorly supported. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The Campaign's goal is to reduce the U.S. teen pregnancy rate by one-third by 2005. Its strategy is to help organize local coalitions of community-based groups to confront the problem at the local level, prod political leaders to raise the public profile of the issue, evaluate the successes and failures of various teen-pregnancy programs, and enlist the news and entertainment media in the effort to change cultural norms.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Perhaps the most significant feature of the Campaign is its acknowledgment, rare in public policy, that "part of a strategy for reducing teenage pregnancy should be a more overt discussion of religion, culture, and public values." To pursue that goal, the campaign is dedicating one of its four task forces to "religion and public values." This task force is chaired by William Galston, a former domestic policy adviser to President Clinton, and includes Heritage Foundation analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick Fagan</a>, Mary Rose McGeady of Covenant House, scholar Jean Bethke Elshtain of the University of Chicago Divinity School, and a representative of the Alan Guttmacher Institute, among others. Former New Jersey governor Thomas H. Kean and Urban Institute scholar Isabel Sawhill are the board chairman and president, respectively. The Campaign will accept no government funding.<p><i>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Leading a coalition of scientists, business groups, property-rights advocates, and conservationists, the National Wilderness Institute recently released its "American Conservation Ethic." The document comprises a set of principles for protecting the environment and managing resources without recourse to "old-style environmental thinking" that relied on federal mandates. Sound environmental policy, says executive director Rob Gordon, should enlist "liberty, free markets, property rights, scientific inquiry, technological advancement, and a realistic understanding of the natural world." Among its principles: <ul><p><li>Renewable resources are resilient and can be used and managed wisely;<p><li>Efforts to control pollution should measure both benefits and costs in a scientific fashion;<p><li>Management of natural resources should take into account the conditions of particular situations and sites;<p><li>Public policy should be guided by science;<p><li>The most "promising new opportunities" for conserving and improving the environment lie in protecting private property and "unleashing the creative powers of the free market."</ul><p><i>

<P> <b>School Choice in Milwaukee</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Supporters of school choice generally frame their argument in economic terms. They compare public schools to "monopolies" that can get away with a shoddy "product'' -- substandard education -- because poor parents have nowhere else to go. By giving these "consumers" more educational choices, it is said, vouchers will introduce an element of "competition" into public education, thereby forcing public schools to raise their educational standards or risk losing their "customers."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	In <i>Break These Chains</i>, former presidential speechwriter Daniel McGroarty looks at the school-voucher controversy through the eyes of a journalist, not an economist. He offers a "battlefield account" of the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program, which claims to be "the first ever 'voucher' plan, providing public funds for private school choice." In the process, he makes some important modifications to the standard arguments for school choice.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
For example, McGroarty challenges the view that public schools are not responsive to incentives. On the contrary, he argues, the problem is that they're <i>too</i> responsive: "Not only is there no penalty for failure, the objective fact is that <i>poor schools prosper</i>. When funding follows failure, bringing underachieving schools more social workers and school psychologists, special 'stay-in-school' programs, an army of 'at-risk' coordinators and early intervention experts, schools faithfully produce the failure that begets funding. Failure, in this Orwellian inversion, is success. Schools, predictably, sink to the challenge."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	McGroarty also points out that choice in practice is sometimes very different from choice in theory. "At an abstract, theoretical level," he notes, "one can champion freedom of choice and condemn, for example, the faddish focus on multicultural curricula without confronting a simple fact: Some parents, given a choice, will choose multicultural schools." In McGroarty's view, the "Afrocentric focus" of many choice schools constitutes a positive aspect of the school culture. "Voucher advocates," he argues, "must have the courage of their convictions to accept choice in practice."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	For McGroarty, the decisive argument for school choice is not an "economic" one -- promoting competition -- but a moral one: parental empowerment. He quotes the principal of one Milwaukee choice school who, when asked what made her school so special, cited parental involvement. "Choice parents are more active than our tuition parents are," she said. "Choice parents want the opportunity to get involved with their child's education."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	When parents become involved, the results are near-miraculous, as McGroarty demonstrates by comparing the educational effervescence at choice schools like Urban Day School and Messmer High School with the apathy and hopelessness of their public-school counterparts. All these schools are located in the same square mile of Milwaukee's poverty-stricken Near North Side, yet are worlds apart in their ethos and record of achievement.<p>
* Break These Chains: The Battle For School Choice <i>by Daniel McGroarty (Prima Publishing).</i><p><b>Technology and Home-Schooling</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"A concern for independent thought, a longing to strengthen family, and a frustration with the bureaucratic limits of conventional schools" are leading some families to opt for home-schooling, according to Britton Manasco, writing in <i>Reason</i>. "Home schoolers are a statistically small but rapidly growing and increasingly influential force in America. Their numbers have jumped from 15,000 to 20,000 in the late 1970s to perhaps 600,000 today (some estimates put the number above 1 million.) The trend is likely to continue, as new products and institutions develop that make it easier for parents to educate children at home."<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Home-schoolers have a powerful ally in the new information technologies that "make it possible for students to learn at their own pace and in their own way, with the teacher serving as a mentor and an intellectual coach -- guiding, supporting and questioning individual learners. . . . [Information technologies] decentralize learning, no longer tying it to the physical infrastructure and administrative overhead of schools."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Critics of home-schooling argue that "individualized learning" fails to develop social skills such as cooperation, collaboration, and communication, but Manasco disagrees. "No one is arguing that technology be employed to the exclusion of human contact and personal warmth. Individualized learning hardly implies learning in isolation. Communications technologies and networks can enlarge one's set of possible associations and even allow for collaborative learning projects that cannot be replicated in the classroom. In a proper setting, they can help facilitate both individual <i>and</i> interpersonal skills."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Equally important, the new educational technologies will also empower parents. "Whether or not political efforts to encourage taxpayer-funded alternatives to government-run schools ultimately succeed, families already have the option of withdrawing from the educational system. . . . As leaving or supplementing traditional schooling becomes more attractive and less costly, the egalitarian ideology and assembly-line pedagogy that dictate one-size-fits-all education cannot remain unchanged."<p><i>
* <a href="http://www.reasonmag.com/9607/Fe.MANASCO.html">"Special Ed,"</a> by Britton Manasco, </i>Reason, <i>July 1996.</i><p><b>The Catholic School Edge</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Studies have consistently shown that Catholic schools are educating minority students better than their public-school counterparts, despite the fact that per-pupil expenditures in Catholic schools are only one-third those of tax-funded public schools. "Catholic schools succeed where state schools fail," writes Sol Stern, "because they have virtually no central-office bureaucrats telling principals how to do their jobs. In public schools, teachers almost automatically get tenure -- a lifetime job guarantee -- after three years. Most Catholic schools around the country have no tenure system whatsoever. . . . And there is no rigid credentialing system: Principals can select teachers for their talent and commitment."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Given Catholic schools' success in educating minority youth, "you might expect that liberals, self-styled champions of disadvantaged children, would applaud [their] commitment and sacrifice," writes Stern. "You might even expect them to look for ways to get government money to these underfunded schools. Instead, they have done their best to make sure the wall of separation between church and state remains impenetrable. Liberal child-advocacy groups tout an endless array of 'prevention programs' that are supposed to inoculate inner-city children against delinquency, dropping out of school and teen pregnancy -- yet they consistently ignore Catholic schools, which nearly always succeed in preventing these pathologies."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Stern attributes the lack of liberal interest in Catholic schools to the fact that liberal opinion leaders are closely allied to the teachers' unions, "which have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the campaign coffers of liberal candidates around the country." As a result, we are ignoring an inspiring laboratory of reform. "Catholic schools are a valuable public resource not merely because they so profoundly benefit the children who enroll in them. They also challenge the public school monopoly, constantly reminding us that the neediest kids are educable and that spending extravagant sums of money isn't the answer."<p><i>

<b>Age Will Be Served</b>	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
According to economist Thomas J. DiLorenzo, "establishment seniors groups" like the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), the National Council of Senior Citizens (NCSC), and the National Council on Aging (NCOA) are little more than tax-supported advocates for Big Government. "They have a vested stake in maintaining the status quo," he writes in a <a href="http://www.capitalresearch.org/crc/books/elderly.html">new book</a> published by the <a href="http://www.capitalresearch.org/">Capital Research Center</a>, "even if it leads to the bankruptcy of programs that seniors depend on." As Baby Boomers age, two programs of critical importance to senior Americans -- Social Security and Medicare -- are certain to suffer financial collapse in the near future unless they are reformed now. Yet the "dependency lobby," as DiLorenzo calls the AARP, NCSC, and NCOA, steadfastly opposes needed changes.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	According to DiLorenzo, the AARP is "the nation's second-largest nonprofit organization after the Catholic Church. It is perhaps the most influential political organization in America, devoting vast resources in efforts to expand welfare and entitlement programs for seniors. AARP has supported a higher minimum wage, more rent control, 'motor-voter' legislation, higher gasoline taxes, higher alcohol and tobacco taxes and higher capital gains taxes." AARP "continues to assure its members that the Social Security system is financially sound," and its lobbying for higher Medicare and Medicaid spending "has helped bring these programs to the point of bankruptcy." About a quarter of its revenues come from federal funding.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The NCSC, which in 1993 received 96 percent of its funding from federal revenues, supports "income tax increases, cuts in defense spending, 'motor-voter' legislation, a national health-care plan including long-term care, more government housing, and expanded government programs for seniors." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	In contrast to these groups, DiLorenzo reports that millions of seniors are joining "a new generation of seniors groups that emphasize voluntarism, consumer choice, and fiscal responsibility. They understand that the welfare-state policies championed by the groups comprising the so-called dependency lobby are as harmful to seniors as they are to younger Americans." Although the combined budget of these organizations -- The Seniors Coalition, the United Seniors Association (U.S.A.) and the 60 Plus Association -- is about $20 million, compared to the $450 million budget of the "Big Three" seniors groups, the influence of pro-market seniors groups is growing. Unlike their counterparts in the "dependency lobby," notes DiLorenzo, these new seniors groups recognize that Social Security and Medicare are in trouble, and favor market-oriented reforms to avert a crisis.<p>

<p><b>The Crisis of Fatherlessness</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"If present trends continue," writes David Popenoe, a professor of sociology at Rutgers University, "the percentage of American children living apart from their biological fathers will reach 50 percent early in the next century." This "massive erosion of fatherhood contributes mightily to many of the major social problems of our time. . . . Fatherless children have a risk factor of two to three times that of fathered children for a wide range of negative outcomes, including dropping out of high school, giving birth as a teenager, and becoming a juvenile delinquent."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	In his new book, <i>Life Without Father</i>, Popenoe attributes the erosion of fatherhood to two causes: the "divorce revolution" and the sharp increase in nonmarital births. These two trends, in turn, reflect a dramatic change in American culture over the past 30 years -- a shift away from any sense of communal responsibility towards a radical individualism.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Until quite recently, Popenoe argues, American individualism was "tempered by a strong belief in the sanctity and importance of social units such as families, neighborhoods, schools, religious organizations, local communities, and the nation as a whole."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	But today's "radical, expressive, or unencumbered individualism is devoted much more to self-aggrandizement at the expense of the group. In place of group purposes serving as personal goals, self-expression, sexual freedom, and even impulsiveness have been substituted. . . . No longer having a strong institutional repository, moral authority has become increasingly centered within the psyche of each individual. At the extreme, we are becoming a nation of asocial hedonists and narcissists."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The crisis of fatherhood, then, is ultimately a cultural crisis, a sharp decline in the traditional sense of communal responsibility. It therefore follows that to rescue the endangered institution of fatherhood, we must regain our sense of community. Popenoe offers several "community-building guidelines designed to promote marriage and family life." These include the fostering of "residential stability," the revitalization of "community moral standards," the "development of smaller cities and towns," and the protection and promotion of "family-oriented neighborhoods." "Without violating the Bill of Rights," Popenoe concludes, "local communities should have more autonomy in establishing and enforcing their own values and moral standards," and "homogenous neighborhoods made up of families with children, possibly up to the size necessary to support neighborhood schools, should be protected and encouraged."<p>

        <font size="+1">T</font>he 288 most dangerous convicts in Maryland are incarcerated in "Supermax," the Maryland Correctional Adjustment Center. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Supermax is a prisoners' prison, one in a growing class of "supermaximum security" facilities that take the worst of the worst--murderers and rapists who have continued their violent behavior while on the inside -- and lock them away in a redoubt of fortified walls and high-technology surveillance equipment. Supermaxes exist to isolate "bad" prisoners from the general population, and in turn, these incorrigibles from each other.<p>

<td hspace=5> 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	While some see supermaxes as civilized society's last line of defense against its most violent predators, others see them as cruel and unusual punishment. This latter group includes the ACLU's National Prison Project, the National Campaign to Stop Control Unit Prisons, and, most recently, the Clinton <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov">Justice Department</a>. 
</td></tr></table>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Deval Patrick, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, has threatened to sue Maryland for alleged violations of prisoners' civil rights at Supermax. Maryland officials vehemently deny the charges. The Clinton administration, they claim, is conducting a quiet campaign on behalf of prisoners that belies its tough-on-crime rhetoric. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Even as President Clinton proposes a constitutional amendment to protect the rights of crime victims, these officials charge, his Justice Department is trying to expand the rights of prisoners by singling out Supermax. And although the president has signed legislation to liberate state prisons from activist federal judges and groundless prisoner lawsuits, his political appointees are attempting to micromanage the incarceration of the states' most dangerous convicts. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Rico Marzano is one such convict. In a 1987 drug deal that went bad, Marzano shot and killed four people, including two pregnant women. He was convicted of first-degree murder and placed in a maximum security facility. After his second escape attempt, he was sent to Supermax.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Maryland's highest security prison houses three kinds of inmates: "serious institutional rule violators" (typically inmates who have assaulted or killed guards or other inmates); serious escape risks, like Marzano; and prisoners awaiting death sentences, like Anthony Brandison, who paid a man $9,000 to kill two witnesses scheduled to testify against him in a 1983 federal drug case. In all, 105 murderers and 19 rapists spend their days in Supermax in what the corrections system calls "restricted confinement."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Inmates remain alone 23 hours a day in their 65-square-foot concrete cells. They are allowed no physical contact with other prisoners or guards; meals are passed through a narrow slit -- a "beanhole" -- in solid metal cell doors. Out-of-cell time is spent alone, in a windowless prison dayroom. "When we were letting them rec [recreate] together they were killing each other, so we had to stop," said William Sondervan, Maryland's assistant commissioner for security operations.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Despite such concern for the safety of inmates -- not to mention the prison staff -- the Clinton Justice Department insists that the isolation of inmates at Supermax is "the mental equivalent of putting an asthmatic in a place with little air to breathe." But the staff must maintain order among prisoners who regularly hurl "correctional cocktails" of feces, urine, and other bodily fluids and often have to be forcibly removed from their cells. It is obviously frustrating, then, that prison officials must also fight a legal battle to protect what they see as a valuable -- and legal -- correctional tool. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Each year, the 50 states spend $81 million defending themselves against prisoner lawsuits seeking redress for civil rights "violations" ranging from insufficiently stylish footwear to faulty television reception. This epidemic of prisoner litigation -- one-fourth of the civil cases filed in federal trial courts last year were initiated by prisoners -- is complemented by federal judges who impose "voluntary" consent decrees on states. In 1990, more than 1,200 state prisons were operating under judicial edicts covering everything from inmate population caps to how many electrical outlets each cell must have. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This litigation explosion has greatly circumscribed the control of states over their own prison systems. Some states have passed legislation curbing prisoner lawsuits, but attorneys general from Tallahassee to Phoenix have looked to Congress for federal relief. Congress responded earlier this year by passing the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:S.866:">Prison Litigation Reform Act</a>. The legislation, which forces prisoners to pick up the tab for lawsuits and limits the ability of judges to impose consent decrees, was signed by Clinton as part of a larger spending bill last April. But the ink had barely dried on Clinton's signature before his Justice Department stepped in to substitute for the liberal federal judges  whose meddling in state prison systems had been curtailed by the legislation. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In a 13-page letter to Maryland governor Parris Glendening, Deval Patrick charged that Supermax was violating inmates' constitutional rights through a range of offenses from inadequate exercise equipment to lukewarm meals. He gave the state 49 days to comply with a three-page list of "necessary remedial measures," or else face a federal lawsuit. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Thirty states, the federal government, and Canada all have supermaxes -- one-third of which have been created since 1991. These facilities have already established a track record of success as pressure-release valves for overburdened state prison systems. In the 1970s, before California built its supermax, one out of every 1,200 prisoners was murdered by a fellow inmate. Today, that rate has shrunk by tenfold, to one in 12,000. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Tom Coughlin, a former New York State Corrections Commissioner, says he saw a "dramatic reduction" in violence in his prisons following the construction of the New York supermax a decade ago. Despite their success -- or perhaps because of it -- supermaxes have become the target, many corrections officials believe, of a systematic bias within the Department of Justice. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Maryland prison commissioner Sondervan says he is  "shocked" and "insulted" by the charges leveled against Supermax by Patrick. Department of Justice investigators, he believes, came into the facility with their minds already made up. "They came in with a political agenda," Sondervan says. "Their charges don't reflect the truth" about conditions at the prison. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Prisoner litigation typically germinates in the expansive environs of the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits "cruel and unusual punishment." Federal civil rights investigators, Maryland officials charge, seem to believe that supermaximum facilities by their very existence are cruel and unusual. In his letter to Glendening, Patrick admitted he was "unable to find evidence of a pattern of physical abuse by Supermax staff against inmates." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What he did find, however, was a host of violations of prisoners' "rights." Among them were the "rights" to outdoor exercise, piping hot meals, and daily visits by medical personnel. In a sharply worded rejoinder, the Maryland attorney general's office told Patrick that his charges reflect his civil rights division's "philosophical opposition to 'super maximum' facilities without regard to constitutional criteria." They noted that the law allows the Department of Justice to redress only "egregious" constitutional violations, a standard, they argued, that was not met by the charges leveled by Patrick. Former New York prisons commissioner Coughlin agrees that the Justice Department too often acts without legal cause. "Look up the word 'egregious' and the meaning is not lukewarm food," says Coughlin. "There is no constitutional right to rehabilitation. You have to protect people from harm -- that's the constitutional right. The Department of Justice says isolating prisoners is causing harm. But as far as I'm concerned, if officers are not hitting individuals with sticks, there is no constitutional harm being done." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Maryland officials suspected Department of Justice investigators of a broader political agenda because Patrick's letter referred to Pelican Bay prison, a notorious facility in California that has been referred to as a "neo-Orwellian hell." Conditions at Supermax, Patrick wrote, were "similar" to those found at Pelican Bay, a supermax that had been the object of a huge 1991 class-action suit alleging physical and mental abuse of prisoners. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Maryland officials believe that the Department of Justice has set out to expand prisoners' rights by building on the case law established by Pelican Bay litigation. A federal judge found extensive abuses at that prison and ruled that the severe isolation of inmates there could exacerbate and even cause psychosis and other mental problems. Maryland officials strenuously object to the comparison. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the state's Democratic lieutenant governor, told the <i>Baltimore Sun</i> that it was "outrageous" and "inflammatory" to compare Supermax with Pelican Bay. "The fact that they have to reach so far to make the comparison makes you suspicious of the people who wrote this," she said of the Justice Department report.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Such an agenda, officials admit, is perplexing given the anticrime sentiment prevalent this election year. And the timing of the investigation of Supermax -- coincident with the president's approval of the Prison Litigation Reform Act -- only muddies the Clinton administration's message on criminal-justice issues. "Deval Patrick has painted himself into a box on this one," a Maryland prison official says. "The Prison Litigation Reform Act really captures the national view of how people feel about prisons." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Meanwhile, Maryland corrections officials remain in a tense standoff with federal officials over the future of Supermax. Unfortunately, they can't look to the Prison Litigation Reform Act for relief; it spares states the tyranny of liberal federal judges and litigious inmates, but not federal regulators.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<a href="http://www.senate.gov/~hatch/">Senator Orrin Hatch</a>, one of the authors of the Act, recently decided to try the direct approach: He appealed to the Clinton administration to drop its insistence that inmates at Supermax have a constitutional right to fresh air. "Many, if not all, of the murderers in this group are lucky to be breathing indoor air at all," the senator says, "which is more than their victims are doing right now."

<h2>A Solution Waiting to be Adopted</h2>
<b>by Charmaine Crouse Yoest</b>

</center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
        <font size="+1">W</font>hen 48-year-old Hillary Rodham Clinton confessed to <i>Time</i> magazine recently that she wanted to adopt a child, it set off a small tempest of controversy. Her comment was hailed by supporters as evidence of her bona fides as a child advocate and decried by detractors as yet another reincarnation of the First Lady as First Mother. Some dismissed the remark as an effort to minimize the fallout from her husband's veto of the bill to ban partial-birth abortions. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Interpretations aside, the incident highlights the unique position adoption occupies in our political firmament. Although many in the adoption community wish it were otherwise, adoption is closely tied to the abortion question. And as abortion politics grow more heated, adoption demands attention as the nearest thing to middle ground in a polarizing issue.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But adoption is enmeshed in politics of its own. It continues to suffer from the controversy over transracial placements and from the bureaucratic delays of the foster-care system. President Clinton, for example, says he will support a House bill that would prohibit states from denying adoptions based on race, but the proposal faces intense opposition from special interest groups attached to the Democratic Party. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This complex issue has two sides: infant adoption and adoption out of foster care. For many years now, only 1 to 2 percent of women faced with unwanted pregnancies have made adoption plans. At the same time, the number of couples waiting to adopt is usually estimated at around 2 million. The tragic paradox is that while many families desperately wait for children, many children wait for families. According to the Institute for Children, state welfare agencies have adoption plans for 100,000 foster-care children nationwide, and 50,000 are legally free to be adopted but are languishing in foster care.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The National Association of Black Social Workers has for years decried adoption of black infants by white families as "racial genocide." Accepted social-work practice holds that a child be held in foster care until an "appropriate" -- read "racially correct" -- family is found. This sometimes occurs even when a white family is waiting to adopt a particular minority child. In theory, race-matching of infants and adoptive parents makes sense; in practice, it means that minority children in some states typically wait two to three years longer for new homes than white children.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Meanwhile, children are often trapped in foster care by the false hopes of the "family preservation" philosophy. With misguided compassion, social workers and judges work to preserve families broken apart by drug addiction and physical abuse, when the children need loving, stable homes. Moreover, the foster-care system is sustained by monetary incentives to keep children in care: Federal money comes into the system based on each day a child stays in foster care. The hurdles to get a child into a permanent adoptive home are high, while the incentives are low. As a result, children can drift in the system for years, waiting for the elusive "family reunification."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Eva is one of those children. She last saw her biological mother 10 years ago, when she was eight. Her biological father is not involved in her life in any way. But 1996 was a year of exciting milestones for Eva. She graduated from high school, and a court finally approved her adoption by her long-term foster parents. It took the law a long time to sanction the family they'd already formed--eight and a half years ago.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Why the delay? Eva's biological father refused to consent to the adoption. Eva wants her story told because it isn't over. Her two younger brothers have been living in a residential placement center for nearly nine years, even though her new family would like to adopt them as well. Compassion and common sense say yes; red tape says no. Eva's story is much too common. The time that children spend in foster care before their situations are resolved can be excruciatingly long. Ten percent of children in foster care stay more than 7.4 years. And the number of children in state care keeps increasing. Between 1982 and 1992, the number rose 69 percent, from 262,000 children to 442,000.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Behind the statistics are thousands of Evas yearning for homes. Fortunately, reform is in the air. Frustration with lengthy stays in foster care, rising incidents of child abuse, and concern over persistently high abortion rates are helping to focus renewed attention on adoption. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Various efforts -- by private groups, state governments, and Congress--aim to reform the system to let needy children connect with a loving family. The following are some recent initiatives:<p><b>The Texas Model</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Texas governor George W. Bush presides over one of 10 states in which 75 percent of the nation's foster-care population resides. Texas currently has 12,000 children in foster care, of whom 1,400 are available for adoption. But even the children ready for permanent homes may face a long journey: It usually takes the state two years after termination of parental rights to place these children in permanent adoptive homes. Most important from a child's view, foster care itself is a pretty bumpy ride: children average four different placements before they get a permanent adoption.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The 1996 annual report of the Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory Services found that, since 1991, the average length of stay for children who were ultimately adopted was 40.8 months. It took 15 months to terminate parental rights after entering foster care, another 18 months to be placed for adoption, and another seven months to finalize the adoption.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 	Bush wants to cut the time kids spend in foster care in half, and has established the Governor's Committee to Promote Adoption to help make Texas a model of adoption reform. The 13-person committee includes several adoptive parents, pastors, and representatives of private adoption efforts such as One Church and One Child. It is due to hand the governor a report in September identifying state policies that hinder adoption. State adoptions, for example, are subject to challenge up to two years after the finalization of the adoption decree -- leaving families and children in a legal limbo.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	So far the committee has targeted two areas for reform: judicial and administrative. Beverly Jimmerson,  Policy Advisor to the governor, notes that courts waste a lot of time when they fail to schedule prompt hearings concerning a child's adoption status. In addition, the committee has discovered that state agencies providing social services to adults fail to prioritize parents who need mental services or addiction treatment. Parents may wait months, or even years, for treatment while their children languish in foster care. The committee's goal is to propose a legislative reform agenda for the 1997 legislative session. <p><b>Kids and the Race Card</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A significant reason for adoption delays in Texas and other states is the ongoing debate over leaving minority children in foster care until suitable minority parents can adopt them -- even though white families are willing and able to take the children in. That battle is now being waged in Washington in the form of the Adoption Promotion and Stability Act. The bill, which passed the House and remains in Senate committee, proposes three significant policy changes:
<ul><li><b>	Give a $5,000 tax credit to middle-class families that adopt children.</b> The bill provides a tax credit for families with income under $75,000 to offset their expenses in adoption. Agency fees, court costs, and attorney fees can create an insurmountable hurdle for many families that might otherwise be able to adopt.<p>
<li><b>	Prohibit the practice of denying adoptions based on race.</b> The goal is to stop state agencies from using racial considerations to delay or prevent adoption of children under their care. In 1994, former senator Howard Metzenbaum shepherded to passage the Multi-Ethnic Placement Act to eliminate racial barriers to adoption. In designing regulations to implement the bill, the Department of Health and Human Services under Secretary Donna Shalala essentially nullified its race-neutral intent.<p>
<li><b>	Amend the Indian Child Welfare Act to prevent tribes from nullifying adoptions.</b> The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), a federal law passed in 1978, grants Indian tribes the legal standing to contest the adoption of any baby with any Indian ancestry. At the time, the law was necessary to halt unethical adoption practices that preyed on Indian babies. But the act, which assigned the tribe a legal interest in the child "on a parity with the interest of the parents," has strayed into reverse racism. 
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A current Ohio adoption case illustrates how convoluted and damaging this mindset can be. The Rost family adopted two twin girls. Subsequently, the birth-grandmother decided she wanted the babies. Grandparents do not have standing to contest an adoption; under the ICWA, Indian tribes do. The grandmother then retroactively enrolled herself, her son, and the twins in the Pomo Tribe of California. The tribe is now contesting the adoption on the grounds that three of the twins' 32 great-great-great-grandparents were Pomo Indian. Courts have previously decided that as little as one-256th of Indian blood (that's one great-great-great-great-great-great-grandparent) qualifies a case for consideration under the ICWA.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The ramifications for adoption could be enormous. Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado informed the Senate Indian Affairs Committee that, although there are just over a million people officially enrolled in tribes, at least 15 million Americans can claim Indian ancestry. Echoing the National Association of Black Social Workers, Congressman Don Young of Arkansas told the committee that adoption of Indian children outside the tribe amounted to "a form of brain drain and genocide." While adults argue over rights and racism, children are the ones who wait and suffer.<P>

<b>Casey Goes to Bat for Kids</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

A new private project to promote both infant adoption and adoption out of foster care is the Fund for the American Family, founded last summer by former Pennsylvania governor Robert Casey. A prominent pro-life Democrat, Casey is marshaling his political clout to raise the profile of adoption, which he believes is a cornerstone in rebuilding the American family. He is lobbying heavily on adoption reform and recently testified before Congress in support of the adoption tax credit.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Making adoption a national priority is one of the group's top four projects. It has already sponsored two adoption summits, bringing together leading experts to discuss ways of breaking down the barriers to adoption. Casey expects to publish a set of reform proposals this fall to spur state and federal officials to reform the system.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"Our goal is to see 100,000 adoptions each year for the next five years," up from 50,000, says Chris Casey, the executive director of the fund. To realize this goal, Casey is trying to bring together all 50 governors for a summit similar to the 1989 governor's conference on education.

<b>A Memo for Reform </b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In 1993, the Cambridge-based Institute for Children began Assignment Adoption to change foster-care and adoption practices in all 50 states. In the first 12 months after Massachusetts governor William Weld signed on to the initiative, adoptions from foster care increased by about 47 percent. The Institute is now working with Texas governor George Bush and recommended to his Adoption Committee the following plan for reform:<p>1. Make foster care a truly temporary form of caring for vulnerable children; enact policies and practices that have as their goal a 12-month maximum stay for children in substitute care. <p>2. Grant biological parents no more than 12 months to prove their fitness to resume custody of their children.<p>3. Give biological fathers 30 days from the birth of the child to formalize paternity, or forfeit the right to contest adoption.<p>4. Prohibit any race-based delays in adoption.<p>5. Terminate parental rights for abandoned children after 30 days, and allow them to be adopted through a private agency--without placement in long-term foster care.<p>6. Find adoptive homes for children within 30 days after the termination of parental rights or contract the process out to a private agency.<p>7. Make entrance requirements for foster families as stringent as those for adoptive families.<p>8. Hold the state Department of Human Services accountable for reporting its progress in finding homes for children in foster care.<p>9. Encourage private-sector involvement in improving components of the substitute-care system.

<h2>Who Owns the Sidewalks?</h2>
<b>Stephen Goldsmith</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
        <font size="+1">I</font>t does not take a legal scholar to recognize that transferring authority to the federal government undermines the whole constitutional structure designed by our Founders. Few realize that this shift is also destroying local self-government in towns and cities all across America.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Ours is a national government whose only powers are those delegated to it by the people. These powers are enumerated and therefore limited by the Constitution, the <a href="http://lcweb2.loc.gov/const/bor.html">Tenth Amendment</a> of which specifies that "the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the People." Jefferson called the doctrine of reserved powers "the foundation of the Constitution" and said that "to take a single step beyond the boundaries thus specially drawn . . . is to take possession of a boundless field of power, no longer susceptible of any definition." The resulting federalist system meant that most political activity in America would occur at the local and state level, rather than at the federal level. <p><table width="160" align="left" cellpadding="4">
<tr>
<td>
<hr width=75><Font FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva" COLOR="blue"><h3>By usurping local authority, the federal government undermines  the Constitution and destroys self-government</h3></font>
<hr width=75></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Today, of course, the opposite is true. Over the course of the 20th century, the federal government has vastly grown in size and power. This expansion occurred largely because Congress, with the acquiescence of the Supreme Court, has long acted beyond its authority and outside the limited powers granted to it. The Tenth Amendment has become, in the eyes of the Supreme Court at least, "but a truism."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But my complaints are more practical than theoretical. Never before have local authorities exercised less control over local life. Federal judges run our jails, bus our children, manage our schools, determine the rights of municipal employees, detail the conditions under which art can be displayed on city property, and the list goes on. The weakening of the Tenth Amendment directly and unduly circumscribes my authority, as the mayor of a large American city, to perform my legitimate duties. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Several recent statutes, in my opinion, are in clear violation of the Tenth Amendment. Consider the Americans with Disabilities Act. Although it was passed with good intentions, the ADA mandates compliance with some of the most minutely detailed specifications ever issued by Congress. Under this statute, we are now negotiating with the Justice Department the precise angle of slope on sidewalk ramps we want to construct for the wheelchair-bound. If we don't even control our sidewalks anymore, what exactly is left of local authority? What Congress views as "good deeds" often undermine both the principles of federalism and the value inherent in a government that is close to the voter. By mandating another set of federal laws, the much heralded Motor Voter Act denies states and local authorities discretion in how best to register their own voters. And it all but orders the use of local tax dollars to achieve this federal objective.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Perhaps the most pestiferous offender is the federal judiciary itself. A recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling had the effect of extending the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act to state and local governments. This decision raised eyebrows among even the most liberal interpreters of constitutional law. FLSA rates do little more than "protect" our cities' strongest unions by mandating generous overtime rates and work weeks. (I was recently sued by a police captain I had prosecuted for theft back when I was the D.A.; he argued that his punishment entitled him to overtime pay.) The practical effect of this ruling is that nonfederal units of government must negotiate employee compensation and overtime rates in the fashion that Congress demands--however minute the level of detail.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	American tax policy is being increasingly decided by unelected federal judges, rather than by elected local representatives. By delving even deeper in state and local matters, federal courts are increasingly mandating nonfederal tax hikes by requiring things like new prison construction or huge property-tax increases to pay for federal social experiments like forced busing. The first time an unelected authority in a faraway place imposed taxation without representation on this country, our forefathers declared independence from England.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Yet, despite our best chance in a generation to right this constitutional wrong, conservatives have focused their collective energies on preventing unfunded mandates. Although unfunded mandates allow Congress to avoid tough decisions, this crusade misses the point. Let's concentrate on reducing the federal government, not making sure its excesses are well funded.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Disregard for the Tenth Amendment endangers the very notion upon which the whole American experiment is based. If the design of the Framers is to survive into the next century -- if local authority is to be preserved in the face of an ever-expanding national government -- the federal government's focus must be readjusted to concentrate on its national role and purpose. Weaving the limited government principles of the Tenth Amendment back into the basic fabric of American politics is a good place to start.

<h2><i>Convention Policy Watch<br>
Day 1</I></h2><br>
by <a href="/heritage/cyberbio.html">Karen Czarnecki Miller</a><br>
Monday,  August 12, 1996
</center>
<P>
     Day 1 at the Republican National Convention, and I can assure you that there is a flurry of activity in and around the floor, around San Diego, and at just about every event hosting Members of Congress, state delegations, a variety of Governors, and every other VIP. What's interesting is seeing events unfold, and
then watching the convention coverage to see what the "spin" happens to be... Yesterday when I visited
with Vice President Quayle and other former colleagues, I learned that the "spin" in which the media had
the most interest was what happens now to VP Quayle now that Jack Kemp is the Republican VP
candidate. The question was: Does Quayle have a future as President? Has he been supplanted as the
future contender of the Republican Party? 
<p>
Perhaps the media should stop trying to find examples of future friction among the Republicans and focus on the issues the Republicans are trying to discuss -- hope, opportunity and economic prosperity for all Americans Any thoughts? I'll be back tomorrow to follow up.

<h2><i>How Has Republican Stewardship Changed the Way Washington Works?</i></h2>
<b>by <a href="/heritage/cyberbio.html">Karen Czarnecki Miller</a></b>
</center>
<P><font size="+1">A</font>fter roughly 40 years of Democrat control of Congress, how has the Republican stewardship changed the way Washington works?  You be the judge.  Thus far ...
<p><ul>
<li>	Over <b>270 federal programs have been eliminated</b> during this budget session -- at a <b>savings to taxpayers of $23 billion</b> for 1995.
<p>
<li>	<b>30 of 39 federal agencies</b> had <b>smaller staffs</b> as a result of Congressional action.  
<p>
<li>	Projections for 1996 indicate that we now have the <b>lowest federal deficit in 14 years.</b>
<p>
<li>	The <b>first-ever U.S. employee buyout</b> will occur this year in July.  The function currently performed by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to do background investigations for federal workers will now be turned over to those who do the job on a contract basis.
<p>
<li>	The budget for the <b>National Endowment for the Arts</b> has been <b>cut by 39%</b> over last year's budget.  In January, the agency laid off 85 workers.
<p>
<li>	The budget for the <b>National Endowment for Humanities</b> was <b>reduced by 35%</b> -- more than under Ronald Reagan.
<p>
<li>	<b>Four major privatization efforts have been approved</b> -- the last time this was tried only two were approved.
</ul><P>
	The Minority Leadership in the US House and Senate is trying to persuade the American people that this is a "do-nothing" Republican Congress.  In my opinion, they certainly are doing something, in fact, many things.  The defenders of the old status-quo cannot sit back on their laurels anymore.  They have to have real and honest debate now about the issues before them.  Isn't it nice to know they are earning an honest dollar?

<title> Feminism at its Finest.... Heritage</title>

<h2><i>Feminism at its Finest....</I></h2>
by <a href="/heritage/cyberbio.html">Karen Czarnecki Miller</a><br>June, 1996</center><P>
	On Tuesday <b>Betty Friedan</b> participated in an interesting panel discussion entitled "The Collapse of Marriage" at ... believe it or not ... the Heritage Foundation! Friedan, the co-founder of the National Organization of Women, the National Women's Political Caucus, and NARAL, gained national prominence after the 1963 publication of her book <I>The Feminine Mystique</I>.  She is currently a Guest Scholar at the Wilson International Center, and her remarks here at Heritage left us with some notable quotables that show that conservatives were right about marriage and family after all.
<p>	
She said....
<p><ul>
<li>"We made a mistake with no fault divorce."  There are unexpected economic consequences and decreases in living standards for women and children.<p>

<li>We have conducted "enough studies that show that divorce is not good for kids."<p>
<li>In a seminar she currently is teaching she claims, "You are not a real man if you have kids and don't take care of them."
<p></ul>
	According to Friedan, she now concentrates on reframing family values in light of economic realities.  Isn't it nice to see another advocate jumping on Dan Quayle's family values' bandwagon?  She thinks we should look at the economic consequences of government policy for women and children -- a step in the "right" direction.  Did you ever think one of the founders of the modern feminist movement would make such an about face?  And at Heritage?

<title>The Presidential Race and the Role of the First Lady - Heritage</title>

<h2><i>THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE AND THE ROLE OF THE FIRST LADY</I></h2>
by <a href="/heritage/cyberbio.html">Karen Czarnecki Miller</a><br>
April, 1996</CENTER><P>
	Both Elizabeth Dole and Hillary Clinton represent a new kind of First Lady - independent, successful, and ambitious.   Laura Blumenfeld of the <I>Washington Post</I> claims that the traditional First Lady role is to stay out of politics, promote do-good projects, and smile.  But, that was then and this is now.  Hillary Clinton's active role was highlighted nationally when her "partner" named her head of the Health Care Task Force - at a cost to taxpayers of $14 million.  On the other hand, Elizabeth Dole intends to raise some $60 <b>billion</b> dollars for charitable organizations.  This is quite a difference from past First Ladies, and quite a contrast between the two front-running contenders.
<P>
	According to Representative Scott Klug (R-WI), the role of the First Lady will be "redefined in the next few years."  He's right. Barbara Bush was the last of a generation - the archetype of the grandmotherly, sophisticated hostess is gone.  She was a very strong lady, but was only interested in promoting her husband.  Her polls were always high because she avoided partisan politics, and issue debate.  Enter Hillary!
<P>	
On the campaign trail in 1992, Bill Clinton quipped "buy one, get one free."  Hillary was voted "Most Likely to Succeed" in high school, selected graduation speaker at Wellesley, and graduated from Yale Law School.  She served as a partner in the now infamous Rose Law Firm as well as held countless board positions from Wal-Mart to the Children's Defense Fund.
<p>
	Hillary's role model as First Lady is (not surprisingly) Eleanor Roosevelt.  But Hillary has gone beyond Eleanor's "pet" issues; she affects day-to-day policy and strategy.  She moved her office from the ceremonial East Wing to the working West Wing, and when Bill Clinton wanted Health Care reform, he turned to Hillary.
<P>	
But what is known of Mrs. Dole?  Here's a sampling of her personality and background.  Now, you can judge which type of First Lady you'd like at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
<p>	
Elizabeth Dole is, as some say, the finest candidate in the race for President this year.  Many pundits have asked why she is not running herself instead of the Senate Majority Leader. At his victory rallies, she interacts exceptionally well with the crowd practically pushing him to follow her lead.  Her credentials are very impressive and speak for themselves.
<p>
	She can speak energetically and passionately about Bob's issues without any prompting or notes.  She has a warmth and southern charm to her that earned her the nickname "Sugar Lips" during the Reagan Administration.  In a 1983 <I>Business Week</I> article, Elizabeth Dole was compared to Jackie Kennedy as "a glamorous, feminine presence draped on a frame of steel." 
<p>
	As for her career, she has served as a Federal Trade Commissioner, the Secretary of Labor under Reagan,  the Secretary of Transportation under Bush, and is currently the President of the American Red Cross.  She has taken a leave of absence from the Red Cross to campaign for her husband.  When she did that in 1988, Peter Jennings declared that one of America's finest women in government was leaving.  
<p>
	Elizabeth intends to continue working as First Lady - she would be the first First Lady to keep a career.  Her answer to this country's problems is community and charitable organization, not bureaucratic task-forces.
<P>
	She has told <I>Ladies Home Journal</I> that she will lead a move to increase giving to churches, non-profits, and other charitable organizations by one percent, which translates into $62 billion dollars more going to those who are actually solving America's problems.  
<p>
	Both women represent the future of the First Lady; they are career-oriented and bright.  They still are devoted to their husbands, and to a large degree sacrifice their own potential successes for their men.  Both also have been accused of being the brains, the heart, or the masterminds behind their husbands' career.  Although they are, and would be, "working" First Ladies, Hillary is unpopular.  Liddy is not.
<p>
	The First Lady now represents America's working women who have to balance home, family, work, and career.  Hillary broke the mold, but who will get to expand and develop the role for the next four years?  What do you think?  Has Hillary set a good standard for those to come?  Has she improved or hurt the image of the First Lady?

<h2><i>TIME TO TEACH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION A LESSON</I></h2>
	<P>
by <a href="/heritage/cyberbio.html">Karen Czarnecki Miller</a><br>
April, 1996</CENTER><P>
	Last week, 40 of the nation's governors met in Palisades, NY to discuss our educational system for the first time in seven years.  Louis Gerstner, the chairman of IBM, and host of the summit declared, "Our educational system is broken."  And education today is an issue on the minds of voters.  According to a recent Gallup poll, education is the top priority voters have in choosing whether or not to support a candidate.  
<p>
	The summit was intended to push higher standards for core subjects from within the states, but the bigger issue that the governor's are not discussing is the future of the <a href="http://www.ed.gov">Department of Education</a>.
<p>	All of the GOP candidates for President last fall supported the elimination of the Department of Education.  From Dole to Gramm to Buchanan to former Secretary of Education Alexander, the GOP insisted that education was the responsibility of parents and localities.  Here are some interesting historical points about the evolution and role of the Department of Education -- and reasons why its elimination is on Congress' radar screen.
	<P>
<b>...IN THE BEGINNING</b>
<p><ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.ed.gov">Department of Education</a> was created in 1979 not long after another useless department, the Department of Energy.  Speaker Tip O'Neill demanded "We need a <b>special</b> department of Education."  He then got his wish, but has it worked?  Has our educational system improved?</ul>
	<p>
<b>RESULTS?</b>
<p><ul>
<li>In 1978, 8% of 8th graders failed to complete high school.  Enter the DOE.  Just in the nick of time, too.  In 1992, that percentage has <b>increased</b> to 12.
	</ul><p>
<b>	RED TAPE ELIMINATION?</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Representative Frank Horten (R-NY) stated, "It  [The DOE] does not create a new education bureaucracy.  In fact, it reduces bureaucracy."  Hold on, creating a cabinet department makes less red tape?  According to the Tax Foundation, the Department of Education spends out over 350 million dollars a year for  <b>internal management</b> alone.
</ul><p>
<b>	LOVE HURTS</b>
<p><ul>
<li>But you and I on the outside cannot see the good that results from the day-to-day operation of insiders within the department.  Not exactly.  The two most prominent former Secretaries of Education, Bill Bennett, and Lamar Alexander, have testified in front of Congress that the DOE produces, "bad ideas, harmful practices, needless expenditures, obsolete programs, and dysfunctional regulation."</ul><p>
	
<b>MICROMANAGEMENT FROM BIG BROTHER</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Virginia Governor George Allen claims that, "our recent experience suggests that concerns about federal bureaucratic interference cannot be lightly dismissed."  He is referring to a lawsuit that he is involved in against the Department of Education.  The lawsuit hinges around whether or not a local school can expel a "special" student with excessive behavioral problems.
	</ul><p>
<b>ALERT THE PRESS: SCHROEDER AGREES WITH US</b>
<p><ul>
<li>This issue has never been a conservative/liberal coalition-builder, but even Pat Schroeder claims, "The Department of Education will meddle in <b>everything</b>."  And it has Ohio Governor George Voinovich claims the Department of Education's management is "highly prescriptive and heavily regulated."  
</ul><p>
<b>	STRINGS-ATTACHED MONEY</b>
<p><ul>
<li>The claim is that the feds do so much for education that they have a right to interfere with you idea of how your children should be educated - after all, aren't the feds paying the bills?  Try again.  According to the <I>National Journal</I>, however, <b>less than 10%</b> of education money comes from the federal government.  The Department of Education's programs are as former Rep. Bob Michel said so "irrelevant to the needs of American children," that school districts in a quarter of the states have refused federal funds to avoid implementing federal mandates, according to Citizens for a Sound Economy. Governor Allen suspects that the US government costs local schools more in regulation than it spends on the schools.
	</ul><p>
	The Department of Education stands in the way of real education reform and school choice.  Bob Dole says, "Put parents back in charge of our schools."  He's right about this.  According to Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson, education is "a local issue, and it must remain a local issue."  For those of you who still like the DOE, could you answer a question that former Senator S.I. Hayakawa asked at the inception of the DOE.  "How [does] this department make our children literate?"  It does not.

<h2><i>The Energizer Secretary: She keeps going, and going...</h2></i>
<P>
by <a href="/heritage/cyberbio.html">Karen Czarnecki Miller</a><br>
March, 1996


</CENTER>

<P>

	Hazel O'Leary has been embroiled in scandal after scandal since she became Secretary of the <a href="http://www.doe.gov">Department of Energy</a> under President Clinton, but it may finally catch up with her as a <a href="http://www.house.gov/commerce/o&i.htm">House Commerce subcommittee</a> begins to expand its probe of O'Leary's activities as Secretary.<p>
	I hope to give you a quick run-down on some of the allegations against Madame Secretary, but it is by no means a complete list, as Representative Joe Barton (R-TX)  has said, "the more information we obtain, the more potential problems we appear to be uncovering." <p>
	<b>The so-called Mission of The Department of Energy</b> (see <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1061.html">Backgrounder 1061</a>, "How to Close Down the Department of Energy")<p>
<ul>
<li> Since the Department was created in 1977, it has struggled to find its proper role or mission after the initial energy crisis of the '70's.<p>
<li>Representative Joe Barton does not &quot;really see a mission for the DOE&quot;<p>
</ul>
                                <b>Travel: Around the World in 130 Days</b><p>
<ul>
<li> O'Leary has spent over <b>130 days abroad</b> on 16 trips.
<p>
<li> On two of those trips, she was accompanied by over 50 aides, on another by 48 aides -- well over the number taken by previous Secretaries of Energy or even Secretaries of State!<p>
<li> Her four main missions have cost the taxpayers $2.6 million<p>
<li> She has upgraded from business to first class on 9 flights, and also made use of Madonna's favorite charter plane, the MGM Grand, on three occasions - when cheaper airfare was available.<p>
<li> O'Leary caused dismay last year when she arrived at a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency with 38 aides -- not exactly &quot;fiscal austerity.&quot; -- previous Secretaries have taken 2 or 3 aides to similar meetings.<p>
<li> O'Leary claims that these trips brought in $27.7 billion dollars in new business, yet  Rep. Barton has said &quot;we cannot document a single case where the trip itself resulted in a contract that would not have been signed otherwise.&quot;
</ul>	
                                           <p>
<b> O'Leary's Media Consultant</b><p>
<ul>
<li>The DOE spent some $46,000 on a of media coverage study by Carmen International.  The result was a ranking of journalists and coverage of the DOE -- it was accused of being an &quot;enemies list&quot;.<p>
</ul>
<b>	The Department of Energy's New Logo</b><p>
<ul>
<li> O'Leary spent over $10,000 in a search for a trendier design for the DOE logo according to <i>Time</i> magazine.  She decided however not to make the move after she found out the cost would be over $1.7 million for the switch -- Hazel O'Leary, the poster child of financial restraint.<p>
</ul>
<p>	
            <b>  O'Leary Takes on the Military</b><p><ul>
<li>Going against a Cold War tradition, O'Leary released the location of over 111.4 metric tons of plutonium that was until now considered to be of extreme national security importance<p></ul>
<p><b>	Friends in Low Places</b><p>
<ul>
<li>O'Leary has also gotten in trouble according to the National Journal for overpaying a department ombudsman who happened to be a personal friend
</ul>
There have been Secretaries in every Cabinet embroiled in some sort of scandal, but the Clinton cabinet claimed to be different. Yet Agriculture's Secretary Espy and Treasury's Deputy Secretary Roger Altman are already gone and O'Leary and Commerce Secretary Ron Brown are under heavy fire.  O'Leary said it best herself &quot;sometimes we have to ... come to work as if you did not need a job.&quot;  Well for your sake, I hope you don't.<p>

<h3>The Non-Farmer's Guide to Agriculture Reform</h3>
<P>
by <a href="/heritage/cyberbio.html">Karen Czarnecki Miller</a><br>
March, 1996</center><p>Both houses of Congress have passed legislation, dubbed the Freedom to Farm Act, that would open up the American agricultural market by eliminating governmental interference.  The two versions of the bill will now go to a conference committee.  But what exactly is involved in this legislation and what needs to be changed in the conference committee?
<p>
<b>Why do we need Agriculture reform?</b> 
<p><ul>
<li>To take advantage of the substantially lower trade barriers GATT has created -  a new marketplace of 6 billion people.
<p>
<li>To make agricultural markets respond to the demand of the marketplace, not the demand of central government planning
<p>
<li>To breath new life into the rural economy and agricultural infrastructure
<p>
<li>To take advantage of our natural resource edge, and use all productive land to our nation's economic benefit 
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; See <a href="/heritage/library/categories/enviro/bg1002.html">Backgrounder 1002</a>, "Freeing U.S. Agriculture to Take Advantage of the New Global Markets" for more information.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; What's so wrong with the <b>current system?</b>
<p><ul>
<li>The current system removes 15% of US acreage from production - if used that acreage could add $8 billion to gross farm income according to a 1994 report by the National Grain and Feed Foundation.
<p>
<li>American government-inflated prices make American exports the last products to be bought -- the "residual supplier."
<p>
<li>Restrictive agricultural policy during the 1980's watched worldwide consumption go up from 3.258 billion metric tons to 3.815 billion metric tons from 1982 to 1990.  Yet US exports went down from .187 billion metric tons to .176 during that same time.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; What is the difference between the <b>House HR 2854</b> and <b>Senate S 1541?</b> See <a href="/heritage/library/categories/enviro/ib221.html">Issue Bulletin 221</a>, "Agriculture Reform, Can House Succeed Where Senate Failed?"
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; House Agriculture Chairman Pat Roberts (R-KS) called this legislation the mark of a "new direction"
<p>
<b>BOTH:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Replace subsidies for wheat, grains, cotton, and rice with fixed declining payments through 2002<p>
<li>Eliminate the Acreage Reduction Program (ARP) -  a program that along with the CRP removes 15% of all US farmland acreage from production.
<li>Put agriculture on a market orientated system
<p>
<li>Reauthorize the sugar and peanut provisions<p>
<li>Eliminate Farmer-Owned Reserve, which currently allows the government to control large stocks of surplus grain and dump them on the market in order to drive down commodities prices.<p>
<li>Allow farmers the freedom to decide what, where, and how to plant
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The <b>House bill</b> differs in that it:
<p><ul>
<li>Creates a commission to study future role of government in agriculture<p>
<li>Includes $200 million in cleanup for the Everglades -- thanks to Speaker Gingrich
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The <b>Senate bill</b> differs in that it:
<ul><p>
<li>Includes food stamp provision<p>
<li>Provides 300 million dollars in rural development<p>
<li>Returns to current law in 7 years without further action
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Why is agricultural reform a priority?
<p><ul>
<li>Two million farmers are currently without federal guidelines as planting season starts.  Farmers do not know if they can plant what they wish or what the government wishes.<p>
<li>Farm policy will not be reassessed for another 4 to 5 years which would put us at a further disadvantage with other GATT nations
</ul><p>
What else should be included in the legislation?
<p><ul>
<li>A deep cut in CRP, which is only capped in both proposals.  CRP is the Conservation Reserve Program that was authorized in 1985.  The program is intended to remove land that is highly erodible from production by renting it from farmers for ten years.  But 22 out of the 36 million acres in CRP today are considered to be among the highest classes of land.  Only 4% of the land actually qualifies as highly erodible.    The cut should be from the current 36 million acres to at least 15 million acres.<p>
<li>Eliminates the three-entity rule, a loophole by which farmers can get twice the benefits they deserve.<p>
<li>Phase out the sugar and peanut provisions -- free the entire market<p>
<li>Pass this as a individual agriculture act, save food stamps for welfare reform legislation and save Everglades cleanup for environmental legislation.<p>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Heritage's <a href="/heritage/staff/fryden.htm">John Frydenlund</a> writes that "for sixty years, Washington has tried to manage US agriculture" like a welfare state.  The changes which end the government's manipulation of production for major crops is historic. However, Congress' failure to enact significant reform in the area of peanuts, sugar and dairy means that they will have to finish the task of reforming agricultural policy in the near future.

<h3><I>Notable Quotations from a Founding Father – Washington</I></h3>
<p>
by <a href="/heritage/cyberbio.html">Karen Czarnecki Miller</a><br>
February, 1996</center><p>

February 22 marked George Washington’'s 264th birthday, 
and in the past year a new political magazine has appeared on newsstands with 
Washington’s first name on its masthead.   Yet we rarely hear about Washington’s  
thoughts on government.  He is more symbol than man.  True, he is, “First in war, first in 
peace, and first in the heart’s of his countrymen,” but what did he intend for our current 
government?
<p>


&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not surprising, if you look at his presidential speeches, 
Washington does a good job of fleshing out the ideas upon which <a href="/heritage">Heritage</a> was founded in 1973: <b>free enterprise, limited 
government, traditional American values, and a strong national defense.</b>
<p>
<center><b>		George Washington on FREE ENTERPRISE</b></center>
<p><ul>
<li>In his farewell address, Washington said we should, “cherish public credit,” and we 
should avoid the “accumulation of debt.”  He backed a balanced budget -- before it was 
popular.<p>
<li>According to the European bankers handling American credit, during Washington’s 
tenure, our credit rating went from “bankrupt” to as high as any other European 
powers.<p>
<li>In private life in 1785, in conjunction with the Maryland and Virginia legislatures, 
Washington organized the Potomac River Canal Co., which was likely the first 
development company financed with private and public capital.<p>
<li>Concerning trade, in his farewell address, Washington said, “our commercial policy 
should hold an equal and impartial hand” to all nations.   
</ul><p>
<center>	<b>	George Washington on LIMITED 
GOVERNMENT</b></center>
<p><ul>
<li>Washington was a firm believer in the importance of checks and balances; he said in 
his farewell, we must “avoid the exercise of powers of one department to encroach upon 
another.”<p>
<li>He also was the first citizen-legislator, since he set the tradition of a two-term 
president.  He was “reluctantly drawn” into service from his home at Mt. Vernon, VA.
<p></ul>
<center><b>		George Washington on TRADITIONAL AMERICAN 
VALUES</b></center>
<p><ul>
<li>Washington said in his farewell, “Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to 
political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports.”<p>
<li>He also had a strong desire to protect future generations. We cannot “ungenerously 
throw upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear.”<p>
<li>In his inaugural address, he commented that there was “an indissoluble union 
between virtue and happiness; between duty and advantage.”<P>
 </ul>
<center><b>George Washington on STRONG NATIONAL DEFENSE</b></center>
<p>
<ul>
<li>In 1790, Washington claimed that “to be prepared for war is one of the most effectual
      means of preserving peace.” <p>
<li>In his first annual address (it was not called the State of the Union back then), 
Washington said, “A free people ought not only be armed, but disciplined.”
</ul><p>


&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Our founding father believed and supported the basic 
principles of Heritage in his most memorable and important speeches.  Next time you 
think of General Washington, think beyond the Gilbert Stuart painting to the ideas of our 
nation’s past, present, and future.

<center><h3>FLAT out throw them out: Part II</h3></center>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>It's time for sound policy, not sound bytes!</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	First, Steve Forbes and Dick Armey did not invent 
the flat tax this past year.  The flat tax has been around since 1981 when it was introduced 
by Dr. Robert E. Hall and Alvin Rabuska.  Early supporters surprisingly included current 
<b>White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta</b>.  
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Enough on the history lesson, <i>Washington 
Post</i> columnist Jim Glassman said that the press is to blame for much of the poor 
treatment of the flat tax.   So it is our responsibility on a personal level to educate our 
neighbors and associates about the flat tax since the media can't or won't.  Because with 
or without its current messenger Forbes, the flat tax will survive and dominate the future 
of tax reform discussions.  So it is important to get out the message on what the flat tax 
actually is and what its likely effects will be.
<p>
<b>Why everyone should love the flat tax -- the universal appeal...</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; It's <b>fair, simple, singular and pure</b>.
<P><ul>
<li>	<b>Equality</b> The government will no longer be able to pick winners and 
losers with the tax code because everyone will fill out the same postcard and play by the 
same rules.  Everyone will pay the same rate; if your neighbor makes 10 times as much as 
you do, he will pay 10 times as much.
<p>
<li>	<b>Simplicity</b> Go ahead and toss out all of those 600-odd IRS forms with 
the fine print in favor of a simple postcard that takes minutes, not days to fill out.  
<p>
<li>	<b>Singularity</b> No longer will your money be taxed three or four times.  
Under the current system,  each dollar you earn can be taxed up to four times including 
capital gains taxes, interest taxes, company taxes, and inheritance taxes.  
<p>
	The goal of the flat tax is to tax all income once.  It is possible that after all 
current taxes are paid on your original dollar, you may only have 20 cents left, according 
to Heritage's <a href="/heritage/staff/mitchell.htm">Dan Mitchell.</a> 
<P>
	 A result of the current loophole-filled tax code, only 11 percent of all income is 
taxed, according to the <a href="http://www.shoponline.com/ncpa/">National Center for 
Policy Analysis</a>.
<p>
<li><b>Purity</b> We cannot let any deduction beyond the personal allowance to be 
included in the proposal because once one deduction is allowed - interest groups will 
demand inclusion of their tax break.  This purity is necessary to keep the code fair and 
simple, as Heritage's Dan Mitchell wrote in <a 
href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi85.html">Why Liberals Should Support 
The Flat Tax</a>.
</ul><p>
<b>I keep hearing about the crisis surrounding the elimination of home mortgage 
interest.  What will happen to the housing market if we adopt a flat tax 
proposal?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Housing is a superior good; meaning that as the 
economy grows the housing market will grow accordingly.  Many of the numbers that 
have been raised in opposition to the flat tax were derived from a <a 
href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi87.html">study</a> done by 
DRI\McGraw-Hill, for the <b>National Association of Realtors</b>, that many experts 
say contains serious flaws. (See <a 
href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi87.html">Worst Case Scenario: Flat Tax 
Would Boost Home Values by 7 Percent or More</a> by William Beach and Dan 
Mitchell.)
<p> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	In the first place, only 22 percent of all homeowners 
use the deduction and a majority of them are wealthy.  When realtors were asked by 
Citizens for a Sound Economy what the most important factor is when buying a home, 
the top two answers were interest rates and down payment.  
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Great! The flat tax will drop interest rates and put 
more money into the taxpayers' pockets.  Also throw into consideration that without the 
capital gains tax, selling your house would give you more cash.  
<p>
<b>How are you so sure interest rates will fall?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The best example of what would happen is seen if 
you compare municipal bonds and taxable securities.  On average, the interest rate on 
municipal bonds is 1.3 % less than taxable securities, so by implementing a flat tax 
system that does not tax interest, interest rates should fall at least one percent.
<P>
<b>But no one will give to charity anymore without the deductions.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	That same argument was made in 1986 after the tax 
cuts, but 1988 was a record year for charity giving.  Only half of donations to charity are 
even deducted, and for the most part this country is a generous one.  The better off we as 
a country are, the more money will be given to charity.  
<p>
<b>All the flat tax will do is add to the deficit because the Treasury will experience 
a reduction in revenues.</b>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The three biggest annual gains in revenue to the 
treasury were experienced in the 1920's, 1960's, and 1980's, which were three eras of tax 
cuts.  Why?  First, the wealthiest individuals will be less inclined to use tax shelters or 
overseas investments to avoid high tax rates.  Revenues grew 4.8 percent under 
Kennedy's cuts, and 2.2 percent under Reagan's cuts, according to Dan Mitchell. 
 <p>
 
<b>But how much money does this mean will come into the economy?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	If the economy only grows one-half of one percent 
faster in ten years that will result in a difference of $5,000 dollars to each family.  The 
National Center for Policy Analysis reports that just raising the annual growth rate from 
2.5 to 3.3 percent will add $2.3 <b>trillion</b> dollars to the economy in 6 years.
<p>
<b>How come the rich do not have to pay money on dividends, when I work all 
week trying to get by and get taxed?</b>
 <p>
 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dividends currently are taxed twice -- once on the 
corporate level, and then again on the individual level.  The flat tax eliminates only the 
second tax, dividend checks are merely after-tax payments.  As it is now, those who 
receive those checks are taxed unfairly.
 <P>
<b>Has the flat tax worked anywhere, or is this just academic conjecture?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Hong Kong, one of the fastest growing economies 
in the world,  has a flat tax and a budget surplus.  Closer to home, the Joint Economic 
Committee found that in terms of real personal income growth from 1962 to 1994, states 
with flat tax systems on average grew 223%, while progressive tax systems grew only 
175%.  "Even when the initial move is revenue neutral, in the long run, government 
revenues are higher with the flat rate."
<p>
<b>What about the national sales tax?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The sales tax backed by Rep. Bill Archer (R-Tx.) 
and Sen. Richard Luger (R-Ind.) has many of the same benefits of the flat tax, but has one 
main drawback.  The transition from income to sales tax would be costly and difficult, 
and there also is the scary possibility of ending up with both systems.
<p>
<b>How can a flat rate help control government spending and balance the 
budget?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	According to the Tax Foundation, the Forbes plan 
would bring in around $300 billion dollars less in revenues for the first couple of years.  
Not so bad if you ask me, go ahead and cut spending to go along with the tax cut.  Or as 
Grover Nordquist said, "starve the beast."  
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Another idea that I like is possibly linking a yearly 
balanced budget with an annual flat tax rate.  Such a system proposed by Glassman 
makes sense.  If Congress wants to spend more in any given year then they will have to 
raise everyone's flat tax rate.  This would put pressure on Congress to cut spending more 
and more every year to lower tax rates.
<p>
<b>Someone told me this was a <i>progressive</i> flat tax...</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Under most of the current proposal there will be a personal 
allowance on approximately the first $30,000 made by a family of four.  After that 
deduction, each person pays the flat rate on any additional money.  The rich will pay 
more because the personal allowance is a smaller part of their total income.  So the rich 
will pay a higher rate than the middle class using a flat tax proposal, so some call it a 
<i>progressive</i> flat tax.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Tell anyone you see -- fill out a postcard yourself .  
It only takes minutes.  See how you do, and I think you will like what you see.  To get a 
copy of the postcard call 1-800 CSE-3CSE, or check out House Majority Leader 
Richard Armey's <a href="http://www.house.gov/armey.flattax/">Flat Tax Home 
Page</a>.   This issue does not have a catchy phrase or slogan to sell it to the public, and it 
will not need one if the public learns what the flat tax <i>is</i>.  
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	This is a <b>sound policy</b> for our future, not a 
<b>sound byte</b> for our TVs.

<h3>Issues '96:  FLAT OUT SEND THEM HOME</h3>
<p>
by <a href="/heritage/cyberbio.html">Karen Czarnecki Miller</a><br>
February, 1996</center><p> Election season's traditional kickoffs in Iowa and New 
Hampshire are within sight, so now might be a good time to look at the definitive issues 
of the upcoming election.  1994 was the year of downsizing, and, to an extent, 1992 was 
the year of the balanced budget.  On Wednesday, Representative Bill McCollum of 
Florida said this campaign would revolve around the flat tax and term limits.  
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;My next two columns will try to give you new insights into 
these two issues.  We know why we support term limits, but we don't always have the 
answers to our opponents' arguments.  So here are some questions to anticipate for the 
upcoming year and our answers to them.
<p><ul>
<li><b>The system already has a term limits provision -- it is called the election! 
</b> 
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Citizens can vote incumbents out of office, but 
challengers to incumbents face an uphill battle from the start.  Do you want to take on the 
name recognition, the franking privileges, the special interest support, and the fundraising 
capabilities of an incumbent?  	Probably not, and neither do a majority of qualified 
candidates.  Incumbents who choose to seek reelection almost always win (about 90% an 
election), so career legislators can stay in office as long as they choose.
 <p><ul>
<li><b>Term Limits is not the issue --  what we need is real campaign finance 
reform!</b>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Absolutely, but remember the PAC system was a 
reform measure in the first place enacted in the `70s that has led many to believe it is 
more of a problem than a solution.  
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	At a term limits conference on Wednesday, Senator 
Fred Thompson of Tennessee called term limits "the ultimate campaign finance reform 
vehicle."  Even if  lobbyists and congressmen are unwilling to restructure the financial 
side of campaigns, term limits offer a viable alternative.  
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	After winning reelection Senators would not have to 
worry, as Thompson said, about "raising another dime."  The result would be more 
challenger vs. challenger races which would decrease the cost to run for elected office as 
well as the influence of PACs.
<p><ul>
<li><b>If we enact term limits, all we do is give more power to Congressional 
staff.</b>
 </ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	An average staff member on the Hill lasts only 
about 5 to 6 years according to a Heritage study, the Hill staff takes direction from 
Congressman, not the other way around. 
<p> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	According to a majority of the Republican freshman 
that I have spoken to, they hired staff that was untrained in the ways of DC in an effort to 
limit the old-style perk system.  Most congressmen prefer to have staff members that 
think and support the views of the congressman and the district.  
<p><ul>
<li><b>In the past, term limits has been a minor issue - Why is this the year of term 
limits?</b>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The public opinion polls show up to 80% of citizens 
supporting some sort of term limits legislation.  That overwhelming support is bolstered 
by a growing group of organizations, like US Term Limits and Americans Back in 
Change, that on a grass-roots level are pushing for national and local reform.  
<p>
	&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; This year was the first year in which the 
Congressman actually voted on term limits.  Although talked about for years, this is the 
first election year that Congressman can be held accountable on the issue of term limits 
based on actual floor votes. 
<p><ul>
<li><b>Why term limits?</b>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Term limits are an effort to make Congressman 
realize that they are going to Washington temporarily, not making a career move.  We 
need Congressman who come to Washington with the citizen-legislator mentality  -  
"Let's get some things done and then get back home to our families."

<h3><i>Who's Vision of Governance Is America's Best Bet:  Federal Administrators 
v. Local Innovators? </i></h3>
<p>
<center>by <a href="/heritage/cyberbio.html">Karen Czarnecki Miller</a><br>
February, 1996<p>
 </center>Ever since the infamous Congressional elections of 1994, 
skeptics of the Republican Contract With America have claimed that lower taxes, less 
spending, fewer regulations, and genuine welfare reform sound like good ideas in theory, 
but they cannot be implemented in reality because they are too "tough" on the little guy -- 
the poor, the middle class, the "average" American.   At least, that's what they argue...and 
we all like to hear good arguments, don't we?   It's just that some of us, myself included, 
want them to back up their rhetoric with some really good examples of how their policies 
would be better at solving our nation's ills.  I, personally, take with a grain of salt, the 
economic advice of Harvard University-trained economists and well-meaning politicians.  
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; So, the question we must ask ourselves is:  DO THESE 
IDEAS REALLY WORK?  IF SO, WHEN HAVE THEY BEEN TRIED?    
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We need only to look so far as the states to realize what 
governors -- particularly Republican governors -- are doing on all these fronts.  
Republican governors now occupy 31 state houses across the country, and in these states 
we are seeing some new ways to address the same old problems.  
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In honor of the <b>upcoming Republican Governor's 
Association Annual Dinner being held in Washington on February 5</b>, I have 
listed some accomplishments of their administrations, showing that local innovations are 
better than overbearing federal usurpations.
<p>
<b>TAX CUTS</b>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  Republicans have always preached that lower tax rates 
yield an improved economy with more jobs.  Governors from New Jersey, Michigan, and 
New York have successfully put this philosophy into place.
<p><ul>
<li><b>Gov. Christine Todd Whitman</b> of New Jersey has created 110,000 new jobs 
with her  30% income tax cut enacted in 1994.
<p>
<li><b>Gov. John Engler</b> of Michigan has turned a $1.8 billion debt into a $1 billion 
surplus with much of the credit going to the 18 tax cuts he has implemented since he took 
office in 1990.
<P>
<li><b>Gov. George Pataki</b> of New York has reversed the high taxes of the Cuomo 
era in favor of a 25% income tax cut in 1995.  That move has many companies 
announcing that they will remain or even expand in the Empire State.
</ul><p>
<b>WELFARE REFORM</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  As legislators quibble over what the future of welfare will 
be on a national level in Washington, two rising Governors in Wisconsin and Michigan 
are already administrating revolutionary new approaches to welfare.
<p><ul>
<li><b>Gov. Tommy Thompson</b> of Wisconsin, through his "Wisconsin Works" 
program, hopes to completely replace Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) 
with a work-based system providing training and child care.  The <i>Los Angeles 
Times</i> called the plan "the biggest break from the traditional welfare system 
proposed anywhere."
<p>
<li><b>Gov. John Engler</b> of Michigan has also pushed through  a new welfare 
program that emphasizes self-sufficiency.  The <i>New York Times</i> simply noted 
that "the new program would be at once tougher on people who refuse to work and 
gentler on those who make an effort."
</ul><p>
<b>EDUCATION REFORM</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  The thrust of Republican reforms in education is to allow 
all parents, rich or poor, to be able to decide where their children attend school.  The hope 
is that the increased competition will improve the quality of education in both private and 
public schools.  Governors in Minnesota and Massachusetts have pushed for such reforms 
in their home states.
<P><ul>
<li><b>Gov. Arne Carlson</b> of Minnesota has given low-income parents of 
Minnesota a $3,000 education voucher to all families with an income below 130% of the 
poverty line.
<p>
<li><b>Gov. Bill Weld</b> of Massachusetts has begun the process of establishing 
charter schools that are designed to focus on one specific subject area.  Thus far 25 such 
schools have opened their doors to Massachusetts families.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; These are just a few examples of the revolutionary 
changes that are occurring in state houses across the nation.  Washington does not, and 
should not, have a monopoly on what's best for all citizens.  Programs that touch our 
daily lives are best administered at the local and state levels.  The REAL solutions to 
America's problems lie in the hands of the governors who are willing to take on and meet 
the difficult challenges without asking the federal nanny-state to step in and mind the 
store.

Facts are stubborn things.  I have always liked interesting facts or statistics that aren't readily 
available in the day-to-day news media.  Here's a good sample of what the <i>American Enterprise</i> 
magazine called the 1995 indicators.  It includes statistics that can "change the way you understand 
the world" -- how we vote, how we live, how we do business.
<p><p><ul>
<li><b>How Does Talk Radio Fare?</b>  The most popular radio format in the United States 
today is not the Talk Radio of Rush Limbaugh or the rock of Pearl Jam.  It is <b>country</b> with 
some 2,642 stations nationwide.
<li><b>Is Congress still a Country Club?</b> 27 Black Americans ran for Congress on the 
GOP ticket in 1994.
<li><b>Electoral Politics:</b>  According to the Republican polling firm The Wirthlin Group, a 
September 1995 survey showed that one third of American voters could <b>not recall</b> when 
the next presidential election would occur.
<li><b>Were the '80's the Decade of Greed or Prosperity?</b>  According to our U.S. 
Treasury Department, 86% of those who reported incomes in the bottom fifth in 1980 had moved 
<b>upwards</b> by 1988.  In fact, 16% of them made the jump all the way from the bottom to the 
<b>top income bracket</b>.
<li><b>Hillary and Health Care Costs:</b>  After a year of Hillary-style health care meetings, 
official documents show that the Clinton Health Care Task Force cost slightly more than the 
projected $100,000 dollars -- the tab was actually <b>$14 million.</b>
<li><b>The Republican Party Comes of Age:</b> Almost 65% of registered Republicans are 
<b>under the age of 45</b> according to a 1995 Gallup poll.
<li><b>NAFTA Results:</b>  As of November 1995, 70% of US corporations report that their 
businesses have <b>not been affected</b> by the implementation of NAFTA or GATT.
<li><b>Political Contributors:</b> Only 19% of individuals have ever contributed to a 
<b>political candidate</b> according to a 1995 Gallup poll.
<li><b>What's a political party, dad?</b> According to an August 1995 Gallup poll, in the last 
fifty-five years, nearly 1 of 5 Americans has deserted the traditional party structure -- Democrat 
or Republican -- to become: independent voters.
<li><b>Budget:</b> In the next seven years under the latest GOP plan, the government will spend 
<b>$12 trillion dollars</b> -- only 7% less than when the Democrats ran Congress under the 
direction of then-Speaker Tom Foley and then-Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell.
<li><b>Competition Is a Good Thing:</b>  According to a government study, the emergence of 
14 new discount airlines has saved consumers an average of <b>$100 dollars</b> per round trip 
airfare.
<li><b>TV Viewing:</b>  Nielson research data reports that the average American woman 
watches almost 4.5 hours of <b>t.v. per day</b>, while men average just short of 4 hours per day.
<li><b>The Cost of Bureaucracy:</b> 75% of the World Health Organization's $1 billion annual 
budget goes to salaries, and much of the remainder goes to conferences.

<h3>"First Principles in the Public Arena"</h3>
<b>By Governor John Engler</b><br>
<p>
Michigan Governor Engler delivered the first <a href="/heritage/kirk/kirklect.html">Russell Kirk Memorial Lecture</a> on Tuesday, September 26, 1995, at The Heritage Foundation, Washington D.C.
<p>

	This weekend, Michigan Republicans held a leadership conference on Mackinac Island. For all practical purposes, we met in honor of Dr. Russell Kirk. After listening to the various presidential candidates and to Speaker Gingrich, it was clear that many of the ideas Russell had written about since the 1950s not only had taken root, but had blossomed. He always said it took about 30 years for a new generation of ideas to enter the public arena--and in this, as in so much else, he proved right.
<p>
	I am honored to be in this redoubt of conservative thought to inaugurate the Russell Kirk Memorial Lectures. It is a humbling experience for me to stand in this auditorium, knowing that I follow in the footsteps of giants. Russell himself must have given some 60 lectures within these walls. In 1986, at a landmark Heritage event, President Reagan paid a wonderful tribute to the Sage of Mecosta, calling him a pillar of post-war conservative thought.
<p>
	Who could have foreseen it back in 1952, when Russell submitted a manuscript to Henry Regnery called <i>The Conservative Rout</i>? Strange as it may seem to us today, that was the original title Russell proposed for the classic the world would know as <i>The Conservative Mind</i>. Back in the early 1950s, Russell was concerned that there was not a more spirited defense of what he and T. S. Eliot called "the permanent things." But he never put his pen down in despair. Over the course of four decades, he wielded the "Sword of Imagination" against an "antagonist world" and gave new strength to conservative ideas.
<p>
	How the battle had turned at the close of the day, for Russell could see the makings of a liberal rout. One can only imagine what mordant comment he would have made about last November's historic elections and the resulting confusion and chagrin in the Liberal Mind, which more than a few are characterizing as brain-dead. Michigan's own Jack Kevorkian--otherwise known as Dr. Death--could be the poster boy of latter-day liberals.
<p>
	If you have ever been to St. Paul's Cathedral in London, you may have seen Sir Christopher Wren's tomb. Wren designed the cathedral and is buried there. On his tomb is an epitaph, which in translation reads, "If you seek my monument, look around you." I think that epitaph is apt for our purposes today, because if you seek a monument to Russell Kirk, look around  you.
<p>
	This foundation, this audience, and in significant ways this city, which today is becoming an epicenter of conservative policies and ideas, all bear Russell's mark. As Ed Feulner eulogized at last year's Memorial Mass in Russell's honor, the Sage of Mecosta "made a real impact on Washington. In a city of constant change, Kirk reminded opinion leaders, journalists, legislators, and staffers...of prudence and of taking the long view."
<p>
	Not just in Washington, but on both sides of the Atlantic, conservatives looked to Russell for inspiration and guidance. Closer to home, I sought his counsel as well. We both lived in central Michigan's "stump country," just two dozen miles from each other, and Russell was a trusted friend. He and Annette, whose hospitality is known around the world, always kept the door at Piety Hill open, not only for the refugee, the hobo, and the scholar, but also for a young legislator just out of college and eager to learn from Michigan's pre-eminent man of letters.
<p>
	I don't think Russell ever held public office except for a brief time as Justice of the Peace. He was, above all, a man of ideas. Yet he was wise to the nature of politics. He always used to say--and it's good advice to remember in Washington these days--that "politics is the art of the possible." The trick is not only to fight for reform, but to live to tell about it.
<p>
	As an aside, let me say that the Republican Party today has a great advantage over Democrats. It is conservative Republicans and their ideas that are driving the debate. And I think the more Americans get to know Republican ideas, the more they will vote for Republican candidates. But whatever their party affiliation, Russell had much to say to the men and women charged with the responsibility of governing. Nobody was more eloquent than Russell in defending what he called the "first principles" of conservative thought. At the center of these "first principles" is the apprehension that order, justice, and freedom are mutually dependent on one another.
<p>
	Another way Russell used to put it: For there to be order in society, there must be order in the soul--and vice-versa. You cannot have one without the other. So it is not just freedom, but ordered freedom that we must strive to preserve. Otherwise, the barbarians will come crashing through the gates.
<p>
	There are a number of first principles that Russell wrote about and that have been important to me as governor. What I would like to do today is tell you how I have tried to apply one of them in the public arena. It concerns the importance of community and the need to respect state and local government because they are closest to our communities.
<p>
	Here, as in so much else, Russell followed the lead of Edmund Burke. The great British statesman wrote that the true wellsprings of community are "the little platoons we belong to in society." By that quaint term, Burke was referring to the groups that we voluntarily seek to associate with and that give our lives meaning. Our church and alma mater, the professional and civic organizations to which we belong, the volunteer charities and friendships we seek out--these are the little platoons that enrich our lives and humanize our relations with one another.
<p>
	Russell early perceived that the centrifugal forces of modern times were tearing apart these little platoons, which are the fabric of our communities. He wrote:
<blockquote>
We have more voluntary organizations than has any other nation.... But it is tempting and easy to let centralized power assume the burdens which necessarily accompany the privileges of community.... I may add that this disintegration of community, and its supplanting by centralized authority, commonly have been accompanied by a proportionate decay of culture and morality.... A nation is no stronger than the numerous little communities of which it is composed.1</blockquote>	These words, though written some four decades ago, ring truer than ever today. They certainly resonate with Marvin Olasky's landmark work, <i>The Tragedy of American Compassion</i>, which I am sure Russell would have applauded. For in the court of public opinion, the verdict is in: We have seen the unintended consequences of a horrendous, $5 trillion experiment in centralized authority known as the Great Society. After three decades, even liberals are beginning to concede that the Great Society was neither great nor good for society.
<p>
	In one of his last Heritage lectures, Russell said that the centralizing tendency of the Great Society, combined with the centrifugal forces of modem times, had helped create "a mass of people who have lost...community, hope of betterment, moral convictions, habits of work, sense of personal responsibility, intellectual curiosity, membership in a healthy family, property, active participation in public concerns, religious associations, and awareness of the ends of human existence."2 How could this tragedy come about?
<p>
	At the diseased heart of the Great Society there evolved more than 300 welfare programs, a number of which rewarded ignorance, idleness, and illegitimacy--the absolute antithesis of the qualities you want a free citizenry to possess. These programs have worked untold mischief on the American republic.
<p>
	As many of you know, the welfare debate is a battleground on which, as governor, I have fought from the beginning. Soon after I took office, back in 1991, I made a priority of getting the Michigan legislature to abolish a state version of the Great Society	known as General Assistance. GA provided a monthly check to almost 100,000 able-bodied adults without children. In essence, it paid them not to work.
<p>
	We put an end to the program with some dispatch and said we wanted these tax-takers to become taxpayers. And you know what? Despite bitter denunciations in the liberal media at the time, not one of the four Democrats who challenged me in my 1994 re-election campaign called for the restoration of GA. That is significant because abolishing GA was, I believe, the first tangible sign in America that the nation was serious about ending welfare as we know it. Nobody else had said, "Get rid of a $250 million government welfare program; it won't exist next year." But that's what we did--and it signalled the beginning of the paradigm shift that is currently afoot.
<p>
	As my friends at the Heritage Foundation know, I have some thoughts about Washington's role in welfare. I am not an advocate of pruning federal programs, because those of you who are gardeners know that pruning just makes things grow faster than ever. What I advocate is getting a firm grip on the system as we know it and pulling it up by the roots. That means pulling welfare's roots out of Washington and letting the states decide what to transplant and what to reject. To stick with my gardening metaphor--and to use the words in a recent issue of <i><a href="/nationalreview/welcome.html">National Review</a></i>--let 50 flowers bloom instead of the weed patch in Foggy Bottom.
<p>
	As a result of last November's historic elections, the relationship between Washington and welfare is undergoing radical redefinition. Under Speaker Gingrich and Majority Leader Dole, the l04th Congress is taking an extraordinary step: It is beginning the process of relinquishing power and returning it to the 50 states. Getting Washington out of the way is the crucial first step in the long process of returning authority and responsibility to where they ultimately belong--to the "little platoons" of civil society, our families and neighborhoods, churches and charitable organizations.
<p>
	In the area of welfare, I and other governors are hopeful that this historic opportunity will result in no-strings-attached block grants. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: There is no devil in devolution. No-strings-attached block grants are the first crucial steps to meaningful reform. But I am not content to stop there. Ultimately, the goal of welfare reform is to cut federal taxes and return all the fiscal and policy initiatives to the states. This is consistent with America's heritage. There are both constitutional and historical grounds for removing the federal government from such programs as Aid to Families with Dependent Children.
<p>
	Two weeks ago, the Heritage Foundation teamed up with the Federalist Society to present a working conference on the Tenth Amendment. I do not know whether Russell's book <i>The Conservative Constitution</i> was cited, but it should have been, because in it we are reminded that the Constitution set up a federal government that was to be supreme in its sphere, while the states were to remain supreme in their sphere. Washington and the states were meant to be co-sovereigns, with a host of undelegated powers reserved to the states. Welfare is one of those areas in which the states were meant to be supreme.
<p>
	This point is buttressed by the fact that our Founders never gave any indication that welfare should be the responsibility of the federal government. America was at its founding, and still is in many ways, a nation of immigrants, and almost 100 percent of the immigrants who have come to our shores have been poor. The men who drafted our Constitution knew the face of poverty. Despite numerous innovations that came out of the Constitutional Convention of 1787, no one called for giving the federal government a role in alleviating poverty. Yet over the last 60 years, as we have moved from the social insurance system proposed by FDR to the massive giveaway programs enacted by LBJ, Uncle Sam has become Big Daddy. And a tragic number of American citizens have been hurt in the process.
<p>
	I would not be so adamant about getting Washington out of the way if I did not think the states could succeed. If given a chance, the states can and will succeed. Remember the classic by Jonathan Swift, <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>? We in the states are like poor Gulliver on the beach, tied down by small-minded Lilliputians who remind me of the army of federal bureaucrats in Washington. If, like Gulliver, we can extricate ourselves from the entanglement of federal rules and regulations, we will be free to experiment and find better ways of truly helping the needy go to work and become independent.
<p>
	In Michigan, for example, an array of welfare reform initiatives over the past three years is yielding dramatic results. One goal of reform has been to get people to work and thereby enable welfare recipients to accept more responsibility for their lives. Because Michigan recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children must sign a Social Contract, they are working, training for a job, or volunteering in communities at least 20 hours a week. As a result, the number of Michigan AFDC recipients earning income is up to an all-time high of almost 30 percent, compared to just 8 percent nationally.
<p>
	A second goal has been to shrink the size of welfare rolls and save taxpayers money. Again, because of our enforced Social Contract, over 67,000 cases have been closed since 1992 because families are earning enough to be independent. Consequently, Michigan's AFDC caseload has declined to its lowest level in over two decades--and that is saving taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars as a result.
<p>
	A third aim of reform has been to keep at-risk families intact. In Michigan, our family preservation programs have a proven track record of reducing foster care and helping troubled families work through their problems. Much of our success is due to the fact that we contract out to private agencies, many of them church-run, because they an important moral element in the battle against poverty.
<p>
	Finally, the most critical objective has been to lower the illegitimacy rate. Efforts of the public-private Michigan Abstinence Partnership have helped bring about the lowest teen pregnancy rate in the Great Lakes State in a decade. However, our task--and America's task--is far from finished. In Michigan, 70 percent of births to teen mothers are to unwed teen mothers. If you think that is shocking, in Detroit it is 95 percent.
<p>
	My friends, this is a crisis of unprecedented proportions. As a state we could move even more aggressively to tackle the problem were it not for one thing--and that thing is the federal government. Like Gulliver, the states have been tied down by Lilliputians in Washington who make reform difficult, if not impossible.
<p>
	I hope the people who complain about the lack of federal control over welfare reform will look at the example of states like Michigan. I also hope they will acknowledge that the 50 governors have at least one credential that nobody in Washington has: We governors must actually administer the welfare system. We are closer to the problem than any federal bureaucrat. We know what works and what doesn't. We know what needs changing and how to change it. And if our reforms are not working, we can tackle the problem quickly rather than wait literally years for the federal government to act. Fifty states experimenting will create what are tantamount to market forces that will encourage governors and state houses to be responsible to both tax-takers and taxpayers.
<p>
	Whatever the final shape of welfare when the 104th Congress adjourns, more is at stake than whether this group of conservatives or that wins the debate. At bottom, this is a fight for the freedom of the states to exercise their constitutional authority and responsibility. If the states lose and Congress insists it has the right to micromanage welfare programs among the 50 states, then an important principle of freedom will have been compromised.
<p>
	But I do not think the states will lose. And in this I draw strength from our good friend, Russell Kirk. One of the things I appreciated most about Russell was his ability, no matter what the challenges, "to let a little cheerfulness break in."
<p>
		I want to close on the last words of one of the last lectures he delivered here at Heritage. This passage summarizes both his belief in the "little platoons" and his indomitable spirit of hope:
<p><blockquote>
		Spritually and politically, the twentieth century has been a time of decadence. Yet as this century draws to a close, we may remind ourselves that ages of decadence sometimes have been followed by ages of renewal.
<p>		What can you do, young men and women of the rising generation of the 1990s, to raise up the human condition?... Why, begin by brightening the corner where you are, by improving one human...yourself, and by helping your neighbor.
<p>	You will not need to be rich or famous to take your part in redeeming the time: what you require for that task is moral imagination joined to right reason....
<p>	Shrug your shoulders at things indifferent; set your face against things evil; and by doing God's will...find that peace which passeth all understanding.3
</blockquote><p>
	<i>Requiescat in pace</i>, my friend.

 The Heritage Foundation's research in the area of health care has always underscored the importance of consumer choice and patient power in our health care system.  Individual ownership of health care insurance and individual control of health care spending are critical if we are to contain health care costs and preserve the high quality health care delivery Americans have come to expect. <p>
 In 1994 at the time of the debates over the Clinton Health Care Plan, Heritage formed a Physicians Council made up of doctors who were concerned about the increasing role and interference of the federal government in the practice of medicine and the prospect of the Clinton Health Care Plan becoming a reality. Members of the Physicians Council helped Heritage publicize the details of the Clinton plan, its costs, its complexities, and its unprecedented control of both public and private health care spending.

<P>

	Today, the Physicians Council of The Heritage Foundation continues to play an active role in informing the medical and policymaking communities about what's at stake in the health care policy debates in Washington.  The Council brings together physicians from all over the country and from many different specialties.  It has no fancy offices and no high-paid lobbyists like many of the large medical societies.  Its aim is simple:  To communicate with patients and physicians about what reforms would mean and to provide ways to let politicians know the views of doctors.  The Heritage Foundation provides for the research needs of the Council and keeps members up-to-date on what is happening in health care reform through a broad range of easy-to-read studies and regular mailings.
<p>
	The Physicians Council is chaired by Heritage Board Chairman, David Brown, M.D., a retired orthopedic surgeon from Oklahoma City, OK.  The more than 700 members of the Council help Heritage leverage our own research and marketing efforts through their use of Heritage speakers, their use of our materials in their own communications, and their distribution of our publications to colleagues and patients.  The membership dues of the Council members ($250/year) help to fund much of the work of our health care analysts, the publication of our policy papers, and distribution of our <i>Physicians Council Reports</i>.  
<p>
	The past year has been an active one in the area of health care.  In 1995 Heritage's model became the framework for the legislation to reform Medicare.  The Heritage plan called for the "voucherization" of Medicare so that seniors could choose private alternatives to Medicare.  Ultimately, legislation did not pass the Congress, but we continue to work with members of Congress and senior staff aides on this issue.   In fact, our June 1996 <i>Physicians Council Report</i> titled, "<a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/pcr3.html">Average Household Faces $14,000 Tax Bill to Keep Medicare Afloat</a>," highlights the urgent and continuing need to reform our Medicare system.
<p>
	On lessening the daily regulatory burdens doctors face, one Heritage paper has proved especially influential:  "<a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/bg1056.html">Cutting Red Tape on Clinical Labs:  Why Congress Should Deregulate Doctors</a>."  Written by Physicians Council member Sandra Mahkorn, M.D., the report was used by Representative Bill Archer to convince fellow Members of Congress of the need for his crucial reform legislation.  And another paper, "<a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/bg1059.html">Reforming Medicare:  What Congress Can Learn From the Health Plans of America's Corporations</a>," by Brenda Fitzgerald, M.D., was circulated throughout Congress by Congressman Charlie Norwood of Georgia.

<h3>Activities -- Second Quarter 1996</h3>
<p>
	Second quarter health care reform activities focused on providing the medical community with a better understanding of the elements of the Kennedy-Kassebaum health care reform legislation and the latest news on the Medicare Trust Fund.  
<p>
	An April 24 Physicians Council dinner in Chicago brought Heritage members and staff together with AMA President-elect Daniel "Stormy" Johnson to discuss the AMA's public policy activities and positions on the latest health care legislation.  At this dinner, Johnson credited Heritage's Bob Moffit with educating the AMA board of directors on the fundamental flaws of our health care financing system, and Heritage Vice President Grace-Marie Arnett shared an early copy of her publication, <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/pcr2.html">"Cops And Doctors, Part II"</a> which broke the story on the very frightening waste, fraud, and abuse provisions contained in the Kennedy-Kassebaum legislation.  At this meeting, Johnson pledged to review these provisions, and the AMA subsequently mounted a substantial lobbying effort to remove or modify this portion of the bill.  This publication was released as a <i>Physicians Council Report</i>, and copies were distributed to Physicians Council members, Hill offices, and the AMA.

	On May 17, physicians who are members of the Heritage President's Club met with Rep. Greg Ganske, M.D. (R-IA) to discuss managed care's "gag rule" on doctors and brief them on his pending legislation addressing this issue.  And, our June 20-21 Physicians Council meeting brought members together for a program of panel discussions on the current political debate over health care reform and Medicare.  For the first time, we asked that presentations at this meeting incorporate a message of how to communicate our message to patients and colleagues.  And, we used this meeting to learn more about how Heritage can better work with doctors to deliver the message of consumer choice and competition in health care.
<p>

	Rep. Dennis Hastert (R-IL), chairman of the Speaker's Steering Committee on Health and the Resource Group on Health of the Health Care Task Force in the House of Representatives, opened our meeting with a dinner address.  Morning speakers included:   Stuart Butler, Marshall Wittmann, Grace-Marie Arnett, and Mike Franc, now Director of Communications for House Majority Leader Dick Armey.  Sen. Robert Bennett (R-UT), chairman of the Senate Republican Health Care Task Force, closed the meeting with a luncheon address on "Why We Need Tax Reform to Truly Reform our Health Care System."  Sen. Bennett's speech provided such a thorough and understandable overview of the problems of our health care financing system and the reforms necessary that we plan to publish his remarks as a <i>Heritage Lecture</i> and distribute these to our Council members, medical societies, and specialty organizations.

<p>
	Upcoming Activities:  The next meeting of the Physicians Council is scheduled for December 3-4 in Washington, D.C.

<H3>Corporate Responsibility</h3>
<p>
<table border=2 width=75% cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td>
	On Thursday, May 16, President Clinton and Vice President Gore will convene a White House conference on corporate responsibility.  CEO's have been invited to participate in a program of panel discussions that will highlight "good corporate citizens" and emphasize behavior the President wants other companies to follow.  What will President Clinton and the White House team propose, and what will America's CEO's report from the front line?  The Heritage Foundation's Rebecca Lukens Fellow in Labor Policy Mark Wilson's essay below highlights several key issues business leaders should keep in mind when politicians turn to the topic of "corporate responsibility".
</td></tr></table></center>
<p>
	After three years of talking about economic insecurity and pursuing government solutions, President Clinton is now trying to walk a fine line between encouraging corporate citizenship and mandating it.  Hence, we see the White House promoting principles of corporate responsibility, while members of the President's Administration and political party propose more government mandates and incentives.  Americans are concerned about their jobs and wages, but in an election year politicians would rather focus that concern on business instead of the real problem: the high cost of government.
<p>
	Do companies have obligations beyond the bottom line?  Of course they do, but <b>the primary responsibility of companies is to produce the best possible products and services for the best possible price.  This, in turn, will ensure the most secure jobs for workers at the highest possible wages, as well as the highest profits for shareholders.</b>
<p>
	Striving to be competitive in a global marketplace does not mean that companies do not care about their workers or communities.  In fact, it can be argued that it is the competitive market forces a business faces every day, not government regulations, that cause it to be responsive to its customers, shareholders, employees, and communities.  For example:
<p><ul>
<li>Between 1942 and 1970, before the creation of OSHA, companies steadily improved workplace health and safety on their own as the total number of work-related injuries in the U.S. declined by 45 percent.  
<p>
 <li>Companies also recognize the goodwill generated by community giving.  In 1994, corporate giving totaled $6 billion.  Thirty-seven percent went to education, 26 percent went to health and human services, 12 percent went to cultural and arts activities, and 10 percent went to civic and community groups.
 <p>
<li>Companies also recognize the importance of training their workers.  Virtually all large establishments, and 69 percent of small establishments, provide some formal training to their workers.<sup>i</sup>  Over half of all establishments that provided formal training made it available to all employees.
</ul><p>
	Companies that are downsizing are not undertaking these measures just to increase their profits.  Rather, they are fundamentally restructuring how they operate in response to competition and to better serve their customers.  In a competitive marketplace no company can be sure how its customer demands will change, what its products will be, or even exactly what business it will be in five years from now.  Moreover, customers are demanding more for less.  If one company can not meet their needs, customers will look for another that does.  So, companies must remain flexible and innovative.
<p>
	The recent pummeling that business has taken in the press is largely undeserved.  And the President should be applauded for highlighting the positive contributions that companies make to society.  In fact, the innovation and invention inherent in business rarely gets much press or attention, but it is crucial to social progress and improvements in American living standards.  
<p>
	The problem, of course, is that politicians are not elected for talking about good deeds.  They are elected to solve problems by passing laws, creating programs, and legislating benefits.  Hence, we see liberals pressing for another mandated increase in the minimum wage and hailing the passage of the Family Medical Leave Act as a great accomplishment.  The dichotomy between the President's recent statement that the government can't make all companies do good things, and his proposal to mandate that all businesses provide health care insurance to their workers is a troubling contradiction.
<p>
	The public, Congress, and the President need to keep in mind that there are no government programs that will make layoffs disappear.  Mandating benefits and training will not eliminate layoffs or increase real wages.  Shutting off imports and immigration will not guarantee everyone a well-paying, secure job.  And sending every American to college will not end economic growth and its accompanying dislocations.  For as long as there has been economic progress, there have been layoffs.
<p><ul>
<li>Although over the past 15 years an average of 20 million workers per year experience at least one spell of unemployment, the economy has managed to create 25 million <i>net</i> new jobs. <sup>ii</sup>
<p>
<li>Sixty percent of the companies reporting job cuts in the twelve months ending June 1995, were also creating new positions at the same time.<sup>iii</sup>  The net workforce change in companies reporting job cuts was only -1.1 percent, down from -5.2 percent the year before.  Because of concurrent job creation, job elimination is no longer synonymous with downsizing.<sup>iv</sup>
<p>
 <li>Of business layoffs that involved 50 or more workers from October to December 1995, most were due to seasonal jobs ending (41.6 percent), slack work (12.2 percent), or the completion of contract work (8.4 percent).<sup>v</sup>  Company reorganizations, business ownership change, and domestic relocation together accounted for 10.9 percent of layoffs.  Import competition and overseas relocation together accounted for less than 1 percent.
 <p>
<li>Those companies that are downsizing many have taken a variety of actions to avoid workforce reductions.  Forty-three percent implement pay cuts and transfers, 40 percent offer voluntary separations, 10 percent offer voluntary job sharing.<sup>vi</sup>  Further, most downsizing companies (75 percent) offer a variety of outplacement assistance to laid-off workers.  Forty-six percent provide extended severance pay, 40 percent provide extended health coverage, and 19 percent provide job retraining.
<p>
<li>Seventy-five percent of all displaced workers who lost their jobs between January 1991 and December 1992 found new jobs.<sup>vii</sup>  Only 11.5 percent remained unemployed.
<p>
<li>Most displaced workers (53 percent) who found new jobs were earning the same as or more than their old job paid.  Over 27 percent were earning 20 percent more.<sup>viii</sup>  And, 82 percent of workers who were previously covered by group health insurance were covered in their new jobs.  Median weekly earnings, however, were 8.2 percent less than the old jobs, and over 14 percent less for workers 45 to 55 years old.<sup>ix</sup>
<p>
<li>Although the overall distribution of job duration has not changed over the last two decades, the distribution of long-term jobs across the population has changed in two ways.<sup>x</sup>  First, individuals, particularly men, with little education (less than twelve years) are substantially less likely to be in long-term jobs today than they were twenty years ago.  Second, women with at least a high-school education are substantially more likely to be in long-term jobs today than they were twenty years ago. 
</ul><p>
	Competition and economic change are a source of America's strength and opportunity.  Government mandates limit innovation by requiring a one-size-fits-all solution, and they will only diminish economic growth. Employment security in the 1990s and beyond will depend upon business flexibility and individuals' ability to adapt to the changing demands of jobs and the job market.  Workers who will fare the best are those with a good basic education, a strong work ethic, sound communication skills, and a willingness to relocate. 
<p>
	Corporate citizenship can not be enhanced with complex tax code changes, trade restrictions, or job-killing increases in the minimum wage.  Instead, what is needed are policies that focus on the primary problems: high taxes on labor and capital, and job-restricting regulations.  Correcting these problems will increase economic growth, real wages, and job opportunities.

<H3>How Congress Won the Budget War</H3></center>
<P>It’s one thing when Democrats attack the Republican-controlled 104th Congress for failing to deliver on its promises; it’s quite another when Republicans themselves start believing the charge.  For the fact is, in the crucial area of making real cuts in the federal budget, the 104th Congress has rung up a remarkable record of success, according to a new Heritage Foundation analysis.

<P>	Consider: When the 1996 budget process came to a close, Congress had made real cuts -- not phantom "baseline" cuts -- in discretionary spending for the first time since 1969, says Heritage Foundation Senior Fellow in Economics Ron Utt.  All told, it eliminated 270 federal programs, agencies, offices, and projects, reduced the number of bureaucrats at 29 of the 39 major government offices, and helped reduce the deficit to its lowest level since 1982.  

<P>"Fiscal conservatives in Congress may have lost a rhetorical battle with the president over the budget," Utt says, "but they won the budget war."

<P>	Specific programs Congress erased from the federal landscape include the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corp., the Office of Travel and Tourism, the Office of Technological Assessment, the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Bureau of Mines.  Spending for many programs and agencies Congress failed to eliminate -- such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development, National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the Legal Services Corp. -- dropped substantially.

<P>	Utt’s conclusion: Congress’s accomplishments were "far bolder than even the intentions of the early Reagan administration, which until now have served as the benchmark for ambitious fiscal restraint." For example, Reagan proposed cutting the NEA by 27 percent and achieved 20 percent, but this Congress slashed the arts agency’s budget by 39 percent.  The same applies to the National Endowment for the Humanities, where Reagan’s goal of a 23 percent reduction (he got 20 percent) pales next to Congress’s 35 percent cut.  Similarly, mass-transit subsidies, targeted by Reagan for a 10 percent reduction, were cut 43 percent by the current Congress.

<P>	Granted, there’s much more Congress could have done, and still should.  "As impressive as this Congress’s performance was," Utt says,  "it has only made a dent in the massive waste and redundancy that pervade the federal government." He says first on Congress’s cut list should be out-of-control entitlement programs such as Medicaid and Medicare.  And while Congress found many opportunities to privatize federal programs such as the Naval Petroleum Reserve, another $8 billion to $20 billion could be saved just from privatizing the country’s four "power marketing administrations."

<P>	With work well underway on the fiscal year 1997 budget, Utt says Congress’s goal should be to shave another $20 billion off spending totals.  "This Congress cut discretionary spending for the first time since 1969," Utt says. "There’s no reason it can’t cut spending a second time."

<H3>PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS ON KASSEBAUM-KENNEDY</h3><p> 
<table border=2 width=75% cellpadding=7 cellspacing=7><tr><td>
	President Clinton signed the Kassebaum-Kennedy health care reform bill on August 21, 1996, and the provisions of the bill will become effective on July 1, 1997.  The exception being the four-year Medical Savings Account demonstration project, arguably the most "controversial" provision of the bill, which will become effective January 1, 1997. The huge margins of support for the bill in both the House and Senate reflect the deep desire of Members of Congress from both parties to address the serious and continuing problems faced by workers and their families in getting and keeping health insurance coverage.  Despite the voting margins, many Members remain concerned that specific provisions, even though drafted with the best of intentions, could have unintended and seriously damaging consequences.
<p>
	Over the next several weeks, in the wake of the political conventions and into the election, analysts, aides, and members of the business community will analyze the legislation to determine its impact on employees and businesses, as well as its impact on the American health care system.  Legal teams from the various professional associations will pore over the new law, trying to ferret out the meaning of some of the more abstruse provisions of this highly technical document, and you can be sure that they will find a few surprises--the unexpected always happens in the legislative process.  Heritage's Deputy Director of Domestic Policy Studies, <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert Moffit</a> shares his "preliminary observations" of the legislation below.
</td></tr></table></center>
<p>
	With the number of uninsured Americans rising by about a million a year, the 104th Congress was anxious to pass some type of health care reform legislation that would begin to address the serious problems facing the health insurance market.  Provisions of the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation are designed to reform the employer-based health insurance market and guarantee portability of insurance coverage for workers.  Our analysts believe that its provisions for guaranteed issue, limitations on pre-existing condition exclusions, and guaranteed renewal of policies may make health insurance coverage more <i>available</i> in the individual market, but they will not make it more <i>affordable</i>.  
<p>
	The bill increases the deductibility for the self-insured, but not by much.  And the long-fought-over MSA demonstration project most certainly will disappoint those longing for a more open market in health care.  The government will dictate MSA policies instead of letting them develop in response to consumer demands, and the four-year trial is limited to 750,000 MSAs -- hardly an incentive for the private sector to compete.  How did this happen?  And what else can we expect from the bill?
<p>
<b>1. The bill is the lowest common political denominator. </b>
<blockquote><p>
	The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill was the only vehicle that Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives and moderates could agree to vote on and pass into law this year.  It passed the Senate by 98 to 0; the House 421 to 2; only liberal Democrats Pete Stark of California and Pat Williams of Montana voted against it in the House of Representatives.  (Many in the business community know Congressman Stark as a major congressional champion of a single-payer system.)
<p>
	In one respect, this is a limited bill.  It has a very narrow focus, namely, health insurance regulation.  And, regardless of the particulars of health insurance rules, they are not decisive in terms of the structure of the market.  What is decisive is the tax treatment of health insurance and medical services.  At best, and putting the very best face on it, this bill should only be seen as a down payment on real market reform--and real market reform will come only with tax reform.  In that respect, we have not even begun to reform the American health care system.  In fact, we have a very long way to go.  
<p>
	The good news is that the debate on the tax treatment of health insurance and health care services is unavoidable, precisely because the debate on tax reform, including a major overhaul of our tax code, is unavoidable.  
</blockquote><p>
<b>2.  The American people should not expect dramatic changes resulting from the President signing the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill.</b>  
<blockquote><p>
	We will not see a drop in health care costs.  Unfortunately, we probably will not see a drop in the rate of uninsurance either. Also, we will not see <i>true</i> portability in health insurance, like we have in auto insurance or homeowners insurance or life insurance, the kind of portability that we take for granted in all of these areas.  The reason:  Americans will still not be able to own their own health insurance policies, like they can in other areas of insurance, and take it with them when they change jobs.  Policies will still remain the property of employers. 
<p>
	Once again, we should remember that insurance regulation, no matter how well- or ill-intentioned, does not and cannot fix the major distortions in the broken health insurance market.  Only changes in the federal tax treatment of health insurance can do that.  This bill does <i>not</i> do that. 
</blockquote><p>
<b>3.  There are certain features of the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill that will help millions of Americans who already have insurance at their place of work. </b>
<blockquote> 
<p>
	The bill sets up unprecedented federal ground rules for the health insurance market, so that Americans who are working will be able to keep health insurance from job to job.  In this way the new law does address the very real worries of millions of Americans who will lose health coverage if they get sick or lose their jobs.  It does this by establishing rules to guarantee, through regulation, portability of health coverage.  With guaranteed issue, health insurance companies must sell you policies in the individual market after you have exhausted your COBRA coverage.  With a limitation on exclusion of pre-existing medical conditions, they cannot deny you or your employer a policy because of your medical status.  With guaranteed renewability, your insurance company in the individual market cannot drop you if you get sick.
<p>
	The bill, therefore, will make health insurance coverage more <i>available</i> in the individual market.  It will not, however, make it more <i>affordable</i>.
</blockquote><p>
<b>4.  In fixing <i>some</i> problems in the health insurance market, the bill could create others.</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
	The American health insurance market is one of the most highly regulated sectors of the American economy.  This regulation is overwhelmingly done at the state level, and state regulation imposes rules on insurance ranging from rate setting for doctors and hospitals to mandating that companies include very specific benefits, everything from in vitro fertilization to psychological counseling.  These state regulations are costly for individuals, families, and small businesses.  In the state of Maryland, for example, these mandates add about 25 percent to the costs of health insurance premiums.  Furthermore, the bill creates two potentially serious problems:
<p><ul>
<li><b><i>First, the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill adds a new layer of federal regulation on top of the existing morass of state rules.</i></b>  The concern among analysts at The Heritage Foundation and elsewhere is that the new federal rules will drive health care costs up.  The reasons:  nobody, no matter how sick, can be denied health insurance; nobody's health insurance can be canceled, except for cause, such as fraud; your medical conditions are henceforth not a barrier to health insurance.  Of course, many medical professionals find these changes desirable. 
<p>
These new federal rules may establish equity of sorts among patients--which is what they are designed to do--but, taken alone, without any other offsetting market changes, they will add to the cost of insurance.  We don't all automatically win.  There will be losers with this bill: those who become uninsured because they can't afford the premium increases or because individual insurers in this new and even more highly regulated environment may withdraw from the market. 
<p>
How much will costs go up?  Nobody knows for sure but there are a range of estimates.  The American Academy of Actuaries says that it will be a modest increase, between 3 and 5 percent.  Individual insurers say we will see anywhere from 10 to 30 percent increases in the individual market.  The increases and adjustments are hard to predict in a rapidly changing employer-based market.  But, in any case, we should be going into this with our eyes open. 
<p>
<li><b><i>Second, the bill sets up a vast, federal data collection apparatus at the federal level, including the storage and sharing of patient records. </i></b>    Each person will have, under the bill, a "patient identifier" code, and this is designed to simplify the administration of the system.  In the text of the conference report, the Congress restates its good intention to protect privacy.  Good intentions are not enough.  As the <i>Washington Post</i> pointed out recently, unauthorized leaks could result in confidential data being sent into electronic mailboxes all over the country.  At The Heritage Foundation we are more than a little nervous about the potential for abuse. This is only the first controversial issue to surface with the passage of the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill.  There will doubtless be others.
</ul><p>
	A "technical corrections" bill will likely be introduced early next year to fix the glitches created by various provisions of  Kassebaum-Kennedy.  Two items should be at the top of the agenda:  First, further modification or elimination of unnecessary fines and penalties on doctors.  My colleagues at The Heritage Foundation have opposed, on sound federalist principle, the nationalization of criminal law, usurping or overriding the authority of the states.  There are today over 3,000 criminal laws.  The Kassebaum-Kennedy Bill has added a half dozen more of them.  While Members of Congress insist that they have heard the message from physicians justifiably angry over the imposition of new fines and penalties amidst the growing underbrush of thorny and complicated rules and regulations.  Members of Congress claim to have "fixed" the problem, but we believe that more can be done to protect honest physicians from overzealous bureaucrats.  If Congress remains conservative, the deregulation of the medical profession should be a top priority, just as the deregulation of agriculture and communications has been a top priority in this Congress.  
<p>
	Second, no personal medical record should be turned over to any public or private agency without the express, written permission of the patient. 
</blockquote><p>
<b>5. The Kassebaum-Kennedy Bill could have, but didn't, advance health care reforms that would have made the American system work better for individuals and families. </b>
<blockquote><p>

	<b><i>First, the bill is not nearly generous enough in providing tax relief to individuals and families, regardless of where they work or even the status of their employment.</i></b>  It increases the deductibility for the self-insured from 30 percent to 80 percent--by the year 2006!  While this is a step in the right direction, in itself it is no big deal.  It falls far short of tax equity for individuals and families--and there is not much pizzazz in waiting ten years for the full implementation of a measure that will approach a bare modicum of tax equity.
<p>
	Real tax relief either in the form of tax credits or vouchers for low-income persons, would be a far more generous approach.  It would expand personal choice for individuals and families, and make health insurance and health care itself more affordable.  In any case, tax credits would be more equitable than deductions, especially for lower-income and lower-middle income working families.  
<p>
<b><i>Second, a related item, the MSA demonstration program looks as if it were designed to fail.</i></b>  We hope it doesn't fail, but that's how it looks.  The four-year demonstration project imposes a cap of 750,000 policies that get tax equity, including the self-employed and individuals in firms with anywhere between 2 and 50 employees.  And it is hobbled by literally dozens of statutory conditions on employers and insurers, too extensive and intricate to enumerate here; and it requires a tight policing of these policies by the IRS. 
<P>
	With all of the attendant paperwork, two problems are immediately evident:  (a) small employers are wrestling with too much government paperwork now.  And this program, with its strict reporting requirements and conditions, is hardly designed to make it an attractive option for harried small businesses; (b) such an artificially small pool of potential policyholders--over a four-year period--is not likely to be inviting to a broad spectrum of commercial insurers.  This means that only a small number of insurers currently specializing in high-deductible polices, who are also willing to put up with the government's regulatory regime, will venture to participate.  The likely result: premiums will be higher than if the option were open to a much broader competition. 
<p>
	If you are interested in a demonstration of the dynamism of the market, the powerful and fruitful collision of the forces of supply and demand, designed to unleash free market forces, this is not it.  This is a political compromise.  Others can judge who got the best of the compromise; the market reformers or the regulators?  Furthermore, the very premise of a demonstration program for medical savings accounts also should be questioned.  Over 2,500 companies already have adopted MSA's, and we know that they are very popular with employees and have been successful in controlling costs in the companies where they are used.  And, as for adverse selection, employers have managed risks with managed care, and there is no reason why they can't manage risks with Medical Savings Accounts.  Moreover, they are popular with employees, even though their savings accounts are subject to federal and state taxation and thus are hobbled by an unfair discrimination in tax treatment.
<p>
	The opposition to individual tax relief and Medical Savings Accounts seems to be grounded in fear; not a fear that they are a bad idea or will fail, but rather that they are an excellent idea and will succeed.  Once individuals and families have individual tax relief, they will pick and choose their own plans and policies, their own doctors and medical treatments and procedures.  And, liberals in Congress know that once families start exercising this level of personal choice, they will never - politically -- be able to take that freedom of choice away.  Families with Medical Savings Accounts are hard, if not impossible, for regulators to regulate; huge, consolidated managed care networks, dominated by a few large insurers in any given area of the country, are comparatively easy to regulate.  It is also easy to transition from such a consolidated corporate system into a single-payer system.
<p>
	The short-term value of Medical Savings Accounts, even in the truncated form found in Kassebaum-Kennedy, is that it will give some employers another health care option that can help them hold down costs, and it will give thousands of individuals and families the power to choose their own physicians, medical treatments, and medical services.  And ultimately this is the kind of health care system Americans want.  
<p>
	Unfortunately, we still have a lot of work to do to get there.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>
China's July 21-26 missile test about 100 miles north of Taiwan
was a blatant act of intimidation. Armed with nuclear warheads,
these Chinese missiles could be used to devastate American bases
or naval formations in Asia, which lack adequate missile defenses.
China's attempt to threaten the Republic of China challenges the
United States to provide its forces and friends with appropriate
defenses. Unless America responds, China's future nuclear intimidation
could destabilize Asia by driving others in the region to seek
their own nuclear deterrent.
<P>
To avoid this, the U.S. should incorporate missile defenses into
its strategy to deter aggression in Asia. At the same time, Washington
should emphasize missile defense cooperation as an effective alternative
to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The Clinton Administration's
focus on short-range, theater-based missile defense (TMD) systems
is inadequate. The Administration can enhance security in Asia
by pursuing a strategy that defends Americans against missile
attack and extending that umbrella to America's allies and friends
in the region. Such a strategy should include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Building and deploying</B> a missile defense system for the United
States. In order to defend its allies, America itself must
be defended from missile attack.
<P>
<LI><B>Improving</B> the defense of U.S. forces in Asia by accelerating
development and deployment of the Navy's Upper Tier system to
the Pacific Fleet and the Army's THAAD system to U.S. forces in
South Korea and Japan.
<P>
<LI><B>Encouraging</B> Australia, Japan, and South Korea to acquire
advanced U.S. TMD systems and promote multilateral missile defense
cooperation.
<P>
<LI><B>Telling</B> China to live up to its nonproliferation commitments
and offering to share missile defense technology if China agrees
to verifiable nuclear missile limitation.
<P>
<LI><B>Selling</B> advanced theater missile defense systems to Taiwan,
consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act, and preparing U.S. naval
TMD forces to help defend Taiwan.
<P>
<LI><B>Offering</B> India and Pakistan a deal:  If they agree to negotiate
verifiable limits and reductions of their nuclear and missile
forces, the U.S. will offer them access to satellite intelligence
to verify agreements and technology to help defend against missile
attack.
</ul>
<P>
<b>ASIAN MISSILE THREATS AND PROLIFERATION DANGERS</b>
<P>
<B>China's Global and Regional Threat. </B>China's nuclear missile
program dates back to the mid-1950s and has grown to include several
classes of nuclear-armed ballistic missiles. China is believed
to have about 300 nuclear warheads for its missile force. <sup>1</sup> By
the year 2120, according to one estimate, China could have 50
to 70 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of reaching
the United States from bases in China. <sup>2</sup>  Two mobile ICBMs are under
development  the 5,000-mile-range DF-31 and the 7,500-mile-range
DF-41. The DF-31, tested on May 29, 1995, could reach the Western
U.S. if fired from Northern China. China deploys four DF-5 missiles
which can carry a 4 to 5 megaton warhead over 8,000 miles and
10 DF-4 missiles with a 3,000-mile range. China has one to two
nuclear missile submarines which can carry 12 of the 1,000-mile
Julang-1 submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM). The 5,000-mile-range
<I>Julang-2</I>, a variant of the DF-31, is under development.
<P>
China also possesses several intermediate-range and tactical nuclear-capable
missiles. Since the mid-1980s it has build over 30 DF-21 missiles
with a 1,125-mile range. It also may have more than 60 older and
less accurate DF-3 1,700-mile-range missiles. Chinese nuclear-capable
tactical missiles include the 185-mile-range DF-11 (M-11) and
the 375-mile-range DF-15 (M-9). According to Chinese military
analyst Dr. Chong Pin Lin, China has hired Russian technicians
and may have purchased a complete missile plant from Russia, to
produce long-range cruise missiles similar to the U.S. <I>Tomahawk.</I> <sup>3</sup>
 China is developing Global Positioning Satellites (GPS) that
emit precise navigation signals. With such a capability, Chinese
ballistic and cruise missiles could acquire high degrees of accuracy. <sup>4</sup>

<P>
In 1993 China reportedly purchased 60 Russian S-300s, comparable
in capability to the U.S. Patriot missile, which can intercept
tactical ballistic missiles, such as the Russian Scud, in flight. <sup>5</sup>
 Thus, China already has a limited anti-tactical ballistic missile
(ATBM) capability.
<P>
China's nuclear strategy against the United States and Russia
is often described as one of &quot;minimum deterrence,&quot; targeting
its small number of ICBMs on U.S. or Russian cities. However,
Beijing clearly employs a more active strategy with its intermediate
and tactical missiles. The &quot;testing&quot; of DF-21s and M-9s
near Taiwan was China's first high-profile use of missiles to
intimidate an opponent. The M-9 missiles were fired from Leping
Military Base in the Jaingxi Province west of Taiwan; Taipei is
just at the edge of the M-9's 370-mile range from this base. <sup>6</sup> 
DF-21 missiles are deployed from bases where they can threaten
Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and India. <sup>7</sup>
 With the assistance of PLA Navy tracking ships, DF-21 missiles
also could be used to attack U.S. Navy carrier task groups. From
China's Hainan Island in the South China Sea, DF-21 missiles could
counter U.S. naval forces transiting the Straits of Malacca.
<P>
<B>North Korea's Current and Future Threat. </B>North Korea's
extensive missile program is often overshadowed by its nuclear
weapons development program. <sup>8</sup>  But its ballistic missile program
deserves equal attention. It was revealed in 1994 that North Korea
was developing two long-range missiles, dubbed the Taepo Dong-1
&amp; 2 with estimated ranges of 1,200 miles and 2,000 miles,
respectively. These missiles would give North Korea the capability
to target U.S. forces in Guam. According to recent South Korean
and Russian estimates, the Taepo Dong-2 could have a 6,200-mile
range, which would cover about half the continental U.S. <sup>9</sup>  At this
estimated range, the Taepo Dong-2 also could reach Europe, all
of East Asia, and Australia. Some U.S. estimates, however, give
this missile only a 2,500-mile range, and it is not expected to
be operational before the year 2000. In a June 1994 statement,
the head of U.S. Naval Intelligence estimated a North Korean missile
could carry a nuclear warhead by the year 2000, or possibly as
early as this year. <sup>10</sup>
<P>
North Korea tested a variant of the Scud in May 1993. Called the
<I>Nodong-1 </I>, it has an estimated 625-mile range and is capable
of threatening U.S. forces in Japan. North Korea was reported
to have had 12 to 18 <I>Nodong-1 </I> missiles in early 1994. <sup>11</sup>
 There are also reports that the North is developing a solid-fueled
930-mile transportable variant, the Nodong-2, with the help of
Russian technicians. <sup>12</sup> 
<P>
Pyongyang began producing the 185-mile-range Scud-B in the mid-1980s,
after gaining advanced missile design knowledge from China and
from copying a <I>Scud-B</I> obtained from Egypt, most likely
in 1981. <sup>13</sup>  Pyongyang began production of the improved 300-mile-range
Scud-C in 1991 and is now estimated to be producing that missile
at a rate of 100 a year. The Scud-C is a mobile missile capable
of carrying high explosive, biological, or chemical warheads.
It has a range enabling it to reach all of South Korea. The North
is believed to maintain a total of 24 to 36 Scud-Cs in its Army.

<P>
According to Robert D. Walpole, Deputy Director of the CIA's Nonproliferation
Center, &quot;North Korea is the largest proliferator [in the
world] of ballistic missiles.&quot; <sup>14</sup>   Pyongyang uses missile sales
to earn hard cash for oil. By one estimate North Korea has sold
Iran and Syria a total of 320 Scud-Cs. <sup>15</sup>  It also has enhanced Iran's
missile production capability. In turn, Iran may be providing
North Korea with missile test facilities. <sup>16</sup>  Although North Korea
has discussed missile sales with Libya, Walpole believes that
Iran probably will be the first to purchase <I>Nodong</I> missiles.
<P>
<B>India and Pakistan. </B>India and Pakistan have fought each
other in 1947, 1966, and 1971. In recent years both countries
have almost come to blows over the disputed state of Kashmir in
Northern India. Their nuclear competition dates from the 1970s.
Although claiming not to be a nuclear state, India is believed
to have exploded a 12-kiloton nuclear device in 1974, and Shekhar
Gupta, Senior Editor of<I> India Today</I>, estimates India has
enough fissile material to build 60 bombs. <sup>17</sup>  The opposition Bharatiya
Janata Party (BJP) is committed to building a nuclear arsenal
and may lead the government after national elections early in
1996. Meanwhile, Pakistan is believed to have enough plutonium
for seven crude nuclear weapons. <sup>18</sup>  Senator Larry Pressler (R-SD)
charged in April of this year that he believes Pakistan has five
nuclear weapons and India possesses between five and ten. <sup>19</sup>  The
inability of the Bush Administration in 1990 to certify that Pakistan
lacked a nuclear weapon triggered provisions of the 1986 Pressler
Amendment barring U.S. military sales to Pakistan.
<P>
Both states are developing missiles that could be nuclear armed.
India is deploying the indigenously developed 150-mile-range Prithvi
 to reserve Army units. <sup>20</sup>  This is a liquid-fueled, mobile missile.
India is estimated to have 40 to 50 <I>Prithvi </I> missiles,
with the intention of building up to 80. <sup>21</sup>  In 1992 India tested
a variant of the liquid-fueled and immobile <I>Agni </I> missile
that flew over 1,500 miles. It is now considering deploying this
missile, <sup>22</sup> which is capable of reaching most of Pakistan and many
targets in China. Additionally, India is developing an Advanced
Space Launch Vehicle (ASLV) for commercial purposes, and this
could become a 2,500-mile-range missile. In 1993 the United States
stopped Russia from selling ICBM engine technology to India but
did go ahead and sell complete rocket engines that could assist
India in building more powerful missile engines.
<P>
With China's assistance, Pakistan began the development of its
Haft missiles in the early 1980s. First tested in 1989, the <I>Haft-1</I>
has a range of only 50 miles. Also under development are the 185-mile
<I>Haft-2 </I>and 375-mile <I>Haft-3</I> missiles. In 1991 U.S.
officials revealed that Pakistan was purchasing the 185-mile Chinese
M-11. <super23></sup>  Pakistan received transporter-erector-launchers for the
M-11 in February 1991 from China. In July 1995, U.S. spy satellites
discovered over 30 M-11 delivery cases at an air force base in
Pakistan. <sup>24</sup> 
<P>
Future Indian long-range ballistic missiles may be capable of
reaching U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. However,
India's and Pakistan's potential nuclear missile arsenals are
mainly to deter each other, while India also seeks to deter China.
While it would not threaten the United States, a nuclear missile
exchange between India and Pakistan would create incalculable
destruction and loss of life, fuel religious and ethnic conflict,
and destabilize South Asia and the Persian Gulf for decades.
<P>
<b>DIPLOMACY ALONE WILL NOT PREVENT PROLIFERATION </b>
<P>
Washington has tried diplomacy and sanctions to prevent nuclear
and missile proliferation in Asia. While these attempts have been
worthwhile, they have not stopped proliferation. China signed
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1992 but continues
to export nuclear technology. Most recently China is reported
to have sold Iran a calutron for enriching uranium, a critical
missing link in Iran's nuclear weapons program. <sup>25</sup>  China twice has
promised but failed to abide by the Missile Technology Control
Regime (MTCR), which forbids the sale of missiles with ranges
over 185 miles. <sup>26</sup>  However, evidence is accumulating that China
earlier this year shipped more than 30 M-11s to Pakistan. <sup>27</sup>
<P>
North Korea signed the NPT in 1985 but has failed to comply fully
with its terms. For example, it refused until 1992 to allow inspections
by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as required by
the pact and threatened to withdraw from the pact in March 1993
in reaction to IAEA requests to inspect a nuclear waste dump.
This dump, which would have yielded information on the extent
of North Korean plutonium production, still has not been inspected.
In addition, North Korea has yet to fulfill a pledge, made to
South Korea in 1991, to create a non-nuclear Korean Peninsula.
The threat of limited United Nations sanctions in 1994 forced
Pyongyang to agree to &quot;freeze&quot; its nuclear program.
In October 1994 North Korea agreed to freeze and then dismantle
its existing nuclear program in exchange for two light-water nuclear
power plants that would be financed and built by an international
consortium. However, the pact allows Pyongyang to delay full IAEA
inspections for five years or more and stipulates that these inspections
will not begin until &quot;significant components&quot; of the
reactors are delivered.
<P>
Pyongyang has challenged and will likely continue to challenge
the implementation of this complex agreement.<sup>28</sup>  Pyongyang's objections
to Seoul's role in building the proposed light-water reactors
heightened tensions and again led to a flurry of U.S.-North Korean
negotiations this Spring and to further delay in the agreement's
implementation. Meanwhile, it is possible that North Korea continues
nuclear weapons-related research and development in locations
unknown to the IAEA  which cannot undertake full-scope inspections.
North Korea also refuses to join the MTCR. North Korea's ability
to undermine the NPT and IAEA and flout the MTCR all demonstrate
the weakness of diplomacy in stemming nuclear proliferation.
<P>
Both India and Pakistan also have refused to sign the NPT and
join the MTCR. The Pressler Amendment sanctions against Pakistan,
which have barred U.S. military sales since 1990, have yet to
convince Islamabad to end its nuclear weapons program. The Bush
Administration tried, but failed, to convince India and Pakistan
to negotiate a South Asian Nuclear Free Zone.<sup>29</sup>  In 1994 Pakistan
rejected a Clinton Administration proposal that the United States
and NATO guarantee Pakistan's security if it denuclearized.<sup>30</sup>
<P>
<b>THE DANGERS OF A WEAKER U.S. DETERRENT IN ASIA</b>
<P>
America's extended nuclear and conventional force deterrent is
the foundation of security in the Asia-Pacific region. This American
commitment obviates the need for allies and friends to build their
own nuclear deterrent. The possibility of nuclear proliferation
in Asia increases when America's commitment is undermined, either
from Washington or by new nuclear threats. After China's threatening
July missile tests, in Taiwan's parliament on July 28, Taiwan
President Lee Teng-hui responded to a question from opposition
Democratic Progressive Party member Liu Jui-hsiung on whether
Taiwan should develop nuclear weapons. &quot;Whether [we] need
nuclear weapons would require long-term study,&quot; Lee said.
&quot;Taiwan used to have the capability to build nuclear weapons
but it caused international concern and damaged the country's
image.&quot;<sup>31</sup> 
<P>
Indeed, it was the Carter Administration's decision to end diplomatic
relations with Taiwan and its attempt to reduce U.S. troops in
South Korea that increased interest in nuclear weapons in both
countries. Washington convinced Taipei not to proceed with attempts
to acquire plutonium in the late 1970s and to end nuclear weapons-related
research in the late 1980s.<sup>32</sup>  A retired South Korean general has
disclosed that in the late 1970s South Korea almost completed
an atomic bomb, but the project stopped after pressure from Washington.<sup>33</sup>

<P>
Although, although Japan's national policy since 1971 has been
not to manufacture, possess, or allow the introduction of nuclear
weapons into Japan, in 1994 then-Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata unnerved
many with the comment that &quot;It is certainly the case that
Japan has the capability to possess nuclear weapons, but has not
made them.&quot;<sup>34</sup>  Only a series of cataclysmic events, such as
a rupture of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty combined with nuclear
proliferation on the Korean Peninsula, would likely move Japan
to build nuclear weapons.<sup>35</sup> 
<P>
Missile technology is also widespread throughout Asia. Japan's
H-2 commercial space-launch vehicle conceivably could be turned
into a 9,300-mile-range ICBM. The South Korean Army deploys the
150-mile <I>NHK-1 </I>tactical missile. In June, Seoul reportedly
asked Washington to scrap a 1979 agreement that bars South Korea
from building missiles that travel more than 180 miles.<sup>36</sup>  Taipei
is developing the 80-mile-range<I> Green Bee</I> tactical missile
and the 600-mile-range <I>Sky Horse</I> missile.
<P>
<b>MISSILE DEFENSES BENEFIT ASIANS AND AMERICANS</b>
<P>
Missile defense systems will increase the security of American
forces deployed abroad. At the same time, they can benefit the
United States and its Asian allies in other ways. For example:
<P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Anti-missile systems offer a deterrent far less threatening
than nuclear weapons.</B>
<P>
Anti-missile systems are a less destabilizing way to deter attack
from nuclear missile-armed states.  Should a non-nuclear Asian
state build nuclear weapons, other non-nuclear states will be
inclined to follow suit. This is a recipe for further proliferation.
<P>
<LI><B>Anti-missile defenses reduce vulnerability to nuclear blackmail.</B>
<P>
China's July missile tests were intended to threaten Taiwan. With
appropriate anti-missile systems, Taiwan would not be as vulnerable
to future Chinese threats. Moreover, with adequate defenses, South
Korea and Japan could better withstand potential North Korean
or Chinese demands backed by nuclear missile threats.
<P>
<LI><B>Missile defenses are insurance against accidental nuclear
missile launches.</B>
<P>
China is undergoing a near-term leadership transition in which
the military could emerge as a nationalist force. Because political
stability cannot be assured, concerns that the political leadership
may lose control of China's nuclear weapons cannot be dismissed.<sup>38</sup>
 Control of some of China's nuclear weapons may have been contested
in 1967, as reports indicate that the commander of the Chinese
military region containing the Lop Nor nuclear test facilities
rebelled briefly against Mao Tse-tung.<sup>39</sup>  In North Korea, presumed
leader Kim Jong-Il's intentions toward South Korea remain unclear,
while accurate knowledge of his health and mental stability is
lacking. Were he to be replaced by a faction bent on heightening
tensions with South Korea, the chances of an accidental missile
launch would grow.
<P>
<LI><B>Cooperation in missile defenses can build political confidence
in Asia.</B>
<P>
As missile defenses are non-threatening and reduce threats to
Asian population centers, multilateral efforts led by the United
States can enhance security, promote defense cooperation, and
advance U.S. leadership with Asian allies and friends. These measures
would decrease mistrust and increase confidence between Asian
countries.
<P>
<LI><B>Missile defenses can create incentives to reduce both nuclear
weapons and ballistic missiles.</B>
<P>
For example, if both India and Pakistan possessed missile defenses,
there would be less incentive to launch missile attacks against
each other. A reduction in the utility of nuclear missiles could
enhance mutual confidence, opening the door to negotiations on
limiting and reducing nuclear and missile forces. Similarly, if
the ROC possessed adequate missile defenses, Taipei would have
a greater incentive to propose confidence-building measures with
Beijing. It could ask, for example, that Beijing join it in agreeing
not to deploy tactical or intermediate-range missiles within a
threatening proximity. If the U.S. and its Asian allies were to
create a regional missile defense system, they would have greater
credibility in approaching China, perhaps in the ASEAN Regional
Forum, about beginning a dialogue on shared missile defense systems.
This could serve as an incentive for Beijing to limit its short-range
and intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
<P></OL>
<b>MISSILE DEFENSES WILL STRENGTHEN ASIAN SECURITY</b>
<P>
American extended deterrence and forward deployment of conventional
forces serve as the foundation for Asian security. In order to
strengthen deterrence and security in Asia, the United States
must take the lead in dealing with Asia's emerging next threat:
 the proliferation of nuclear-armed missiles. The United States
is the only country with the technical and moral strength to counter
the growing missile threat in Asia.
<P>
Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger in 1985 invited Australia,
Japan, and South Korea to participate in the Strategic Defense
Initiative.<sup>40</sup>  Only Japan responded positively, allowing private
companies in 1987 to participate in missile defense architecture
studies with the U.S. Department of Defense. The Clinton Administration
has built on this by seeking Japanese technological contributions
to missile defense systems more aggressively and by offering Theater
Missile Defense (TMD) systems on a commercial basis.
<P>
But the Administration's Asian missile defense architecture is
hobbled by its decision to abandon the Bush Administration's more
ambitious Global Protection Against Limited Strikes (GPALS) program.
The Clinton Administration is limiting the U.S. missile defense
program to theater-based, short-range systems. The Administration
refuses to build space-based missile defense systems, like boost-phase
interceptors, that have a better chance of defending the United
States and its allies from missile attack. An active missile defense
strategy toward Asia can strengthen U.S. leadership by:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Creating a major post-Cold War mission for the Asian-American
alliance system. </B>Building a regional missile defense architecture
is a service that only America can provide. A secure and stable
Asia will foster growth in job-creating U.S.-Asia trade. Equally
important, by cooperating with Washington to develop and fund
missile defenses, Asian nations for the first time will be able
to share the burden of defending the United States and other countries
from nuclear missile threats.
<P>
<LI><B>Confirming the benign and defensive intent of American strategy
in Asia. </B>American leadership in missile defenses would offer
allied and friendly Asian states the same protection from limited
nuclear attack or nuclear blackmail that  Americans enjoy. Such
defenses threaten only the offensive weapons of potential aggressor
states in Asia.
<P>
<LI><B>Reversing the growing impression in Asia of American retreat
and weak leadership. </B>
<P>
The Clinton Administration's policy flip-flops toward China, attempts
to manage trade with Japan, and inaction in response to aggressive
acts by China in the South China Sea and against Taiwan have reduced
American credibility in Asia. By exercising strong leadership
in missile defenses, Washington can regain lost political momentum
and begin to reverse diplomatic damage. A strategy to accomplish
this goal would entail:
<P>
<OL>
<LI><b>Building and deploying a missile defense system for the United
States.</b>
<P>
A National Missile Defense (NMD) system is needed not only to
defend Americans, but to demonstrate to U.S. allies and friends
that they too need not be vulnerable to nuclear attack or blackmail.
Such a goal is both feasible and affordable. Earlier this year,
a team of experts assembled by The Heritage Foundation recommended
a National Missile Defense system based initially on the Navy's
Upper Tier proposal. This is an advanced high-velocity version
of the Navy's <I>Standard</I> surface-to-air missile system deployed
in AEGIS cruisers and destroyers. Its guidance would be assisted
by the <I>Brilliant Eyes</I> early warning and tracking satellite.
The Heritage plan then calls for Upper Tier to be supplemented
by space-based defenses, to include space-based missile interceptors
and lasers. The cost of the Upper Tier, <i>Brilliant Eyes,</i> and space
based systems is estimated to be about $25 billion over 15 years.<sup>41</sup>
 At the same time, it is critical that the U.S. retain adequate
offensive nuclear systems, although NMD would allow the U.S. to
reduce its nuclear deterrent forces.<sup>42</sup>
<P>
Space-based missile defense systems also would enable the U.S.
to complement any future TMD capabilities of its Asian allies.
If U.S. space-based interceptors or lasers did not destroy hostile
missiles early in their flight, U.S. satellites could help direct
Asian-based interceptors to their targets. Some countries in Asia,
like Australia, oppose a U.S. National Missile Defense program
because it might lead to abrogating the 1973 Anti-Ballistic Missile
(ABM) Treaty. Washington should tell its friends that it seeks
ultimately to renegotiate the ABM Treaty with Russia to allow
for a limited national defense against missiles but that, in the
meantime, the ABM Treaty does not prohibit the United States from
deploying theater missile defenses in Asia.
<P>
<LI><b>Accelerating development and deployment of the Navy's Upper
Tier TMD system to the Pacific Fleet and the Army's THAAD TMD
system to U.S. forces in South Korea and Japan.</b>
<P>
The Clinton Administration should increase funding for the Navy's
Upper Tier TMD system, THAAD, and the Brilliant Eyes early warning
satellite. These TMD systems are needed urgently to defend U.S.
naval and ground forces in Asia.<sup>43</sup>  The Navy's Upper Tier system
is especially important because its mobility will enable the U.S.
Pacific Command to deploy a TMD system near South Korea or Taiwan.
This system also will protect U.S. naval forces within range of
Chinese medium-range missiles. The THAAD system is needed to defend
U.S. forces in South Korea and Japan against North Korean Scud
 and <I>Nodong </I> missiles. Accelerated development of Upper
Tier and THAAD would make these systems more rapidly available
for sale to U.S. allies.
<P>
<LI><b>Encouraging Japan, South Korea, and Australia to acquire advanced
U.S. TMD systems and promote multilateral missile defense cooperation.</b>
<P>
Washington should urge its major allies in Asia to purchase TMD
systems, enter into co-development programs, and then explore
multilateral cooperation in missile defense activities. Japan
is slowly developing a political consensus to purchase an advanced
U.S.-based TMD system. According to a recent study of potential
missile defense architectures for Japan, completed by private
U.S. and Japanese companies, a Japanese TMD system could include
advanced Patriot, THAAD, and naval-based Upper Tier systems guided
by missile targeting systems built into AWACS radar aircraft.
Washington should urge Tokyo to decide quickly on missile defense
architecture and to purchase those systems from the United States.
<P>
South Korea has a clear requirement to defend itself against North
Korean missiles. Therefore, it is interested in obtaining TMD
systems. Washington should urge Seoul to place a much higher priority
on purchasing TMD systems from the U.S. South Korea now relies
on the approximately 192 Patriot  missiles deployed in the Spring
of 1994, which mainly protect U.S. forces in South Korea and are
not enough to defend ROK forces or cities.<sup>44</sup>
<P>
Australia, which refused to join the 1985 U.S. offer of SDI international
cooperation, finally signed a missile defense research agreement
with the U.S. in June 1995.<sup>45</sup>  During the Gulf War, a jointly manned
early warning satellite downlink in Nurrungar, Australia, helped
target attacking Iraqi Scud  missiles. The U.S. should encourage
Australia to consider purchasing naval-based Upper Tier systems
and placing them in air defense frigates which Australia plans
to build. Washington should ask Canberra to consider hosting a
multinational missile defense early warning observation facility
at Nurrungar. The facility would be open to Western allies cooperating
in missile defense and to other states seeking neutral enforcement
mechanisms for missile control or reduction agreements.
<P>
Washington also should encourage missile defense cooperation between
South Korea and Japan. The major reason for this is to help South
Korea avoid any unintended damage from Chinese or North Korean
missiles destroyed on their way to Japan. When the Upper Tier
AEGIS cruisers are introduced to the 7th Fleet, the U.S. Navy
should demonstrate their capability to allies and friends in Southeast
Asia and make their use a regular part of multilateral exercises,
like <I>KANGAROO</I> in Australia and <I>RIMPAC,</I> conducted
bi-annually with most U.S. allies and friends in Asia.
<P>
<LI><b>Telling China to live up to its nonproliferation commitments
and offering to share missile defense technology if China agrees
to verifiable nuclear missile limitation.</b>
<P>
Washington should continue to urge Beijing to abide fully by the
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and to join the Missile Technology
Control Regime. Washington also should urge Beijing to make its
nuclear weapons programs more transparent and to consider eventual
limitations on its nuclear arsenal. But added pressure on China
is needed. The Chinese should be told that if they do not curb
nuclear technology cooperation with countries like Pakistan and
Iran, and missile sales to Pakistan, China will begin to define
itself as an adversary.
<P>
The Clinton Administration should obey the 1990 Arms Export Control
Act that obligates the United States to impose trade sanctions
on China because of its sale of missiles to Pakistan. U.S. intelligence
agencies believe China has shipped over 30 M-11 missiles to Pakistan.
This charge cannot be swept under the rug. Failure to respond
to China's sale of missiles makes a mockery of the Administration's
nonproliferation policies. The Clinton Administration should devise
a graduated schedule of sanctions that will be ended when China
joins the MTCR.
<P>
Clinton should also explain to the Chinese that missile defenses
are a justified and moral response to China's continued nuclear
weapons buildup and its demonstrated willingness to engage in
nuclear threats. Washington should tell Beijing that if it agrees
to talks aimed at verifiable limits on its nuclear arsenal, the
U.S. will make available to China early warning data.
<P>
<LI><b>Selling advanced TMD systems to Taiwan, consistent with the
Taiwan Relations Act, and preparing U.S. naval TMD forces to help
defend Taiwan.</b>
<P>
The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) calls for the U.S. to &quot;provide
Taiwan with arms of a defensive character&quot; and to &quot;maintain
the capacity of the United States to resist any resort to force
or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security,
or the social economic system of the people of Taiwan.&quot; 
Following China's missile &quot;tests&quot; designed to threaten
Taiwan, sale of missile defense systems to Taiwan is consistent
with the TRA. Raytheon Company is helping Taiwan build a variant
of the Patriot PAC-2 called the Modified Air Defense System.<sup>46</sup> 
Since this program does not respond to Taiwan's immediate defense
needs, Washington should offer Taipei the more capable <I>Patriot</I>
 PAC-2 GEM  the most advanced variant in the U.S. Army  and consider
offering THAAD if Beijing persists in threatening Taipei. Washington
should make clear to Beijing that the sale of missile defense
systems to Taiwan does not threaten China. Rather, the purpose
is to prevent China's nuclear blackmail of Taiwan. Washington
also should prepare to use 7th Fleet AEGIS cruisers and destroyers
armed with the Standard Upper Tier TMD missiles to defend Taiwan,
consistent with the TRA.
<P>
<LI><b>Offering India and Pakistan a deal:  If they agree to negotiate
verifiable limits and reductions of their nuclear and missile
forces, the U.S. will offer them access to satellite intelligence
to verify agreements and technology to help defend against missile
attack.</b>
<P>
To advance non-proliferation initiatives between India and Pakistan,
the United States should offer both countries missile defenses
and technology if they agree to limit and reduce their nuclear
and missile arsenals. A verifiable treaty to limit such systems
might be facilitated by giving Indian and Pakistani officials
access to a U.S. monitor that receives data from U.S. early warning
and reconnaissance satellites or a similar monitor placed in another
location. A monitor would enable both countries to observe each
other's military sites and provide warning of a first strike.
The agreement could be strengthened later by the sale of ground-based
TMD systems to both countries. After acquiring space-based missile
defense systems, the U.S. might help enforce an Indian-Pakistan
nuclear and missile reduction treaty by extending space-based
missile defense coverage to both countries. Space-based defenses
also could give Washington the option to intervene unilaterally
to prevent a disastrous nuclear exchange.
</OL>
</UL>
<P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>
The United States must develop a missile defense strategy for
Asia. Missile defenses are needed to enhance the security of U.S.
military forces in Asia, to safeguard America's Asian friends
and allies, and to encourage multilateral missile defense cooperation.
This strategy is sorely needed to enable Americans and Asians
to reduce their vulnerability to Chinese and future North Korean
nuclear missiles. Both countries have demonstrated they are prepared
to disregard conventions like the NPT and MTCR. China's willingness
to use missiles to intimidate neighbors like Taiwan, in addition
to concerns about instability in China or North Korea, compels
Americans and Asians to plan jointly for appropriate missile defenses.
<P>
Only the United States has the technical capability and the moral
vision to prevent its allies from falling victim to nuclear blackmail
or engaging in destabilizing nuclear proliferation. By responding
to the threat of nuclear missiles in Asia, the U.S. can counter
perhaps the most critical emerging threat to peace in that region.
At the same time, by demonstrating determination to counter this
threat, Washington will be strengthening its extended nuclear
and conventional deterrent in Asia while lessening the possibility
that Asia could become destabilized by nuclear proliferation.

Director, Congressional Relations, U.S. House of Representatives
<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Buoyed by the dramatic outcome of the 1994 elections, conservatives had high expectations for the incoming Congress. For the first time in 40 years, conservatives assumed key leadership roles in both chambers. Particularly encouraging were the members of the incoming House freshman class, many of whom had based their successful campaigns on the Contract With America and its bold commitment to reforming Congress and reducing the size and scope of government.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although President Clinton repeatedly has vetoed major legislation, conservatives have achieved amazing success in transforming government and the way Congress does business. Despite setbacks and retreats, the 104th Congress has met the high expectations of conservatives in several key areas by beginning a revolutionary reversal of failed liberal policies in such areas as welfare, agriculture, and regulation.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The successes of the 104th Congress are particularly significant when measured against the records of previous Congresses. While this Congress adopted significant government reforms with only narrow majorities, the New Deal and Great Society Congresses had large liberal majorities. Moreover, the legislation passed by those lawmakers was championed and signed by liberal Presidents. Although the revolution remains to be completed, conservatives should appreciate the progress that has been made.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No assessment of the 104th Congress would be complete without a recognition of what could have been accomplished if the President had not vetoed critical legislation. The most important accomplishment of this Congress was a balanced budget bill which would have eliminated the deficit by the year 2002 while mandating $245 billion in critical tax reductions. American families would have benefited from a $500 per child tax credit.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This legislation not only represented the first balanced budget in 26 years, but also contained significant reforms in government programs which would have returned power to states and communities. In spite of the President's obstructionism, however, Congress succeeded in reducing discretionary spending for the first time since 1969. As submitted, the President's FY 1996 budget would have raised the deficit to $211 billion; Congress deserves the taxpayer's credit for cutting the Administration's projected deficit nearly in half.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps the most notable achievement of the 104th Congress was its overhaul of the nation's welfare system. While the President twice vetoed welfare reform bills, he indicated that he would sign a third which differed from the first two bills only in minor respects. This historic legislation ends the federal entitlement to welfare, contains real work requirements and time limits, and fights illegitimacy. President Clinton promised to "end welfare as we know it."  But it was conservatives in Congress who made this promise a reality. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In many other areas, Congress succeeded in adopting conservative, commonsense alternatives to liberal approaches advanced by the Clinton Administration and its allies on Capitol Hill. Congress restored funding for important national security programs that were slashed by the Administration and its allies in Congress. Lawmakers deregulated telecommunications, stemmed the tide of costly new mandates, and stopped unjustified new regulations. Congress delivered on its promise to enact specific measures to improve federal crime-fighting efforts and help state and local officials combat violent crime. In addition, the 104th Congress gave the President the line-item veto.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Conservatives in the last Congress stopped the Clinton health care bill that would have led to socialized medicine; this Congress passed a scaled-down version of health care reform that had as its primary goal enhancing portability of health insurance. However, Congress did not address the flawed tax treatment of employment-based health insurance that produces costly distortions in the health care market, undermines consumer choice, and restricts access to health insurance.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In spite of its success in other areas, Congress has more work to do to complete work on other conservative objectives. Lawmakers failed to pass legislation to end racial preferences. They were unable to end government funding for left-wing political activities. They failed to close down the Energy, Education, Commerce, or Housing Departments. The National Endowment for the Arts and the Legal Services Corporation live on. But Congress did achieve cuts in all of these programs that were unthinkable before 1994.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It took 60 years to build the modern welfare state, and it will take more than just two years to do what is needed to reform it. The 104th Congress, however, has taken significant steps to reduce the size of the federal government and to empower states, local communities, and individuals. President Clinton has stated that "the era of big government is over."  The 104th Congress actually has done something to turn this rhetoric into reality.

<a href="/heritage/issues96/bud_2.gif">Chart 2</a>: Comparing of Deficit Reduction Plans
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
After nearly 18 months of trying to block congressional efforts to enact a seven-year plan to balance the federal budget, President Bill Clinton is now jumping to take credit for the recent news that the FY 1996 deficit will fall to $117 billion -- some $29 billion below the Office of Management and Budget's March estimate and the lowest dollar level since 1981. But not only is the falling deficit none of Clinton's doing; the record shows that he repeatedly blocked Congress's efforts to enact an honest long-term plan to balance the federal budget.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Clinton's claim is especially surprising when one considers that in February 1995, he submitted an FY 1996 budget to Congress that would have raised the deficit to $211 billion, or $94 billion higher than is now expected.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It is Congress that deserves taxpayers' credit for cutting Clinton's proposed $211 billion FY 1996 deficit nearly in half. This happened because Congress rejected Clinton's plan and acted to curb spending. According to Congressional Budget Office predictions, the Clinton policies would have perpetuated $200 billion-plus deficits well into the next century. Furthermore, had Clinton not vetoed Congress's Balanced Budget Act of 1995, which included $17 billion in entitlement savings for FY 1996, this year's deficit actually would be less than $100 billion rather than the $117 billion for which Clinton now claims credit.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

But this has been the White House's pattern throughout the budget battle with Congress: First block congressional initiatives, then claim credit for the good news. Since Clinton sent his budget-busting FY 1996 budget to Capitol Hill, he has proposed seven "balanced budget plans."  Each of these plans -- including Clinton's FY 1997 budget -- proposed higher spending and higher taxes, and as a result, each would have added more to the national debt than the balanced budget plans produced by Congress.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

There are a variety of reasons the deficit is now $173 billion lower than its peak of $290 billion in 1992. Clinton policies, however, generally are not among them. Some of the factors:<ul>

<p><li><b>Domestic discretionary cutbacks pushed by Congress.</b> Although Clinton blocked the entitlement reforms embodied in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, Congress was able to reverse the growth of discretionary -- or annually appropriated -- spending. Thanks to congressional pressure for program terminations and major cuts, FY 1996 discretionary spending will experience its first decline since 1969.<sup>1</sup>  More than 270 separate programs, offices, agencies, projects, and divisions were eliminated completely. Many other programs, such as the National Endowment for the Arts, the Appalachian Regional Commission, and the Legal Services Corporation, were cut by more than one-third.

<p><li><b>The turnaround in the savings and loan program.</b> A significant contributor to the soaring deficits under George Bush was the high taxpayer cost of bailing out failed savings and loan institutions. In FY 1991, for example, $66 billion in taxpayer-financed bailout costs was added to the federal deficit. In FY 1992, these costs totaled $2.6 billion. This year, however, this program is expected to bring in over $15 billion in new revenue to the Treasury as assets acquired during the bailout are sold to the private sector. Between FY 1992 and FY 1996, this budgetary reversal (from a program adding to the deficit to one reducing the deficit by generating revenues) amounts to an $18 billion swing in the deficit -- 10 percent of the deficit change between FY 1992 and FY 1996.

<p><li><b>New revenues from selling the electromagnetic spectrum.</b> The White House currently estimates that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auction of telecommunications spectrum to private industry will generate over $10 billion in new revenues in FY 1996. These new revenues are considered "offsetting collections."  This means they are subtracted from the expenditures column of the federal register rather than added to the tax revenue column, thus giving the appearance that federal spending is lower than it actually is. In 1992, when the deficit reached its record level, the government did not auction telecommunications spectrum; it simply gave it away at no cost, and therefore at no benefit to the Treasury. Clinton is reaping this windfall.

<p><li><b>Defense cutbacks.</b> The White House now estimates the government will spend roughly $266 billion on national defense in FY 1996 -- $37 billion less than in FY 1992. These cutbacks, initiated by the Bush Administration, reflect the fall of the Soviet Union. Under the Clinton Administration, defense spending has fallen to roughly 3.6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and less than 17 percent of overall federal spending. Both levels are lower than at any point since before World War II. By contrast, when the young Bill Clinton had his picture taken with President John F. Kennedy in the White House Rose Garden, defense consumed 50 percent of all federal spending and about 10 percent of the nation's economy.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Combined, the last three items alone account for $65 billion, or 38 percent, of the overall drop in the deficit since 1992.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>A Tax Revenue Windfall.</b> OMB currently projects that tax revenues will total $1.453 trillion in FY 1996, nearly $27 billion higher than was estimated in March. It appears that these new tax collections are a one-time windfall rather than a sign of improved economic conditions. According to OMB, "the Administration believes that most of this increase comes from higher-than-anticipated collections of non-withheld individual income taxes."  In other words, it is possible that this windfall is the result of investors cashing in on capital gains because of the rise in the stock market and the possibility of an agreement between Congress and the White House on a cut in the capital gains tax.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The rise in tax collections from the doldrums of the Bush recession is a significant factor in the declining deficit. Since 1992, tax revenues have grown by $363 billion, or one-third. During the Bush recession, however, tax revenues grew an average of only 3.8 percent per year, half the average annual growth rate between 1948 and 1996. The combined effect of tax collections returning to their historic year-over-year growth rates and Congress keeping federal spending from growing faster than these new collections has made a significant dent in the deficit picture.
<p>

<b>CLINTON'S RHETORIC VERSUS REALITY<sup>2</sup></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Clinton's record throughout the budget debate with Congress stands in stark contrast with his public rhetoric. At every turn during the past 18 months, Clinton stood in the way of smaller government and real long-term deficit reduction. The record is clear:
<p>

<b>Clinton Budget #1:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In February 1995, the Clinton Administration responded to the 1994 election results by presenting a status-quo FY 1996 budget to the new Congress. This budget deviated little from "baseline" forecasts which projected $200 billion deficits through the end of the decade.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

According to the CBO, the President's February budget would have increased the deficit from an estimated $177 billion in 1995 to $276 billion in 2000. Spending would grow an average of 5 percent per year, some $422 billion in all in just five years. On May 19, 1995, the Senate defeated Clinton's budget plan by a vote of 99 to 0.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #2:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On June 13, 1995, after months of criticizing congressional balanced budget efforts while offering no plan of his own, Clinton presented a second budget plan which he claimed balanced the budget in ten years, by FY 2005. This plan, barely 30 pages in length, fared no better than Clinton's first effort under CBO scrutiny. According to CBO, in addition to not balancing the budget, it would have produced $200 billion deficits for at least the next ten years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Due to revised economic forecasts, the Administration later said that this plan would balance the budget in nine years. However, the CBO maintained that it would never have balanced the budget. Indeed, CBO found less than $400 billion in legitimate deficit reduction in this Clinton offer -- $350 billion short of the total seven-year deficit reduction in the Balanced Budget Act.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #3:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On December 7, the day Clinton vetoed the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, he presented yet a third budget plan. The Administration claimed that this plan also would balance the budget in seven years but was more in line with the President's priorities than the one he had vetoed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Once again, CBO found that the Administration's numbers failed to reach a balanced budget by 2002. While this budget plan proposed larger savings from discretionary spending programs and welfare reform compared to the June budget, it also proposed smaller savings in Medicare and Medicaid. In total, Clinton's third budget produced only $385 billion in credible deficit reduction over seven years -- $365 billion short of the savings achieved by the BBA he had vetoed. Moreover, according to the CBO, instead of balancing the budget in FY 2002 as advertised, it would leave a deficit of $115 billion in that year.
<p>

<b>Clinton Budget #4:</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


On December 15, after two weeks of negotiations with congressional leaders, Clinton presented a fourth budget plan. But this plan was mostly an iteration of Budget Plan #3 and contained no new policy recommendations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The CBO scored this plan as still $69 billion out of balance in FY 2002. The Administration tried to make up its shortcomings in reducing the deficit by challenging CBO technical and economic estimates. The Administration had been arguing for weeks that CBO's economic assumptions were too conservative and thus required excessively deep spending cuts to balance the budget. In making this argument, the Administration wanted to have it both ways. While claiming that it wanted to balance the budget, it actually wanted to spend more money as the budget was moving toward balance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On December 18, 1995, the House defeated this plan by a vote of 412 to 0.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #5:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On January 6, 1996, Clinton presented a fifth budget plan. This plan, largely adapted from a proposal by Senate Democrats, was certified by CBO to balance the budget in seven years, at least on paper. Though it mathematically balances the budget in seven years, however, the fifth Clinton budget fell far short of being a credible plan. The reasons: 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Most of the heavy lifting of deficit reduction was required in the two years following the end of Clinton's possible second term as President. Indeed, 62 percent of the plan's $583 billion in deficit reduction falls in FY 2001 and FY 2002. For example, the plan called for $102 billion in Medicare savings over seven years, but 63 percent of these savings were to come in the last two years. Similarly, the plan called for $37 billion in discretionary spending cuts beyond the savings needed to achieve a "hard freeze" in these programs, yet 95 percent of these additional savings fell in the last two years of the plan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

While the fifth Clinton budget plan called for $87 billion in gross tax cuts ($17 billion in net tax cuts) over seven years, these cuts were sunsetted in FY 2001 -- one year before the budget was to be balanced. This means taxes would have to be raised. Mathematically, such a ploy "boosts" tax revenues by at least $15 billion in FY 2002 and thus requires fewer spending cuts to achieve a balanced budget. The overall size of the tax cut proposal was reduced by the plan's call for $60 billion in new revenue from closing "corporate loopholes."  Some 43 percent of the revenues generated from these tax hikes would be received in FY 2002.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #6:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The sixth Clinton budget was submitted on January 9. This plan moved only slightly beyond the previous plans, modestly increasing the proposed savings from Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare reform while slightly boosting the size of the tax cuts. Overall, this Clinton plan would produce nearly $160 billion less in budget savings and nearly $70 billion less in deficit reduction than the last congressional offer. Moreover, the White House still avoided the fundamental reforms in Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare needed to achieve budget savings and restructure the programs.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #7</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The seventh Clinton plan was submitted to Congress on January 18. This budget plan was essentially identical to the January 9 plan except that it substantially increased the amount of new revenues it would generate from closing "corporate tax loopholes" and other such devices. Because of these new revenues, the net size of the tax cut would have been reduced to a mere $36 billion over seven years.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #8: The FY 1997 Budget</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Like the seven budget plans that preceded it during the past year, the FY 1997 Clinton budget, presented to Congress February 5, would have forced hard-working Americans to pay higher taxes in exchange for more spending on programs which have become old and obsolete, or which are ripe for termination, privatization, or transfer to state control. Indeed, compared with the FY 1997 budget resolution passed by Congress in May, Clinton's FY 1997 budget would mean nearly $1,500 in higher taxes and $3,500 in higher spending for every household in America over the next six years. Moreover, the Clinton plan ignores the fundamental problems facing the government's major entitlement and welfare programs. Clinton has shirked his responsibility to address, for instance, a Medicare program facing insolvency, a Medicaid program that is bankrupting state budgets, and a welfare system that perpetuates a culture of poverty.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Repeated gimmicks and ploys such as these indicate that the Clinton Administration probably never has been serious about reaching a balanced budget agreement with Congress. At every turn, President Clinton has fought attempts to cut spending -- or even to reduce the growth rate of spending. Incredibly, Clinton now claims credit for reducing the deficit to a 15-year low when, in fact, it would have been lower had he not vetoed Congress's Balanced Budget Act of 1995. The truth is that Congress deserves credit for reversing Clinton policies which would have perpetuated a $200 billion deficit into the next century. The record is clear: Bill Clinton prefers keeping money in the hands of Washington bureaucrats to keeping it in the pockets of American taxpayers.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress has kept its promise to the American people that it would begin to cut regulatory red tape and return common sense to regulation. It has reduced the size and cost of government and increased the health and well-being of all Americans. But alarmists have done a good job of convincing the American people that exactly the opposite has been true, seizing the moral high ground with rhetoric designed to convince the public that a reformed regulatory system would have disastrous consequences. Nevertheless, this Congress can point to a record of solid reforms and progress toward a more flexible and less burdensome regulatory system that will cost less and achieve the same or higher levels of public health, safety, and environmental protection.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What is the reality?  Legislation passed by the 104th Congress and signed into law:
<p>
<ul> 
<li> Repealed the federally mandated 55-mph speed limit that had been on the books since 1974.
<p>
<li> Deregulated two major industries: agriculture and telecommunications. Farmers will now be able to grow what their customers want, not what bureaucrats demand.
<p>
<li> Stemmed the tide of costly new unfunded mandates on states and localities.
<p>
<li> Moved away from "one-size-fits-all" regulations by making it easier for the needs of small businesses to be taken into consideration.
<p>
<li> Established clear goals for agencies to reduce the paperwork burden, which will save Americans as much as 70 million hours of their time (valued at more than $1 billion) this year to use for more productive activities.
<p>
<li> Made itself directly accountable to the public by giving itself the authority to review and stop burdensome, unjustified new regulations developed by federal regulators.
<p>
<li> Forced a review by the Clinton Administration of all existing and proposed federal regulations.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition, Congress:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Passed and sent to the President the Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act, which would have required federal regulators to follow a set of rational principles in deciding whether and how to regulate. These include the use of cost-benefit analysis, sound science, and risk assessment, as well as market-based alternatives and performance standards. President Clinton vetoed this bill.
<p>
<li> Passed and sent to the President with bipartisan support the Common Sense Liability Reform Act which would have curbed abuses of the legal system by relieving the crushing burden of frivolous and unfounded cases brought against state and local governments, charitable organizations, and America's product manufacturers. President Clinton vetoed this bill.
<p>
<li> Passed legislation to reduce the existing burdens of the Safe Drinking Water Act, one the largest unfunded environmental mandates. Signed by President Clinton on August 6, 1996, the legislation will give states and localities the flexibility to target their resources more effectively to achieve greater levels of protection.
<p>
<li> Started an important national debate about how to resurrect commonsense regulation. This Congress, for example, introduced proposals to restructure the Superfund program in ways that would encourage faster cleanups, eliminate most of the need for lawyers and the courts, and reduce federal spending while improving public health, safety, and the environment. Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration so far has blocked reform, choosing to leave in place a program in which one-third of the money will continue to go to lawyers and transaction costs while failing to clean up many of the most hazardous waste sites.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Taken together, in just 18 months this Congress has accomplished and initiated the most significant changes in more than 20 years, and has changed the terms of the debate in a way that will affect the shape of federal regulation for decades.

<p>
<b>THE BOLDEST AGENDA IN 20 YEARS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Alarmists did a good job in this first round, convincing the American public that regulatory reform was just another term for the rollback of important public health, safety, and environmental protections. As a result, Congress has not yet seen many of its most ambitious efforts to reform the Superfund program, the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water and Clean Air Acts, the Food and Drug Administration, or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration signed into law. Many in Congress believe they lost the battle to reduce the burden of regulation and cut away the approximately $700 billion in red tape<sup>2</sup> that strangles American businesses and consumers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Nothing, however, could be further from the truth. In less than two years, the 104th Congress accomplished unprecedented and far-reaching reforms that impose discipline on the federal regulatory decisionmaking process, deregulate the agriculture and telecommunications industries, and fundamentally change the way the federal government and the American people think about public health, safety, and environmental regulation.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>Surpassing Reagan.</b> The regulatory agenda of the 104th Congress is the boldest of the past 20 years. The successful enactment of legislation to deregulate the agriculture and telecommunications industries is comparable to the transportation deregulation successes of the late 1970s.<sup>3</sup>  Although the Reagan Administration had bold intentions to reverse the growth of economic and social regulation, the completed action fell short. Other than modest steps to deregulate the energy and communications industries and a new administrative review process that enjoyed some success in reducing the rate and cost of new rules, for example, the Reagan Administration could not follow through with new versions of the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and Superfund, or with FDA or OSHA reform.<sup>4</sup>  Thus, the 104th Congress stands alone in the scope and scale of its reform efforts. Until now, the deregulatory accomplishments of the last 20 years focused on freeing industries to rely on market forces. But the 104th Congress also has taken on for the first time the rapid expansion of major health, safety, and environmental programs which have increased steadily since the 1970s. The costs of these "social" regulations, particularly environmental regulation, has almost tripled over the last 20 years from about $80 billion in 1977 to more than $220 billion in 1995.<sup>5</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress needed to take such bold action because the problems have never been worse. For example:
<p>
<ul>
<li> According to <a href="/atr/1.html">Americans for Tax Reform</a>, the total cost of government has been estimated at $3.38 trillion, nearly $1 trillion of which results from federal and state regulation. The federal government is responsible for imposing more than $700 billion in regulatory costs each year: more than $2,800 for every man, woman, and child in America. Of the 366 days in 1996, the average American will work 184.6 days for the government. More than 40 of these days will be just to pay for the cost of federal regulations.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
<li> As the number of regulations has grown, so has the number of federal regulators enforcing these rules. The number of permanent, full-time regulatory staff has increased from 69,946 in 1970 to 128,566 in 1994.<sup>7</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
 And more is not always better. A seminal new study from Harvard University reveals that roughly 60,000 lives are lost every year because of the current command-and-control regulatory system, which squanders billions of dollars on efforts to eliminate risks that are negligible or nonexistent while failing to protect the public from others that are much more serious.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress has fought to bring common sense back to the way federal agencies make decisions about whether and how to regulate to improve the environment and public health and safety. Today, federal regulators are no longer giving Americans the highest levels of protection for the billions of dollars they take from taxpayers, consumers, and businesses. By making sure that regulators follow rational principles that tell them to evaluate risks sensibly and consistently, consider the costs and benefits of their actions, and use market-based solutions, policymakers can do an even better job of protecting the environment and public health and safety while spending less and with fewer rules.
<p>
<b>COMMONSENSE REGULATORY REFORMS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In just 18 months, the 104th Congress has put in place a number of important reforms that will provide significant benefits to the economy and the well-being of all Americans.
<p>
<b>The Telecommunications Act of 1996</b><br>
The 104th Congress succeeded in passing the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-104), signed into law by President Clinton on February 8, 1996. This is the most important industry-wide deregulatory initiative undertaken by Congress in over a decade. The Act removes unnecessary layers of federal rules governing telephone, cable, and broadcasting competition.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Act eventually will eliminate restrictions that prohibit competition between local and long-distance companies, as well as cable companies, so that they can offer consumers a full range of communications and entertainment services.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One 1993 study estimated that complete deregulation would help create 3.6 million more jobs by 2003 and pass along savings of roughly $63 billion a year to consumers.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Although the Telecommunications Act does not go quite as far as the more rapid, comprehensive deregulation this study envisioned, comparable gains can still be expected over time as a result of the bill.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Deregulation also will mean the end of the Cable Act of 1992, numerous restrictions on beneficial merger and alliance activity, and many other needless Federal Communications Commission activities.
<p>

<b>The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996</b><br>
The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-127) eliminates federal programs that manipulate production and prices of major crops (wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice) through production subsidies and acreage reduction. This legislation will mean greater freedom and enormous opportunities for rural America. By dismantling much of the restrictive straitjacket on farmers, the new law will free the U.S. economy -- farmers and related businesses -- to take full advantage of the growing global market, which should mean huge economic benefits for Americans. According to an analysis by The Heritage Foundation,<sup>10</sup> the new law will mean that:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Farmers will earn an additional $16 billion in net income between 1996 and 2002.
<p>
<li> Suppliers of the inputs used in agricultural production will sell an additional $14.6 billion in products during the same period.
<p>
<li> Taken together, the agriculture community will enjoy a rise of $30.6 billion in income.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition, the Act establishes an Environmental Quality Improvement Program to provide funds for a cooperative effort with farmers to protect wetlands, using a flexible, incentive-oriented approach while increasing wetland acreage under the conservation program. 
<p>
<b>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</b><br>
In response to the increasingly hostile reaction of states and localities to unchecked and costly federal mandates, Congress in March 1995 enacted the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-4). The Act requires Congress to take into consideration the cost to states, localities, and Indian tribes of new mandates. Federal agencies must assess the impact of new regulations both on state, local, and tribal governments and on the private sector; and the U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations is tasked with a review of existing mandates.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One year later, states already feel the relief from new unfunded mandates.<sup>11</sup>  Thanks to this legislation, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is tasked with estimating the costs of these new legislative mandates. Now many Members of Congress can find out the costs of proposed mandates and reduce the cost to the states.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Some examples of how these additional consultations and deliberations have resulted in important policy changes that saved hundreds of millions dollars:
<blockquote><p>
<b>Immigration.</b> The benefits of CBO's input were evident in the development of the immigration bill. Originally, the Senate bill required that all drivers' licenses without valid Social Security numbers would be invalid immediately upon the date of enactment of the law. CBO estimated that this would cost from $80 million-$200 million for states that would have to purchase new equipment and make other necessary changes to handle the volume of people who suddenly would need to have new licenses issued. <sup>12</sup> This provision was changed in the final legislation to allow for a six-year phase-in period during which states could renew licenses when they normally would come up for renewal. This dropped the costs to states to around $20 million.
<p>
<b>Agriculture.</b> The House version of the farm bill contained provisions that would require milk sold for fluid uses to contain greater amounts of nonfat solids than currently required and lock in higher fluid milk prices under the archaic Milk Marketing Order System. CBO estimated the direct costs of this provision to dairy processors and manufacturers at somewhere between $800 million and $1 billion annually. The final farm bill did not contain a national higher fluid milk standard, and CBO's estimates were used to help make the case for its elimination.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
<b>Health Care.</b> The Kennedy-Kassebaum health care reform bill initially included a provision that would have required insurers to provide the same benefits for mental health coverage as for other illnesses, and the case for dropping this unjustified mandate was greatly facilitated by CBO estimates of the cost. The CBO noted that imposing this mandated benefit on private health insurance would have huge public and private sector costs. It projected that the Senate mandate would impose $423 million in additional costs on the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) between 1996 and 2002, rising to $739 million by 2005. If it was applied to Medicare and Medicaid, program outlays would increase by almost $80 billion for Medicare between 1997 and 2000, and by another $35 billion for Medicaid during the same period. CBO also estimated that the premiums for traditional fee-for-service plans would increase by 5.3 percent, while managed care plans would see an increase of 4 percent.<sup>14</sup>  The costly provision was taken out of the bill.
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The National Highway System Designation Act (P.L. 104-59)</b> ended a burdensome, costly unfunded mandate requiring states to satisfy a minimum tonnage utilization requirement for asphalt pavement containing recycled rubber on federal-aid projects. According to the CBO, the Federal Highway Administration estimates that states would save up to $1 billion annually in paving costs by not having to comply with the crumb rubber requirements.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>Amendments to the 1990 Clean Air Act employee commute option (ECO) program (P.L. 104-70)</b> make the program optional for states if they can undertake alternative methods that will achieve equivalent emissions reductions. While the EPA had estimated the cost of the ECO program at $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion annually,<sup>16</sup> it also called the impact of the program "minuscule" because it proved to be relatively ineffective at achieving emission reductions.<sup>17</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Land Disposal Program Flexibility Act (P.L. 104-119)</b> exempts waste determined to be non-hazardous under the Clean Water Act or Safe Drinking Water Act from regulation under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, since chemical compounds safe enough to drink presumably are safe enough to bury. Municipal solid waste landfills likewise are exempt from ground water monitoring requirements if they are small (waste disposals of less than 20 tons daily).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>Repeal of the federal speed limit.</b> As part of the National Highway system bill that President Clinton signed on November 28, 1995, the federally mandated 55-mph speed limit was repealed unconditionally. Beginning on December 8, 1995, states were able to begin freely adjusting speed limits within their boundaries. Several states immediately took action to raise their limits in response to the bill.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

<b>Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996</b> Small businesses are the engine of economic growth in this country. For small business owners, Washington looms as "public enemy number one." Small businesses want to get government off their backs so they can do what they do best -- create jobs and generate tax revenue -- without the excessive burden of reporting and regulatory compliance.<sup>18</sup>  Regulation also does not affect all businesses equally. "One-size-fits-all" regulations impose the heaviest burden on small and medium-sized businesses because they find it harder to spread the high overhead costs of paperwork, attorney and accountant fees, and staff time needed to negotiate the federal regulatory maze.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In response to the concerns of small business, Congress passed the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) of 1996 (P.L. 104-121), which was signed by the President on March 29, 1996. This legislation:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Authorizes judicial enforcement of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, which requires agencies to provide information on the impact of their regulations on small businesses and other entities;
<p>
<li> Allows small business to recoup expenses and legal fees incurred when agencies make excessive demands for penalties that cannot be sustained in court;
<p>
<li> Provides for an independent ombudsman to receive confidential complaints from small businesses about their dealings with federal regulators; and
<p>
<li> Requires federal agencies to prepare "Plain English" compliance guides spelling out in easy-to-follow language how small businesses can comply with federal regulations.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress deserves credit for this modest reform in the face of the Clinton Administration's overwhelming opposition to more fundamental reforms that small businesses desperately need. For example, President Clinton vetoed a number of important regulatory, tax, and legal reforms proposed by the 104th Congress that were important priorities not just for small businesses, but for all businesses so they can promote economic growth and create more jobs. These included environmental and workplace reform, secure property rights, a reform of outdated labor laws, repeal of Davis-Bacon, capital gains tax reduction, estate tax reform, tax equity in health care reform, pension reform, and tort reform.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995</b> More than one-third of the costs of regulation -- about $200 billion -- in 1995 was due to paperwork.<sup>19</sup>  Thus, even a modest reduction in the total paperwork burden imposed on the public can save Americans thousands of hours of time and hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars in lost productivity. Most Americans fill out some kind of paperwork, such as federal tax forms or forms to obtain some type of government benefit. Businesses also must maintain a myriad of records to demonstrate compliance with environment, workplace, and other rules.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Intent on easing the burden imposed by the federal government on individuals and businesses, the 104th Congress voted overwhelmingly to pass the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-13), and President Clinton signed it into law on May 22, 1995. The Act further amended and recodified the original Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. The new law sets a government-wide paperwork reduction goal of 10 percent in each of the first two years after its enactment, and 5 percent from FY 1998 through FY 2001.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The General Accounting Office (GAO) recently released a report showing that the number of hours of paperwork imposed by the government rose by 500 million in the one-month period immediately before the effective date of the Act, from 6.39 billion hours on August 30, 1995, to 6.90 billion hours on September 30, 1995.<sup>20</sup>  The estimated burden imposed by OSHA rose the most dramatically, from 1.5 million hours to about 208 million hours.<sup>21</sup>  These significant increases were due to the fact that the new law forced agencies to more accurately acknowledge the level of paperwork burden they impose on the public.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The GAO projects that federal agencies are expected to reduce the paperwork burden by about one percent in FY 1996.<sup>22</sup>  For the first time since 1989, Congress has managed to force a decrease of as much as 70 million hours in the government paperwork burden. This is equivalent to allowing 36,350 people now working full-time on paperwork each year to engage in other, more productive activities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Congressional Review Act of 1996</b> For too long, federal agencies have blamed Congress for many of the burdensome regulations it has crafted, and often this blame is justified. The 104th Congress now has made itself accountable and responsible to the American public for all regulations. The Congressional Review Act, part of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, allows Congress to review each new rule and consider a joint resolution of disapproval to overrule it. Under this Act, no rule may go into effect until it is delivered to Congress for its review. A "rule" is defined very broadly to include all general agency statements that affect the public, including "interpretive" rules, agency "policy statements," "guidelines," and "staff manuals."  Federal agencies will have to report to Congress on each rule, stating whether they have evaluated the costs of the rule relative to the benefits, whether the rule takes private property, and whether it affects the relationship between the federal government and state and local governments. Congress can reject a rule, which would then have to be changed substantially before it could be resubmitted to Congress.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
More reform would have been achieved had President Clinton not vetoed other measures passed by the 104th Congress. Among them:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

<b>The Common Sense Liability Reform Act (vetoed by President Clinton)</b> The Act would have curbed abuses of the legal system. It had strong bipartisan backing in Congress but was vigorously opposed by the trial lawyers -- incidentally, among the largest contributors to Clinton's presidential campaign. Liability reform is desperately needed to reduce the crushing burden of frivolous and unfounded cases brought against state and local governments, charitable organizations, and America's product manufacturers. Unfortunately, Congress did not have the votes necessary to override Clinton's veto of May 2, 1996.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995 (vetoed by President Clinton)</b> In September 1993, President Clinton had revised and reissued the regulatory review executive order first issued by President Reagan. Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, established a set of principles to guide federal regulators in developing rules and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in reviewing rules. These principles include consideration of costs and benefits and the use of market-based alternatives and performance standards. The Clinton Administration, however, did not appear very committed to making sure the regulatory principles it embodied were being taken into consideration by federal agencies. A review of EPA rulemaking between April 1994 and September 1994 showed that:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Of 45 significant rules reviewed by OMB, only six contained a determination that the benefits justified the costs; only three contained a determination of a compelling public need; and only nine considered alternative approaches to regulating. Of the other 177 EPA rules issued during that six-month period but not reviewed by OMB, no rule determined that the benefits justified the costs.<sup>23</sup>
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress recognized that for regulatory reform to be truly effective, it must force regulatory agencies to behave differently, and a statutory change was the only way to achieve it. Federal regulators needed to be required to base their decisions on costs, benefits, and actual risks faced by Americans, and they need Congress to give them the roadmap to do it. Congress enacted such legislation as part of a temporary increase in the debt ceiling. But President Clinton vetoed this bill on November 13, 1995.

<p>

<b>THE BAND-AID APPROACH: THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S "REGULATORY REINVENTION INITIATIVES" </b>
<p><blockquote>
<center>	I am going to stop handing down mandates to you and regulating you to death.</center>

<P>
--Bill Clinton, remarks before the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Houston, Texas, June 22, 1992.
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Despite campaign promises to cut red tape, the growth of regulation has continued during the Clinton Administration.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
At the end of 1992, the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), the annual accumulation of all federal regulations in effect, filled 199 volumes and 128,344 pages. By the end of 1995, the CFR had grown to 205 volumes and 138,186 pages -- almost 10,000 pages of new executive branch rules in just three years.<sup>24</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
To be sure, soon after the 104th Congress took office, the Clinton Administration initiated a number of steps that made it look as if it was really serious about slowing the growth of new rules. For example, on February 21, 1995, the White House directed federal agencies to conduct a review of their existing regulations to determine which should be eliminated and which should be streamlined, updated, overhauled, or otherwise improved.<sup>25</sup>  However, one year later, it is clear the Administration is making no real progress in reducing the overall burden of regulation. For example:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In June 1995, the Administration claimed that agencies had identified over 16,000 pages in the Code of Federal Regulations that they would be eliminating.<sup>26</sup>  But some of the pages being eliminated are for rules for which the underlying statute has long since been repealed, treaties that no longer exist, and the like. This alone easily could achieve a 10 percent reduction in the CFR without accomplishing any real changes in the way the federal government goes about regulating the public. So while it sounds impressive, it is not. At the same time, the Administration already has added 10,000 pages of new regulations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
While EPA claims to be streamlining various permitting, review, and reporting requirements for a number of programs, the Clinton Administration simultaneously is pushing forward with burdensome regulatory initiatives, such as expanding the universe of sources that must be reported as part of the Toxic Release Inventory. Critics argue that last year's expansion will mean as much as $331 million in compliance costs.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Administration, while asserting that it is committed to sound science, is pursuing federal guidelines on cancer assessment to make it easier to regulate or ban substances despite the lack of sound scientific evidence that they pose any risk. Virtually all scientists who conduct statistical analyses to determine cancer risks -- or any other analyses, for that matter -- use confidence levels to determine the likelihood that their results are accurate. But the EPA proposed new rules this April that would eliminate the current requirement that EPA use confidence levels in doing risk assessments. Under this new rule, EPA would be able to conclude that something is dangerous on the basis of evidence that would fail under any rigorous scientific study.<sup>28</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Although the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is consolidating a few rules and eliminating duplicative pages in the Code of Federal Regulations, it also is working on new regulations that will impose over $12 billion in compliance costs on consumers and businesses (indoor air quality and ergonomics) and increase the cost of a home by $1,000 to $5,000 (fall protection).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Clearly, the Clinton Administration's "reinvention" effort does little to curb the rising costs and inefficiencies of regulation. The Administration claims to be reinventing regulation but goes about implementing new burdensome regulations about as fast as it can take old ones off the books.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
When the 104th Congress began in January 1995, the federal government's ever-expanding reach into the lives of Americans -- the food they eat, how they use their private property, how they run their businesses -- was a source of great concern to the American people. The 104th Congress has made historic progress toward fundamentally changing how the federal government regulates the lives of all Americans. And it has done so by applying a set of principles: free markets, competition, consideration of costs and benefits, sound science and risk assessment, priority setting, and assigning of property rights.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Clinton Administration will now attempt to take credit for regulatory reform through its "reinvention" efforts, but all it actually has done is try to play "catch-up" by repackaging the same old regulatory system and passing it off as something new. Making it easier for businesses to comply with regulations that were unjustified in the first place or claiming to take away rules while simultaneously adding new ones does not represent true regulatory reform. The American people are too smart for that. In the final analysis, they know that true reform gives them more freedom and incentives to take actions for their own benefit, and that the 104th Congress has delivered on its promise in a way that will affect the shape of federal regulations for decades.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The 104th Congress has delivered on its promise to enact specific measures to improve federal crime-fighting efforts and help state and local officials combat violent crime. Most of these anti-crime measures were initiated by conservative Members of the House of Representatives, based on promises made to the taxpayers in the Contract With America, and later incorporated into bills passed by the Senate. They include a solid program of truth in sentencing for violent criminals, effective death penalty provisions, restrictions on the power of federal judges to put criminals back on the streets, a reordering of federal funding from social programs to law enforcement efforts (including prison construction and police funding), and victim restitution.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The two major vehicles for enactment of most of these measures were the comprehensive Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (S. 735), sponsored by former Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS), and the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act (H.R. 3019). While more can be done at the federal level, more also needs to be done by state and local officials who bear the primary responsibility for fighting violent street crime.<sup>2</sup>  Nonetheless, the legislative record of the 104th Congress in combating crime is impressive and far-reaching.<p><b>KEEPING THE BAD GUYS OFF THE STREETS</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first duty of government is to protect the people. As a short-term measure, the most effective way to do this is to put more violent criminals in prison and keep them there. In fulfilling this duty, Congress enacted the following measures into law:
<p>
<b>Violent Criminal Incarceration Act of 1995 (H.R. 667).</b> A major failure of the criminal justice system has been the inability or unwillingness to identify, target, and incarcerate violent criminals for long periods of time. Violent criminals typically serve only one-third of their sentences.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under this new law, states will receive Truth in Sentencing Incentive Grants for the construction of prisons on condition that they keep violent criminals locked up for at least 85 percent of their sentences. Already, more than 20 states have adopted such truth-in-sentencing laws,<sup>3</sup> and it is likely that many more will adopt such measures to keep violent criminals behind bars and off the streets.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The bill passed the House of Representatives on February 10, 1995; was incorporated into the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act (H.R. 3019); and was signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-134.
<p>
<b>Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995.</b> During the past three decades, federal judges have seized control of state and even local prisons, dictating conditions of confinement, promoting more comfortable living conditions for convicts, and releasing inmates as a way to ease overcrowding. Federal judges have been releasing inmates without finding a violation of a specific federal or constitutional right. Over 500 municipalities and 1,200 state prisons have been operating under judicial orders or consent decrees. Under Section 3626 of the 1994 federal crime bill, Congress attempted to stop lenient federal judges from imposing caps on the number of prisoners that can be incarcerated at a particular prison,<sup>4</sup> a judicial practice that has resulted in the release of violent criminals before their terms have been served.<sup>5</sup>  Liberal lawyers and judges quickly found ways to get around this provision.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Prison Litigation Reform Act, originally sponsored by Representative Bill McCollum (R-FL), closes existing loopholes by imposing tighter restrictions on federal court-ordered prison population caps. It requires a three-judge panel to find that prison crowding is the primary cause of the violation of a prisoner's legal or constitutional rights. Moreover, it requires judges to find that there is no other remedy available before they impose a prison cap. State or local officials responsible for the prosecution or custody of criminals who could be released because of judicially imposed prison caps are granted standing to sue. The Prison Litigation Reform Act also specifies that court-ordered relief from incarceration is to be based on specific violations of a prisoner's constitutional rights and that federal judges must give substantial weight in their decisions to any adverse impact of such relief on public safety or on the operation of the criminal justice system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This measure also reduces the burden of frivolous prisoner lawsuits, which include a wide range of often strange and bizarre complaints. Inmate lawsuits are estimated to comprise 25 percent of all civil suits filed in federal courts, and state officials are burdened with responding to them. Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon has compiled a "top ten" list of the most frivolous of these lawsuits, including complaints against officials who do not provide salad bars and brunches on weekends and holidays, officials who do not pay food allowances of $26 a day to inmates traveling from prison to the courthouse, and officials who do not permit male inmates to wear such female apparel as bras, panties, lipstick, and artificial fingernails.<sup>6</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Under the new law, federal courts are authorized to dismiss frivolous or malicious suits "without hearing."  Moreover, all administrative solutions within the corrections system must be exhausted before a lawsuit can be filed in federal court. The measure also limits the lawyers' fees awarded to successful inmate plaintiffs. In the past, trial lawyers have received as much as $300 per hour for representing prisoners.<sup>7</sup>  Under this Act, fees will be based on an hourly rate no higher than that for other court-appointed counsel, and any monetary damages awarded to a prisoner in a successful suit against state prison authorities must be applied to outstanding restitution owed to the victims of his crimes.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Prison Litigation Reform Act was incorporated into the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act (H.R. 3019) and signed into law as Public Law 104-134.
<p>
<b>To disapprove certain sentencing guideline amendments (H.R. 2259/S. 1254).</b> This law, originally sponsored by Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI), requires the U.S. Sentencing Commission to submit new guidelines imposing higher penalties for crack cocaine than powder cocaine, and higher sentences for "high level" as opposed to "low level" drug trafficking. It rejects previous guidelines that would have lowered penalties for crack cocaine to those for powder cocaine. The law stipulates that new guidelines also should include stiffer penalties for drug traffickers who use a dangerous weapon, possess a firearm, or involve or injure children or other vulnerable individuals when committing an offense.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This bill passed the Senate on September 29, 1995; passed the House of Representatives on October 18, 1995; and was signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-38.
<p>


<b>MAKING PUNISHMENT SWIFT AND SURE</b><p>
<b>The Alien Deportation Improvement Act of 1995 (H.R. 668).</b> Originally sponsored by Representative McCollum, this law would expedite deportation procedures for non-resident aliens convicted of serious felonies, as well as bribery, counterfeiting, trafficking in stolen vehicles, perjury or subornation of perjury. It also would permit deportation of a permanent resident alien who has been sentenced to five or more years for an aggravated felony.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This measure, originally titled the Criminal Alien Deportation Improvements Act of 1995, was passed by the House of Representatives on February 10, 1995, and later incorporated into the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-132).
<p>
<b>Effective Death Penalty Act of 1995 (H.R. 779).</b> While there is considerable debate over the ethics or wisdom of imposing the death penalty, the empirical evidence indicates that the death penalty in the United States is used sparingly. In 1995, there were 2,976 criminals on death row, but the states have executed 263 criminals since 1973. The abuse of <i>habeas corpus</i>, enabling those on death row to file petition after petition seeking to overturn their sentences or convictions, has been a major weakness of the American criminal justice system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This measure reduces delays in carrying out capital sentences while preserving the right of those convicted of capital crimes to present valid claims in federal court. It also imposes time limits for the filing and judicial consideration of petitions; ends the practice of filing multiple petitions except in the rarest instances; requires that state prisoners seeking <i>habeas corpus</I> relief must exhaust all state remedies before bringing action in federal court; and specifies that if a state gives reasonable consideration to the petitioner's claim, the federal judge must deny that claim.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Effective Death Penalty Act of 1995 was passed by the House of Representatives on February 8, 1995; incorporated into the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 by the Senate; and signed into law by President Clinton as part of Public Law 104-132.
<p>


<b>HELPING LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The central congressional approach to law enforcement assistance is the block grant, which allows local law enforcement officials to secure more funds, hire more police personnel, and have even more flexibility in using these monies to combat crime at the local level.
<p>
<b>Local Government Law Enforcement Block Grants Act of 1995 (H.R. 728).</b> This measure authorizes federal grants for local law enforcement officers while giving them the flexibility they need to fight crime in ways they deem most appropriate for their communities. Unlike the police funding in the 1994 crime bill, these funds are targeted to communities with high crime rates. $503 million has been appropriated for FY 1996.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This bill was passed by the House of Representatives on February 14, 1995; incorporated into the FY 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act by the Senate; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-134.
<p>
<b>Anti-Car Theft Improvements Act (H.R. 2803).</b> This law, originally sponsored by Representative McCollum, advances the investigation of car theft by setting up the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System (NMVTIS). This system, to be managed by the Department of Justice and maintained by the states, is intended to serve as a reliable and accessible body of information on motor vehicle titling for law enforcement officials.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This law was passed by the House of Representatives on June 18, 1996; passed by the Senate on June 20, 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public law 104-152.
<p>

<b>JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS</b><p>

<b>Victim Restitution Act of 1995 (H.R. 665).</b> This law, originally sponsored by Representative McCollum, requires judges in federal felony cases to order restitution to victims in cases involving violent crimes, offenses against property, or tampering with consumer products, as well as crimes in which an identifiable victim has suffered a physical injury or pecuniary loss. The law also authorizes the federal courts to make restitution a condition of probation or parole.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This Act was passed by the House of Representatives on February 7, 1995; passed by the Senate on December 22, 1995, and incorporated into the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-132.
<p>
<b>Sexual Crimes Against Children Prevention Act of 1995 (H.R. 1240).</b> Sponsored by Representative McCollum, this law imposes strong sentencing guidelines for criminals convicted of creating or trafficking in child pornography and the interstate transportation of children with the intent to use them in such criminal activity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
H.R. 1240 was passed by the House on April 4, 1995; passed by the Senate on April 6, 1995; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-71.
<p>
<b>Megan's Law (H.R. 2137).</b> Sexually violent criminals often are repeat offenders, and their presence in local communities is an obvious concern for families with children. Under this law, sponsored by Representative Richard Zimmer (R-NJ), criminals convicted of these crimes must register their addresses with state law enforcement officials, and communities will be informed when these offenders move into their neighborhoods.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bill was passed by the House of Representatives on May 7, 1996; passed by the Senate on May 9, 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-145.
<p>
<b>Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996 (H.R. 3525).</b> This new law, sponsored by Representative Henry Hyde (R-IL), makes it a federal crime to damage religious property or obstruct any person's free exercise of religion where the offense is in, or affects, interstate commerce.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
H.R. 3525 was passed by the House of Representatives on June 18, 1996; passed by the Senate on June 26, 1996; and signed into law by President Clinton as Public Law 104-155.

<p>
<b>PENDING ANTI-CRIME LEGISLATION</b>
<p><b>Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1997 (H.R. 3814).</b> This bill provides $680 million for prisons and $571 million for block grants to local law enforcement. It passed the House on July 24, 1996, and currently is before a conference of the House and Senate.
<p>
<b>Interstate Stalking Punishment and Prevention Act of 1996 (H.R. 2980/S. 1729).</b> H.R. 2980 makes it a felony to cross a state line to stalk someone or to cross a state line in violation of a restraining order. The House of Representatives passed this bill on May 7, 1996. S. 1729, an identical bill sponsored by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), was passed by the Senate.
<p>
<b>Exclusionary Rule Reform Act of 1995 (H.R. 666).</b> This bill, sponsored by Representative McCollum, would establish an exception to the exclusionary rule, which bars the use at trial of any evidence gathered by police officers in violation of the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure. The narrow qualification created by this legislation would allow the admission of evidence obtained by police officers who, while they technically violated proper procedure, acted in the "reasonably objective belief" that their actions under the circumstances complied with Fourth Amendment protections. The bill classifies any information obtained pursuant to, or within the scope of, a warrant as evidence obtained in good faith.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The House of Representatives passed this bill on February 8, 1995. It has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
<p>
<b>Violent Youth Predator Act of 1996 (H.R. 3565).</b> This bill, also sponsored by Representative McCollum, would allow federal prosecutors to try violent juvenile offenders as adults. It also includes tough, mandatory sentences for juvenile criminals who use firearms in the commission of a federal violent crime or drug trafficking offense, and authorizes additional funding for juvenile justice programs and grants to states, allowing them greater flexibility in combating the growth of violent juvenile crime. The bill was marked up by the House Judiciary Committee on July 16 and 17, 1996, and referred to the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth, and Families, which approved sections under its jurisdiction.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the United States Senate, John Ashcroft (R-MO) introduced S. 1245, a similar bill. The Subcommittee on Youth Violence of the Senate Judiciary Committee has held hearings on the Ashcroft bill.
<p>
<b>Sexual Offender Tracking and Identification Act of 1996 (S. 1675/H.R. 3456).</b> This bill would enhance the federal effort to track convicted sex offenders. Cosponsored by Senators Phil Gramm (R-TX) and Joseph Biden (D-DE), the legislation would establish a federal tracking system, accessible to the public, to document the location of sex offenders, making it more difficult for these criminals to hide their records when applying for jobs, housing, or youth service programs. A version of the bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Zimmer. Hearings on the bill have been held before the Subcommittee on Crime of the House Judiciary Committee.

<h3>HOW CONGRESS REFORMED THE WELFARE SYSTEM</h3></font></b>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a><sup>1</sup><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>
</center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The 104th Congress passed historic welfare reform legislation; and after vetoing two previous versions of welfare reform, President Clinton finally signed the congressional welfare reform bill into law on August 22, 1996.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Liberals have long opposed serious welfare reform, arguing that if the federal government continues its traditional practice of offering free handouts, children in particular will be better off, and the social maladies that characterize the life of low-income Americans in many of our urban and rural areas will decline or disappear. The liberal experiment in social policy has been tried and has failed.<sup>2</sup>  No scientific study has ever demonstrated that increasing welfare benefits to low-income persons improves the long-term prospects of the children of those persons. Indeed, children on welfare, compared to children whose families are poor but are not on welfare, do poorly: They do less well in school and earn less. The liberal welfare state has not helped children; it has hurt them.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The congressional legislation reforms the current welfare system in four major ways:
<P>
<b>1. It eliminates perverse financial incentives for state government.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, the major welfare program for unmarried mothers and children established in 1935, has been funded on an entitlement basis. Traditionally, this has meant that the more persons a state enrolls in AFDC, the greater will be the funds received from the federal government. Conversely, if a governor reduces the number of persons on welfare, federal funding to his state is reduced. Clearly, AFDC's entitlement funding structure creates perverse incentives for state government, penalizing states which reduce dependency and rewarding those which allow their welfare caseloads to grow.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The new congressional welfare reform legislation eliminates these perverse incentives by creating a new funding system. Under this new system, each state will be given a fixed dollar grant which will be increased gradually from year to year. If a state reduces its AFDC caseload, its federal grant will not be cut. Instead, the state will be permitted to keep any surplus federal funds that are generated by caseload reduction and apply those funds to other efforts to aid the poor. On the other hand, if a state permits its AFDC caseload to grow rapidly, the state -- not the federal government -- will bear the added cost.
<p>
<b>2. It slows the growth of welfare spending.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Contrary to claims by liberals in Congress and certain reports in the press, the congressional reform bill will not cut welfare spending. It merely slows the rate of growth in spending. Seven major programs are affected by the legislation:<p><ul>

<li>Aid to Families with Dependent Children;
<li>Food Stamps;
<li>Supplemental Security Income (SSI);
<li>School lunch and other child nutrition programs;
<li>Foster Care;
<li>Social Services Block Grant; and
<li>Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under prior law, aggregate spending in these programs was scheduled to grow by nearly 50 percent over the next seven years (an annual growth rate of roughly 6 percent).  The congressional reform legislation will slow the rate of growth to around 35 percent over seven years (an annual growth rate of roughly 4.5 percent). Thus, the reform will permit future aggregate state spending in these programs to expand faster than the rate of inflation.
<p>
<b>3. It establishes work requirements.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under the new law, welfare no longer will be a one-way handout. The law establishes serious, correctly designed standards for the states and work requirements for welfare recipients; the goal is for states to reduce their caseloads, not to process greater numbers of persons through welfare. Specified percentages of AFDC recipients will be required to take private-sector jobs. If a state is unable to reduce its caseload through placements in the private sector, it will be required to place certain numbers of welfare recipients in community service work in exchange for welfare benefits. When working in a community service job, the welfare recipient must be in a "pay after performance" system: The beneficiary will not receive AFDC benefits until after the community service work has been completed satisfactorily. If the individual fails to work the prescribed number of hours, his welfare benefits will be reduced accordingly.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One weakness in the reform legislation is that because of numerous loopholes, the number of recipients who will be required to work is quite low. By 1999, the typical state will be required to have only 18 percent of its AFDC caseload working. The new law, however, is still an improvement over the current system.
<p>
<b>4. It provides incentives to reduce illegitimacy.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At the present time, nearly one-third of all American children are born out of wedlock. There is a growing consensus, among liberals and conservatives alike, that the growth in illegitimacy is a social catastrophe for the nation. The collapse of marriage and the rise in out-of-wedlock births encourage welfare dependency as well as crime and many other social problems.<sup>4</sup>  The welfare reform bill contains three provisions to combat illegitimacy. First, it will focus the attention of state governments on the illegitimacy problem by requiring each state to set numerical goals for reducing illegitimacy over the next ten years. Second, it will provide bonus funding to states which reduce illegitimacy without increasing abortion rates. Third, it will create a new program to provide abstinence education, funded at $50 million per year.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While it is not perfect, the congressional welfare reform legislation is a significant step in the right direction. It represents the largest change in federal welfare policy since the initiation of President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty in 1965.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Much more, however, has to be done. Congress must begin the job of rebuilding and revitalizing America's inner-city neighborhoods, promoting moral as well as urban renewal in the nation's most devastated communities and giving hope to millions of Americans trapped in environments whose principal distinguishing characteristics are broken families, crime-ridden communities, and economic and physical deterioration. Representatives J. C. Watts (R-OK) and James Talent (R-MO) have introduced a comprehensive initiative, Saving Our Children: The American Community Renewal Act of 1996 (<a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3467:">H.R. 3467</a>).<sup>5</sup>  Their goals are real enterprise zones in urban and rural areas to encourage business opportunities and job creation in the nation's poorest communities; scholarships for poor children to attend the schools of their choice, including religious schools that reinforce traditional moral virtues; a charitable contribution tax credit to any American who makes a contribution to any private charity engaged in providing direct services to the nation's poor; and the elimination of official discrimination against religious or faith-based drug and alcohol rehabilitation centers -- the very programs that most often use public funds for these purposes most effectively.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conservatives in Congress have a full agenda in social policy. Serious welfare reform is only the beginning.

<h3> HOW THE 104TH CONGRESS REFORMED ITSELF</h3></font></b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Imperial Congress was dethroned in 1994, and conservatives who had railed against an insulated ruling class in Washington had reason to celebrate. The switch in majorities alone deposed decades-tenured House and Senate committee chairmen who had frustrated Ronald Reagan's policy initiatives and hounded his appointees. But the new majority was far more than an ideological mirror image of the old. Beginning with its first day in January 1995, the 104th Congress instituted sweeping reforms of its own internal operations and budget, the legislative process, and congressional relations with the states and the executive branch.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The abuses of the old order were rooted out, not only with new leaders, but with new laws and rules which amount to the most sweeping changes in decades. More important, these changes likely represent an enduring and positive change in the way Americans govern themselves. As a result of reforms enacted in the past two years, future Congresses will be unable to perpetrate many of the abuses practiced by politicians in the past. The new Congress strictly limited gifts and perks, agreed to abide by laws imposed on the private sector, cut its budget and staff, limited its own spending and taxing powers, and agreed to avoid new impositions on state and local governments. By acting voluntarily to curb its own powers and privileges in this way, the 104th Congress has been truly revolutionary.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, the new Congress has received insufficient credit for these achievements. The reasons: They are not widely known to the public, many of the early reforms were forgotten during the political storms of last winter, and procedural reforms take time to bear fruit. Further, many Americans were disappointed that Congress failed, albeit narrowly, to approve the most popular and sweeping reform: term limits. But the blame does not lie with Congress, which advanced term limits farther and faster than nearly any previous constitutional amendment proposal. Votes in the House and Senate have laid the groundwork, making eventual passage of a constitutional amendment highly likely. The real culprit is the Supreme Court, which invalidated state laws imposing term limits on Members of Congress. Had the Court ruled the other way, a constitutional amendment would have been more swift and certain, and some Representatives would have been facing term limits as early as 1998.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Repairing the public's fractured trust in Congress will take a long time, but a simple listing of reforms implemented since January 1995 should cheer Americans who sometimes despair about whether politicians can ever get things right. Among its reform accomplishments, the 104th Congress:<ul>

<p><li>Applied laws imposed on the private sector to itself;

<p><li>Froze congressional pay;

<p><li>Cut its own budget and staff;

<p><li>Granted line-item veto authority to future Presidents;

<p><li>Banned most gifts to Members of Congress;

<p><li>Required lobbyists to register and disclose their activities;

<p><li>Restricted laws imposing burdens on states and communities (unfunded mandates);

<p><li>Reduced franking (free mail) and other perks;

<p><li>Imposed term limits on committee chairmen and top House and Senate leaders;

<p><li>Abolished an entire agency (the Office of Technology Assessment);

<p><li>Privatized support services;

<p><li>Eliminated government grants to nonprofit lobbying groups;

<p><li>Repealed a law that favored congressional staff in hiring for career government jobs; and

<p><li>Established a mechanism for Congress to review major new regulations.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition to these reforms applying to the entire Congress, the House of Representatives, which had been subject to more severe criticism for its management and procedures, acted on its own to:
<ul>
<p><li>Require a supermajority (three-fifths) vote to increase taxes;

<p><li>Conduct its first comprehensive audit and modernized financial management;

<p><li>Reform the committee structure, eliminating three full committees and 25 subcommittees;

<p><li>Prohibit absentee (proxy) voting in committees;

<p><li>Open committee meetings and information to the media and the public;

<p><li>Create a new corrections day process to repeal unreasonable rules and regulations;

<p><li>Guarantee that the minority party would have more opportunities to amend legislation; and

<p><li>Compare spending proposals to existing spending (rather than to inflated projections).
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The result of these reforms is a Congress that is less costly, less bureaucratic, and less insulated from the concerns of average Americans. It is more open, more responsive, and more accountable to voters. It is, in brief, a Congress more befitting a democratic republic, and unless these reforms are abandoned or reversed, Americans should discover a growing sense of confidence in their ability to govern themselves through Congress.
<p>

<b>THE FIRST DAY</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The 104th Congress acted swiftly to change its rules and practices. The 1994 elections changed the partisan control of Congress and delivered a clear reform mandate. The Contract With America promised numerous changes in House rules, and the new leadership of the House of Representatives took this mandate and ran with it. On January 4, 1995, the opening day of the 104th Congress, the House voted to end procedures that had become increasingly arbitrary and secretive.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The new House rules package largely achieved the goals of the institution's critics. The rules were designed to:<ul>

<p><li>Improve deliberation by banning proxy (absentee) voting in committees, ensuring minority rights in the amendment process, and requiring fuller reporting on spending bills;

<p><li>Streamline the legislative process by cutting the number of committees and subcommittees, abolishing joint referrals of legislation, and slashing committee staff;

<p><li>Promote accountability by requiring that committee meetings be open to the public and to the broadcast media, requiring roll call votes on major legislation, prohibiting alterations in debate transcripts, and conducting a comprehensive audit of House finances; and

<p><li>Increase responsiveness by imposing term limits on the Speaker and committee chairmen and providing for consideration of a measure to apply federal laws to Congress as the first legislative vote in the 104th Congress.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Republicans' Contract With America provided for eight specific first-day reforms that the House succeeded in passing, in most cases with large bipartisan majorities:
<ol>
<p><li><b>Staff Cuts and Committee Reforms.</b> The new rules package eliminated three House committees (Post Office and Civil Service, District of Columbia, and Merchant Marine and Fisheries) and 25 subcommittees. The committee reform provision also shrank House committee staff by one-third.

<p><li><b>Truth in Budgeting.</b> Appropriations committees are now required to compare new spending recommendations to the current spending level. Under the old system, tax-and-spend liberals had the upper hand because spending increases were judged not against what actually was spent last year, but against projected spending for next year. With these rules, even a spending increase could be called a "cut."

<p><li><b>Term Limits for Committee Chairmen and the Speaker.</b> House committee chairmen will be prohibited from serving more than three consecutive Congresses (six years). Limiting the tenure of committee chairmen begins to address some of the concerns of advocates of full-scale legislative term limits. A central problem of previous Congresses had been that committee chairmen, who set the agenda, had spent decades in office. In the 103rd Congress, for example, the chairmen of two of the House's three most powerful committees (Ways and Means, and Energy and Commerce) had held these positions for over a decade; the chairman of the third (Appropriations) had just vacated his position after holding it since the 1970s.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition, the Speaker will be prohibited from serving more than four Congresses (eight years), bringing the top constitutional officer of the legislative branch in line with the President, his executive branch counterpart.

<p><li><b>Elimination of Proxy Voting.</b> Elimination of the practice of allowing absent members of a committee to lend their votes to other members was critical to ensuring fairness and improving committee deliberation. Although House rules strictly prohibited one Member from casting votes for another on the House floor (indeed, ethics reprimands have been triggered by violations of this rule), proxy voting was the norm in most committees in the 103rd Congress.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Proxy voting promoted committee absenteeism by ensuring that legislators who skipped meetings would retain their ability to cast votes in absentia, in addition to allowing legislators to abandon their deliberative responsibilities by voting for or against legislation without hearing any discussion or argument on its merits. Abolishing proxy voting will reduce the power of committee chairmen and force Members to show up and actually participate in the work of their committees if they want their votes to count.
<p>
<p><li><b>Open Meetings.</b> The 1995 rules changes also ensure public access to committee meetings. In previous Congresses, committees frequently closed their doors to the press and public, a step the panels could take for nearly any reason. In fact, the two House committees that most often operated in secret (Appropriations and Ways and Means) were the ones making controversial choices about federal taxation and spending.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Further, broadcast media are permitted to cover any open hearing or meeting (previously, media coverage was subject to a vote of approval). The new rules also require that committees publish recorded committee votes in their reports (most voting records previously were available only at committee offices) and that hearing transcripts not be altered other than for minor grammatical changes.

<p><li><b>Tax Hikes More Difficult.</b> The new rules require a three-fifths vote of the House to pass any income tax rate increase and prohibit retroactive taxation of income. The 60 percent rule has been particularly controversial, with some Washington commentators claiming the new rule is anti-democratic or even unconstitutional. Behind the heated rhetoric inside the Beltway is the conviction that new tax increases are needed.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The supermajority requirement is similar to restrictions voters have imposed on numerous state legislatures. Among the most beneficial aspects of the 60 percent tax rule is that any future Congress desiring to raise taxes would have to alter or waive the rule, thereby signaling a potential tax boost. The provision also balances the burden of a 1990 budget law which effectively requires a 60 percent vote in the Senate to cut taxes (unless the reductions are offset by increases in other taxes or cuts in entitlement spending).
<p>
<li><b>House Audit.</b> Another 1995 rules change authorized a comprehensive audit of House records, assets, and facilities by an independent accounting firm. Some House accounts previously had been audited sporadically by the General Accounting Office, an internal congressional agency. Despite the fact that one such audit uncovered the House Bank scandal, most House accounts were not examined regularly, and some may never have been reviewed by an independent examiner. This audit -- the first complete accounting of the House's financial status ever made available to the public -- uncovered 14 material weaknesses (significant deficiencies) in House accounting and financial control processes and resulted in a complete overhaul of House financial management practices.

<p><li><b>Applying Federal Laws to Congress.</b> The last of the Contract reforms was the Congressional Accountability Act (CAA). This measure has both substantive and symbolic importance. It underscores the principle that no American should be immune from the law or receive special treatment in its application. The bill also should encourage legislators to review the burdens that federal laws place on American citizens and ensure that the benefits they bring exceed their attendant costs.
</ol>

<p>
<b>EARLY SUCCESSES</b>
<p>

<b>Congressional Accountability Act.</b> After being passed by the House on its first day in session, the Congressional Accountability Act was taken up by the Senate as its first item of business. The Senate added an eleventh law, the Veterans Reemployment and Training Act, to the ten the House had applied to Congress; it also strengthened congressional employees' judicial review and appeal rights. The House quickly approved the Senate changes and sent the bill to President Clinton, who signed it on January 23.
<p>
<b>Unfunded Mandates.</b> The second piece of legislation considered by the Senate bars unfunded federal mandates on state and local governments. This was also an item in the Contract With America, though not on the list of "first-day" reforms. As with the Congressional Accountability Act, the House and Senate speedily passed this legislation, which President Clinton then signed into law.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As the federal government essentially had run out of money over the past decade, Congress increasingly had resorted to laws requiring state or local governments to provide new services. Aside from upsetting the balance of federal powers, this allowed one agency of government (Congress) to expand services while leaving others to raise taxes to pay the bills. This was a sure formula both for expanding government and for increasing voter discontent. The new law requires congressional committees to assess and report the costs of any requirements imposed on states or localities. It also requires the House and Senate to vote explicitly to impose new mandates. As a result of this law, Congress has stopped even considering imposing new unfunded mandates. Rather than trigger scrutiny under the new law, congressional committees have rewritten communications, environmental, and other laws to avoid imposing new costs on state and local governments.
<p>
<b>Senate Reforms.</b> The Senate did not reform its internal procedures to the degree the House did, largely because a bipartisan tradition had allowed incremental reforms to be implemented over a number of years, making a large package unnecessary. The Senate did, however, echo the House by imposing term limits on committee chairmen and on the Majority Leader (the Senate's most influential member). The Senate also cut committee staffs by a substantial 15 percent and worked with the House to devise overall congressional budget cuts.
<p>
<b>Term Limits.</b> The new Congress also held the first-ever House vote on term limits, and provided the first serious consideration in the Senate. On March 29, 1995, as a part of the Contract With America, the House voted 227-204 in favor of a constitutional amendment limiting House and Senate service to 12 years. Though a majority favored term limits, the total was 63 votes short of the two-thirds majority necessary to send a constitutional amendment to the states. In a similar fashion, the Senate voted 58-42 in favor of a "cloture" motion on term limits, like the House, garnering a simple majority, but falling short of two-thirds support.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While supporters of term limits were disappointed by the failure to achieve the two-thirds majorities necessary to send a constitutional amendment to the states, at least members of the House and Senate are on record as publicly supporting or opposing term limits. Supporters now have a standard against which they can measure future Congresses, and voters will know -- unequivocally -- where their representatives stand on this important issue.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Supporters of terms limits should remember that a majority in Congress voted for them; the real culprits are not in the majority, but among those Members still opposed, as well as on the U.S. Supreme Court. In a 5-4 decision on May 22, 1995,<sup>1</sup> the Court held that states may not impose term limits on their own representatives in Congress. At the same time, the Court indicated that Congress may not act on its own to impose term limits by statute. The impact of this decision was to invalidate 23 existing term limits laws and make a constitutional amendment essential to achieving term limits for Congress.<p><b>Budget Cuts.</b> The new Congress voted to slash its own budget. The FY 1996 legislative branch appropriations bill provided systemic congressional reforms as important as any yet enacted, including spending cuts, staff cuts, privatization, and abolition of unnecessary offices and functions. The FY 1996 and 1997 congressional budgets reduced spending in real dollars -- not phony "baseline" cuts -- by $161 million, or 9 percent below the 1995 level. Had Congress and the President made similar cuts in every other agency and program, the federal budget would be balanced next year. While cutting every program (including interest payments and Social Security) is clearly unrealistic, it is evident that Congress took its share of cuts and more.
<p>
<b>Pay and Pensions.</b> Members of Congress made personal sacrifices as well, voting in both the 1996 and 1997 appropriations cycles to freeze their own pay. Congress also approved reforms in the bloated congressional pension system. Congressional pensions far exceed most private-sector plans. Congress's pension system is up to twice as generous as those of most Fortune 500 corporations. Not only do these generous pensions burden the taxpayers, but they also promote political careerism by providing incentives for lawmakers to extend their tenure. Unfortunately, the pension reforms approved by Congress were part of the reconciliation package which was vetoed by President Clinton in November 1995.
<p>
<b>Perks.</b> Cuts in congressional perks contributed to budget savings, including a $20 million cut in franking (postage) costs achieved by cutting the budget for each Representative by one-third, bringing down the average annual allowance from $163,000 to $108,000 per office. The House achieved further savings by privatizing food services, mail handling, and other support functions.
<p>
<b>Agencies and Personnel.</b> Congress succeeded in setting an example for the rest of the government by slashing its staff and eliminating unneeded agencies, including the $21 million Office of Technology Assessment, which had provided redundant services to the national legislature. The reforms pushed the General Accounting Office to privatize its administrative functions, such as printing, mail handling, and library services. The GAO also will receive funds to contract out some of its auditing work so that it can benefit from the lower costs available in the private sector. The result is a cut of more than 25 percent in the GAO's budget.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In line with budget savings, Congress cut total employment by over 2,600 positions, nearly 10 percent of the total for Congress and its agencies.
<p>
<b>Lobbying Reform and Gift Ban.</b> In 1995, the House and Senate both enacted rules restricting the types and amounts of gifts lawmakers may receive. The Senate passed a complex rule that allows single gifts up to $50, with a $100 annual limit. Any item less than $10 falls outside the Senate's rules. The House chose to adopt a more sweeping proposal, offered by Speaker Newt Gingrich, to prohibit all gifts. Both the Senate rule and the House ban include exceptions for commemorative items and expenses related to official activities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Lobbying disclosure legislation was approved by both the House and Senate in late 1995. While this legislation would institute new reporting requirements and close loopholes in the original 1946 Lobby Reform Act, it carefully avoids many potential pitfalls. It protects legitimate grassroots organizing as well as incidental or small lobbying activities.
<p>
<b>Line-Item Veto.</b> Among the most potentially far-reaching reforms approved by the 104th Congress is the line-item veto, which will be available to the President who takes office in January 1997. The removal of presidential impoundment authority (the practice of refusing to spend all the money Congress appropriated) in the 1974 budget reforms was one factor in the continuing stream of high deficits from that year on. Despite partisan differences, the 104th Congress agreed that the President should be able to excise unneeded items from appropriations bills and send them back to Congress. Unless both houses can muster a two-thirds vote to override the President's objections, the spending cuts stand. This is a power used by 43 state governors and, effectively, by Presidents prior to 1974. Ronald Reagan repeatedly asked Congress for just this authority. The 104th Congress's approval of the line-item veto was an act of political magnanimity and unmatched institutional restraint.
<p>

<b>CONTINUING REFORMS</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As impressive as this list of reform accomplishments is, even more impressive is the fact that leaders and members of the 104th Congress remain committed to further reforms. House Speaker Newt Gingrich has vowed that a term limits amendment will be the first item of business for the House in the next Congress. Balanced budget and tax limitation amendments also will be brought back for consideration. Several House and Senate committees are considering changes in the budget process, which probably will be altered in 1997.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Newly installed Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott is exploring ways to streamline Senate procedures, and separate Republican and Democratic task forces in the House have issued reports urging further changes in House procedures. These are likely to result in another opening-day package of House rules changes in January 1997. Among the most likely items for action is a Congressional Freedom of Information Act, which would make information about Congress more widely available on the Internet.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Other House rules changes which have widespread support are a truth in testimony proposal to require witnesses testifying before congressional committees to disclose the amount of federal grants and contracts they receive, and a proposal to require sponsors of legislation to cite specific authority from the Constitution to justify it. Following up on the Unfunded Mandates Act, Senator Ted Stevens and others are promoting legislation to enforce the Tenth Amendment and its reservation of powers to the states.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Too often, revolutionaries who seize power become too much like the leaders they overthrew. Some Americans may even fear that this has happened to the 104th Congress. But a review of congressional reform accomplishments over the last two years shows that the reformers stayed true to their cause. They achieved most of their goals (and even exceed some) and remain committed to further political reform in the next Congress.

<h3>
HOW THE 104TH CONGRESS HAS PROTECTED THE NATION'S SECURITY</h3></font></b>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/moore.html">Thomas Moore</a><br>
Deputy Director of Foreign Policy and Defense Studies<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nowhere has the failure of presidential leadership been more stark and disturbing than in defense and foreign policy. Failures in economic and domestic policy are bad enough. But negligence, complacency, incompetence, and self-delusion in national security are matters of life and death, as the terrorist bombing of the U.S. barracks in Dharan, Saudi Arabia, so tragically attests. When the Commander in Chief is not up to the job, lives are lost and vital national interests are injured.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The President, as Commander in Chief, has the primary constitutional responsibility for the conduct of U.S. foreign and defense policy. But the Framers of the Constitution wisely did not place all the responsibility in the President's hands: The constitutional system of checks and balances assigns much of the responsibility for national security to Congress. Under Article I, Section 8, "The Congress shall have Power to... provide for the common Defence and general welfare of the United States... ," including the power "To declare war... To Raise and support Armies... To provide and maintain a Navy; To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.... "

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress exercises oversight authority for the conduct of foreign and security policy through the authorization and appropriation of funds for executive branch agencies. The Senate also has specific national security responsibilities, both through its power to confirm Administration appointments and officers of the armed services and, most significantly, through its role in approving or disapproving the ratification of treaties, as spelled out in Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The 104th Congress has performed with great credit in carrying out these responsibilities, though in some cases the results have not been commensurate with the quality or intensity of the effort. Indeed, there are limits to what Congress can do to protect the nation's security if the Commander in Chief persists in following misguided policies, or is guilty of slipshod execution of sound policies. In any case, the 104th Congress has mitigated the worst consequences of President Clinton's record on national defense and foreign affairs, and has provided balance against Clinton excesses, negligence, and irresponsible actions. Highlights of congressional accomplishments in national security include:
<ul>
<p><li>Making national missile defense a congressional leadership issue. Though the proposed Defend America Act of 1996 has yet to be enacted, it has given supporters of national missile defense the political initiative and has exposed the moral and intellectual bankruptcy of the Clinton Administration on the most vital of all defense issues.
<p>


<li>As part of the missile defense effort, focusing attention on the need to withdraw or substantially modify the 1972 ABM Treaty and providing a statutory reminder that substantive changes in the Treaty must be brought before the Senate for advice and consent to ratification.

<p><li> Restoring needed funds to the defense budget to offset the severe, chronic budget shortfall inherent in the Administration's Bottom-Up Review force levels and its five-year defense plan.

<p><li> Allocating substantial new funds to modernize the forces and rebuild combat readiness.

<p><li> Acting to renew the NATO alliance by a series of votes calling for enlargement of the alliance to include newly independent democracies in Central Europe.

<p><li> Cutting foreign aid and instituting organizational reforms in the State Department and in foreign operations accounts to eliminate waste and duplication.
</ul>
<p>
<b>THE CONTRACT WITH AMERICA</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Clinton Administration's misguided policies in foreign and defense policy were a prime target of the Contract With America. Alarmed over Clinton's defense budget cuts and failure to move rapidly toward a national missile defense system, Republicans and conservative Democrats committed to the Contract promised to restore America's military strength. And early in the 104th Congress, they worked to fulfill their promise.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

On February 7, 1995, the House of Representatives passed the National Security Revitalization Act (H.R. 7), which sought to establish a commission to eliminate the funding shortfall in defense, set a new policy for the development and deployment of missile defenses, expand NATO membership, and limit the authority of the President to subordinate U.S. troops to United Nations command.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Senate did not take up H.R. 7, but parts of the bill did find their way into different pieces of Senate legislation, such as the defense and foreign relations authorization bills. While not all of the original Contract items were included in final legislation reconciling differences between the House and Senate -- for example, Congress dropped the House demand for a commission to examine U.S. national security strategy -- conservative supporters of the Contract delivered on the majority of their promises to the American people.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress undertook a number of other foreign and defense policy initiatives that complement and supplement the national security planks of the Contract With America. For example, the new majority in Congress has endeavored to:
<p>
<b>Restore America's military strength.</b> Congress approved a defense spending bill that added $7 billion to the defense budget request submitted by President Clinton. This money was needed not only to keep America's armed forces trained and combat ready, but also to maintain a force with modern high-technology weapons in the 21st century. Because he needed congressional support for his Bosnia mission, President Clinton bowed to demands from the Hill and signed the defense appropriations bill for FY 1996, which provided the additional $7 billion above his original defense budget request.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

However, the President vetoed the accompanying FY 1996 defense authorization bill, which would have 1) provided more funds to maintain the technological superiority of U.S. forces; 2) authorized a pay raise and housing allowance increase for military personnel (including those deployed to Bosnia); and 3) mandated the defense of the U.S. homeland against ballistic missiles. The veto was narrowly upheld, and Congress found it necessary to weaken the missile defense provisions of the bill in order to secure its enactment with the President's signature.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the FY 1997 defense authorization bill, Congress has added more than $11.2 billion to the defense budget and has maintained a vigorous missile defense program -- or at least as vigorous as can be expected under the threat of another veto from a White House which gives lip service to missile defense while steadily undermining any real prospects for deployment.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Move the United States closer to a national missile defense system. The FY 1996 defense authorization bill -- approved by Congress but vetoed by the President -- sought to establish a clear timetable for development and deployment of both national and theater missile defenses. Further, it sought to bar the application of Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty restrictions to theater defense systems. However, the President refused to sign the defense bill, giving as his primary reason the strong missile defense provisions it contained. He prevailed, forcing Congress to weaken missile defense in the final 1996 defense authorization bill. Once again, the President succeeded in blocking this country's ability to defend its citizens from nuclear attack, and Congress was not able to muster enough votes to override his veto.
<p>

In the second session of the 104th Congress, both House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) and Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) sponsored the Defend America Act of 1996, which would mandate the development and deployment by a specific date of limited missile defenses of the U.S. homeland. This Act has not yet won approval, but the strong opposition of the Clinton Administration further illustrates the lengths to which the President is prepared to go to ensure the strategic status quo, which defends the 1972 ABM Treaty instead of defending Americans and leaves the U.S. vulnerable to the increasing proliferation of ballistic missiles armed with weapons of mass destruction.
<p>

<b>Cut foreign aid.</b> While the new Republican majority promised extensive cuts in foreign aid, little has transpired by way of revamping America's wasteful foreign aid programs. Federal spending on foreign aid will likely be only $2 billion less in FY 1996 than it was in FY 1995. However, under the umbrella of a balanced budget by the year 2002, further cuts are likely. While current cuts amount to nearly 30 percent for all programs except aid to Israel and Egypt, much still needs to be done. One step in the right direction is a new law requiring that the U.S. government report on the progress being made by foreign aid recipients developing free markets, the main engine of economic development. This effort was inspired by The Heritage Foundation's <i>Index of Economic Freedom</i>, a global comparison of economic freedom in 142 countries.
<p>
<b>End the Castro dictatorship in Cuba.</b> Congress passed, and the President signed, the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act just a few days after Cuba downed two U.S.-registered civilian aircraft in international waters on February 24, 1996. This legislation, which tightens the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba and allows American citizens to seek compensation for property stolen by Castro, is another step toward hastening the end of Castro's dictatorship.
<p>
<b>Reorganize the State Department.</b> Congress proposed to cut waste in the State Department and foreign operations accounts by consolidating several independent foreign policy agencies within the State Department. This effort, led by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms (R-NC), had the support of Secretary of State Warren Christopher until bureaucratic interests within the Administration persuaded him to oppose it. Key legislation to move the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA), Agency for International Development (AID), and other foreign policy agencies into the State Department was approved by a House-Senate conference committee in March 1996. The President has vowed to veto this legislation if it is approved by Congress.
<p>
<b>Express reservations on sending U.S. troops to Bosnia.</b> In December 1995, the House and Senate passed resolutions to support the U.S. troops being deployed on the peacekeeping mission to Bosnia. These resolutions, however, did not endorse the President's decision to deploy them, and also raised questions about the wisdom of American involvement in a mission lacking clear goals. The House went so far as to vote to cut off funds for the Bosnia mission.
<p>
<b>Maintain America's trade relations with China by approving most-favored-nation trade status for China.</b> In June 1996, the Congress sustained most-favored-nation trading status for China. This decision reflects the belief, held by a majority in Congress, that increasing economic interaction is the best way to promote economic reform and advance political liberalization and human rights.
<p>
<b>Protect the U.S. relationship with Taiwan.</b> In the face of Administration resistance to granting Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui a visa to visit his alma mater Cornell University, Congress voted with near unanimity in May 1995 to support his visit. As a result, the President reversed course and granted the visa. Also, both the House and Senate have included provisions in the 1996 State Department authorization bill that would give precedence to the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act over U.S.-China government-to-government communiqu‚s when considering future weapons exports to Taiwan. U.S. China policy too often is framed by communiqu‚s that have no force of law, international or domestic. The Taiwan Relations Act, however, is the law of the land. The President has vowed to veto the bill if approved by Congress.
<p>


<b>UNFINISHED BUSINESS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While the 104th Congress has done much to mitigate the Clinton Administration's negative impact on national security, much remains to be done. Working within its constitutional, budget, and oversight prerogatives, Congress needs to adopt a concerted strategy -- and initiate a legislative campaign based on that strategy -- to restore America's lost credibility abroad and dispel doubts around the world about U.S. leadership.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The first step is to continue the good work of the 104th Congress to reverse the neglect and decline of U.S. military strength that has characterized the Clinton Administration. Proper congressional action can encourage the development of a clear and coherent foreign and defense policy grounded in American principles and national interest, replacing the Clinton Administration's politicizing of defense and indifference to foreign policy, which have created only muddle and confusion.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress must ensure that the U.S. preserves the capacity to act unilaterally when U.S. interests are threatened. This means rejecting the false notion that U.S. power must be "legitimized" by operating through some international or multilateral agency like the United Nations. Congress must make sure that the Clinton policy of "assertive multilateralism" does not subordinate clear national interests to the U.N. and other supranational entities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress needs to assert its prerogatives to prevent more dubious foreign interventions like Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia which turn the U.S. military into an international social work agency. Clinton's vague global utopianism has misused the military, gotten American soldiers needlessly killed, and wasted scarce defense dollars. If Congress does not intervene properly in such cases, American military strength and credibility will continue to be frittered away in "peace operations" which provide little or no benefit to the nation's security.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress needs to provide adequate funds and resources to preserve the core mission of the armed forces: to fight and win wars in defense of U.S. strategic interests and existing military alliance commitments. Under Clinton, American fighting forces are weaker and less able to deal with larger military contingencies in areas like Korea or the Persian Gulf.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In keeping with this duty, Congress must end the weakening of the armed forces caused by the imposition of a radical social agenda of "political correctness."  The President has imposed his radical vision on the military services by pushing women into combat positions before their effectiveness has been tested or their impact on combat effectiveness honestly evaluated. He has advocated the admission of acknowledged homosexuals into the ranks, contrary to the judgment of the nation's top military leaders. The result has been a corrosion of the mutual trust between leaders and those they lead that is essential to unit cohesion and combat effectiveness. Congress must intervene to protect the morale and combat effectiveness of America's fighting forces.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress must also continue to press for deployment of the most effective theater and national missile defenses possible. If the President and his advisors continue to use the 1972 ABM Treaty as an excuse not to defend Americans from the growing threat of ballistic missiles, Congress should remove the Treaty as the chief impediment to meeting this vital requirement.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Many in Congress are unnecessarily intimidated by the prospects of dealing with the ABM Treaty. The Constitution establishes treaties duly ratified as part of the "supreme Law of the Land."  But the law of the land consists of the U.S. Constitution; "laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof;" and then "all Treaties... which shall be made under the Authority of the United States" -- <i>in that order</i>. In other words, treaties are not supreme over statute law or provisions of the Constitution itself. Treaties, like the Constitution and other federal laws, are subject to change or amendment. They are not permanently unalterable like the laws of the Medes and the Persians. Congress may overturn the ABM Treaty by a simple statute declaring it null and void.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The mistakes, misjudgments, and missed opportunities that have characterized the Clinton Administration's approach to foreign and defense policy over the past four years are serious. They have weakened U.S. influence and credibility abroad and, unless rectified, could lead inevitably to America's decline as a great power capable of defending its values and interests.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

For America, it is either lead or be led. The first road leads to freedom, security, and greatness; the second, to weakness and submission. For America's own well-being, and for that of the entire globe, U.S. leadership must be restored. If the Administration cannot or will not provide this leadership, Congress must hold it publicly and politically accountable and then, insofar as the Constitution and good public policy allow, step into the breach to safeguard America's national security.

<p><blockquote>
	"We must, however, continue to express our concerns about mandated Medicaid expansions. States do not have the luxury of operating a budget deficit. Every mandated dollar that we spend is a real dollar that has to be taken from another program."  Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, June 7, 1990

<a href="fyi63_2.gif">Chart 2</a>: Relationship Between Total Expenditures and Medicaid Spending, 1990-2002<br>
<a href="fyi63_3.gif">Chart 3</a>: States With More Than 50% Increase in Medicaid Payments Supported by Their Own State Revenue, 1990-2002<br><p>
While attention recently has focused on the problems of the Medicare system, Congress shortly will try to tackle another health care financial time bomb in the form of Medicaid, the health care program serving the nation's poor. If significant reforms are not enacted, states will face a heavy increase in spending and a rise in the proportion of their projected revenues that must be dedicated to Medicaid. And because the rate of growth in state Medicaid spending will exceed the rate for total state spending, states will be forced either to increase taxes or to divert money from other programs.
<p>
Medicaid is a state-administered program that operates under federal guidelines. Federal and state governments jointly fund the program. Federal reimbursement to the states is based on a statutory formula designed to give a higher matching rate to states with lower per capita incomes. Matching rates for these services range from 50 percent to 83 percent and are adjusted annually.
<p>
	The cost of Medicaid to the federal government has been growing at double-digit rates in recent years. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that annual federal Medicaid costs will almost double by 2002.
<p>
	Although the financial impact on the federal government under current law is alarming, the future impact on states could be even more severe:  a remorseless growth in the share of their own projected revenues going to Medicaid. States can make some cost-saving reforms in the program, but only subject to federal rules requiring that certain levels of coverage be provided to certain populations.
<p>
	To examine the probable future budget impact on states, The Heritage Foundation analyzed the likely trend using certain assumptions to forecast the state share of Medicaid payments for the period 1995 through 2002. First, the Heritage analysis assumes no change in the current Medicaid program. Hence, the following charts and tables project the future state-level Medicaid burden if Congress does nothing to reform this program. Second, where possible, a state's Medicaid spending trend is adjusted by expected changes in state economic activity, by forecasted changes in the eligible population, and by the trend in federal Medicaid transfers to the state.
<p>
	The forecasts for future state Medicaid spending were prepared jointly by Heritage and by Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates (WEFA), a nationally known economic consulting firm that maintains detailed models for each state. For 47 states, WEFA found a significant relationship between historical Medicaid spending changes and fluctuations in the state's economic activity and Medicaid-eligible population. In four cases, however, the relationship was sufficiently weak that WEFA simply projected the historical trend in spending; these are identified with an asterisk on <a href="fyi63_1.gif">Table 1</a>. This table shows the additional state revenues or program cuts needed if the states are to meet their projected Medicaid expeditures.
<P>

Highlights
<p>
	Between 1995 and 2002, if no reforms are enacted, states will have to spend $688 billion of their own money on Medicaid. Total state Medicaid spending over this period is projected to be $1,730 billion, of which $1,042 billion will be supplied by the federal government (if CBO's forecasts of federal spending prove correct). The difference between federal and state spending on Medicaid means that states will have to devote an average of 8 percent of their non-federal revenues to the program. Among the hardest hit states, Pennsylvania will have to devote 19 percent of its revenues to the health care program.
<p>
	As <a href="fyi63_1.gif">Chart 1</a> shows, the amount of state Medicaid payments alone steadily increases between 1995 and 2002. In 1990, the states spent just $32 billion of their non-federal funds on Medicaid. These unfunded payments are projected by our analysis to grow to $69 billion by 1995 and $104 billion by 2002. In other words, the Medicaid amount paid by the states will have increased by 225 percent over the twelve-year period between 1990 and 2002.
<p>
	Some individual states will be particularly hard hit. For example, California will need to raise $21.5 billion in new revenues or in budget cuts to pay its part of Medicaid growth between 1996 and 2002. Similarly, New York will need to raise $20 billion; Florida, $15.2 billion; Pennsylvania, $13.7 billion; and Texas $8.6 billion. If these states choose to raise taxes to meet their Medicaid obligations, then California will have to increase the average taxpayer's bill by $294 per year; New York, by $427; Florida, by $441; Pennsylvania, by $427; and Texas by $211.
<p>
	This rapid growth in the state's Medicaid share is reflected in the annual percentage change in state-level Medicaid spending as compared with total state spending, which includes support of such things as education, crime control, and transportation infrastructure (see <a href="fyi63_2.gif">Chart 2</a>). The Heritage analysis anticipates 1995 state Medicaid spending that is growing at a rate of 11 percent, while total state spending should grow at an 8 percent rate. This higher rate of change for Medicaid means that states either must raise taxes or must take funds away from other state programs. The forecast suggests that state spending on Medicaid will continue to keep pace with total spending. Over the forecast period (1995-2002), Medicaid spending is projected to grow at an 8 percent rate.
<P>
	Again, some states will be hit particularly hard. <a href="fyi63_3.gif">Chart 3</a> shows those states that are forecasted to have increases in Medicaid spending from their own revenues that are greater than 50 percent.
<p>

Technical Assumptions
<p>
	The Heritage Foundation and Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates used state models of economic activity to develop state-by-state estimates of Medicaid spending and the additional funds states would need to raise to meet their future Medicaid obligations.
<P>
	We assumed no change in the current Medicaid eligibility rules and allowed federal Medicaid transfers to the states to grow at the rates implied by the history of this program. Total Medicaid program spending in each state is a function of that state's historical Medicaid expenditures and expected demographic and economic change. We used this as the basic structure of future Medicaid spending.
<P>
	These baseline forecasts of state Medicaid spending were adjusted upwards by Heritage to reflect the higher federal Medicaid program spending projected by the Congressional Budget Office. The difference between our initial baseline for total (federal and state) spending and the CBO adjusted estimates is $98 billion over the period 1996 to 2002. We distributed the state portion of this additional amount by each state's annual percentage of total national Medicaid spending for each of the seven forecast years following 1995. Estimates of additional taxes that would be raised to meet each state's additional funding requirement were calculated by dividing the additional funding requirement by the estimated number of taxable individual federal income tax returns in 1995.

INTRODUCTION
<P>
     Terrorism is a cancer that has plagued the Middle East for
decades. It is now metastasizing into new and more deadly forms that
pose grave challenges to the United States and the West. Middle
Eastern terrorists are striking outside their home region, boldly
attacking high-profile targets, and killing in a more indiscriminate
manner. Last year the U.S., which had never suffered a major terrorist
attack on its soil by Middle Eastern terrorists, was rocked by the
bombing of the World Trade Center in New York City, which killed six
Americans and wounded over 1,000. This was the highest casualty toll
ever recorded for a single terrorist incident. A subsequent bombing
campaign against targets in New York City was stopped in its tracks in
June 1993 by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
<P>
     The World Trade Center bombing embodies several ominous trends in
Middle Eastern terrorism. It epitomizes the drift toward large-scale,
indiscriminate violence. It also underscores the degree to which
radical Islamic extremists have supplanted radical nationalists, such
as the Palestine Liberation Organization, as the chief Middle Eastern
terrorist threat to the U.S. Moreover, radical Islamic groups are
inciting Sunni (orthodox) Muslims to support revolutionary terrorism
in Egypt and Algeria, just as radical Shia Muslims were incited by the
Iranian revolution. Finally, the Sudanese connection of several of the
bombers demonstrates how Sudan has become the "new Lebanon" -- a host
for a wide variety of terrorist groups and an important bridge between
Shia Iranian radicals and the new wave of Sunni Arab radicals.
<P>
     The United States cannot afford to ignore the wake-up calls
presented by the World Trade Center bombing and the foiled Iraqi-
sponsored assassination attempt against former President George Bush
during his April 1993 visit to Kuwait. The taboo against international
terrorist attacks inside the country and against important national
symbols has been broken. Washington must lead a concerted
international effort to make such terrorist attacks more difficult,
more costly to the perpetrators, and more risky for the states that
back them.

<P>
     The Worldwide Spread of Middle Eastern terrorism. The U.S. is by
no means the only country to feel the wrath of Middle Eastern
terrorists in recent months. In July, 117 people were killed in a
series of four bombings in nine days that swept Argentina, Panama, and
Britain. Most, if not all, of this carnage is believed to be the
handiwork of the world's most deadly terrorist organization --
Hezbollah (Party of God), an Iranian-sponsored and Syrian-backed
terrorist group based in Lebanon that perpetrated the October 1983
bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut. In August, radical
Islamic terrorists seeking to overthrow the Algerian government killed
two Chinese and five French citizens in Algeria, as part of a
terrorist campaign against foreigners that has claimed 60 lives since
September 1993.
<P>
     Yet, the U.S. and its citizens have been the world's foremost
targets of international terrorism in recent years. The FBI estimates
that 32 percent of terrorist attacks worldwide from 1982 to 1992 were
targeted against Americans or American property. (FBI Terrorist
Research and Analytical Center, "Terrorism in the United States:
1982-1992" (Washington D.C., 1993), p. 11.) Middle Eastern terrorism
remains the greatest terrorist threat to the United States. Although
some 20 percent of all international terrorist incidents from 1982 to
1992 have been traced to Middle Eastern quarrels, these incidents have
accounted for about 35 percent of terrorist-related fatalities.
(Testimony of terrorism expert Brian Jenkins before the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, Subcommittee on International Security,
International Organizations and Human Rights, March 12,1993.) Middle
Eastern terrorist incidents repeatedly have drawn the U.S. into
international crises. State-sponsored terrorist attacks against
Americans have triggered U.S. military retaliation against Iran, Iraq,
and Libya. 
<P>
     Iran has been the foremost state sponsor of terrorism since the
1979 Iranian revolution. But terrorist attacks against Western targets
dropped off after the 1989 election of President Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani, who was more interested in rebuilding Iran with Western
help than in exporting revolution. Now that Rafsanjani is steadily
losing ground to more radical leaders in a bitter internal power
struggle, there could be an escalation of Iranian-sponsored terrorism.
Indeed, this may already have started to happen with Hezbollah's July
bombing campaign.
<P>
     Despite the growing danger, the Clinton Administration has failed
to mount a credible effort to stem the tide of terrorism. Although it
pays lip service to counterterrorism, the Administration unwisely
remains wedded to a State Department reorganization plan that would
downgrade the Office of Counterterrorism and signal friends and foes
that fighting terrorism is not a high priority. To more fully protect
American citizens from the scourge of Middle Eastern terrorism, the
Clinton Administration should:
<P>
Make counterterrorism a top priority in American foreign policy. 
  <P>   The Administration should shelve its plan to downgrade the status
of the State Department's Office of Counterterrorism and make
terrorism a top permanent agenda item at the annual G-7 summits.
<P>
Tackle international terrorism as a form of low-intensity warfare.
<P>     Treating it as a purely criminal matter does not effectively
address the issue of state-supported terrorism.
<P>
Punish state sponsors of terrorism on as many fronts as possible.
 <P>   Raise the diplomatic, economic, political, and military costs of
state terrorism to the point where they exceed the expected benefits.
<P>
Mobilize reluctant allies to maximize pressure on terrorist states and
groups. 
 <P>    Washington increasingly should apply public pressure on allied
governments, particularly in Europe, that appease terrorist states.
<P>
Maintain the option to retaliate unilaterally for terrorist attacks
with decisive military force. 
 <P>    The use or threat of force is an essential deterrent to state-
supported terrorism.
<P>
Stand firmly behind states threatened by Middle Eastern terrorism.
 <P>    Algeria, Egypt, Israel, and Turkey require firm U.S. support and
close cooperation against international terrorism.
<P>
Upgrade counterterrorism intelligence. 
 <P>    The FBI, CIA, and other intelligence agencies need to expand
their sources of human intelligence on international terrorism and
consult closely with allies and other concerned states.
<P>
Reform immigration laws to improve internal security.
<P>     Deportation proceedings should be streamlined, political asylum
requests should be screened more quickly and decisively and visas
should be denied to members of groups that use, support, or advocate
terrorism. Federal criminal penalties for visa and passport forgeries
should be toughened.
<P>
Work to restore order in anarchic areas where international terrorist
groups thrive. 
  <P>   The U.S. should back efforts by the governments of Lebanon and
Afghanistan to roll back the influence of Islamic radicals and
dismantle terrorist training camps.
<P>
THE UPSURGE IN RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM OUTSIDE THE MIDDLE EAST
<P>
     Middle Easterners are the prime suspects in a series of four
terrorist attacks against far-flung Western targets in July. On July
18 a car bomb destroyed a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires,
killing 96 people and wounding more than 200. The next day a bomb
destroyed a commuter plane in Panama, killing 21, most of them Jewish
businessmen. A car bomb exploded outside the Israeli Embassy in
Lebanon on July 27, wounding 13 people. The next day another car bomb
demolished the London offices of a Jewish charity organization.
<P>
     A previously unknown group calling itself Ansarallah (Partisans
of God) claimed responsibility for the Buenos Aires and Panama
bombings. American intelligence specialists believe that the group is
a subsidiary of Hezbollah, the Lebanon-based radical Shiite terrorist
organization. Sheik Sobhi Toufeili, the leader of Hezbollah's most
militant faction, is suspected of being the leader of the group.
(Louise Lief, "Partisans of Terror," U.S. News and World Report,
August 8, 1994, p. 36.) There has been speculation that the attacks
were meant to derail the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations, because the
bombings straddled Jordanian King Hussein's July trip to Washington to
sign a non-belligerency accord with Israel. A more likely explanation,
however, is that this spate of terrorism was a spillover of the
intensifying fighting between Israel and Hezbollah in southern
Lebanon. 
<P>
     Hezbollah undoubtedly was smarting over Israel's capture of one
of its leaders, Mustafa Dirani, in Lebanon on May 21. The radical
Islamic terrorists also may have been angry over Israel's June 2 air
strike that killed some 45 of its cadres in Lebanon. Israeli and
American intelligence officials are said to have little doubt that
Iran also was behind the July 18 Buenos Aires bombing. (Testimony of
Steven Emerson, before the House Foreign Affairs Committee,
Subcommittee on International Security, International Organizations
and Human Rights, August 1, 1994.) Up to 20 Iranian Revolutionary
Guards, who train and equip Hezbollah forces, apparently were killed
in the June 2 air strike. (Michael Parks, "Bombings Underscore World's
Vulnerability," The Los Angeles Times, August 1, 1994, p. A3.) Iran
was implicated in a similar terrorist operation in Argentina that took
the lives of 29 people in March 1992. Hezbollah claimed responsibility
for that bombing, which destroyed the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires,
possibly retaliating for an earlier Israeli attack that killed its
military chief. Electronic intelligence intercepts and an extensive
forensic investigation revealed that Iranian officials had helped
acquire the plastic explosives used in that 1992 bombing. (Steven
Emerson, "Diplomacy That Can Stop Terrorism," The Wall Street Journal,
July 22, 1994, p. A10.) Iran also has been implicated in the July 18
Buenos Aires bombing by an Iranian defector questioned by Argentine
criminal investigators. (Gabriel Escobar, "Iranian Diplomats Said to
Be Suspects in Blast at Argentine Jewish Center," The Washington Post,
July 29, 1994, p. A27.) 
<P>
     The string of bombings in July greatly concerns U.S.
counterterrorism officials. They are worried about the ability of
Hezbollah terrorists to mount a sustained, coordinated, and well-
organized terrorist campaign against targets all over the globe. (The
car bomb used against the Israeli Embassy in London was delivered by a
woman, a fact that has led some experts to doubt involvement of
Hezbollah in that particular attack, because the organization
previously has condemned the use of women in terrorist actions.
Nevertheless, the possibility that a secular terrorist group carried
out that attack does not necessarily let Iran off the hook, because
Tehran has used secular groups such as the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine - General Command.) The attacks apparently
were planned well in advance and utilized local support networks for
reconnaissance and preparation. (Michael Parks, "Bombings Underscore
World's Vulnerability," The Los Angeles Times, August 1, 1994, p. A3.)
The July 19 mid-air bombing of a Panamanian commuter plane is
especially troubling because it may be the first suicide terrorist
attack on an airliner. (British counterterrorism officials secretly
have warned British airlines to be on guard for suicide bombers. Jamie
Dettner, "Airlines Warned of Suicide Bombers," The Washington Times,
August 8, 1994, p. A15.) 
  <P>   

 THE CONTINUING MYSTERY OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBING
<P>
     The February 26, 1993, bombing of the World Trade Center was a
curious terrorist operation. On the one hand it was well-planned and
professional; the terrorists were able secretly to construct and
deploy a massive truck bomb. On the other hand, it was a surprisingly
amateurish operation. The four terrorists convicted of the attack took
unnecessary risks, such as giving a correct name and address when
renting a vehicle for delivering the bomb.
<P>
     So far, no foreign state has been found responsible for the World
Trade Center attack. But there are disturbing shreds of circumstantial
evidence that point to possible Iranian or Iraqi involvement. Sheik
Omar Abdul Rahman, the radical Egyptian cleric who inspired and
possibly directed the bombers, long has been on the Iranian payroll,
according to Vincent Cannistraro, the former head of CIA
counterterrorism operations. (Bill Gertz, "Iran Backs Terrorist
Networks in U.S., Canada," The Washington Times, March 17, 1993, p.
A7.) Sheik Omar regularly was given large sums of money by Iran's
intelligence service, using Iran's delegation to the United Nations as
a conduit. ("Washington Whispers," U.S. News and World Report, May 31,
1993, p. 23.) U.S. government investigators discovered that about
$100,000 was transferred to the suspects before the bombing from banks
in foreign countries, including Iran, but it is not known if this was
payment for the attack or for other activities such as propaganda or
recruitment. (Ralph Blumenthal, "$100,000 Is Linked to Trade Center
Suspects," The New York Times, April 25, 1993, p. 41.)
<P>
     Other signs point toward Iraq. For instance, the attack took
place during the second anniversary of the ground offensive against
Iraq in Operation Desert Storm. Terrorist attacks launched on
anniversaries historically have been a common means of seeking
vengeance in the Middle East. Another troubling circumstance is that
Ramzi Yousef, who apparently set the plot in motion, entered the U.S.
in 1992 on an Iraqi passport on a trip that began in Iraq. Moreover,
Abdul Yasin, an Iraqi suspect who cooperated with the FBI and was
released from jail, later flew back to Iraq and is now believed to be
living in Baghdad. Many New York law enforcement officials reportedly
believe that Iraq was involved, although they can not prove it.
(Laurie Mylroie, "World Trade Center Bombing -- The Case of Secret
Cyanide," The Wall Street Journal, July 26, 1994, p. A16.)
<P>
     Iraq also would seem to have more to gain from such a terrorist
operation than Iran. Saddam would have had a strong incentive to
punish the U.S. for its role in Desert Storm. Iraq also may have
wanted to provoke a confrontation between the U.S. and its arch-rival
Iran by casting suspicion on Tehran for the bombing. This would
strengthen Iraq's perceived value in the Middle East as a bulwark
against revolutionary Iran, an argument Iraqi diplomats have made in
attempts to persuade members of the United Nations Security Council to
lift the U.N.-mandated sanctions against Iraq. (Iraq also had
sponsored a similarly deceptive terrorist operation in June 1982, when
it ordered the Abu Nidal Organization, a renegade Palestinian
terrorist group, to shoot the Israeli Ambassador to Britain, an act
which provoked Israel to punish the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO) by invading Lebanon to destroy its base camps. The payoff for
Iraq was that the Israelis dealt Iraq's rival Syria a sharp military
setback in the course of the Lebanon War, and precluded Syria from
joining its ally Iran in its 1980-1988 war with Iraq.)
<P>
     A final disquieting consideration was the nature of the World
Trade Center bomb itself. Not only was the bomb huge, loaded with
1,200 pounds of explosives, but it was customized with compressed
hydrogen to magnify the blast and sodium cyanide to create a poisonous
cloud after the explosion. (The sodium cyanide apparently burned up
completely instead of turning into a gas. See Mylroie, op. cit., p.
A16.) A bomb that big and sophisticated has never before been
detonated by a terrorist group that did not have state sponsorship or
long-standing experience in building explosive devices.
<P>
THE NEW BREED OF RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS
<P>
     The World Trade Center bombers are a new breed of terrorist.
Unlike the tightly disciplined cells that dominated terrorism in the
past, they functioned in a loosely organized ad hoc manner. Three of
the six charged with the bombing were dedicated followers of Sheik
Omar Abdul Rahman, the fiery spiritual leader of the Islamic Group, a
radical fundamentalist movement that has waged a terrorist campaign to
overthrow the Egyptian government.
<P>
     At least three of the six bombers had fought in the war in
Afghanistan against Soviet and Afghan communists. The Sheik also made
at least three visits there since 1980 and two of his sons reportedly
fought there. Thousands of Muslims from roughly 40 countries flocked
to Afghanistan following the 1979 Soviet invasion. (Pakistani
officials estimated that at least 2800 foreign Muslims remained in
Afghanistan in 1993. Edward Gargan, "Where Arab Militants Train and
Wait," The New York Times, August 11, 1993, p. A8.) Radicalized
veterans from the Afghan war -- called by some journalists the
"University of Jihad"(Holy War) -- have returned home and have become
the spearheads of radical Islamic movements in Algeria, Azerbaijan,
Bosnia, Egypt, Sudan, and many other places around the world. (Tim
Weiner, "Blowback From the Afghan Battlefield," The New York Times
Magazine, March 13, 1994, p. 53.) Hundreds of these "Afghanis" are
being trained by Iranian Revolutionary Guards in Sudanese training
camps.
<P>
     Radical Islamic movements have mushroomed not only in the Muslim
world, but also among Muslim immigrants in the West. The World Trade
Center bombers were all either recent immigrants or illegal aliens.
Although they may have been drawn to America by economic opportunities
and political freedoms, these terrorists rejected America's values and
what they considered to be its degenerate culture of materialism and
secularism. Rejecting assimilation into the resented society of their
host country, they were susceptible to incitement by Sheik Omar. What
they did mirrors what happened in several other terrorism cases, such
as Hezbollah's 1985-1986 bombing campaign in France and its bombings
in Buenos Aires in 1992 and 1994. In all three cases, small portions
of local immigrant communities provided support for the terrorist
operations. 
<P>
     Ironically, many radical Islamic movements outlawed in their own
countries have found sanctuary in Western countries. So long as they
are in the West, they cannot be arrested by the police back home. Like
Sheik Omar, leaders of these radical movements lambaste their host
countries while taking advantage of their open political systems to
travel freely, organize politically, raise funds, recruit new members,
support underground opposition movements in their home countries, and
sometimes to direct terrorist activities. Germany long has been a base
for Islamic extremists. (German intelligence officials estimate that
about 700 Arab extremists live there, along with over 42,000 other
foreign extremists. Jim McGee, "U.S. Pledges Global Pursuit in
Bombing," The Washington Post, March 13, 1993.) The U.S. has become a
safe haven for Hezbollah, the Islamic Group, Algerian fundamentalists,
and Palestinian fundamentalists. Israeli officials claim that Hamas
(Islamic Resistance Movement), the radical Palestinian Islamic group
that is using terrorism to undermine the nascent Palestinian-Israeli
peace, actually is directed from a headquarters in the United States.
(Ehud Yaari, "A Safe Haven for Hamas in America," The New York Times,
January 27, 1993.) 
<P>
     The support networks that these terrorist groups are forming
inside the U.S. for fundraising, recruitment, and propaganda
activities could become the nucleus for terrorist attacks on American
soil. These potential terrorists are dangerous because, unlike hit
teams dispatched from the Middle East, they are now blending into
Western societies where they have established personal and communal
roots. U.S. counterterrorism officials worry that "sleeper cells"
already established inside the U.S. could lie dormant for many years
until activated for specific terrorist actions. (The FBI discovered a
sleeper cell of the Abu Nidal organization inside the U.S. in 1986 and
arrested four Palestinian members in April 1993 after one member of
the group murdered his daughter. See William Carley, "A Trail of
Terror," The Wall Street Journal, June 16, 1993, p. A1.)
<P>
     Moreover, the decentralized structure of many of the radical
Islamic movements makes it difficult for host governments to detect,
defend against, or apprehend terrorists lurking within these
movements. The loosely linked informal webs of Islamic militants,
often organized in small groups around a charismatic cleric, are
harder to track and infiltrate than the more rigidly organized
Palestinian terrorist groups that have been a major threat for
decades. The Palestinian groups had a more straightforward
organization and often were corrupt and therefore susceptible to
bribery. They also were easier to penetrate because infighting between
rival organizations led them to provide information on each other.
<P>
     The new breed of radical Islamic terrorist is more intractable,
less likely to betray other terrorists, and more unpredictable. In
contrast to long-established Palestinian terrorist groups who had more
predictable targets and objectives, Islamic radicals have more unclear
motives and a wider variety of targets. They not only attack Israel,
secular governments in Muslim countries, and states that support the
secular regimes they oppose, they also target reporters with whom they
disagree, intellectuals they despise (such as Salman Rushdie, the
author of The Satanic Verses), and Western cultural institutions such
as the American University in Beirut. 
<P>
     Most Palestinian terrorist groups refrained from assaulting
Americans or launching attacks on American soil. The reason: they
wanted to influence American public opinion to change U.S. foreign
policy and to drive a wedge between Israel and America. They made the
cold-blooded political calculation that killing Americans would hurt,
rather than help their political cause. 
<P>
     This self-imposed restraint often is not as strong among Islamic
militants. This new breed of terrorist is hostile not only to American
policies, but to many American values. For example, they reject
secular law and democracy and the separation of church and state. They
view American culture as a threat to Islamic piety and revile what
they perceive to be the degenerate secular and materialist bias of
American society. To Islamic radicals, the U.S. is the villainous
successor of the European colonial empires that have sought to
dominate the Middle East since the time of the crusades. In their holy
war against the West, terrorism is an acceptable instrument for
carrying out the will of God. Because they are motivated by
apocalyptic zeal, and not sober political calculations, their choice
of possible targets is much wider and more indiscriminate than that of
other terrorists. Since they are less predictable, they can be more
dangerous than Palestinian or other Middle Eastern terrorists.
<P>
     Islamic radicals also often have a different audience in mind
than Palestinian nationalists. Instead of using terrorism to influence
Western powers to change their policies, they often use terrorism to
punish Western powers and inspire other Muslims to rise up against the
West. This focus on the Muslim audience rather than an American
audience helps explain how the bombers of the World Trade Center could
rationalize their bloody actions. The bombing was meant to demonstrate
the power of Islamic radicals and the vulnerability of the U.S., not
to lead the U.S. to rethink its Middle East policy.
<P>
THE PERSISTENT THREAT OF STATE-SPONSORED TERRORISM
<P>
     The Middle East is a hotbed of state-sponsored terrorism. Five of
the seven states that have been branded by the U.S. government as
sponsors of international terrorism-- Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, and
Syria--are located in the region. (Cuba and North Korea are the other
two on the State Department's list of states that sponsor terrorism.)
Moreover, 22 of the 41 major international terrorist groups described
in the State Department's annual report on global terrorism are based
in the Middle East. (See U.S. Department of State, Patterns of Global
Terrorism: 1993, April 1994, Appendix B.) The region not only is
infested with more terrorist groups than any other region, but these
groups subscribe to a wider variety of ideologies and causes, ranging
from Marxism to secular Arab, Armenian, Kurdish, and Palestinian
nationalism to radical Islamic fundamentalism. Each year the Middle
East is the world's foremost exporter of terrorism, with most of the
spillover afflicting Western Europe. (Between 1980 and 1989 over 400
terrorist actions spilled over from the Middle East to other regions,
with 87 percent of these actions occurring in Western Europe. Paul
Wilkinson, "Terrorism, Iran and the Gulf Region," Jane's Intelligence
Review, May 1992, p. 222.)
<P>
     Because of the heavy concentration of terrorist states and
terrorist groups, most new trends in terrorism develop in the Middle
East, then spread quickly to other regions. Radical Palestinian groups
such as the Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine
(PFLP) pioneered the tactic of airline hijackings after the 1967 Arab-
Israeli war. When improved airport security measures made hijacking
more difficult, Palestinian groups such as the 15 May organization
were in the forefront of the trend of airline bombings. 
<P>
     Most terrorist groups prior to 1970 were autonomous organizations
of indigenous dissidents that pursued their own agendas without
outside support. (Neil Livingston and Terrell Arnold, eds., Fighting
Back: Winning the War Against Terrorism (Lexington, Mass: D.C. Heath,
1986) p. 12.) During the 1970s the Soviet Union and its satellites
greatly expanded their support for terrorist groups. Moscow often used
Middle Eastern client states such as Iraq, Libya, Syria, and the
former People's Democratic Republic of South Yemen as intermediaries
to mask Soviet arms, training, intelligence, and logistical support
for a wide variety of terrorist groups. 
<P>
     The radical Arab states, which regularly used terrorism as a tool
of repression against internal opposition, sought their own terrorist
surrogates to wield as weapons against Israel, Western powers, and
other Middle Eastern states. Libya, Syria, and Iraq courted
Palestinian splinter groups or created their own Palestinian puppet
organizations to buttress their claims to Arab leadership. These
puppets also were used as proxy terrorists who, if caught, would not
bring down retaliation on the head of the state sponsor.
<P>
     The 1979 Iranian revolution brought Iran into the forefront of
international terrorism. Iran organized, trained, equipped, and
financed Shiite revolutionary movements such as Hezbollah in Lebanon
and Ad Dawa (The Call) in Iraq and the Gulf States. Under Iranian
supervision, Hezbollah unleashed a lethal terrorist campaign in 1983
to drive the Western peacekeeping forces out of Lebanon, bombing the
U.S. Embassy in Beirut in April and the Marine barracks in October.
After Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was elected President in 1989,
Iranian support for international terrorism was toned down and the
Western hostages held by Hezbollah in Lebanon gradually were released
by the end of 1991. But assassinations of Iranian exile leaders
continued at an alarming pace. Government-sponsored terrorism also was
supplemented by terrorism financed by Iranian so-called charitable
foundations, many of which are controlled by radical clerics opposed
to many of Rafsanjani's policies. One of these, the Fifteenth of
Khordad Foundation, has put a $2 million bounty on the head of Salman
Rushdie, condemned to death as a blasphemer by Ayatollah Khomeini in
1989. (Rushdie's publishers, translators, and bookstores that sell his
books have been targeted for terrorist attacks. In the last five years
113 people have died in violence related to the Rushdie affair in more
than 20 countries. See Bizhan Torabi, "The West, Iran Deadlocked Over
Rushdie," The Washington Times, February 16, 1994, p. A13.) 
<P>
     President Rafsanjani's power steadily has been eroded by radical
rivals who have gained dominance over the Iranian parliament. He is a
lame duck, prohibited by the Iranian constitution from running for re-
election for a third term in 1996. As the struggle to succeed him
intensifies, there is a good chance that Iran's support for terrorism
will escalate. The West and the U.S. make convenient targets for hard-
liners in their fight to seize power. In fact, Iran already has become
more aggressive in supporting terrorism. In addition to suspected
Iranian involvement in the July bombings in Buenos Aires and London,
three Iranians await trial in Thailand for an attempt to bomb the
Israeli Embassy in Bangkok in March. In April, the British government
charged that it had clear evidence of growing contacts between Irish
Republican Army terrorists and Iranian embassies in Europe. (In
addition to providing money and possibly arms to the I.R.A., London
charged that Iran also was building links to the Syria-based Japanese
Red Army. Stewart Dalby, "Iran Accused of Terrorist Links," Financial
Times, April 29, 1994, p. 1.) In May, more than 300 Iranian
Revolutionary Guards arrived in Bosnia to organize Muslim militias and
terrorist groups, according to U.S. intelligence sources. (Bill Gertz,
"Iranians Move into Bosnia to Terrorize Serbs," The Washington Times,
June 2, 1994, p. A1.)
<P>
TOWARD A MORE EFFECTIVE U.S. COUNTERTERRORISM POLICY
<P>
     The U.S. has an historic opportunity to crack down on Middle East
terrorism. The end of the Cold War and collapse of the Soviet Empire
have deprived Middle Eastern terrorist states of superpower backing.
The embryonic peace agreement between Israel and the PLO has reduced
one source of terrorism, although Palestinian rejectionists both
within and outside the PLO continue their terrorist war against
Israel. Iraq's defeat in the Gulf War and subsequent isolation has
constrained state support from that quarter, particularly as long as
Baghdad moderates its policies in an effort to wriggle out of U.N.-
sponsored economic sanctions. Iran and Libya are isolated and beset by
substantial economic problems caused in part by low oil prices.
Sudan's radical Islamic regime is drained by a long-running civil war
and a grim economic situation. Syria faces a precarious future as
President Hafez al-Assad, not in the best of health, plots his
personal political endgame. 
<P>
     All of these Middle Eastern regimes, which have exported so much
terrorism-related misery, are simultaneously vulnerable on a number of
different fronts. In the past they have been able to shrug off Western
demands to halt their support of terrorism. But now that they have
lost Soviet backing and have become increasingly dependent on the West
for economic support, that is no longer true. The West now has more
influence and leverage over these states. Moreover, many of these
regimes are threatened by internal political opposition, or the
prospect of such opposition in the near future. The U.S. and other
Western powers, therefore, gain potential leverage by supporting or
threatening to support opposition groups hostile to terrorist regimes.
<P>
     While the threat or actual use of force is the ultimate deterrent
to terrorism, experienced terrorist states and groups often are
successful in concealing their responsibility for terrorist outrages
to avoid military reprisals. To deter terrorism, Washington must
convince its allies and other concerned states to increase the
diplomatic, economic, military,and political costs of state-supported
terrorism. A unified Western campaign to curtail Middle Eastern
terrorism now has a greater chance for success than ever before. Only
the U.S. can forge and lead such a coalition. To build an
international consensus to combat terrorism and to follow through and
act on that consensus, the Clinton Administration should:
<P>
Make counterterrorism a top priority in American foreign policy. 
<P>
     The Clinton Administration must drop its short-sighted plan for
downgrading the State Department's Office of Counterterrorism. This
reorganization plan would fold that office into a new Bureau for
Narcotics, Terrorism and Crime and demote the Coordinator for
Counterterrorism from the current equivalent of an Assistant Secretary
of State to the level of a Deputy Assistant Secretary. L. Paul Bremer,
a former Ambassador-at-Large for Counterterrorism, noting that the
office would be "gutted," charged that: "The Clinton Administration
has neglected the terrorist threat, with our public officials paying
only lip service to the problem." (L. Paul Bremer, "With Assad, Talk
About Terrorism," The Wall Street Journal, January 14, 1994, p. A10.)
   <P>
	Congress has temporarily blocked the Administration's plans.
Under the leadership of Representative Benjamin Gilman (R-NY), the
House voted on April 18, 1994, to retain an independent Office of
Counterterrorism. But the Administration has not given up on its
reorganization plan, which originated in the Bush Administration as a
cost-cutting measure. 
<P>
     Congress will again have to wrestle with the reorganization plan
after April 30, 1995, when the Gilman amendment expires. At that time,
Congress should consider insisting that the Administration permanently
shelve its plans to downgrade State's counterterrorism office. This
office instead must be given the bureaucratic clout to champion tough
anti-terrorism policies against other bureaus in the State Department,
or in other departments, that have little or no interest in combating
terrorism. Therefore, the Coordinator for Counterterrorism, who is the
U.S. government's senior full-time counterterrorism official, must
have direct access to the Secretary of State, and not be relegated, as
the Administration plans, to the bottom of a cumbersome reporting
chain. To secure the diplomatic clout that is needed to impress U.S.
allies and terrorist nations, the Coordinator should be restored to
the status of ambassador-at-large, as was the case during the Reagan
Administration. 
<P>
     Washington should aggressively raise the profile of the
counterterrorism issue by injecting it into every multilateral
diplomatic forum and every high-level bilateral meeting with officials
from allied governments or terrorist regimes. The U.S. should ensure
that the issue of terrorism appears automatically on the agenda at
every G-7 summit. The Coordinator for Counterterrorism should become a
permanent fixture at the summits as the prime mover in a multilateral
working group on counterterrorism.
<P>
Tackle international terrorism as a form of low-intensity warfare. 
<P>
     Terrorism is the most ubiquitous kind of low-intensity conflict.
Yet, it is too often treated primarily as a law enforcement issue.
While bringing the rule of law to bear on terrorists is desirable, it
is not always possible, particularly when terrorists are being
protected by a state sponsor. In cases of state-supported terrorism,
which the CIA estimates comprise up to 80 percent of all international
terrorism, it is not realistic to rely solely on law enforcement
agencies to fight terrorists. 
<P>
     State-supported terrorism is in effect an act of war and should
be approached as a form of surrogate warfare. The U.S. should not
unnecessarily hobble itself in this war against terrorism by treating
state-sponsored foreign terrorists the same as it treats domestic
terrorist groups. Counterterrorist forces should not require courtroom
standards of evidence before they take action. Adopting a narrow
legalistic approach to fighting terrorism would lead to American
paralysis and terrorism would proliferate unchecked. 
<P>
     The U.S. should make use of the full arsenal of its weapons
against terrorism by relaxing self-imposed restrictions on special
operations. For example, Executive Order No. 11905, signed in 1976,
was designed to prohibit assassinations of foreign leaders, but it
also has been interpreted as prohibiting commando assaults on
terrorist groups. This executive order should be refined to permit
such special operations, particularly against terrorist groups that
have killed Americans in the past, such as Hezbollah or the Abu Nidal
organization. Counterterrorist teams also should be deployed to
apprehend terrorists in anarchic areas such as Lebanon or Afghanistan,
and not just in international waters or airspace.
<P>
     The U.S. should also make greater use of non-violent covert
actions, such as the dissemination of disinformation to create
dissension inside terrorist groups and psychological warfare to
aggravate the terrorists' sense of vulnerability and to encourage
distrust of their state sponsors. Agents of influence, wherever they
can be inserted, would help to disrupt terrorist operations and turn
terrorists against each other. Sabotage operations also should be
launched against the safehouses, logistics support networks, and
financial assets of terrorist groups. 
<P>
Punish state sponsors of terrorism on as many fronts as possible. 
<P>
     Middle Eastern states have relied heavily on state-sponsored
terrorism because it is a cost-effective tool to their foreign
policies. The U.S. should work with its allies and other concerned
states to raise the diplomatic, economic, political, and military
costs of supporting terrorism so high that it outweighs the strategic
benefits.
<P>
Diplomatic sanctions. 
<P>
     Countries victimized by terrorism in the past have broken
relations or reduced the size of the diplomatic mission of the state
sponsor. This helps limit the threat of terrorism, because much of it
is directed, supported, and financed by intelligence personnel
operating under diplomatic cover. But diplomatic sanctions usually
have been unilateral, ad hoc responses that have had little effect on
terrorist states. Washington should propose an agreement among the G-7
and NATO allies that would require all of them to expel large numbers
of diplomats, if not break diplomatic relations completely, with
states that support terrorist attacks. Moreover, diplomatic personnel
of these states should be expelled for each confirmed terrorist attack
by a surrogate terrorist group. 
<P>
     This measure would raise the public uproar over terrorism and
increase the costs of each attack. This may give pause to some
terrorist states, particularly those such as Iran and Sudan, that want
the West to bail them out of dire economic predicaments. At a minimum,
reducing the diplomatic presence of terrorist states will make it
harder for them to support terrorism out of their embassies. For
example, the expulsion of diplomats greatly undermined Iraq's ability
to export terrorism during the 1991 Gulf War. 
<P>
     Regardless of whether it can gain G-7 support for such an
agreement, the U.S. should pressure its allies to pare down the
diplomatic presence of Iranian and Sudanese diplomats in their
countries. Diplomats from Iran and Sudan have been implicated in the
July bombing in Buenos Aires and in the 1993 bomb plots in New York
City. The Iranian diplomatic presence particularly should be cut back
in Germany and Venezuela, which are centers for Iran's intelligence
and terrorist networks.
<P>
     Economic sanctions. Washington should persuade its allies to
participate in developing a multilateral version of the State
Department's list of states that support terrorism. Once placed on the
list, a terrorist state should be denied economic assistance, arms
sales, and preferential trade privileges from all participating
states. Further, the allies would be committed to voting against
financial aid for that state in international financial institutions
such as the World Bank. If Western Europe and Japan presented a united
front in threatening to impose sanctions, it could have a sobering
effect on the five Middle Eastern terrorist states. All, with the
possible exception of Libya, will require Western or Japanese economic
assistance, loans or renegotiation of existing loans in the near
future. Iran already is staggering under the financial burden of its
$30 billion foreign debt. Iraq owes foreign creditors more than $14
billion, Syria owes $16.5 billion, and Sudan's foreign debt is in
excess of $16 billion. Now that the Soviet Union has dissolved, they
have no place else to go. The U.S. should convince its allies to take
advantage of their financial leverage and elevate counterterrorism to
the forefront of economic aid and loan renegotiation decisions. 
<P>
     Trade sanctions against terrorist states will be more difficult
to extract from the Western Europeans and Japanese since they see
Iran, Iraq, and Libya as potentially lucrative export markets and
important sources of oil supplies. France and other countries already
are impatient to lift the U.N.-sponsored economic sanctions on Iraq.
To block this, Washington should make Iraq a high-priority test case
for Western anti-terrorism cooperation. The U.S. should stress Iraq's
abortive plot to assassinate former President George Bush during his
visit to Kuwait in April 1993 (For more on Iraq's assassination plot,
see James A. Phillips, "Punish Saddam's Terrorism With Military
Action," Heritage Foundation Executive Memorandum No. 358, June 11,
1993.) and Baghdad's continuing terrorist attacks on the Kurds and on
U.N. personnel in northern Iraq. To test Baghdad's intentions,
Washington should request the extradition of Abdul Yasin, an Iraqi who
participated in the plot to bomb the World Trade Center, who returned
to Iraq. (Yasin was seen outside his father's house in Baghdad by an
ABC News reporter earlier this year. Mylroie, op. cit.) If Baghdad
balks at observing the terms of the extradition treaty that it signed
with the U.S., then it clearly will be in violation of U.N. Security
Council Resolution Number 687 (April 1991), which called on Iraq to
abandon its support of terrorism. This violation could become a
justification for maintaining the U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
<P>
     The Europeans have been more cooperative in imposing economic
sanctions on Libya for its refusal to extradite two suspects in the
1988 Pan Am flight 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. But these
U.N.-imposed sanctions have fallen short of an embargo on Libyan oil.
The U.S. should expand the sanctions to include Libya's oil exports.
Washington should work through the U.N. Security Council to impose an
oil export regime similar to the one imposed on Iraq: oil revenues
would be funneled into a U.N.-administered escrow account that could
be used to pay reparations to the families of victims of Libyan
terrorism. This could be a model to punish other terrorist states that
block international efforts to apprehend terrorists.
<P>
     Another terrorist state that is extremely vulnerable to concerted
international economic sanctions because of its crumbling economy is
Sudan. It already has sought to appease the West by turning over the
notorious Venezuelan-born terrorist Illich Ramirez Sanchez, alias
"Carlos the Jackal," to France on August 15. (Carlos was a terrorist
playboy who had outlived his usefulness to Syria, which had harbored
him until 1991. Carlos's leftist politics did not endear him to
Sudan's radical Islamic regime.) 
<P>
     Iran will be a more difficult case because of the reluctance of
America's allies, particularly Germany and Japan, to sacrifice their
short-term commercial interests in exporting to Iran. Now that Iran is
having difficulty repaying its debts, foreign creditors may be more
willing to consider trade sanctions against Tehran. In any case, the
U.S. could strengthen its case for economic sanctions against Iran if
President Clinton blocks the proposed $750 million sale of up to 20
Boeing 737 jetliners to Iran and prohibits U.S. oil companies, the
largest purchasers of Iranian oil, from buying Iran's oil exports.
(American oil companies currently are prohibited from importing
Iranian oil into the U.S. but are allowed to buy it for resale
elsewhere. See James Phillips, "Containing Iran," Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder No. 980, March 9, 1994.)
<P>
     The U.S. should drive up the prospective political costs of
state-sponsored terrorism. This can be done by supporting opposition
groups in countries that engage in international terrorism. All Middle
Eastern terrorist states have generated domestic opposition.
Washington should provide diplomatic, economic, and even military
support to the most viable opposition groups in terrorist states. The
Kurds in Iraq, the resistance movements in southern Sudan, pro-Western
exile groups and the increasingly restless Azeris, Baluch, and Kurds
in Iran, and Libyan dissidents all merit increased American and
Western support. The Assad regime in Syria has brutally eliminated
most domestic opposition, but President Assad's persistent health
problems and the recent death of his son and heir apparent, Basil, has
increased uncertainty about the political durability of Syria's
minority Alawite regime. Although there may be no viable opposition
inside Syria in the short run, the U.S. should increase its diplomatic
support for an independent Lebanon free from Syrian domination. 
<P>
Mobilize reluctant allies to maximize pressure on terrorist states and
groups.
<P>
     Western Europe has borne the brunt of the spillover of Middle
Eastern terrorism, yet historically has been reluctant to take
determined action against it. Too often, European states have sought
to appease terrorist states and cut separate deals with them, rather
than take a unified stand against terrorism. Last October, Germany
hosted a visit by Iran's Minister of Intelligence and Security, Ali
Fallahiyan, the overseer of much of Iran's terrorist operations.
France appeased Iran last December by expelling two suspected Iranian
terrorists whose extradition had been sought by Switzerland for the
1990 assassination of an Iranian opposition leader in Geneva. 
<P>
     The U.S. must drive home to its allies that appeasement of
terrorism is a self-defeating policy that only encourages more
terrorism. France may be ripe for persuasion, now that an upsurge in
terrorist attacks against French citizens in Algeria led Paris to
crack down on exiled Algerian radicals in France in early August.
France now criticizes the U.S. and Germany for allowing exiled
Algerian radicals to continue to operate freely within their borders.
Washington should cooperate with France and closely monitor the
activities of Algerian radicals in the U.S., while pressing Paris to
support greater international cooperation in isolating terrorist
states, particularly Iran.
<P>
     Germany and Japan, the two biggest exporters to Iran, are the
weak links in Western efforts to isolate Iran. Both states argue that
they aid Iranian "moderates" by maintaining good trade and diplomatic
relations with Iran. This rationale has grown increasingly threadbare
in view of Iran's continued support of terrorism. Besides, Iran's
"moderates" are losing ground to more radical elements in Tehran who
are likely to escalate terrorism unless confronted with firm
international pressures. The U.S. should strongly warn Germany and
Japan, first privately and increasingly in public, that appeasement
only encourages Iran and other terrorist states to believe that
terrorism is cost-free. Worse, by conducting preferential trade
relations with Iran and granting it foreign aid and loans, Germany and
Japan are subsidizing Iran's terrorism. 
<P>
     Washington also should press its allies to establish a high-level
central office for coordinating counterterrorism policies. These
offices could act as liaisons with allied counterterrorism agencies.
Modeled on the U.S. Office of Counterterrorism, these offices would
help raise the profile of counterterrorism as an international issue
and make international cooperation more effective and timely.
Washington also should lobby all its allies to adopt stiffer penalties
for terrorism, including longer jail terms and the seizure of the
assets of terrorist groups or states. The Europeans, in particular,
should be pressed to stop releasing terrorists before their sentences
have been completed.
<P>
     Washington also should press Saudi Arabia to halt the flow of
financial aid to radical Islamic movements. Substantial sums of money
from private Saudi religious foundations and individuals have
bankrolled Sheik Abdul Rahman and other radical fundamentalists.
Riyadh placed restrictions on the flow of these funds outside the
country in 1993 but needs to more carefully control the activities of
the Islamic foundations to prevent them from meddling in the internal
affairs of other Muslim countries. 
<P>
Maintain the option to retaliate unilaterally for terrorist attacks
with decisive military force. 
<P>
     The use or threat of use of military force is essential for
punishing and deterring state-sponsored terrorism. The military
response should be designed to raise the cost of terrorism above the
price a terrorist state is willing to pay. The U.S. should not get
bogged down in a tit-for-tat exchange by limiting its attacks merely
to terrorist training camps. Instead, it should strike targets that
the terrorist state highly values, such as its internal security
forces and secret police. For example, if Iran or one of its
surrogates, such as Hezbollah, lashes out at an American target, the
U.S. should not content itself with destroying a few easily
replaceable terrorist camps in Lebanon or Iran. Rather, the U.S.
should attack Iran's Revolutionary Guards which train terrorists and
provide internal security, as well as Iran's Ministry of Intelligence
and Security.
<P>
     A sharp and decisive military reprisal not only can have a
deterrent effect on the terrorist state attacked, it also can have a
strong demonstration effect on other states that support terrorism.
For example, the April 1986 air strikes against Libya had a
significant impact on Syria as well as Libya. According to the State
Department, Libya reduced its involvement in international terrorism
from 19 incidents in 1986 to six in 1987, while Syrian involvement
fell from 34 in 1985 to six in 1986 and to one in 1987.
<P>
     Special operations are an important option for fighting
terrorists close to innocent civilians, in hostage rescue operations,
and in efforts to apprehend terrorist leaders. The Pentagon must make
an effort to maintain the strength and readiness of the Special
Operations Command which includes the elite "Delta Force," Army
Special Operations Forces, Navy Seals, Marine Reconnaissance teams,
and a special assault unit from the 101st Air Assault Division. These
forces should be periodically dispatched on anti-terrorism training
exercises in friendly Middle Eastern states to give them familiarity
with the region and experience with desert warfare. 
<P>
Stand firmly behind states threatened by Middle Eastern terrorism. 
<P>
     Middle Eastern terrorists pose much more of a threat to secular
and moderate regimes in the Muslim world than to the West. Islamic
revolutionary movements have used terrorism to undermine and
demoralize ruling governments, polarize societies, and intimidate
secular opposition. Terrorists have become the shock troops of Islamic
revolutionary movements seeking the overthrow of the governments of
Egypt and Algeria. The U.S. has a major stake in both countries. A
radical Islamic revolution in either of them would send shock waves
throughout the Arab world.
<P>
     Washington should steadfastly support the governments of Egypt
and Algeria in their efforts to reach an accommodation with political
opposition groups while firmly suppressing terrorists. American
diplomats should not meet publicly with radical Islamic leaders
because this could undermine the existing government. Nor should
Washington permit radical Islamic leaders, such as Tunisian
revolutionary Rashid el-Ghanoushi, to visit America unless they reject
terrorism. Nor should it pressure any government to enter talks with
any group that supports terrorism. Whenever possible the U.S. should
share its intelligence on terrorist groups and their supporters with
the governments battling revolutionary terrorists.
<P>
     In addition to supporting moderate Arab regimes threatened by
terrorism, the U.S. should cooperate closely with Turkey and Israel in
combating terrorism. Both countries are valuable sources of
intelligence on international terrorism and should be furnished with
American intelligence on terrorist activities in a timely manner. The
U.S. also should maintain relentless pressure on Syria to halt its
support for the Kurdish Workers Party and the Armenian Secret Army for
the Liberation of Armenia, two terrorist groups that have killed
scores of Turks. Moreover, Washington should strongly back Israel's
demand that any Syrian-Israeli peace agreement must include guarantees
that Syria will cease its support for Palestinian terrorists and help
end Hezbollah's rein of terror in Lebanon. 
<P>
Upgrade counterterrorism intelligence. 
<P>
     Fighting terrorism effectively requires detailed and timely
intelligence about the operations of terrorist groups, their support
networks and their state sponsors. The FBI has made effective use of
intelligence information to pre-empt at least 78 terrorist plots since
1982. (Estimate provided by Kevin Giblin, Senior Intelligence Officer
for Counterterrorism, FBI, in an August 3, 1993 Forum of the U.S.
Global Strategy Council entitled "Terrorism: The Next Phase?") But the
new breed of radical Islamic terrorists, organized in informal
amorphous groups, presents a new challenge for intelligence-gathering.
To maintain and expand its intelligence network, the FBI should make a
systematic effort to recruit Arab-Americans and American Muslims.
<P>
     The CIA needs to upgrade the volume and quality of its human
intelligence on terrorist groups and states. It must develop a more
extensive network of agents dedicated to counterterrorism intelligence
and infiltrate terrorist groups on a long-term basis. The CIA should
make every effort to recruit American and foreign personnel with
extensive knowledge of and experience in the cultures and societies of
their terrorist adversaries. The CIA's Counterterrorist Center,
created in 1986 by President Reagan after the hijacking of TWA flight
847, should be expanded and devote more resources to surveillance of
the new breed of radical Islamic terrorists. The National Security
Agency and various defense intelligence agencies should be directed to
give counterterrorism a higher priority in their intelligence-
gathering efforts. The Defense Department also should consider
dedicating more of its reconnaissance satellites to gathering
information on possible military targets related to terrorism, such as
terrorist bases and training camps in terrorist states and the Syrian-
controlled areas of Lebanon.
<P>
     In addition, the U.S. should improve its efforts to reward
informants who provide useful information about terrorist activities.
The State Department's International Counterterrorism reward program
provides monetary awards of up to $2 million for information on
terrorist activities against Americans. It has led to the defection of
more than ten terrorist informants and the prevention of nearly a
dozen acts of terrorism against Americans. This program should be
publicized more widely in the Middle East. A recent report that a
valuable informant was treated shabbily by the U.S. government is
disconcerting because it could lead the trickle of informants to dry
up. (See Jill Smolowe, "A Hero's Unwelcome," Time, May 9, 1994, p.
50.) Informants who risk their lives to provide important intelligence
should be promptly rewarded for their efforts.
<P>
Reform immigration laws to improve internal security. 
<P>
     Sheik Abdul Rahman and two of the World Trade Center bombers
entered the country illegally. They eventually were caught but were
allowed to remain in the country pending subsequent legal proceedings.
This situation is intolerable. Congress should reform the immigration
laws to accelerate deportation proceedings and simplify and
consolidate the lengthy procedural hearings and appeal system that
permit illegal and undocumented aliens to evade immigration controls.
Applicants for political asylum should be screened to weed out and
immediately deport those without a credible basis for asylum.
<P>
     Tougher penalties should be imposed on the production or use of
fraudulent passports and visas. Nine of the original 35 indictable
counts in the 1993 New York bombing plots involved visa or passport
offenses. The recently passed crime bill contains a measure that will
double the maximum prison terms for such crimes from 5 to 10 years
(and increase to 20 years if the documents were used to facilitate
terrorism) and boost fines from $2,000 to $250,000. A companion
measure sponsored by Representative Gilman, which currently is under
consideration by the House Judiciary Committee, would allow the
government to seize the assets of criminals convicted of creating or
using false documents for terrorism or drug smuggling. If passed, this
measure would make it harder for terrorists to obtain false documents.
<P>
     Finally, the U.S. government should automatically deny visas to
members of groups that advocate, support, or participate in terrorism.
Unfortunately, the 1990 Immigration and Naturalization Act killed the
provisions of the 1952 McCarran-Walter Immigration and Nationality Act
that allowed the U.S. government to restrict the entry into the U.S.
of members of a group deemed a threat to U.S. security. The State
Department now wrings its hands over denying visas solely because of
membership in a terrorist group. This loophole, which puts the nation
at risk, needs to be closed. Congress should pass legislation that
enables the U.S. government to deny visas to foreigners because of
membership in terrorist groups rather than requiring proof of personal
involvement in terrorist acts, as is now the case.
<P>
Restore order in anarchic areas where international terrorist groups
thrive.
<P>
     Many of the World Trade Center bombers were supporters of the
radical Afghan group Hezbi Islami (Party of Islam) led by Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar, a virulently anti-Western Islamic militant. Some reportedly
were trained in Hezbi Islami camps and fought in the Afghan war. The
U.S. should drop its short-sighted hands-off policy in Afghanistan
that has led it to remain neutral in the fighting between Hekmatyar's
Islamic zealots and the provisional government of President
Burhanuddin Rabbani. With a limited commitment of financial aid, the
U.S. can greatly strengthen the ability of the moderate Afghan forces
to defeat Hekmatyar's drive to transform Afghanistan into a
revolutionary Islamic state. By bolstering Rabbani's regime, the U.S.
could help end the anarchy that gives terrorists a foothold in
Afghanistan. (See James Phillips, "Winning the Endgame in
Afghanistan," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder Update No. 181, May 18,
1992.)
 <P>
    In addition, Washington should press Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to
end their support of Hekmatyar.
<P>
     The U.S. also should revive its efforts to build a stable and
independent Lebanon. Syria has sought to keep the Lebanese weak and
divided to assure its own dominance there. It has vetoed the efforts
of the Lebanese government to extend its control into southern Lebanon
and disarm Hezbollah. The U.S. should insist that Syria abide by the
terms of the 1989 Taif agreement, which require Syria to withdraw its
40,000 troops to eastern Lebanon and permit the Beirut government to
extend its control over its own territory. Only then will Lebanon
cease to be a staging area for international terrorism.
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     Middle Eastern terrorism has become more unpredictable and
audacious. Radical Islamic terrorists inspired by Iranian, Algerian,
and Egyptian revolutionary movements have overshadowed Palestinian
nationalist terrorists as a threat to the West. These new terrorists
often are supported by networks of radical Islamic activists who live
in Muslim communities in the West. Even more worrisome is the
training, arms, financial support, and guidance which radical Islamic
terrorists receive from such states as Iran and Sudan. 
<P>
     International terrorism is not likely to be eradicated, but it
can be weakened considerably if increased diplomatic, economic,
political, and military pressure is brought to bear on the state
sponsors of terrorism. The U.S. must lead an international campaign to
raise the costs of terrorism. This will require a coordinated, firm,
and relentless international effort. This kind of cooperation paid off
in disarming Iraqi terrorism during the Gulf War, and it can work
again. The U.S. must convince its allies that they now are involved,
whether they want to be or not, in an international war against
terrorism.
<P>
     To do so, the Clinton Administration must do more to stop
international terrorism. It must shelve its misguided plan to
downgrade the State Department's Office of Counterterrorism, toughen
its approach to terrorist states, and remain vigilantly on guard
against terrorist movements. Only then will its allies sacrifice their
short-term commercial interests to advance the long-term security
interests of the West and other targets of Middle Eastern terrorists.

<TITLE> NEW LAW REDEFINES THE FAMILY</TITLE>
<BODY>

<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<H2>NEW LAW REDEFINES THE FAMILY</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<P>A new law pushed by the Clinton Administration redefines "family"
to include unmarried partners, including gays and lesbians.  This
promotes homosexuality as the moral equivalent of heterosexuality.
<P>
<CENTER> <H3>THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Federal Employees Family Friendly Leave Act was signed into
law by President Clinton on October 22, 1994.  The Act permits
a federal employee to use sick leave to attend to the medical
needs of a family member.  The Act requires the Office of Personnel
Management to use the definition of "family member"
as found in the pre-existing leave transfer program.[1]
<P>
The leave transfer program defines "family member"; based
on the term "immediate relative" as it is used for funeral
leave purposes.  OPM clarifies the definition in the <I>Federal
Register:</I> "We recognize that there may be cases in which
the traditional concept of a family relationship is not applicable,
yet a close relationship to the leave recipient exists that is
the equivalent of a family relationship.  Examples include foster
children and step children."[2]
<P>
In December 1994, the Clinton Administration twisted the definition
of "family member" as outlined in the leave transfer
program to mean something entirely different when applied to the
new leave law.  OPM Director of Communications Janice Lachance
confirms that "family member" now includes "domestic
partners" of either sex.  "It's a recognition of how
family relationships have evolved," Lachance said.  "It's
an effort to respond to the realities that federal employees face
each and every day....The key thing to remember is the government
is getting out of the business of defining relationships."[3]
<P>
OPM's new definition for "family member" includes: "spouse,
and parents thereof; children, including adopted children and
spouses thereof; parents; brothers and sisters, and spouses thereof;
<I>and any individual related by blood or affinity whose close
association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship</I>."[4]
<P>
Representative Constance Morella (R-MD), a co-sponsor of the bill,
said the definition of family is "reasonable" because
it "covers everybody without getting into the particulars.
 It is accommodating different lifestyles without favoring one
over another."
<P>
<CENTER>
 <H3>WHAT TO DO?</H3></CENTER>
<P>
OPM has liberalized the definition of "family" in the
Federal Employees Family Friendly Leave Act to mean something
not allowed by the law.  The definition should be changed to mean
unambiguously only the natural family.  This could be accomplished
by striking the word "affinity" from OPM's new regulation.
 Alternatively, the Clinton Administration can grant this benefit
to other-than-family members by amending the regulation to allow
for "non-family members."  The 104th Congress has oversight
of any change.  
<P>
The Federal Employees Family Friendly Leave Act was not designed
to expand the official definition of "family" to include
domestic partners, whether homosexual or heterosexual.  Rather,
it was intended to help federal employees in crisis and should
not be manipulated by the Clinton Administration to advance a
political agenda.

<TITLE>AMERICA NEEDS WEDFARE, NOT WELFARE</TITLE>
<BODY>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>AMERICA NEEDS WEDFARE,<BR>
NOT WELFARE</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
The new Congress is planning to pass a major welfare reform initiative
that will encourage states to test some creative ideas for reducing
the number of people on the welfare rolls.  To date, much of the
debate has focused on ways to help welfare recipients become self
sufficient by requiring them to work for their benefits.
<P>
While "workfare" is a worthy idea, welfare reformers
need to do more than just get people off welfare.  They need to
devote serious attention to developing "preventative"
strategies for reducing the number of people who ever need welfare
in the first place.
<P>
A "preventative" strategy should focus squarely on the
primary cause of welfare dependency:  illegitimacy.  Three out
of ten births in the U.S. today are out-of-wedlock.  And few of
these never-married mothers bear any resemblance to the affluent,
upwardly-mobile Murphy Brown.  Instead, unmarried women who bear
children are five times more likely to live below the poverty
line than are married mothers.  And their children are much more
likely to suffer from abuse and neglect, and to drop out of school,
abuse drugs, commit crimes, and get pregnant out of wedlock.
<P>
To curb illegitimacy, Congressional reformers should step up efforts
to teach abstinence in schools, streamline adoption for out-of-wedlock
births, and reverse welfare policies that penalize marriage. 
The House GOP Contract With America takes some important first
steps in these areas.  It makes adoption expenses tax deductible,
eliminates welfare payments for all future cases involving unmarried
teen mothers, and sets aside money for developing a pro-marriage
tax credit for the poor.  
<P>
Moreover, some states have already taken modest steps to address
the welfare system's bias against marriage.  For example, under
the leadership of Governor Tommy Thompson, Wisconsin adopted a
"bridefare" policy in 1991 which provides higher benefits
for low-income married couples who marry or remain married.  More
recently, California has passed a "wedfare" law which
allows poor moms who marry an opportunity to retain health coverage
rather than being cut off from continued benefits.
<P>
Congress would do well to encourage states to adopt more pro-marriage
reforms of this kind.  Doing so would acknowledge that the primary
escape route from poverty 30 years after the adoption of liberal
Great Society programs is not welfare or workfare.  It is marriage.

<TITLE>VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT OF 1994</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN<BR>
ACT OF 1994</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
The "Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act"
passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton on September
13, 1994 authorizes $1.6 billion to combat and study violence
against women, stiffens laws against sex offenders, and creates
prevention and treatment programs.[1]  The comprehensive statute
has seven subtitles, outlined below.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>"SAFE STREETS FOR WOMEN"</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI> Federal Penalties for Sex Crimes.  The law doubles prison sentences
for repeat sex offenders and mandates restitution for sex crimes.
 Sex offenders will pay the full amount of the victim's loss to
include medical services, transportation, temporary housing, child
care expenses, lost income, and attorney's fees.  Court decisions
to award restitution to victims will not consider the economic
circumstances of the offender nor the fact that the victim received
compensation from other sources.  The provision also authorizes
the appropriation of $1.5 million over three years to appoint
victim/witness counselors.
<P>
<LI> Law Enforcement and Prosecution Grants.  This provision amends
the 1968 Safe Streets Act to authorize grants to combat violent
crimes against women.  It is designed to develop and strengthen
law enforcement and prosecution strategies to combat violent crimes
against women.  It authorizes $800 million over six years.
<P>
<LI> Safety for Women in Public Transit and Public Parks.  This appropriates
$20 million to increase the safety of public transportation and
public parks by enhancing lighting systems, camera surveillance
and emergency telephone lines to contact law enforcement personnel.
<P>
<LI> New Evidentiary Rules.  This amends the federal rules of evidence
for sex offense cases.  It prohibits the admission of evidence
offered to prove that a victim engaged in other sexual behavior
or establish a victim's "sexual predisposition."  Exceptions
are permitted in cases where the evidence proves that "a
person other than the accused committed the crime" or to
prove that the victim consented to the act.
<P>
<LI> Assistance to Victims of Sexual Assault.  This section of the
law has six provisions.
<P>
<UL><LI> It amends Title XIX of the Public Health and Human Services
Act to create education and prevention grants to reduce sexual
assault against women.  It authorizes $205 million over five years
for rape prevention seminars, hotlines, training programs for
professionals, and the production of information materials.
<P>
<LI> It provides $2 million over two years to train probation and
parole officers who work with released sex offenders.
<P>
<LI> It requires that a study be conducted to develop model legislation
that provides the maximum protection for the confidentiality of
communication between sexual assault or domestic violence victims
and their counselors.
<P>
<LI> It requires the Attorney General to ensure that all incarcerated
sex offenders are apprised of available sex offender treatment
programs.
<P>
<LI> It authorizes $30 million over three years for the Runaway
and Homeless Act.  Grants may be made under this provision to
agencies that provide a street-based outreach, including treatment,
counseling, and referral for runaway, homeless, and street youth
who have been subjected to or are at risk of being subjected to
sexual abuse.
<P>
<LI> It authorizes $38 million over five years for the Victims of
Child Abuse Act of 1990.</UL>
<P>
<CENTER><H3>"SAFE HOMES FOR WOMEN ACT OF 1994"</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI> National Domestic Violence Hotlines.  This provision creates
a national domestic violence hotline for $3 million over six years.
 It will be run by a private agency and will be toll-free, operate
24-hours-per-day and offer information relating to services for
victims of domestic violence to which callers may be referred
throughout the U.S., to include the availability of shelters that
serve battered women.
<P>
<LI> Interstate Enforcement.  The law was changed to increase punishments
for persons who cross state lines with the intent of harming a
spouse or to violate protection orders.  This provision also authorizes
$120 million over three years to encourage states to treat domestic
violence as a serious criminal act.
<P>
<LI> Family Violence Prevention and Services Act.  This Act is amended
to authorize $324 million over five years.
<P>
<LI> Youth Education.  It creates four youth education and domestic
violence model programs for young people.  It authorizes $400,000
for one year.
<P>
<LI> Community Programs on Domestic Violence.  It grants $10 million
over two years for nonprofit organizations to establish projects
that coordinate intervention and prevention of domestic violence.
 The nonprofit organizations may include religious community personnel.
<P>
<LI> Confidentiality for Abused Persons.  The Act requires the U.S.
Postal Service to write regulations that protect the confidentiality
of domestic violence shelters and abused persons' addresses.
<P>
<LI> Data and Research.  It requires the National Academy of Sciences
to study violence against women, including rape and domestic violence.
 The one-year study will report on how states may collect centralized
data on the incidence of sexual and domestic violence offenses.
 It also tasks the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
to obtain a national projection of the incidence of injuries resulting
from domestic violence and to recommend how to reduce the incidence
and cost of associated injuries.
<P>
<LI> Rural Domestic Violence and Child Abuse Enforcement.  It authorizes
$30 million over three years to expand and establish efforts among
rural law enforcement agencies, victim advocacy groups, and victims
of domestic violence and child abuse.  The grants will provide
treatment, counseling, and education strategies directed to domestic
violence and child abuse.

<P>
The Clinton Administration has rescinded combat exclusions for
women without justification and contrary to the recommendations
of the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women
in the Armed Forces.  These changes have stripped women of more
than one-quarter million combat-related exemptions.  Consider
the changes in the last two years:

<P>
<LI> <B>Combat aircraft.</B>  On April 28, 1993 Former
Secretary of Defense Les Aspin announced that women could be assigned to combat aircraft.
<P>
<LI> <B>Combatant vessels.</B>  On November 30, 1993
Congress rescinded, at the Administration's request, the law exempting women from permanent
assignment aboard combatant vessels.
<P>
<LI> <B>Military's risk rule.</B>  On January 13, 1994
Aspin rescinded the military's risk rule, which resulted in the end of more near-combat and
combat exemptions for women.
<P>
<LI><B>Combat and near-combat positions.</B>  On July 29, 1994 Secretary
of Defense William Perry ended 80,000 more exemptions for women. Women can now be
assigned to more than 80 percent of all military positions and virtually all Air Force (99.7
percent) and Navy positions (94.0 percent).  The Army (67.2 percent) and Marine Corps (62.0
percent) are more restrictive.[1]
<P>
 <CENTER><H3>LITTLE CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces
recommended that "military readiness
should be the driving concern regarding assignment policies."
 The Pentagon, however, has yet to cite the military readiness justification for the recent changes.
Additionally, Congress has not publicly heard from the commission.  
<P>
On October 6, 1994 former chairman of the House Armed Service Committee's Subcommittee
on Military Forces and Personnel Rep. Ike Skelton (D-MO) hosted the sole Congressional
hearing considering the latest changes.  He limited the hearing to one three-member panel which
supported the Administration's changes.  Rep. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) had asked to hear dissenting
views from a panel consisting of commissioners from the 1992 Commission.  His request was
denied.

<P>
Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the responsibility to "raise and support
armies" and to "provide and maintain a navy."  Congress also must make the rules and
regulations that govern the military, and that includes the number of women in the military and
their assignments.

<P>
The 103rd Congress virtually ignored the Clinton Administration's radical assignment policies. 
These changes do not improve readiness and threaten to leave women vulnerable to a future
draft.  The 104th Congress should conduct a thorough review of Pentagon policies and seek to
reverse the Clinton Administration's current course.
